under transphobia you mention suicide stats what does this refer to or mean i don t see how discussing suicide statistics amongst trans folks is bigoted rather it s quite the opposite
will you be differentiating between queer as insult and queer as identity
i think they left out tell the emperor he has nice new clothes apparently that is the rule for the day that we are living in
is this post real or an attempt to actually stir more controversy itself i m asking sincerely because i guess i m too out of touch with reddit
good post but i feel like the racism rule should be expanded beyond just addressing black people and jews there are countless different ethnic groups out there and they all experience racism i think the rule should read racism in general instead of racism against black people in general edit i saw you did address other groups in a couple sentences but i think they should have their own subheadings as well just so it doesn t look like you re prioritizing black people over the rest of them
bigotry aside somewhat surprised your statement is so political but ok your sub
use of biological male or biological female the term is cis male or cis female i m not sure biological male and biological female are synonymous with cis cis is a reference to someone s gender identity when it corresponds with their sex when sex does not correspond with gender identity a person is trans
first off i agree with of what you have posted here and the thought of violating the majority of these things would never cross my mind nor would it cross the mind of any civil human however and it pains me to say this as i really like this subreddit and i have a feeling this will get me banned there s about items on here that are beyond the reaches of ensuring civility you speak of education and how if someone doesn t understand these items they must be lacking in education to me education means coming to a better understanding of how the world operates through observation and data a small minority of your banned things one could violate by posting objective facts and if someone could be banned for stating objective facts they are not being banned due to lack of education they are being banned for not conforming to your point of view that s the type of education that drives us further away from an understanding of the world and drives people further apart thus increasing the social problems your post claims to be trying to resolve
as someone who is lgbt i don t think this helps i ve noticed that most decent folk will call someone out in the comments if they say something disgusting and offensive you know just call them out stand together report them and then they are removed this just feels like pure ammunition for certain red capped hillbillies who cry whenever something might slightly attack their stupid freedom of speech this is just yeah i can hear the what is this jokes already
removed
internet janitors is allowed
has this subreddit always been political i thought it was just for funny and crazy videos
good attempt to be woke
so racism against white people and sexism against men is allowed
i think people are too sensitive to be on the internet
reddit mods do it for free
what about using the term zionist as a pejorative to mean jew
there is no freedom of speech on reddit
so are people on here allowed to call me cracker and mayo monkey since i m white
itt a bunch of angry bigots upset about new rules against bigotry x200b edit the amount of people responding that are shadow banned is absolutely adorable xd
lol
that s reddit for you downvoted for doing the right thing and tackling racism especially that anti black racism that s rampant on here
ugh the new mod flexing his virtue signal powers pass
all of this is wrong basically if you re straight or mixed race you can t comment without being blocked last message from me on this page but you will not bring down heterosexual mixed races people for having an opinion on what they believe if you want a page based off of hate it s your own doing and i ll make it my mission you prove this hole community is based off of racial and sexual biases you don t care about the world you care about your community
wow reddit used to be a great place now it s germany x100 full of way too sensitive folks
maybe you should have just typed the two things you are allowed to say mind boggling lol

hell yeah
i worry that the examples of antisemitism all seem to be one particular variety of antisemitism and will fail to address manifestations of antisemitism that try to appear more benign on the surface

what about posts like these that are made constantly are they alright https://i.imgur.com/gs6hx1n.jpeg

sure it depends on how you discuss them many bigots don t discuss them at all and just leave a under any trans person s comment that they don t like as a reminder of the high rates of suicidal ideation even when it s not relevant to the conversation it s basically another way for people to say kill yourself but specifically for trans folks
it s often used by people to either say that being trans is a mental illness and therefore the reason for the high suicide rate rather than being in a hostile environment and being harassed for who you are or mocking trans people and telling them to actually commit suicide
absolutely identifying as queer or talking about the queer community obviously not in a bigoted way is absolutely fine we will only take exception to it if it is said as a slur sorry that wasn t clear
being out of touch with reddit means you re probably a good person
nope we just don t want to update things without making an announcement first it really doesn t seem to fair to implement a new hatespeech policy without telling people that s all we would absolutely love if everyone embraced this without any hesitation or controversy but we also aren t delusional we know there will be people that balk at this stuff that s fine those aren t the members we are wanting in the sub anyway
fair point this post is about specific common phrases and dog whistles that are racist if you have any to suggest we ll consider them and if you d rather not post them publicly you can send us a modmail
that s all who are important screw the rest s
these people grew up worshipping civil rights activists and need to believe they re heroes like mlk jr and rosa parks so they have convinced themselves that policing speech acts on the internet in a way that gigacorporations like netflix and disney would approve of is fighting oppression just like refusing to go to the back of the bus was
yeah i should look at reframing that it s supposed to mean use of biological male female as a way of undermining the status of trans people but i didn t phrase it the best way there thanks for pointing that out
seriously trans women are biological women
i just feel like this wasn t necessary people with basic human decency know they shouldn t say this shit it s just that bigots don t care
easy ban what is this type talk

sure i mean thats what we do clean up the shitty messes that others leave around we don t do it for the glamour that s for sure
this is reddit of mods in all subs are farrrrrrr to one side and immediately ban ppl that say anything to disagree with them
woke subreddit bans racism
are you able to define woke
this list is non exhaustive there was an attempt to read comprehensively
what is wrong with you why can t you be happy for other people getting something without assuming you are having something taken away
when people say young men are being brainwashed by andrew tate or stuff similar then they are talking about a subset of young men who are being brainwashed even if it was a dig at men as a whole it s still not intended nor will it end up justifying subjugation or oppression of men when you say she is such a slut or that thing will never be a woman you are doing a rallying cry to be hateful and oppressive to a group with immutable characteristics and one that is also less privileged than average would you like to provide some examples of anti white racism or anti men sexism that are said to be ok by the mods i sure can t find any
apparently all lives matter is so hateful
i believe taking the freedom of some assholes so we have a subreddit where you can t call my trans friends pedos because they like they find the idea of skirts more appealing than beard hair increases the freedom of the subreddit overall why because my trans friends are free from hatred and feel more comfortable to browse and bystanders don t feel awkward to witness it believe you me as an edgy and foul mouthed queer who is sick of peoples shit i can be plenty insensitive and politically incorrect but you don t see me getting banned you know why because i m not being a bigot nor am i trying to hurt others with a more tender heart than mine your freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence or a license to be hateful
janny cleanup in aisle
if they re using it to mean all jews then yes that would be bigotry if they re using it to mean promoting a specific stance on israel then that would not
reddit choosing who is and who isn t allowed to use their platform is freedom of speech reddit admins allow mods to create rules banning bigotry as is their freedom of speech reddit admins don t allow mods to create rules allowing crimes that isn t freedom of speech if the government stepped in and forced internet sites to stop banning people that would be anti free speech people are free to go create their own private websites like reddit and enforce their own rules that is free speech on my private property no one is allowed to wear yellow shirts if you say you like yellow shirts you will be asked to leave my property that is me practicing free speech if we are in public the only thing i can do about yellow shirts is look at them and stew silently in my mind about them i am not allowed to have cops remove you from public for yellow shirts the way i would be able to on my private property this isn t the government saying liking yellow shirts is illegal they are saying trespassing on private property is illegal
correct reddit is not the government therefore the concept doesn t apply here you also don t have freedom of speech inside your local walmart
did a fellow mayo monkey like myself call you one because that not me being anti white it s clowning on white people who are ignorant plus mayo monkey is really funny

it s on there it s just inconsistent formatting
yeah honestly this one s the last straw for me especially after seeing the comments in these two in the last few days https://reddit.com/comments/11zr8rt https://reddit.com/comments/11yuaov i wish the mods the best of luck with the honorable mission they ve set for themselves but seeing the up down ratios on just the grossest most inhumane shit of every stripe not just racist coming from this subreddit i say just throw the whole community in the trash where it belongs the idea that this op is riding right at net pts kinda says it all you re better folks than i u karmanacht and u kumquat_conniption godspeed
yeah i ve been at that post for hours and i ve still got quite a far way to go i very much appreciate you pointing it out we wouldn t have normally let it get that bad but i ve got covid and another mod is away for the weekend and it was just bad timing i ll get through the whole thing if it takes days it s disgusting and more than half the comments are permanent ban worthy it s really disheartening but we are determined to turn this place around
ima chime in on this one your first amendment rights end at my front door in other words when your are a guest you can either respect the rules of the house or the can be expelled from the house this applies even when the house is rented and even if rent isn t involved at all each subreddit is from that standpoint not public it is owned by reddit and rented to whatever mod team is present any sub can prohibit anything they want with the caveat that reddit can decide to boot mods and replace them if that prohibition violates reddit s desires so just like i can and would put my foot up the rear of any bigot trying to express their opinion in my living room and do so until they were off my property the mods and admins of reddit can do the same thing in equivalence and are not violating your civil rights in doing so check the terms of service and check the laws regarding how internet forums work that s the layman s explanation of them on this subject now there are arguments to be made as to whether or not that is a good thing and there s always the risk of the slope getting slippery and anything that isn t within the wishes of the homeowners being labeled as bigotry regardless of objective evaluation of that but that s different from trying to claim that your rights are being infringed upon in a public space reddit and subreddits are private spaces
you re allowed to say whatever you want but you re not entitled to people giving you a platform to do it reddit isn t owned by the government so the first amendment doesn t apply they can ban you for saying you don t like cheese if they want to this would not violate any rights
freedom of speech is an often misunderstood concept on reddit in its purest form freedom of speech means that people should be allowed to express their opinions without any consequences whatsoever however that s a right which is not recognized anywhere in the world because it leads to illogical results that burden the rights of others for instance if your girlfriend chooses to break up with you because she dislikes your ideological views that is undoubtedly a negative consequence of expressing your free speech but the notion that society would tolerate free speech forcing her to remain as your girlfriend is patently absurd if you espouse racially insensitive remarks against a minority client of your company and are subsequently fired freedom of speech does not compel your employer to keep you employed nbc s today show and abc s good morning america are similarly not burdening the free speech rights of minority viewpoints by electing not to allow their proponents to be interviewed on the aforementioned shows even if the decision not to for instance permit a white nationalist to explain his her views clearly stems from a belief that such views are repugnant freedom of speech in the united states and elsewhere is a proscription on the use of government power to burden free speech rights examples listed earlier were examples of entirely private conduct being subject to free speech consideration which is a result that has never been nor likely ever will be obtained in us courts irrespective of whether the supreme court is in the hands of liberals or conservatives therefore freedom of speech generally bars the government from penalizing you with jail time or fines for the basic act of expressing your beliefs and acts as a bar to the government from using its power to enforce a civil judgment even then freedom of speech is not absolute in the us there are laws that technically limit freedom of speech and expression slander libel copyright infringement hate crimes sedition and treachery for example the first amendment raises the bar tremendously as to the burden required to prove each of these actions but it does not generally create irrebuttable presumptions against them this is why anwar al awlaki could not simply invoke the first amendment as a shield for his activities supporting al qaeda s propaganda arm nor was it an absolute shield from liability for rolling stone in its shoddy reporting of on campus rape in uva after the jury had found actual malice in a more germane example freedom of speech also does not mean that public policy encourages an unregulated morass on the internet thus congress specifically recognized the need for online platforms to self regulate comments in passing the communications decency act of of the cda exempts online platforms from the common law republication rule if websites choose to moderate comments on their platforms as applied to reddit this means that the decision to or not to moderate a comment does not lead to liability for the website for the thoughts expressed therein in the specific context of this website so called free speech advocates have taken free speech and its polar opposite of censorship to mean something that it does not regardless of what kn0thing and spez have stated in the past the development of the site has led to the creation of discrete subreddit communities as contrasted to the single front page that existed at the site s inception with different cultures and purposes all of which the sitewide administrators have sought to lend support to thus a subreddit dedicated to pictures such as this one is within its grant of authority to prohibit submitted pictures from merely being screenshots or the self written musings of users themselves other subreddits might permit only submissions of that nature and that s perfectly fine unrestricted free speech would hold that such actions constitute censorship common sense would hold that these are merely expressions of the specific purpose of the subreddits themselves sitewide administrators also require that subreddit moderators enforce sitewide rules prohibiting certain behavior as listed in the site s content policy https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). free speech is not an excuse to post illegal content nor is it an excuse that will carry the day if you act in a way that harasses other users a proscription not recognized by law in fact posting of illegal or defamatory content on the site can easily expose someone to criminal or civil liability and reddit is under no obligation to protect your online identity from entities seeking to subpoena it for liability purposes finally free speech and censorship in the context of moderation on subs is also specifically recognized by the sitewide administrators the content policy also includes a statement on reddit moderators individual communities on reddit may have their own rules in addition to ours and their own moderators to enforce them reddit provides tools to aid moderators but does not prescribe their usage this enables community moderators to determine for themselves the appropriate rules for their communities on top of sitewide rules that all communities must enforce that has led to a diversity of subreddits with varying tolerances for content some subreddits choose to enforce only the bare minimum if even that others choose to enforce rules that would damn near take a rules lawyer to understand on r therewasanattempt we take a middle approach permitting a wide range of comments as they pertain to civil discourse but excluding comments that would be uncivil or offensive generally if users discuss in a manner consistent with how they would discuss matters in the workplace or among a new group of friends they d never encounter an issue with moderation if you believe this to be impermissible censorship we can only disagree because the vast majority of users will never be subject to a moderation action but the site as a whole and the internet in general provide many opportunities for free speech that may be free of the reasonable limitations that we find to be necessary to ensure civility we wish you the best of luck in finding a forum or platform more amenable to your sensibilities but decline to extend them here
it was also appended with all kinds of fun stuffs
did you actually think free speech meant i can say whatever i want wherever i want and no one can get mad at me or stop me did you read the explanations did you absorb any of it
i don t think that post lasted too long and was screenshotted at minutes old we are volunteers trying our best to make this sub a fun place to be and appreciate any reports you folks can give us that are helpful thanks
well white and black people use drugs at about the same rates yet way more black people are arrested for possession than white people so it s basically a fact that lots of white people do get away with it other than that it s more class based than race based it just happens to be that black people after slavery and jim crow and redlining and institutional racism are overall significantly more poor than white people so that s the actual factor that creates the crime as opposed to skin color the people that break out these stats fail to mention that wealth disparity is the overwhelming reason that black people commit more crime than white people they fail to recognize that correlation doesn t mean causation and that s a dangerous mindset to spread
what form of reddit are you using

some people are too hateful for words keep up the good work mods
weird to see antisemitism adressed on the prime example sub if people talk about anti semitic violence on reddit you just banned all jews caring about antisemitism from voting on your sub because of brigading and now antiaemitism exists don t play like you wanted the change reddit admins lost their temper with your hatred infected sub
the events that unfolded today will tragically for multiple reasons probably reinforce that argument

removed
well i think a lot of the banned phrases are applicable to all racial marginalized groups like diversity hires upvote because black or any other marginalized group never relax culture or anything like that these certainly aren t just used against black people
what do you mean by undermining here i would read this as the term being acceptable as a way to discribe someones sex and only that thereby not assuming any gender which to me is correct wikipedia even uses biological to make the distinction between genetics and the way someone feels identifies as x200b sex generally refers to an organism s biological sex while gender usually refers to either social roles based on the sex of a person gender role or personal identification of one s own gender based on an internal awareness gender identity x200b granted i used the term genetic not biological but the rest of the post made it clear i wasn t trying to undermine insult or piss off anyone and still it was removed because of hatespeech i m not sure that this specific rule was the reason but this is the onlyone that comes even close yes we need to be respectfull regardless of wheter or not you agree with someone i don t care if someone scared you or if you think they are weird some respect and understanding from both sides goes a long way i agree with most that s on this list but purely based on the amount of items it does feel we re trying to not step on some very long toes and quite a few are heavily dependend on context like the queer someone identifies as queer or queer as an insult or my use of genetic male plenty are simply unaceptable n word tranny babykiller just to name a few and for the record i m not saying ignore everything above and just let people speak their mind there are plenty of people just being an ass and they should be blocked comments deleted whatever but if we want to be able to talk about lgbtqia there needs to be sme leeway
fr if anything we re more biological than cis people ty
a lot of people will say this stuff and then when we ban them claim they had no idea it was racist or whatever bigotry fits we just want to be open and clear
a very thing to do sorry if you re being sarcastic for the life of me i just can t seem to notice sarcasm through text xd
that s really disappointing can t even go on a seemingly non political sub reddit to enjoy yourself without people s bullshit politics getting in the way
pejorative the hyperbolic and disingenuous privileging of identity based i e race gender sexuality disability concerns in political discourse and policy change over material ones class poverty other forms of economic or social oppression see also race reductionism there i fixed it for you this sudden very much contrived by the democratic party idea that no one can define woke is nothing but a political talking point actually just a straight up piece of propaganda of course we all know exactly what is meant by this term pretending we don t is a way of avoiding any actual self reflection on where our politics have left us open to not only critique but ridicule from right wing ideologies

https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/viral-video-shows-resident-harassing-local-concrete-company-breaks-headlights-steps-in-concrete
good thing they got it all on video now they have concrete evidence against him
mans losing his mind
concrete burn is no joke i can only imagine it being worse on an elderly man with thinner skin he s going to regret this tantrum
just pave over him and get on with your day
truck off my lawn but fill my pants with cement please
you can feel the they don t pay me enough to deal with this shit vibe
in pretty sure at a certain point we need to start acknowledging that these people have severe mental impairments that are leading them to act this way
i think there s a very good possibility that he s senile
sometimes it s just time to stop being a burden on society
he s wearing a romper
i bet this old guy never realized that this is how he d cement his reputation
once a dick always a dick
gif giphy 8fen5lszchq5o
all i thought was the help i can t get up ads when he was stuck
hell yeah now we get overtime thanks ol timer those construction workers probably
orange shirt guy should we help him out of the cement other orange shirt guy nah fuck that dude he s got a hammer
i think that man is not well in the head
guys gonna have some serious chemical burns after wading through that concrete in shorts and sneakers
concrete is the secret skincare treatment that doctors won t tell you s you can t have skin conditions if you no longer have any skin due to all that chemical burn
want to guess the party he belongs to
ok grampa s goin back to the home no more day passes for him
haha don t just stand there you idiots help me get out of this mess
so what happened to him after
age did not make him wiser i guess
the entitlement and he got a slap on the wrist of course
ahh the wisdom that comes with age
i say they leave grandpa s faceplant in the concrete as a warning to all the other racist geezers on the block
they should ve done society a favor pushed him in and buried him under the street
at what point in a man s life does the lawn top all other priorities
messing that concrete up is going to be expensive tear out disposal install again labor twice not to mention the truck repair and the time the truck may be down
grandpa needs to go in a home asap don t care if he was a veteran or not this isn t the shit i would approve of if he was from the military
so now he s a hardened criminal
fun fact if g paw doesn t wash that concrete off asap he s in for a whole lot of hurt
the attack may have been racially motivated as soon as i saw that overall
what a fucking clown lmao
this looks like a sketch from a comedy show the warbly old man voice the pathetic trapsing through the thick concrete the eventual slow fall and feeble attempt to regain footing all while several spectators look on in deadpan silence
being old doesn t give you the right to be a fucking asshole the dude deserves no respect and should be arrested
poor guy has dementia from the child like behavior to the awkward and unnatural swinging of the hammer to the confusion he displays only when trying to exit the wet concrete he s losing his mind and likely needs around the clock care soon sucks for everyone involved
i guess he doesn t know wet cement is a hazardous substance and has the potential to cause chemical burns
i m sure there are no dead bodies in his basement
looks like his guilt has been cemented
gotta be the villages
i have a sinking feeling he is going to regret that
old people falling is just about the funniest thing in the world
a child who stagnated at and simple became wrinkled over time
he reinforced it concretely that he wanted that truck to move
cops say he s a hardened criminal
i don t think he s mentally sound
he needs a glass of milk and a nap
legends say that he s still stuck there as part of the road swinging his hammer at passing vehicles and yelling racist things at passerbys
maybe some concrete burns a trip to jail and a civil lawsuit will fix that crazy old fuckstick
omg that dude is gonna have concrete burns and probably die from infection
definition of get off my lawn guy right here
thought he d fall in the concrete and they d just pour more on top n say rip now you re a driveway
a place called boulder on the wild colorado i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound but i am still around
please please please tell me they left him stuck in the concrete until the cops got there and he was all burnt up
how can you live in a beautiful house in a beautiful picture perfect neighborhood and still be this violently stupid
this is like a kids in the hall skit or something
thor got old
i ain t even hispanic like at all and all i could think was look at this pendejo
gramps lost his marbles
please get stuck or fall please get stuck or fall yes
quick pave over him
the icing on the cake for me is when he gets stuck in the wet cement and falls holy fuck was i lmao
same guy who calls constantly to complain about a pothole wants it fixed magically without trucks and people
i was hoping he would be engulfed in the cement and turned into a lawn ornament then placed gently into his yard behind the white truck
good job mate you got ya self chemical burns and a lawsuit
these workers had way more control than i did when he walked into the concrete not even a snort of laughter came out of them while i m over here cackling
and that was the day that we decided to take pawpaw to the golden sands assisted living home
i have never been so happy to see an old man fall down
do you all think this old timer has dementia i was terrified that he was seriously gonna injure himself during the ordeal he looks like he is well into his 80s
caught red handed doesn t quite do it justice
free ride in a police car
oldies new born babies
can t wait for the concrete burn to set in
he s already complaining about the new potholes in the road
i had a old angry guy on my street he lived at the beginning of the street where the school bus stopped i would wait in my car for the school bus for my elementary aged son and he did not like it at all as far as he was concerned he owed the house and the public street in front of his house waiting for the school bus was like trespassing in his mind crazy this guy reminds me of him just angry
i really hate to be such an asshole and bad guy but i was hoping he would fall face first in that and cry about getting help and they just watch briefly before helping
eustace i m gettin me mallet
what a tantrum
those guys just calmly watching him was great
he ll have fun with the cement burns on his hands feet and legs
cool there daren felony vandalism charges will be fun for you
he ll be sleeping with fishes soon
gif giphy cr7yhnmd2tryc
damn that ending got me had to laugh out loud at the man struggling to get through the cement
he might be getting senile and thinks the street is his lawn
dude woke up put on his cover mosts over somes and chose violence
i hate suburbia

i m just curious what did he do to trigger the other guy no pun intended
the shooter didn t mean to shoot him it was just a prank
he s a budding comedian known for ruffling feathers no he s just an asshole for likes
how bout we don t fuck with people we don t know
life pro tip don t be an asshole
these prank assholes have taken it too far this is going to start happening more frequently
the fact the fucking media labels him as a budding comedian then goes on to say that security and the police have been called on him for things he s done how is he a comedian if both security and police have been called on him he s not funny he s a douchebag
i gotta say i m real sick of the prank culture less than 48hrs after my boyfriend had heart surgery we went for a small walk two girls walked by us one turned and right between us screeched at the top of her lungs they ran away giggling i ve never been in a physical fight in my entire life and for the same reason i wanted to beat their asses i couldn t if i got my boyfriends heart rate up or him involved in the fight it could very well kill him it was such a defeating moment for me it s rare i feel that angry and helpless over something so stupid and if you re the two chicks who walked by a month ago in boston reading this i hope karma hits you hard
it was only a matter of time until someone snapped
people don t fucking like being pranked like this was this to far yeah probably but for the love of god stop making videos at other people expenses it s not fucking funny they think they can harass the fuck out of someone and then get some diplomatic type immunity when they screech out durrr it s just a prank fuck these people someone was bound to get seriously hurt eventually prank your homies and people you know not random ass strangers cus you got a fucking god complex and need likes
gif giphy 7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb
i m gonna go get shot for internet clout be sure to smash that subscribe button
now that s funny
all his four friends can now upvote him
you said budding comedian but what you must ve meant was brainless piece of shit
anyone that harms a youtube prankster should be a given a pass
so asking for it joker got the punchline he deserved i take it
the definition of play stupid games win stupid prizes
i m not going to argue that the guy deserved to be shot just for being an asshole that s obviously too far but this should still serve as an example of messing with people and receiving harsh consequences for it doesn t seem worth the risk
now i m not going to say what he did was right in any capacity but i m not going to say he s wrong either
jury will let him off
normalize shooting social media prank people
they could have had the over the shoulder graphic say something like youtuber finds out or something like that missed opportunity
the mugshot of the guy who shot him did not look like he was in the mood for any shit
honestly there shouldn t be any charges pressed sounds justified
thank you alan
the shooter should go free and the prankster should be ticketed and fined
i was just poking this bear with a stick and he bit me x200b then while in recovery and i ll still keep poking bears
wouldn t these pranks fall under disturbing the peace should ve charged the gooner instead
play stupid games win stupid prizes obviously he shouldn t have been shot but when you make a living being a prick you re going to be a prick to the wrong mentally unstable person that has a gun eventually reminds me of the prankster that ran at a family with a frikin butcher knife and got shot
i think some of his pranks qualify as assault he has it all on youtube hopefully he s arrested and charged once he is healthy enough
pranks for the internet should be considered harassment i got no remorse for the idiot youtuber shooter was within his rights
budding comedian oh boy with journalists these days
took his gallbladder lol great prank
back in my day we had a name for people that thought they were funny when they were really just super annoying dorks we called them dorks we would have all laughed if nathan got shot at the mall we d have said that dork had it coming simpler times
there is a go fund me setup for the shooters defense it s a great cause
i say he simply had the day he deserved
pranks are just another word for harassment
leaning real hard into the my harassments are just pranks sympathy huh don t prank random people and you won t increase your chances of randomly being shot
these annoying teenagers need to learn that not everyone is a saint there are literally 1000s of serial killers roaming around
triggered
i m usually against violence but i also don t feel bad for these assholes that base thier entire platform on pissing other people off i m a little glad he got shot
i wonder why there are no massive cemeteries of the usa prankers hilarious must be the cemetery block of crazy clowns with chainsaws
thank you alan
here s the thing pranks should be between friends and family and should be good natured if the person being pranked doesn t laugh you re doin it wrong leave strangers alone unless your goin to be nice to them
he should get darwin award nominee tattooed around the bullet wound
should have just shot him in the nuts so he couldn t reproduce
the man upstairs literally gave him a warning shit to knock it off
aggravated malicious wounding do they just make up crimes it sounds like self defense to me
free that man
the more i see the more it feels like he did something a reasonable person would consider an imminent threat there s a reason they re not releasing the footage even though the police definitely have it as evidence this guy needs a good lawyer asap
fucking know your boundaries people especially with strangers you know absolutely nothing about keep your distance be respectful and never fucking ever think less of people
the amount of people who are justifying civilians shooting each other because youtube pranksters suck is astounding nobody deserves to get shot unless they are threatening others safety civilians with firearms are also not the best judges of this because lots of them want to play hero
the way i see it there are now two less assholes running free in the world
what people don t get with hidden camera shows they have a legal team to research if a prank is leagle they have a team of writters to decide if the prank is actually funny then tjey have extras on scene to intervene if things go wrong they also have to worry about boycots of they re sponsers so they do pay a bit of service to the moral outrage mafia keeps them a bit in line these youtube tiktok prankster have none of that no voice of reason behind the scene saying that s not a prank you re just being a dick
i m not saying he deserved it but it was bound to happen eventually don t fuck with strangers you don t know what s going on in their lives or what their mental state is
these pranks are definitely annoying but cmon this should be what could go wrong shooting someone who was pulling a prank the shooter s life may be completely ruined with the charges he s facing you can t just fucking shoot someone because they made you angry
free him
he found out
honestly the last think id do is pranks in america at least not on random people
i m not saying he deserved it but i m also not saying he didn t
a reasonable response to the prankster s odious behavior would be a lawsuit if an injury was incurred no content service should not be giving a platform to this idiot especially if his behavior could result in injury to non consenting parties this shooter has demonstrated that he lacks the composure or discipline to own or operate a firearm he almost killed someone two very different levels of horrible going on here
while of course he shouldn t get shot for it this type of comedy really needs to stop
i mean yeh he sounded like a dick but shooting guns in public places is just stupid and irrational learn to throw a punch jeez
well i sure he got a lot of up votes worth losing your liver over right
the shooter needs to be sentenced to at least a couple hundred hours of community service at a practice range so he can do the job correctly next time no pity or sympathy for the knob of a comedian may more of his kind meet the same fate as they are a cancer upon society
shooting prankers is a trend i can get behind
someone should set up a go fund for the defence fund of this hero
thank you karma
don t feel bad for either
i don t feel bad for these assholes
fuck both of these assholes
you have to be stupid in this day and age to fuck with people you don t know
yea people don t like being fucked with
doing society a favor maybe he ll learn his lesson prank videos are annoyingly dumb
faandfo
i reserve to make my opinion when all the facts are present not with a minute news clip
i d like to buy the suspect a beer
we should make a shotgun roof of your mouth challenge you know thin out the idiots
darwin award nominee
i feel bad for the shooter
since when did annoying people randomly in public make you a comedian that s my only question
man commits attempted murder we like well he had it coming
i m surprised it doesn t happen more often
why would the guy get charged for shooting him
the shooter did not subscribe but he sure rang the bell
is there a go fund me for the shooter
is there a go fund me for the shooter this is what is going to continue to happen because these people think they re funny but they re not
some people just need shootin
seems like i remembering seeing a chart that would explain what happened here
play stupid games win stupid prizes
play stupid games win stupid prizes
lol
wtf fuck this news station anchor and reporter whatever the fuck they are trying frame it like it s all harmless
i cant say i feel sorry for him
please share this with everyone these pranks are not funny and can be legitimately dangerous
it was bound to happen pranking strangers has its risks
did we get to the find out part
his own fault

this is the funniest shit i ve seen all day dude can see the second hit coming and can do nothing about it but anticipate the crash lol
was that harry maguire
satisfying clip to watch over over
the immediate regret in his eyes is palpable
shredded knacker sack
that s an ancient video but it still hurts just like the first time i ever saw it
that rag doll came straight outta the muppets
the look of pain on his face after the first hit combined with the i don t want to do this anymore but i can t stop look combined with it and then how he went flying at the end is just muah chef s kiss
fkn idiot
gosh i wonder why they put those divider thingies there
why he fell like a cartoon character
i d like someone to catch up with this guy this video is so old he has lives some life since i d like a profile on him
i don t care how old this clip is it s always funny
crushed nutz
what s so shocking the world is full of these idiots
if you really closely he knees himself in the face extremely hard as he is launched off
you can hear is head smack off of the escalator that man will never be the same it was a dumb idea but now he s probably even more brain dead than before
maybe everyone s better off if he doesn t reproduce but that was funny af
i hope that uninvolved pedestrian was unhurt
the regret in this lads eyes
who wants to have kids anyway
look like the last fall really could have fucked him up
i wonder how he predicted that would go
took those like a champ
it s like someone strategically placed objects every ft approx meters waiting for this day
damn karma is brutal the first one i think was lesson learned the second is just over kill
after smashing his balls on the first bump i doubt he felt pain else where
i wonder if he bit the serrated metal corner of the escalator stairs on landing fooked his face up real nice that ll learn him
how do i make this my phone background on repeat
jesus fucking christ that is funny
i ve probably seen this posted times by now and that thud at the end is still amazing
chuso it s always in our hearts
pang right in the toast
typical footballer you know he s faking his injury
i wish i could edit this with the mario jump sound when he goes flying
they just need this video playing on repeat at the top as a warning
he was in so much pain after the first one poor guy just had to ride it out
the end of that genetic line
crushed grapes and a bruised rear he might have learned his lesson
you think they would have stopped after hitting the first one
nut shot on a instant karma block
bro thinks he s james bond
this ass soccer shorts lol
i felt the first hit
full kit wanker
something tells me he knew what he signed up for
this video will never get old
that dude is like now
he gmod ragdolled at the end
love it i laughed out loud
this is the way i want to feel to peoples
his manpurse is permanently open

ow my balls
but he s just a raggedy man

womp womp
that dude is f d up those escalator stairs would mess you up falling on them like that not to mention the hip checks he was getting from the slide
chuso
removed
good to see the bumps doing their job
hit em right in the undergrounds
thank god he lost the ability to reproduce
somebody put a gta wasted edit on this
this should be under contagiouslaughter
idiot then now forever you
is this skyfall
a lightbulb moment
not going to lie i always wanted to do this as a kid
if you slow it down you can see the exact moment he went to sleep
kaaablaamooooooooo
this is one of those videos i will always stop and watch a couple times it s perfect the look of regret the instant karma the fact he could have stopped himself but failed then absolutely wrecked him self on the block and got wrecked again by the metal stairs too all while everyone looks on going you deserved that you little shit
i ve seen this clip before and never understood why he didn t landed on his feet or knees i feel like it s better than braking your spine
this slide terminates here all change please
his friend dying of laughter is icing on the cake
nice to see ow my balls from idiocracy make a real life appearance
that little bounce as he goes airborne adds just the right amount of style i give it a
he succeeded
gif giphy szd4gf32yzttuiinhn downsized
so did he succeed in making himself sterile sure hope he did it s a win for the human gene pool
lol
is this real life
bahahahahahahahahahaha
i never noticed this why is he fully kitted out ready to play
that high pitched ah
don t know which hurts more the part where he hit his sack or the part where he face plants into escalator stairs
i witnessed a guy trying this stunt a couple of decades ago he hit that ski slope barrier and launched
some guys pay good money to have their balls wacked
the noise he made when that first one hit never fails to fucking end me
is he okay
i broke my computer on one of those maybe even the same station
i ve seen this awhile ago but with some kind of mario edit lol
i think i ve watched this like times back to back
cracked in the nads followed by concussion brilliant
bahahahahaha
every time i see this reposted i love the look on the guys face after his balls get crushed on the first red block and the look on his face as he slides towards the purple block further down so his balls can take another thrashing
the fear and regret in his face as he s sliding down

why they do the cat s tail dirty
servals are great but not as pets they re not domestic and they re dangerous as heck for their size
but why why is a serval in a house
that serval is for sure saying oh honey nooooo

it s not your fault i know it s not your fault
you re not that guy pal
calm down please calm down it was a missunderstanding
fk people is a cat not enough no have to get a serval too idiots
cervals are not pets wild animals are not pets this one will end up dead or in a rescue
it appears to be blind wonder if that s why it has the temperament it does
i hate seeing servals as pets tame not to domesticated non domestic animals shouldn t be bred or traded disgusting industry
who did that to that poor cat s tail
serval said you re not that guy pal
bro no
please don t keep servals as pets
gif giphy 2tn5vihmnv9f0hgvwo downsized
are we just not going to talk about what s been done to that white cats tail
they should hire this serval to train cops

serval is just politely asking him to calm down

this reminds me of when i introduced a kitten to my adult cat the kitten went full aggro but was a 10th of the size of my cat my cat just put a paw on its head and told it to chill they ended up being best friends
i wonder what that paw posturing means in cat world i m getting heavy i could fucking ruin you but i am choosing not to vibes
is that serval missing an eye
relax child let me enlighten you
settle down meow
ssshhhh sshhhhh trust me you don t want these problems
you re not that guy bud you re not that guy

no you re not mad at me you re just upset at what they did to your tail it s ok
zava cat form
serval is being super gentle
that serval looks to be missing at least one eye
this is pretty much how i remind my cats bengals not to question my physical dominance

your enemy lies not with me but within yourself
ma am i m gonna need you calm down

babou he remembers me
thought that was a housecat at first then noticed the tail that serval is lucky that albino lion doesn t tear him to shreds
you re not that guy my guy
you re not that guy pal
the serval puts his paw out like he s putting his hand on your shoulder going whats wrong friend you seem upset you need to calm down
in the beginning he puts his paw on his chest like u keep playing these games u gon find out
lil dude just got a talking to listen closely and carefully little one one way or another this behavior you re showing right now will not keep up there are too many ways that i can at the very least ruin your day now put your paw down and carry on with your life while i still permit it
he was like listen do you see this paw i can use it to slice you up real bad let s not get carried away here okay bud

metal is metal
i think he actually paid for the vip package
the drum and the foot hiting at same time just makes this odly perfect
gif giphy sbt3dmcs3eee2xx5ci
as someone who spent a good amount of my younger years going to these shows it likely wasn t on purpose jumping on and off the stage is part of the whole thing in hardcore deathcore shows

did he throw his ass in the crowd after the kick

gif giphy xtcntjeh5rtf6bdlwa
strike first strike hard no mercy
that was a sick ass kick
that s honestly an impressive thing to pull off on stage lol
on beat
everybody was a kung foo fighting
i need to know what group this is like immediately
in the dome
roadhouse
if this is real that was the most bad ass irl thing i ve ever seen
that s his happy dance
kick was on time with the snare impressive
that thud tho i can t tell if that was his boot hitting the guy s chest or the drums
no scope
holy shit that was cool
fatality
r nextfuckinglevel
i can t stop watching this
with all the past news of performers getting shot or stabbed good glad that dick got a boot to the chops
in capoeira it s called meia lui de compasso
pantera
removed
wwf said that was perfect
you can see the guy taking a stance before the guy gets on stage he saw the guy climbing up prepared a strike and hit it on the beat hitting him clean in the jaw don t get in a fight with that guy
the applause from that flawless execution
not the kiss he was expecting
if that was fake they both deserve an oscar
i bet that dude had been waiting his whole life for a perfect roundhouse kick to the face opportunity nice form
in the face
reminds me of mondays except no one s helping me up
great form
ko
yeah man this is what a friend of mine would do in the middle of a mosh pit he says he has never actually hit anyone though i too throw arms and legs but never actually connected this guy was unlucky i have been punched in the head flying kicked in the stomach and some dude sprinted headfirst into my back i was surprised he just bounced off and didn t break his neck or my spine metal is metal
definitely the meet greet experiences are a lot more intimate these days
at that price point he can hit
that was just the sound of his foot connecting with his jaw s
came to see if anybody else posted this
no it was an accident lol source i follow the band on ig https://www.instagram.com/reel/cldlrssat01/?igshid=ymmymta2m2y=
this immediately made me think of shawn michaels that dude loaded up with that chin music
definitely on a stage aight i m out
snare
didn t even notice till i read your comment made it even funnier
drummer probably saw it coming and took a cue either way it was good timing if not slightly an overreaction
its definitely part of the vocalists choreo shit timing by the guy who rushed the stage
rang that dude s cowbell
the whole point of the move is to emphasize the music so it s very likely that he synchronized the movement well and the fan was attempting to be around the singer for that moment too not realizing what the singer was about to do
the singer probably coordinated his kick to the drums but he didn t expect anyone to be standing there
no you can see the singer take a stance for a knockout kick he timed it perfectly with the music he obviously has mma experience i would not climb on his stage
probably helped him up and apologized getting on stage and stage diving are common at shows like that and most people don t actually intend to hurt others when swinging like that
it likely wasn t on purpose jumping on and off the stage is part of those shows
i believe he threw him over the top rope and out of the rumble
i believe it s street soldier
feet of fury
street soldier
real but not intended it was a choreographed kick during the break timed to the drum hit the concert goer just happened to get up there at the wrong time the timing angle height everything was so perfect that it seems like it must ve been set up phone cameras and the power of the internet give us gems like this what a time to be alive
this is likely a hardcore punk deathcore show jumping on and off stage is part of the whole thing he likely didn t mean to hit him as hard
it was just an accident it happens sometimes he wasn t being a dick he was having fun
naw your good as long as some death metal or something isn t playing otherwise if he brings his own fight music around and a bluetooth speaker yikes
y all sounds like the worst people to be in a mosh pit with
eh if you are on the most pit yeah don t throw arms or shit the hardcore pit behind the most pit sure go hard a friend of mine would throw elbows in the pit and glocked me in the fricken sternum i ended up headbutting him in the face later that evening on accident so we called it even
and extreme
yea he meeted and greeted his boot
love an itysl reference in the wild
dudes jaw is the best sounding snare i ve ever heard
that s what i thought the first time i watched it lol
hi out i m dad
kick and snare at the same time and probably a crash cymbal for added impact
this is the right answer
yeah it looks like he had that move planned out with the way it lines up with the beat and i don t think he even saw the guy before he started kicking
i remember seeing this pic of a dude wearing a shirt saying street soldier but it had the ss symbol on it didn t know it was a band too
thanks i m glad covid didn t kill you
naw it s like doomslayer the music starts playing when you enter the room truely a terrifying ability
anyone in a mosh pit to fight are the worst type of people in general especially in tiny ass venues that can barely support one
just snare
username checks out
right definitely don t think there was any intent to harm there
lmao

that could ve worked without the chopper
my dude walked out like a gta character and thought his wanted level automatically disappeared
why d they stop for the guy in the sidewalk
should ve used a car paint shop
i was expecting the police to have inexplicably stolen a vehicle to chase someone disappointed
stupidly runs rampant in some places
he should have been a bro and stood in the middle of the street blocking them so the rest can get away depending on what happened he could claim he had no idea the car was stolen and didn t know them was just hitching a ride
always best to nonchalantly take off in the unattended police car
whoever did the alignment on that car deserves a raise still going straight
plot twist decoy now imagine if this were a clown car
classic reacher
can confirm as a teen the cops chased us all the time the ones who kept running were the ones who got caught eventually just get to the nearest sidewalk and act like you belong there
you cheated you had a chopper that s an envasion of my rights
five stars
bro forgot to call lester
to get at least one of those fools since clearly hes dumb enough to instantly crack and say they live at x y z or smth
he should have jumped out and pretended to be a hostage
i m pretty sure it s someone getting out of the back seat there s still a driver in the car
honestly he should ve hopped the first and jetted down the alley
actually stars that s when the helicopter flies in and there isn t cops nearby
in addition the helicopter can still easily fallow the car while the person on foot would have a significantly easier time escaping the view of the helicopter
that too

name
hopefully next time
that s my same reaction as well something coming at me knee high suddenly is usually a dog and i have had to kick a few to protect myself already i want to clarify in defense when being charged by a snarling dog it s reflexive and that would have landed a swift kick in the face with steel toed work boots and then only mild concern after realizing it was a fucking stupid prank i would have called an ambulance for them but damn sure wouldn t touch them or let them within arms reach
i was expecting the spanish inquisition

dude s like bruh
everybody hates chris vibes
dude is dead inside
my niece s face at everything
idk if a dude lifted me up over his head that easily i d be a little concerned at least but these days there are too many laws against assault and they were all on camera kid knew nothin real was gonna happen
my dad used to do this aaall the time
scared straight programs have been shown to actually increase delinquency if you want to fix the kids make sure they have a future they can realistically strive towards
scared straight wouldn t intimidate the smart ones or the kids who ve known someone inside prison these dudes would be brutalized by other inmates if they hurt a kid
i know this is all scripted but those dues are scary strong
dude is so done with everything
my man already dead inside
this man like my grandma whoop me harder than you
cuzz he knows you can t punch his face and stab his ass like a real prison i m sure he s seen the show
first scared straight was good cuz the kids didn t know what would happen to them best line from a prisoner to a kid hold my pocket
would have been more effective to show him some kindness obviously he s seen enough intimidation
bikes
guessing mother scared him that bad huh
that kid is lacking a certain understanding of what could happen to him without the protection from the tv show
how dumb do you think these kids are they obviously know that no tv show will allow kids getting beat up by adults in front of a camera which they know is going to be broadcasted as a show
he looked like being lifted two feet from the floor by some dude was a slight inconvenience
that teen looks he s seen some shit
gif giphy l0mypjjdkpousaajy
hold my pocket
lol reminds me of ol school wrestling i d be fucked up if deebo pressed me in the rafters but this child knows the camera s rollin the best one is where they make buddy stand in his commissary bin
looks like to scare this dude try a hug
don t help just film s
someone drop some pixelated shades on this dude
the infamous bored shitless episode of the scared straight series
that show lost its appeal once the kids realized the prisoners can only threaten and posture in their attempts to scare them they were no longer afraid then started mouthing off and doing things like this
some of these kids seen this show already
he s only acting unphased because he knows they aren t allowed to hurt him lock him up for a year in a real prison and watch that smirk fade
well yeah because they can t actually beat the shit out of them shiv them in the showers or rape them
he has a black momma too not scared of shit else
kids like man this power wedgie ain t cool bro and my sphincter isn t impressed
dudes like my mom does this to me at home
he may not be pulling that face when they ve got him bent over and pulling down his strides
song
bro he knows not a thing will happen to him
i ve never been in prison before so i don t know how to respond but for people who have what s it like it it like how hollywood portrays it with rape and violence or is it kinda just where people are just people going day from day doing stuff
i remember these were so stupid the kids were always obviously aware they couldn t be actually hurt or touched probably why there are so many disrespectful kids these days honestly most kids know if an adult does anything at all they can jus record it and get them in legal trouble or fired
kids got ice water in his veins
if someone can pin you up against the wall you gone be scared when it s the real deal unscripted
it s all funa dngames until you re in the shower with them and you drop the soap
he ends up in there and they bend him over it will be a different vibe picked him up like a rag doll
kid s scared out of his mind dude could use him as a pocket pussy if he wanted to lol he playin it cool for the cameras
wonder where that kid is now prob ly runnin shit somewhere
he knows they can t punch him so he waits it out lmao
empty threat s the tv show
he s seen worse
motherfucker looks like he s with a mortgage and baby mamas lol
he like if we were outside in the streets i would have popped your ass
fight flight or freeze he s terrified
bro is inches from dudes dick
everybody hates chris

that s how you act in online games when you know you ll respawn after death i don t think he understand the word consequence
how is this show not child abuse is it court ordered or what s going on here do the parents get paid it s nuts
wait till they pull his pants off face ain t gonna be like that
a lot of these kids were drugged could be a really sad story
never knew jordan poole was in a scared straight program
i bet his face changes once his pants come off
when you try to act tough but dont understand that you wont get far with that if you dont understand prison is bullshit and you have to avoid it
people are too confident they won t get their ass whipped these days a good example why they should allow once a year legally allowed fist fight between individuals it can be monitored by medics and refs if someone has a problems with another person bring them into the fight they can workout aggression that s building without it going to far limitations to determined at a later time
the teens know the shit they do is so ridiculous lmao like sure they re assholes but even this shit us beyond them scared straight nah we re just gonna make it painfully silly
hhmmmm i can hear the dirty voice in my head talking about lifting me and hmmmm
they know it s all show
my kid like cmon man
isn t this a scene from malcom in the middle
hes all wait til your sleeping tonight
he has a mustache before his 20s this man fears no one
he s probably thinking my step dad whooped my ass for real you guys are clowns
dude s like bro just let me down already
he was already died inside
bikes
when you go to prison expecting a new experience just for it to be just like back home
and here i present dissociation bro needs therapy
he just picked him up like he was a damn cloth doll
another tuesday
the anger and threats may be fake but that strength is real and impressive
how nice they helped him to stand up
cause he knows it s full of shit and they can t do anything to him
my grandma lifted me higher than this before the choke slam bruh
bros got bigger issues than some policeman pickung him up
dude knows ain t nothing happening these aren t the inmates that get sent to solitary all the time and shank others every tuesday these are the good ones trying to get out early even us tv wouldn t put kids at risk with actual dangerous inmates
the problem with scared straight programs is they know the inmates can t do shit to them
what s going on in his life to make him just not care about being attacked by inmates
teen that kid looks with a gambling addiction
does anyone know the song name
scared straight faced
these kids probably grew up around violence what makes you think using violence will cause a change in behaviour through shock
scared straight on youtube look it up maximum security prisoners serving multiple life sentences with no chance of getting out very worth the watch also bikes
i m a karate man karate man bruise on the inside
bikes
maybe it is a npc
mans like this isn t so bad i could get used to this
this needs to be a meme template
teen convict
ah giving random people permission to assault children what a wonderful world
he s looking forward to the showers
awe and they look proud of themselves too

have you seen what humans do to animals it s grotesque and we are supposedly the humane ones
r angryupvote
yeah but they aren t are they
we have never been humane we keep telling ourselves we are but we ve never been
yeah you re right our egos gave us this superiority complex to believe we are a kind and intelligent species but we are cruel beyond measure
i think we really can be kind and compassionate problem is we think we are kind and compassionate always not realising that we are as complex as nature itself because we are nature
that s the aliens haven t stepped in to help
we can and should be but we are not we are nature but we deem ourselves the most intelligent so why do we act like savage wild animals

this dude is a liar thief and corrupt politician every word from his mouth is a lie
anti semitic s i legit love how israel can commit war crimes and the us turns a blind eye
they do this every ramadan
pieces of shit why are we funding them
disgusting
in before anyone calls op antisemitic
just a reminder criticism of israel and its government and the support of innocent palestinian lives does not equal antisemitism
i criticized this type of behavior on the s world news page yesterday and was not only permanently banned from that page but warned by reddit i ve never been banned or warned for anything like that before what i said was categorically not incorrect the amount of people who just blindly support israel and turn a blind eye to the evils they perpetrate on palestinians is just out of control
sure looks like what the nazi stormtroopers were doing before world war ii
does anyone know what incident this is in regard to
i just tried to share this via fb messenger to a friend and fb wouldn t let me send it bc it violates their standards saying i m sharing private and sensitive images
fuck this asshole and fuck the conservatives in israel
international criminal court
common netanyahu l
looks like american police
they ll just play the victims like always
this is why i have no respect for religious governments
a us cop s feared for my life is similar to idf s someone threw a rock
fascist pieces of shit are always the ones who screamed loudest that they are peace keepers fuck that demon
he s trying everything he can to rewrite the rules to try and hold on to power for a life term
they were praying in the mosque in ramadan imagine if it was the other way around it would be an outrage and reported by major news channels
removed
crickets from us media
how and why people side with israel is beyond me
i worked with the israeli army years ago the shit they say about palestine and how to handle them would make even eva braun blush
every time i compare the israeli government to 1940s facist i get banned but i m not wrong
oh the same army that snipes at palestinian civilians for fun
when you are so delusional you start to believe your own lies
the us needs to stop funding this shit
based on his morals obviously
israel is turning into germany circa
batons rated e for everyone
binyin netanyahu is a liar and a snake should be in jail
they disgust me
israel is trash free palestine
his moral army raided al aqsa mosque and attacked citizens who were just praying peacefully
the most deadly disease in human history is religion
i m all for supporting the jewish people but israel can go fuck itself
literal fascism and an ally of the west
pardon my ignorance but can anyone explain how all this started in the first place
didn t take long for them to end up like germany
classic usa backed and funded zionists gif giphy 3osxyrgm8gi9cdjcpu
what shocks me is that israel would reelect a far right fascist that they already know is a far right fascist because he was already the leader once and then be surprised and upset when he does far right facist s to them as well on top of all of that they fail to see how their own plight runs parallel to how badly and poorly they mistreat palestinians it s actually insane how apartheid and perceived racial superiority can make you blind to just pure logic
as long as the majority of the west allows israel to get away with playing the ww2 card nothing will ever change every criticism is instantly met with the decades old you re an anti semite and a lot of people still chew it up but let s face the truth israel is a war mongering land invading oppressive lives destroying nation with only one goal the complete subjugation of every last palestinian man woman and child
sometimes i wish there was an afterlife so some people could burn
technically military police magav but yes still unreasonable
fucking israeli terrorists
this is just one example what about shooting reporters in the head blocking medical aid snipers shooting civilians in the genitals using civilians as human shields using cluster munitions bombing hospitals schools and places of worship all this is verifiable with a simple google search
is there any army in the world that has morals
israel is a parasite
what a bunch of nazis
this is messed up
fuck the idf
the israel government are nazis the fucking irony of it all
snipers killing children in palestine just for kicks moral indeed
the crazy part it works you think he doesn t know people can fact check him
what a miserable fucking problem the middle east and israel continue to be since before i was born and probably well after wish both israel and palestine would dissolve mix together and become one big non religious thing so sick of the death and the violence and the pointing fingers everyone s a monster for letting this go on so long
this piece of garbage reminds me of another piece of garbage that as well claims that he is fighting nazis and terrorists same shit different smell
israel should outgrow its apartheid no place for that in the modern world
that guy and his army are actual pieces of shit that have no regard for human life and the hamas is just as bad and innocent people on both sides get caught in the crossfire of an almost century old war fuck that shit
consider the source i respect his military past but that dude is insanely corrupt an outright bully
he and his supporters don t car as long as arabs and palestinians are being beaten murdered forced out of their homes living under a new apartheid and not them they re happy
hey fuck you israhell free palestine
to them that is moral because palestinians are in their eyes less than human
being critical of israel isn t antisemetic just like being critical of the taliban isn t islamophobic
goebbels theory in action
saying netanyahu is a piece of shit or being critical of certain israeli policies is not anti semitic bibi is an absolute garbage human i hate how far right some countries are moving moderates have no place in politics anymore and it s ripping us apart
removed
shameful
pictures are worth a thousand words my friend
i don t believe in any afterlife heaven n hell but damn if the underworld exists these dudes just bought a non refundable ticket straight there
he also publicly proclaimed we run america and the americans know it but it wasn t reported on the news
let s not forget the aerial bombing campaign a little while back too taking out whole city blocks
hypocrites
all n all team palestine fuck the us islaeli money laundering shit
imagine taking morality advice from fucking bb netanyahu this mfer s picture is in the dictionary next to the word corrupt
fuck israel
defund isreal trash ass apartheid state
disgusting
when you hate the ethno fascists so much that you become the ethno fascists
removed
omniman pathetic
pretty easy to think youre morally right when you dont think of the people youre oppressing and murdering as people netanyahu and his dogma needs to go
doing unto others as the nazis did to them
how can you lie through your teeth with such a straight face i guess this why i can never be a world leader
this is sadly old news fuck israel free palestine
i ve been to palestine recently and seeing this situation up close is even more sickening we need to stop this somehow it s disgusting really how people are treated and nobody does a thing
israel is evil
their moral is fucked up them
israeli nazis
israel is an apartheid state their land grabs are illegitimate israelis deserve everything they ll get from their fascist dictator
i have witnessed their morality first hand multiple times so moral
w t f
well he is kinda right they are definitly using morals to justify their actions and with their actions being that terrible they must be using a lot of morals

he s a fascist free palestine
yeah politicians lie
heh you forgot to show the other part of shooting fire works and throwing rocks and chairs at the army
fascist scumbag
well that s fucked up
gta moment
i bet his family is so proud of him do you think they play this video at family get togethers hey jake come look at your old dad in action hee hee that s funny daddy you hit that old lady for no reason
you can tell it s israel because it s a guy in of gear blasting a little old lady s kneecaps to fuxking atoms to disable her for life while not burdening the police department with the hassle of a death investigation
what the fuck why karma certainly has got a package waiting for him
this is so disgusting and heartbreaking why does the super powers stand by and let this brutality happen
bruh israel is legit fucked up nobody calls them out imagine if russia did this
what is this video of
i see things like this think what a big man you are spit on the ground
what in the hell would possess that coward of a cop to hit a poor woman filming newsworthy events as they occur i have no idea what the law is where this is occurring but that s some messed up madness in the police force to think this is ok
this is shocking considering israel has the most moral military in the world according to them
how can anyone in the world think this is necessary it makes me sick to think these idiots think they re doing gods work had religion had never been conceived or even if god never revealed himself to us we d would have been better off or even the other side is this the way god would have wanted us to handle things we re soooo far off the mark of what he or she would have wanted we all should be very ashamed
what is going on with this world there is something we are not being told the mainstream media doesn t report on this or the protests in france or the protests that were going on in brazil or anywhere else in the world we are being lied to and kept in the dark just like the people of north korea
apartheid state doing apartheid stuff
love how no matter where you go how hard you look how much you pay cops are all the fuckin same
what the actual fark disgusting
fascism in action
not as bad as what they re doing to those poor people and their children

i love this guy makes moronic people feel stupid with there own statements
half the stuff i see on reddit make me feel like i am a worthless idiot and then there s the other half like the folk in this post which make me feel like a god damn genius
trump supporters may be the most dense senseless and cult following human beings on the planet the only thing missing is him telling them that he gets to be with their wives and to drink the tainted punch
my aunt is a scientologist i learned many years ago that talk isn t talk to cultists just something they know they have to do otherwise they d be more creepy and weird than they already are these people are in fuckin deeeeeep
soooo stupid where do these people come from
a gut feeling from the facts don t care about your feelings crowd gotta love it
logic and reason evades these people when thats happening it signals a cult
it s hard for some people to think
gif giphy ho2mvz5dvsw7s
the definition of knuckle draggers
this isn t necessarily dumb people but actually people with a opinion that is hard to change if they form an opinion on something they can be proven wrong but still try to fight it with as little evidence they have this happens all of the world with nearly every political party just the general fight in what you believe in and sometimes what you believe in isn t true
you shouldn t just be able to pick and choose whi goes to jail that s communism
these people need to learn to just run away when this dude approaches
its a bit funny that theres trump supporters here downvoting anything related to agreeing with the interviewer
they never actually know how things work but always have an opinion on what they assume based on feelings facebook memes and fox news
i m not sure who this guy doing the interview is but i love him he definitely has balls of steel trump supports are the most dangerous violent people in the world to take the chance to try to show these idiots how stupid the stuff coming out of trumps mouth
with how far along we are with technology and the ease of information at our fingertips it s inexcusable to be this dumb
these people are so far gone they don t even realize they re a walking joke
it s a stupid case rich guys screw a lot of women did anyone not know that most of them prefer it to remain secret especially from their wives surprise campaign finance laws were bent to the tune of of trump s spending the whole thing is a clown show and will probably backfire
these people are mentally ill
the mutants love the cult
so many us citizens have no idea what is in the constitution and how the legal process works
ndas we re literally invented for paying off hookers
these people even look scary
i ve never seen this guy before he looks like a great value chris evans but sounds like a great value ryan reynolds
it s jordan klepper as an fyi he has awesome stuff and attends a lot of trump rallies and protests also another good one is the youtuber all gas no brakes who does a variety of stuff be careful it s a deep rabbit hole with both
glad we could help out love doing nice thing a day for a stranger
just waiting for them to set up trumptown
try telling abrahamic religion followers that they are in cults and then come back and talk people think there are working magic spells called sacraments and other things which are actually defined as divine magic not symbolic actions people really sleep on the fact that there are dudes who think their full time job is to cast spells in a robe and commune with a divine being but we let that happen and provide tax exemption for these groups
politics is the new cult the echo chambers on both sides pull people in based on fear and the politicians leverage it to get the votes
the united states of america
the appetizer was so so but can t wait for the additional courses of ga j6 and the good old documents case with a desert of 250m tax fraud everyone should be pretty full by then i bought a case of popcorn the old school style not the shitty microwave stuff

when i see any of them out there with picket signs and calling a priest rabbit or prophet christ himself i will certainly do that also most religions here in the us are not trying to overthrow our republic and turn us into a totalitarian government most of his followers would allow him to be their king to me it s insanity

most of the crazy maga people and other extremists are only capable of such extremism via their mental infrastructure being warped by religion it s basically a gateway drug to crazy because it enforces a reality facts don t matter approach to life
i assure you the end goal of evangelicals is to overthrow the us government and turn it into a theocracy
amen but a little bit of butter as well
yes we do
agreed it s basically a reality distortion field that is impermeable to anything fact or reality based

more interested in those electrical tape shoes
by the looks of that big toe looks like he has definitely fucked up numerous times before
i was waiting to see one of those toes snap lol
what happened to these toes
i like the safety shoes
anyone else notice that his toe is ummm bleeding
you have to anchor the pipe and bear down and into it noob
looks like that hit ur toe or times
mans working in sandals
why does this need a shitty over autotuned soundtrack
ngl i was thinking something was going to happen to that exposed toe lol
someone get this guy some real flip flops
maybe you need to find a job that will allow you to buy a real pair of shoes buddy
in tube bending machines there is a bendable head with bearings between small segments of softer metals called a mandrel it is in the middle of the tube to prevent crimping and breaking during the bend like that
that s a horrible bend

did it snap at the back
that s why temper is important
ewww the fuck
most conduit benders are one piece of metal so no slipping around one fluid motion
that has to be the worst bender ever made you have to have heavy foot pressure or it will kink every time when i saw the sandles i knew how this would end
shitting bend should be smooth degree no crimping
may need to warm things up bud
now you broke the bend put a wooden stick fitting the tubes dimension and the bends length and it will keep more of it s strength
i m no electrician but have zero issues bending conduit
besides the stupid music is his toe bleeding tf
how many times did it land on his toe one is too many edit i m just now noticing the electrical tape to hold a bottom onto his foot he just needs to stop everything
it s just a bump i got tested last week and everything s negative baby
forgot the spring
did he try it on his big toe first
looks like they got their big toe a couple of times
those poor feet
fill it with sand you won t get the awkward bad crinkled up bend
what are those
yeah it looks like electrical tape and an insole
i got this from r lachancla they re safety chancla s
i can here for that comment
r diwhy
asking the important questions
lookin like my fingers after eating some hot cheetos
he swapped with mtg
anything that could happen with electric tape flip flops
you can see from his big toe that they are working
you work through the pain and blood my friend
anchor the pipe it s all about foot pressure the handle is only there to stabilize and guide source me an electrician i ve bent countless feet of pipe
noob sauce
like you bear down for midterms https://youtu.be/pefalthuqf4)
sandals would be a step up that s just some cloth taped to the bottom of his foot electric tape and cloth that s it
the one covered in blood
wow i didn t even notice that damn taping some cloth to the bottom of your feet that s rough poor guy
they make good manual benders without bearing benfield is the name when it comes to maual benders the problem here is the bender sucks you have to have heavy foot pressure when bending emt or it will kink i have ran miles of pipe in the electrical industry the benders will keep the required bending radius there is a different bender for every size pipe if you are bending rmc give me a chicago bender it s a ratchet type will keep all your bends uniform and smooth
would it have worked if they torched it a bit to make the metal more malleable
temper how x200b you just need these https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/internal-spring-bender-20mm-pipe/dp/b0768hmjph/ref=asc_df_b0768hmjph/?tag=begogshpadde-21&linkcode=df0&hvadid=632995447114&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4403347955437912857&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001122&hvtargid=pla-421263813491&psc=1&gclid=cj0kcqjw27mhbhc9arisaifsete76daftjq-h9zhtvy5jmcf4bborfm7u3o0armu0bjowr_h3cqae8caajvcealw_wcb) inside
i understood this reference
you coming to the function
and his big toe looks beat to fuck
they really do have a sub for everything
chee toes
i thought you pulled a chain of balls through the tubing or high pressure water
i think something already did
i have only operated a couple and both were mandrel benders most tube i ran was like
yeah but i m sure i could bend with this bender without kinking it just need to actually use some foot pressure
no you will still end up with a crumpled pipe you need something to counterakt the force its like a slinkey made to fit snugly inside the tube x200b like this https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/internal-spring-bender-20mm-pipe/dp/b0768hmjph/ref=asc_df_b0768hmjph/?tag=begogshpadde-21&linkcode=df0&hvadid=632995447114&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4403347955437912857&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001122&hvtargid=pla-421263813491&psc=1&gclid=cj0kcqjw27mhbhc9arisaifsete76daftjq-h9zhtvy5jmcf4bborfm7u3o0armu0bjowr_h3cqae8caajvcealw_wcb)
i have no clue lol
tf is that lol all you need is foot pressure the handle is just there to guide and stabilize
i am proud of you
he should have taped another insole to top of his foot
nope i m sure that may be a thing for something but not this i ve never personally run into it or even heard of it until this reddit thread and as i said i ve bent countless feet of pipe ranging from emt imc rmc pvc and have been on a huge range of different projects large and small never even heard of it so i m guessing it s not used in electrical applications however i could be ignorant of some specialty thing in the video it appears he is bending emt probably the most common size and type of conduit
that is a little different than electrical conduit i have bent everything from to in thin wall to threaded heavy wall to pvc to pvc coated heavy wall it is an art some people are naturals and some like me have to develop the skill through training and practice you probably had a tight bend radius that would require the mandrel benders the electrical trade requires a long bend radius
filling it with sand works pretty good too
do you actually call it imc and rmc where you are genuinely curious everyone in my area refers to it simply as rigid

the other kid sipping and putting the drink down was a direct clue that an ass beating was forthcoming
you don t mess with someone willing to wear that shirt with overalls
i love his guah love seeing this video again
this pranking shit is tiresome
the girl already knew what was coming and was unbothered af
never ever fuck with anyone in overalls overalls are a power move
last i read overalls guy is her brother and the other kid had basically been stalking her edit i don t know why everyone is so salty i m just sharing the information i got last time i saw this video it was on another thread that had a link to tiktok where this video was originally posted all the comments there were saying that it was a brother who was sick of this guy annoying sister
my buddy has a hell of a left punch
wasn t about to spend another six dollars on no smoothie kids got style
ill never not upvote this video i d love a where are they now update it s been several years
best part of this video is to be the look on the girls face when she realizes what the loser is saying she has that here we go again look down pat she has def seen this before
prank everyone laughs at the end harassment intentionally making people feel weird bad worried scared etc pranks are funny harassment provokes a response your emotionally unintelligent ass deserves whatever you get when you harass random strangers
osh kosh b gosh really surprised me calmly set his smoothie down then came hard with the left i mean it s almost r unexpected material granted the goofball he clocked was pounds soaking wet and wearing boots
the girl s action suggestd this has happened a few times before
dennis the menace has really changed
you can hear the second punch connect right before the video cuts off dude prolly caught a two piece broken jaw and feelings hella hurt
uegh
a wise man once said never monkey with another monkeys monkey
i really want to see the full video of this
old mcdonald is out here whooping ass
there s only one way these pranking videos will stop when citizens continue to pop these idiots in the mouth they will realize that it s not worth it to prank random people they will find a random guy willing to pull a gun and make you pay just like we recently heard about
oshkosh b gotyaassbeat
simple jack woke up today and chose violence
he didn t even hesitate just set his drink down and started swinging you can hear the guy recording going for the it s just a prank bro
that one kid was dressed like chucky never ness with a kid that is dressed like that
this is the reaction we need more often for idiot pranksters
lmfao not gonna let a little nerd do you like that and record it a very well deserved left hook and honestly looks like he followed up with a combo
he gonna feel silly for being rocked by a kid from the s lucky they caught that on vhs
good i m sick of those prank videos
with audio my b ik it old but funny when annoying people get bodied lmao
her little smile of understanding is quite terrifying
this was probably the last straw after a day in the city where everyone thought he was cos playing a minion
what was the prank though
man to get you ass beat by mario and luigi s cousin giuseppe had to have been demoralizing
dude is dressed like a year old
this felt right
the ending all prank videos deserve
people need to stop messing around with strangers for internet videos i almost prefer when they go down this way
is there a sub for pranksters finding out
he s literally one of the gang punks from the warriors movie
is there a subreddit dedicated to videos of pranksters getting reactions like thiwr to their incessant aggressive attempts to annoy scare or otherwise bother people just trying to go about their days
when he got hit it was almost like there was some old school mortal kombat sound effects
luigi has pretty good punch ay mariooo
these prank vids are only ever worth a shit if the prankster gets his ass kicked
this is the 10th different title for this video ive seen the most believable one for me is that this isnt a prank the blonde kid confessing his love to this girl has been stalking her and repeatedly doing this dude in overalls is her current bf
the noise he made when he got punched is incredible he deadass went blegh
got a free sample of kung pow chicken
bro got his ass whooped by a minion
i wish there were more breakdowns for people who make a living from doing prank videos
imagine getting slept by bob the builder
it looks like the couple are used to this guy or people like this guy coming up to them or people they know and harassing them in a similar way goofball and his friends probably go up to a lot of people with the same from the moment i saw you i was like oh my gosh crap and a camera behind them and kid had it coming that being said overalls hands could get him in a lot of trouble with such a short fuse
the fact that he took a sip of his drink before putting it down and throwing the punch is somehow funny
what is the prank
sometimes you find out
the couple went on to have a nice meal prankster was full having had a knuckle sandwich prior
average overalls enjoyer
gif giphy lszab3tzftrau
we need this to happen to more pranksters
we need to normalize beating the absolute shit out of these pransters
no hesitation at all just casually put down his drink and started swinging that kid s got it
dude even calmly set his drink down
saw the backstory to this somewhere apparently the kid in overalls is her brother and the kid that gets the beatdown was a stalker that kept repeatedly doing stuff like that
the sound he made after getting hit tho
dude got punched by a baby from an oshkosh ad
if this would happen more often maybe there would be less prank videos
there s a reason why the prank genre fell off eventually
oh i saw the uncut version of this video nothing special he just continues to get his ass beat
never underestimate a dude in overalls
dennis the menace kept it realer
that was such a solid overhand right he may have broken the kids jaw i can t understand how the kid was still conscious boyfriend probably has some kind of training
i m more worried about what kind of man the overalls kid grows up to be throwing hands at some weak shit like that dude has a problem
i predict felonies in his future
you can tell quite a few boys in here don t know what it s like to be a woman who gets harassed often this type of shit is terrifying and part of why i do not like leaving the house leave us alone we are not here for your pleasure i would love to punch the next asshole who follows me into a store to tell me i m hot i didn t even realize i did this until it was over but a truck honked at me and then made an immediate right and i jogged behind some bushes and watched it make a uturn and come back out and i was literally hiding in the bushes because i knew he was coming around to either holler at me at best and god knows what else at worse leave us alone
what a twat ig he s that desperate to look manly he d assault someone for basically nothing
let me explain how women work for you guys on reddit recent scientific findings have found that women are persons they have have a free will they have opinions and the same rights as you so if someone is confessing their love to a woman they actually have a choice and an opinion now let me explain relationships it s when two or more people are interacting with each other a very common relationship is a romantic usually monogamous relationship it s when two or more persons by their own free will chose to engage in romantic stuff so if a outside party confesses their love to a person already in a relationship it is that persons choice to do what they want about that information it has nothing to do with their partner but punching someone for confessing their love only makes sense if the other person is not a person with free will and can t choose the only way to keep the relationship is by removing competition instead of being a better partner the prankster is an asshole and the presumably boyfriend is also an asshole
what even was the prank hit on someone s girlfriend in front of them
it s the way the guy in overalls calmly sets his drink down then boom
that first punch should have knocked him out you could hear it i think he pushed his elbow out to far instead of just driving into that dudes jaw
nothing hits harder than love
simple jack got hands
busy day on walton mountain
this is what the minions grew into
sounds like people are getting fed up with this prank bs another youtuber got shot in the stomach this week trying to do a prank
the two dudes made a connection at least
i feel like violence against prankers should be legal kinda like how killing drug dealers is legal in the philippines kidding kindof
kick the shit of these pranksters the punch gave me so much peace happiness and tranquility
osh kosh wasn t fucking around
last word bleugh
i love her face when she sees her guy bend down to put down his drink she just backs away and has a little smile she knows her man
i wish all prank videos ended this way
i love how he just puts his drink down and wham
bro you got your ass best by dennis the menace
ol south paw
i hope this will be the new trend
dennis will feed you your own face
don t fuck with lefties man the way he casually puts down the drink like i see where this is going
casually sets down drink knocks some sense into an idiot
the fact that he sets his smoothie down first means it wasn t an emotional reaction just a man doing what needs done total g
coveralls dennis the menace whatever kid delivered a nice overhand left there

taking that gotta cough to get off to a new level
delta is alike filling your lungs with ants gets me buzzed as f though not gonna lie ive learned how to do it now shallow hits control the air intake much better
about seconds too long on that one champ
as somebody who s made this mistake i feel for the dude those things pull smooth and you don t realize you made a mistake until it s much too late

what was in there cinnamon
you cough you get off
he need to breeve
min later he ate all the food in the fridge and fell asleep
i was hard cringing for every second past
you don t need the whole gram at once
vape is harsh and hard on the lungs quick buzz that don t last man
it s not hitting love giving a pen to someone and watch them take a drag like this know whats about to happen lmao bet my man felt good after this
my husband daily
these thread vape carts are unusually hard on the lungs and that guy was taking wayyy too big of pull it seems like most forms of concentrates shatter wax budder live resin etc have always been this hard on the lungs in general not good for you and especially bad if you re taking huge hits like this guy
did he get a hit
r tooktoomuch
am i just really high or did anyone else think this guy was under water at first

smoking on that tear gas

bruh how do you even get high
the last inhale with the face was fucking hilarious
gif giphy 4ybsfjyg1gs6s
same waiting on the day we get medical or recreational passed until then delta isn t bad
how d you know it was d8 i had a d8 gummy once tossed in as freebie with a polypeptide order i ate it thinking yeah whatevs it s not even weed big surprise
rite of passage
thc vapes tend to be harsh pulling for more than even seconds is too much so him pulling that long would definitely cause a coughing fit and i guarantee he was coughing up nasty coloured phlegm afterwards for days
not really when taken at reasonable levels dude was sitting there trying to get as much as he can of course he s gonna die doing that he s what some would call a noob
that s a thc vape tho soooo it do last
man quick buzz that don t last u gotta stop buying boof dude
have you tried the htfse stuff worth the extra money imo
respiratory issues in the future
top gif usage my man
it s not bad at all weed is legal in my state but d8 is definitely more accessible and convenient i like to have a bit of both stocked up
we call that lung butter
yeah it don t hit like weed at all the buzz never lasts for me even with the high quality live resins
plus one or two pulls and you can put it down and be good for a few hours now normal vape pulling all day long like that can become a problem but of course anything we do too much aint good for us
i m using the high quality live resins raw garden is my go to what do you use as a year stoner i ve tried every single method of ingestion on the planet ounce for ounce price wise and duration wise nothing beats the buzz of a gel cap edible it comes on slow but it lasts forever plus you can titrate the dosage so you don t over medicate and waste money ripping bongs all day that s just how i see it one man s opinion your mileage will vary
that s my point though at least for me as a regular user it s too easy to over medicate with the vape pens everyone s mileage will vary of course
these people don t understand dude i m with you carts suck
everyone s different i ve been smoking everyday for years and have only been vaping for the last months i cough up less gunk and i get just as high and it s more convenient less smell no resin no pipes to clean no lighter just need to charge a battery raw garden is one of the best vapes i ve had and very cheap they used to be now they re only high 90s i have just tried recently and the high was even better than raw garden but they are i like the carts because they are a little more consistant than flower my ounces would start to dry out towards the end and dollar for dollar the carts last me longer

some glass panes were lifted
are those panes just stacked on one pallet and strapped together i think the glass was not shipped from the factory like this but repackaged at some point along the line by people who should have asked for help
beep
typical riggers
see what we got here is failure to calculate and we get what we have right here
if they used a basket instead of a choke sling method i bet they wouldn t have broken
that s why you always add waste
croughywhsiwnsubrus eee
i d better honk just in case they haven t noticed
it looks so crispy
this is why lifting with pallets is a violation
mr no gloves is lucky the pane he was holding isn t the one that broke
i mean do folks not understand the pressure that would be applied to that loop of webbing
they all were for a time a very very brief time
looks to me like it was forklifted on to then be forklifted off glass is shipped on these all the time seems like a big site and lots of floors my guess is someone wanted to save time by straight lifting them off the truck to the work floor so threw a strap around it and used the big crane not realising that the inward pressure of the straps on the glass at the top would shatter them not something they ll forget in a hurry

i thought it was going to turn in to gta
omg what is happening lol
i thought you couldn t hitch up a car if someone was inside it
it s always those guys with scat packs charger and 84month apr payment lmao
owner was in before the hook in most states that makes it an illegal hook i know technicalities but that s mostly what the law consists of
pay your bills
r whyisitalwaysadodge
doesn t pay bill it s my car bro
i thought you were driving a tank at first lol
this is a dangerous job geez especially in america one day they might run into a crazy who ll just shoot them
illegal tow because person was in vehicle not to mention gas pump nozzle he is very lucky no one was injured this could have ended very badly the tow truck driver should be fined at least
of course it s a charger
deleted
this approach seems highly dangerous people do mad things under pressure and trying to manoeuvre a ton truck in reverse to put a tow plate under a car seems a little dangerous
like the tune more plz
i don t have any respect for people who take on bills they can t afford but i got less respect for banks and repo men
pay your bills
just put bucks in gas for it to get towed lmao
its crazy people think this is ok not only are they putting people in danger and pulling some illegal crap at this point it looks like theft i get that if you don t pay bill it can happen but i ve never seen or heard of it happening in a public place
man pay yo carnote you knew what you was signing up for with that interest rate
dam tow truck driver s good
need more of the homie shit was funny
the tow truck driver with the stealth attack
i hope the repo man has financial hardship in his future
fuck tow truck drivers
suga boom boom
gothem the penguin has finally been apprehended the streets are safe
while the car is still running huh
pro move on the tow truck to take out the gas hose
smooooth very smooth
at least he let them get their things out of the car first
cool with the snatch but damn right while pumping gas is a kick in the balls lol
got eeeeeem
don t mess with the repo man
that s my car bro that s my car bro that s my car bro that s my car bro that s my car bro that s my car bro that s my car bro
this is illegal in some countries
suga boom boom is my new favorite tune
repooooooooo d that was pretty smooth actually
its always dodge owners who never pay their monthly dues
no chance
are these repo men
i dislike people don t pay bill but f repo man they are scum on the planet i have seen repo being dishonest and shady when doing their job to them money is money doesn t matter if they damage auto in the process because they can get away with it credit card don t need repo man they just simply raise interest if payee refused to pay send it to the debt collection that s it then their life will be even more difficult if they decide to make big purchases or move to another apt
i understand they are behind but first you re gonna literally tow the car while gas is pumping so not only is the tow driver reckless but apparently has no brain moreover you re gonna tow it with people in it and then leave them stranded what happens if a toddler or baby was inside sorry but this tow driver needs his license pulled asap and charged with reckless behavior fucking idiot
repo man
homie beat the hook on film
my aunt had her car towed repoed she always made sure to park her car in a place the repo tow wasn t allowed to enter so they waited and watched her until she left her car outside a friend s house snatched it up in the dead of night
why does it seem like it s always chargers getting repoed
sugar boom boom
they paid for the gas too hilarious
a lot of times it does
guy didn t make his loan payments on the new car so it gets repossessed until he does
repossession
you can t unless they have a court order and even then i am pretty sure you can t in most places
probably on a lease too not even to own lol
it s illegal to tow a vehicle with a person in it if the repo guy doesn t have a court order then they don t have to surrender the vehicle in most places a repo has to be peaceable if it isn t peaceable the repo guy is to blame if the repo guy has a court order they usually don t the vehicle person is probably going to get prosecuted for interfering with a lawful repossession signed former repo guy
well the guy kept saying it was his car meaning that the lady possibly wasn t also the owner so maybe the tow company had their own technicality to fall back on but i was wondering the same thing you were and that s my best attempt at devils advocacy
not always illegal to hook but definitely would ve been illegal to tow
repo men hate this one trick just get in your car lock the doors roll up the windows and sit you win usually if they move the car with you in it call and tell em tow driver is in all kinds of trouble if they try to drag you out that s assault but then you have to be willing to have more patience than the repo dude
well she aint an owner no more
don t overspend
plan cities so cars aren t a fucking necessity
this can happen with one late payment
get a car with 4wd
to be fair at what point are you the majority owner of the car if you ve paid 13k on a loan for a 15k car why is the bank still entitled to the full value of the car there s a lot of predatory behavior involved in the repo industry and repossessing almost fully paid off cars is essentially free money for the repo company and the holder of the associate credit default swap
disagree that s repo malpractice
yeah debt collectors too if my job entailed taking things from the poorest people i d have a very low opinion of myself
can t believe i had to scroll so far down to see somebody say this
why because these people didn t pay their car payment
found the low life who doesn t pay his bills
found the person who has been towed for parking in a fire lane or maybe unpaid tickets
probably snuck a tracker on it
until he does
until he does usually means the entire note once you re so far behind that they had to repossess the whole loan becomes due immediately
along with a freshly filled tank of gas that part had to cross deadbeat s mind that s why couldn t you have come minutes earlier
big shock it s a dodge
that s what you would think but it is more profitable of dealers to scam people into long term and high apr than leasing plus you do have to place a hefty amount if cash upfront when leasing ranging from to grand so it kinda discourage the low credit score demographic
you are correct i thought i was the only one who used to do this a lot of people don t understand how this works in the state i worked if the person jumped in you d have to let it go as well as the coo explained to me after this happened it turns into a breach of the peace
how can they repossess without a court order
could the repo man get away with it since they purposely jumped in while he way hooking wouldn t the owner or whoever jumped in be responsible for any injuries or accidents that happen
does not matter if was the owner or not it s enough that someone is in the car and has possession of it car was running and they did not check if anyone else was in the car what if they had a child in the car
don t live beyond your limits
you do know that at least in the us there are millions of us who never want to live in a city give me my mountain views along with our peace and quiet any day
i cant go to the store and pay most of the price of an item and then claim its mine
no quite the contrary i have an credit score people do have legitimate issues that arise and are temporarily unable to pay bills on time though hopefully you don t ever have any health issues or job shut downs or any other no fault of your own issues arise in your life everyone that gets behind in their bills is a low life have a great day
isn t
never had a vehicle towed in my life nice try though guys please dont downvote me my reddit post karma means the world to me i dont know what i will do if it gets to low
his mom will pay off a month then we ll see a similar clip in may
yup that s pretty much it depending on the loan agreement but let s be honest in most cases of repossession none of it gets reclaimed tvs furniture whatever
that is completely false
mine worked off a three strike rule i had to catch up on payments and cover repossession costs twice unfortunately i did it a 3rd time and they required to entirety of the loan be paid alcoholism made me drop really stupid responsibilities
oh yeah that s how they make their money but also the car itself they are going for a 40k or even more on a car like that you should already have in mind the payments aren t going to be cheap
you don t need a court order if a debtor is in default the lender can repossess the vehicle or bobcat or boat or trailer etc however it has to be peaceable a court order drags it out but puts the power of law directly behind it if a repo man does his job of the time he ll never meet the person whose vehicle they repossessed this guy in the video is an incompetent bozo imo
nope it s got to be peaceable it s the repo guy s responsibility if anything bad happens that s why you don t repo like this guy
yup most states don t allow for occupied hooks or toes so you have to get it and be gone before they can get in it if they beat you you gotta try again another time they just weren t smart enough to say i m not getting out end of story but i m a believer pay up or pipe down when the repo man comes doing his job as he s just doing his job trying to make a living i did it for just over a year for a tow company and it was only a small shitty part of the job people are total assholes to the repo guy like he s the one who sent himself after them and has a choice to just not do his job the screaming crying and even fighting isnt worth bucks an hour that you deal with i think that s why most repo guys are becoming private specialist instead of regular tow and impound yards
usually by now someone has come to the guy hasn t kept up with the payments defense redditt still does surprise me on occasion
my dad tells me that all the time i wish more people would follow it
after years we moved to the mountains i still drive to a city days a week

and in that moment i realized my father didn t love me and laughed at my pain years later in the therapy sessioon
future insurance scammer
future footballer for sure
children are manipulative assholes
and one day he ll be a professional soccer player
maybe i m overthinking it but for me this behaviour shouldn t be rewarded obviously it s very minor and innocent at this stage but the kid is trying to give the illusion of being hurt or perhaps even hurting themselves to get attention if this type of behaviour gets a positive reaction eg laughing and giving them the attention they desire it s going to teach them that positioning themselves as a victim is a way to get what they want which could lead to all kinds of negative behaviours later in life
young neymar
attention seeking behavior
insurance scams start younger and younger with every generation
future career victim
yellow card for sure
young george santos
he will be a great soccer or football player
he got consciousness too early

it s not a nice sight while the camera zooms in on his face
happened in he had to wait a few minutes but did get back in the race and finished in 60th place he took it in good spirits a complaint was made https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/colombia-complain-to-uci-as-junior-left-stranded-with-mechanical-at-world-championships/
i d be heartbroken too and feel a little betrayed by the people that were supposed to support me
not tdf junior worlds
that s fucked up that guy was heartbroken
hell of a job by the camera crew though
i would have started crying way before he did
that breaks my heart the tears of disappointment
what s the deal here were all of those cars supposed to stop and help him
i d be crying too if i trained this hard for something only to be let down by some incompetent person who s only job in this event is to support me
his team has some splaining to do
dude is metal those clipcless shoes for road bike are really hard to walk also f ck the service team your only job is to support and where are you
oh i can so just sit here and cry frt i feel for that guy knowing what he s had to endure to get there
training probably your whole life that this race and this happens how did he get no help
fun fact in its early years riders on the tour de france were not allowed to get help from anyone a rider once had to repair his wheel and was docked penalized because the farmer whose house he stopped at operated the bellows on the forge while heating up the wheel
they are savages just driving past my dude
this was in the uci world championships held in yorkshire england and not the tour de france
man i felt that i think we ve all had those moments
as a spectator this turns be off i know their reasons but i ll be damned if we shouldn t be better than this that guys self worth was destroyed that day
it s amazing how many cars are needed for a bicycle race
what s the point in driving a support car if you drive past the people who need it
i hope he feels better and tries again
i don t know about etiquette on these races but by car i d be whipping my bike at the windshield oh now you stop
the european teams always help each other out why not help out this colombian dude those teams just drove right past him while he breaks down
damn couldn t just throw a tire to the guy all bikers know the rule help a guy in need cuz you never know when it s you turn in need that s karma in life lessons
at that point i would just throw the rim in front of a service car
not the tour de france
not the tdf it was the junior world championship a few years ago
i don t know anything about how this works who was suppose to help him and how quickly feel bad for the guy busted his ass for years to get there
this was so sad
that s like a pit crew at the daytona he runs out of gas in wrong pit do you still fill up his tank
i want the names of every single driver that was supposed hep that man and didn t so they can get cursed that is terrible and with there negligence towards this poor guy
isn t the sole purpose of those passing cars is exactly for this scenario
every time a road cyclist cries a puppy is born with a smile sorry not sorry years on the pch and i ve never met a more rude or entitled subculture of people fucking juggalos are nicer than southern californian road cyclists
bro that legitimately made me feel terrible for this guy i hope he has an amazing day today whatever he s doing
i feel so bad man you can see the defeat and hopelessness in his face why did so many cars ignore him
dude i ve been there not in the tour but nevertheless watching months of training and effort dissolving to nothing just because of a flat tire
people suck help him you jerks
gif giphy 7sf5scgb2afrgsxp63 downsized
agony of defeat
i feel so bad for this dude
wish he would have thrown his bike a neutral fuck this sport it s so gone these days
if my grandma had wheels she d have been a bike
is this the english part of tour de france
imagine the heartbreak and frustration training all year managing to find sponsors to send you to france your bike breaks and you can t get the help you need i d be crying too guy is holding it together rather well
this is not in le tour de france but in the world road championship in yorkshire
so sad and the tv broadcasted it like a joke
poor guy really this sucks
me being last place in mario kart watching everyone pass me by again
this is the world championships i m sure someone else has mentioned that but definitely heartbreaking to see him not get any support
that s not the tour de france it s the world championships
why is nobody actually helping him this is painful
bro swap out front to back tire and ride a wheelie until you can flag down your team be a hero
i m also a man who waits too long to be serviced
was one of those cars supposed to help him or all of them i don t really know the rules for this
man that s terrible i feel for him
can anybody explain why the cars with bikes on top don t stop for him or what neutral service is i do not follow cycling but am interested
this was harder to watch than funky town
dropped
wasn t the tdf it was uci jr world championship road race op sucks
his team left him is so fuck
this was not during the tdf this was world s miss leading title
watching people die on the outside
mad props to walking as they say in halo finish the fight gif giphy 3osxyrgm8gi9cdjcpu
r watchpeopledieinside
this video makes a great sociopathy test if you can laugh at this mans pain your sense of empathy is fried for anyone not getting the full picture his team service car has seemingly abandoned him he was in the lead pack instead he finished the race 60th this is probably this mans livelihood and he has likely trained his whole life for this opportunity
the guy filming this probably put firecrackers in ant hills and waited to see if any ants would crawl out and then stomp on them
this video is so heartbreaking every time poor guy trained like hell just for this bullshit to happen i wouldn t even make fun of him for crying this was a huge moment for him and it got fucking ruined
on u sudden moment i d have thrown it in front of one of my cars
man that s so sad getting left behind no help that s just soul crushing
he jaist waints t rade s bike
fuck me all those people and vehicles following useless useless useless
did that motorcycle stop look back wait and leave when he got close
he s 1st place in our hearts he serves as motivation to others to keep fucking going what a champ
gif giphy ix8fgtabvcdpajhgge
that s really heartbreaking
give the man some fuken wheels how unsportsmanlike watch how many people stop for a damsel in distress needing a car tyre changed
it s the tour de france not some small bike race this young guy has been training his entire developed life for this exact moment and failed utterly by the people meant to support him absolutely disgraceful it would be as if a young tom brady was ignored by the person responsible for deflating his footballs during his first super bowl
all these cars going by where is the good sportsmanship
this is not the tour de france
bmw wagons everywhere wow
that s rough buddy
tour de walk
young lad probably one of his first if the not the his first major championship race knows his family and friends and country are watching can feel his position getting further and further away as he watches team car after team car pass by i d cry too
i almost want to cry for him that shit is terrible he just wanted to compete
that is really sad
not tour de france
god have mercy why didn t no one service this poor man stressed out and getting no assistance this poor man
poor bastard
this still breaks my heart the guy is going and spent many months prepping i read the story and it sounds like he s accepted what happened but still
worst moment of his life and a camera is glued to his face
i cant wait til people actually revamp sports to make them make sense so much senseless shit the viewer has to watch
when you re not from europe or usa the friendliest places in the world
dude i feel so bad for that guy he was probably like this is it this is my shot at success before this race only to be fucked by a flat tire dude i felt it when he started the frustrated and defeated cry
seeing him cry like that because nobody stopped to help made me tear up a bit i feel for that guy
why won t they stop
tbh as a fellow guy it makes me more sad to see when a man cries than seeing a girl cry
yeah seems like a dumb system
that was depressing

sucker punched himself to eternal shame
you just don t recover from that
i don t get it did he not make contact she didn t look phased at all
i love how she just keeps walking away and it s his friends that give him shit legend
y all remember that one scene from megamind where roxanne is chucking all of that stuff at metroman this is the real life version of that
this was me once i learned the hard way that punching was not going to be an effective way to defend myself i m really good at catching punches and twisting now and i m an artist with swinging club like objects too
that weenie broke his wrist
i normally am not a fan of videos of girls being hit but that was hilarious and gets funnier every time
i heard it make contact and someone said that hurt so bad not sure what happened
thats crazy
if the hit bounced off her shoulder he might have broken his hand lol
it was that or get beat up i didn t exactly have a trainer to throw punches learned on the job
looks like he may have hit her backpack so he may have just punched a ton of textbooks
literally you could ve given tips on how to defend yourself against people like that kid because you say you have the experience
so that s what it means to hit the books
no not that kid a lb lineman on the football team caught his kick to my face and made him dance on one leg for a bit edit she could have kept an eye on him as she left though

chasing views gonna get you in trouble actually super profound words that should be in a song
could have been worse he could have been shot like that dude doing a prank video on sunday
claims he s not chasing views goes on to describe how he chases views
fuck prank culture
i thought that old dude was going to say just kidding after scaring them with a lawsuit but nope not today
i d ve been long gone
get fucked stop bothering people just minding their own business
honestly i thought the old guy said he wanted to sue the kid just get him all nervous and freaked out then say it s just a joke young man didn t you think it was fun
https://i.redd.it/msvudfb0k8sa1.gif
if it were me i d call the da and ask him to talk with the judge to give the kid a year sentence soon as the kid flipped his shit we d all start laughing and say gotcha now get the fuck out of here
what a douche leave people alone the world isn t your oyster
sometimes when people are sitting alone and minding their own business you don t know what is in their head maybe he had to get out of the house because it reminds him of his wife that passed away two months ago maybe he is a vietnam vet that has ptsd and the last person who snuck up behind him he wrestled him to the ground and slit his throat maybe he found out he has terminal cancer and is writing his last will out on his laptop you never know what space people are in before computers and the internet i knew a guy who would drive into puddles on the side of the street and splash people walking on the sidewalk one day he splashed the wrong guy the guy was a lawyer who took him to court and sued him
this guy is such an idiot still trying to defend himself by saying it s just a prank up to the very end
i don t think personal injury will fly but i would buy harassment these pranks designed to annoy anger humiliate or even injure someone need to be stopped they aren t funny pranks are only funny when everyone ends up smiling and laughing all the bushman and living statue videos are a good example of that i could watch those all day
i feel sorry for the older man it s not just a prank sometimes people can be depressed or going through hard times and when a complete stranger pranks you and films your reaction just to laugh at you it can actually really hurt just leave people alone
personal injury lol
uh uh i just thought if i was a pain in the ass i would get away with it
good fuck this kid he seriously doesn t understand what he did wrong
old man i mean you re okay proceeds to sue them for harassment and personal injury old man sued him for personal injury old man wasn t even injured but i do agree with the old man about harassment
what would they expect from the comment section if it had gone the way they wanted did they want wow that guy got poked and when he turned no one was there oh my gosh he got pranked so hard he was doing something and had to take all his attention and focus on you lol hilarious
play stupid games and win stupid prizes
fuck this entire generation
refreshing to see a video where the police officer is the voice of reason i m sure they are in a lot of situations just doesn t show up on reddit often
how about growing the fuk up and stop being a cringelord
snowflakes come in all ages
fuck prank culture but also personal injury fuck regular culture too
shook his hand and stated he was okay still tries to sue him pretty toxic disproportionate response over a little thing
jesus when a cop gets it right and calls you on your bullshit and you can t admit it chasing views it aint even like that yes it was that s why you were recording i get the impression the guy using the word trolling was mostly just giving them a bit of bullshit back and scaring them
classic case of both of you are stupid no a shoulder tap prank shouldn t be a legal matter but also don t fuck with random people for content
i understand this kid is annoying but he didn t injure him in anyway or cause him any real distress i don t think the sue is gonna go well with the judges i might be wrong though
injury lol
they really need to pass a law for prank trends like increased punishment no use of social media for years all previous online content must be deleted and all profits forfeited disclaimer i m old
at first i thought this was some punkass teenager but this is a full grown adult such cringe man i ll never understand any of this
not only that but they are filming in a private property and showed the dude s face on the video
the old dude is now on the internet forever because of these arse wipes all he was doing was minding his own business i wonder if there should be some law that says if you were proved to have uploaded someone s image or likeness intentionally or otherwise you will be required to pay many thousands in reparation if successfully sued facebook twitter tictok and all reddit reposts would be immediately affected and everyone s privacy protected
while it s shitty to mess with people would you really go all out over a shoulder tap like if the guy actually scared him or did something actually damaging i d get that but it just seems like a little much
i m so tired of these fucking trends
r neverletthemknowyournextmove
this trend of tik tok pranks is going to get someone severely injured people are losing their tolerance for this sort of thing and depending on the type of prank a person could perhaps justify an aggressive self defense action regardless it just isn t worth the risk a woman in los angeles was recently injured and required hospitalization from as prank because she was an epileptic and passed out injuring herself if i remember correctly the investigation is ongoing and the posted video has been sourced police know who did it on top of everything else the cameraman can be sued by the victim for invasion of privacy and by the restaurant even if things get settled for litigation fees it will make the prank not worth it if the defendants were successfully sued or the case was settled their wages could be garnered until the damages were paid in full many job applications require listing any criminal or civil suits they have been a defendant in this could affect careers lastly the pranksters never know who the are pranking it could be an off duty cop it could be someone who has just had a really bad day and now has an excuse to go ballistic on the prankster or it could even be an attorney the attorney who sues you for eternity or the off duty cop who shoots you out of a self defense reaction one never knows these young adults are playing with fire and when they get burned they can be paying for it for a long long time it is time for people to grow up
all parties look stupid in this video of all the pranks going on that one is super mild but also everyone hates this shit so
would have been funny if the old man and the cops were like we re just fucking with you man and he got trolled but unfortunately this shit has gotten outta hand so people are drawing a line had a few jobs as a kid where we were pranking each other and the pranks always grew until the boss would have to put a stop to all pranks because someone would always go too far
hell yeah everybody should do this so maybe those prankster will stop fucking around
honestly dudes an asshole for saying harassment and personal injury when the guy said he s okay and shook his hand and walked away and then wanted to sue them like people don t know what to do with themselves anymore
that s a tired old person he s had enough of everyone s stupidity and doesn t want to be fucked with at all he s probably just trying to put his point across in a way that he thinks will work
after they shook hands i thought it d end there i skip about or seconds and a cop is there
personal injury
goddamn reading the comments one thing has become abundantly clear people on reddit don t like other people irl but do like to get together online and be all up in each other s business
hey here s a prank you get to talk to a judge
fucking narcissist man child
the idiot behind the tube channel classifiedgoons who got shot says it won t stop him from doing more pranks facepalm https://youtu.be/7tnewumcmoe
how old is this man child
wtf is wrong with people on reddit lmao
old guy must have been very delicate
i understand being bothered by this i understand being asked to leave but suing someone over a fucking tap on the shoulder is a bit overboard imo
not sure about the legal case personal injury seems like it would get thrown out as for harassment hmmm maybe a case any thoughts
they kill me with that my my store my safe my customers
you re okay man clearly not you old liar
fuck these guys
old man is overreacting like the comment section imagine calling the cops because someone tapped your shoulder
that escalated quick
everyone in this video is a douchebag just leave people alone no one wants to see you tap some guy minding his own business on the shoulder
na man i m just mic d up with a professional camera we weren t chasing views i hate these people fucking spoiled children all of them
look at that doofus wearing his tiny little shorts and his little pulled up socks fucking dooshcannon
i think we can all agree these tiktok pranks are stupid af that being said suing for personal injury cause someone tapped you on the shoulder come on man
not after views idiots
pretty pathetic what some people will do just to get attention
these grown ass men doing this a hole behavior are pathetic
tell the judge lol
that s a nice dunkin
that is the nicest dunkin donuts i ve ever seen
i really hope someone breaks this guys face
i hate pricks that do this prank shit i would rather befriend pond scum
old dude seemed so cool at first well not so much
tbh i get leave people alone or out of the pranks but to literally call cops and wanna press charges etc id of literally done what most police do and said honestly dont waste our time then left
i mean it s on video so we can plainly see that there is no injury this is just a nasty overreaction honestly but in all fairness it should always be expected that someone will not consent to your intent
https://preview.redd.it/gn98siuns7sa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0ad3ec969bcda27767b2bbfd7f54d7c656c7e50c he found the exit
tort laws for the old man wasting the courts time with frivolous suits personal injury isn t going to make you retire early old man that s a slam dunk case and you re looking to get rich quick shame on you
i m just trying to make sense of this incident there are so many people pranking and recording i do think that these guys were certainly on the mild side of a prank but it only escalates from there so the people who have escalated and walk threateningly up to strangers in the airport and accuse them of stealing their luggage and threaten to physically take it away if these kids cannot get away with this harmless prank behavior how is it that the others have not suffered the same fate they are pushing boundaries and i m sure there are people still angry at them how have they not been told to stop by the police and taken to court are they just able to avoid this in a large airport they are more wily than these kids i assume i can understand the kids hanging around because they felt that they really had not done anything and were totally surprised that action could be taken against them hell i was surprised
if everyone could do things the world would be a much better place keep your hands to your damn self mind your own damn business there i just solved world peace
at this point just make pranks illegal since everyone wants to be in a pissy mood
i like pranks but it s a gamble and sticking around is asking for trouble real pranksters should know this
don t fuck with detective crashmore
these guys aren t kids either they re grown men who should be having jobs and lives and they re filming themselves in fast food places trying to scare old people
good old americans always trying to sue everybody for every little thing i hope this country s economy goes down the gutters so they can t do that anymore
the prankster is a turd but the old guy c mon dude what a soft cock
i mean why the hell would they stay there after getting caught fucking around with people and sticking around long enough to get i trouble seems like they aren t the brightest
he is lucky he didnt get shot
sympathy zero let s hope the judge deems days of community service a suitable prank back on this idiot
in some jurisdictions this could be prosecuted as assault i m not sure if most prosecutors would decide to charge the kid but it is generally a bad idea to touch people without their consent
sadly the true solution for these kids is to get slapped hard by someone who doesn t appreciate being fucked with while they re relaxing at a donut shop this guy wouldn t do it to a biker but he thinks he can do it to an old man
i thought he would enjoy it like in what universe does anyone enjoy being bugged by an annoying wee arsehole when they re just trying to enjoy some food in public the cop had it right chasing views will only lead to trouble
sorry kiddos can t prank us older generation we just find you annoying af
i love when bad things happen to dipshit pranksters
for the love of god what possesses someone to go out into public and touch other people like complete strangers serves them right tbh i hope he sues
these aren t pranks
sue talk to the judge authorities called lol crazy escalation involving armed police for literally real reason this is why we laugh at americans
y all be acting like he planted a bomb chill out

he didn t buy the shirt
i had a make up yours shirt in high school school made me flip it inside out cause it said up yours on the back this kids shirt would have had me suspended
and who bought him the shirt
as a former lying to his parents kid this kid was lying mom was hella mad when the yearbook came out and i had a primus frizzle fry shirt on in 9th grade i cant remember how i lied to get out of it but she still mentions it
i don t believe kids his age now a days dont know whats going on with that shirt i had aol and k mart dialup and i still found porn when i was like i even somehow managed to get a porn charge on the dialup internet billed to the phone bill for a couple of hundred dollars not knowing wtf i was doing and my father not knowing how computers worked never understood how that happened actually not sure if he ever paid that bill or got out of it sorry rip dad
two all beef patties special sauce
well i do enjoy eating there
accidentally wore it to school so the kid just grabs random clothes that aren t his for school parent of the year material in this house s
sweet and sour sauce
why d they censor him saying shirt
what did he say in place of what i imagined was shirt to get bleeped
i had my have a nice day in detroit shirt taken by teachers simply cuz it had a smiley with a bullet hole in its head i miss that shirt
seeing as he s the parent bought it and it s fake
i saw that shirt at some flea market in and some kid grabbed it and his mom slapped his head and said no toques esa cochinada
if i was his dad id be cackling in the background
can i get a vaggie burger please
this is fake
i don t get it all i see is a mcdonald s logo
turn it inside out and get back to class
tell me your a trash parent wotm
i ll take a furburger and an order of thighs
oh that s funny
it took me about three seconds dont trust your periphery to identify shit
trashy parents too
the parents is just as shitty
let a girl of the same age wear a suggestive dick shirt and see the outrage
so does this poor kid not have any clothes that fit him that shirt is like three sizes too large
me as a teacher sees shirt excuse me one minute ducks into office to laugh hysterically ok you re not in trouble but we need to call your mom and have her bring you a new shirt otherwise every boy in school is going to need a change of pants
a little fucker lying his ass off
i miss my joe camel blanket that my mother wrapped me in at night
straight pimpin
nice shirt bro
i just cackled i have this as a sticker on my welding helmet at work
i remember when i wore an angry birds shirt that said flipping the bird on it
that s fantastic
i remember covering the top of a kappa logo and this is what you got good times
i need that shirt u keeleyleshae
why do they beep out the word shirts the kid clearly doesn t curse in the context of the conversation with his mom
why do they beep out the word shirts the kid clearly doesn t curse in the context of the conversation with his mom
no way he didn t know
does anyone else remember gadzooks and all their t shirts my favorite i had was one of those vintage looking athletic shirts that said titanic swim team i miss that shirt
ba rap ba bba baaaa
what a champion
currently a man formerly a boy i can speak from experience when i tell you that mfer s full of shite not buying the act little dude now change out of it and don t tell mom i laughed
i love this kid
now that is a happy meal boys that s the title of this video shirt
what in the whiskey tango
everyone knew nobody wanted to deal with it since it s just a joke t shirt
did they censor the word shirt
with a haircut like that he knew what he was wearing
liar
eat fresh
that s a great shirt tbh
mcdouble penetration
super dumb question why is that shirt in your house
i bought a t shirt in key west it had an anti coast guard comic calling them the water nazi s and their slogan was just one seed to make you bleed well my nephew raided my clothesline because it was cool adult shirt they made my sister go get him from school and gave him days suspension
he s lying you can see it in his mannerisms
i don t care about you guys but i am lovin it
she should get off her ass and get her kid a different shirt i hate people
reminds me of the time i was and really into golf so i bought a t shirt in ocean city md that said golfers aim straight for the hole my parents let me where it to school and they were clueless as was i about the sexual connotation
deleted
i ordered the same shirt when i was like i feel for this guy
my parents got me a few shirts like this as a kid because they were just at oblivious to double entendres
this kid did not think this was mcdonald s
gimme gimme that fish
that kid knew exactly what he was doing
why the beep
they all knew
when i was i wore a shirt to school that everyone thought was hilarious but i didn t get at all eventually one of the prudish teachers decided to send me to the dean s office the dean forced me to wear a sweater covering the shirt or they would send me home the shirt said big hands big feet you do the math i totally believe this kid because i was this kid
dummy should have ordered a mcdouble
his fake id said his name was mclovin
smells like a mc fillet
sir this is a taco bell
would you like to super size that
not a fillet o fish
mcstuffin
i had a mount and do t shirt
he just said that he got in from a basket with boys clothes probably after gym or something lost and found shit you know
i loved primus in high school and saw them live back in the day twice frizzle fry was such a weird album
your dad knew how it happened the things parents know about their kids but don t share that they know protects the kids from feeling shameful at a young age it s a catch cause they feel the shame much later on don t sweat it rip your dad
sounds more like they gave away lost and found clothes and he picked up this shirt it s a harmless shirt don t get your panties in a wad
was wondering that too im betting it s to stop the censor bots or whatever from thinking it says shit i don t understand how the internet went from ogrish com to being afraid of saying a word that sounds somewhat similar to shit
this shit right here needs ya god damn upvote what do you think you are doing scrolling past this shit i d give you gold but i m broke and i need to buy crack
it s a prostitute with her legs spread open
it sounds like he messed up his shirt and got that one out of a spare bin inside of the school
i mean based on the video where he clearly states he grabbed it from a bin of clothes it s not his normal clothes he probably found this shirt in a pile of donations at his school that none of the teachers checked for inappropriate stuff and kids don t exactly care about shirts fitting properly he just likes mcdonalds
truth lol
know what i m getting you for father s day now
right i could not imagine picking out a legit mcdonald s shirt to wear when i was a young boy lol
why does that make me incredibly uncomfortable
the parents were all in on it
i want to believe it was school picture day
man i m and that still took me longer then i d like to admit to notice kid had no clue
well are the rumours true
not a mcdicken
mhhmm and it was crispy too
tastes like chicken nuggets

this video clip has its own grandchildren
sometimes i ll start a sentence and i don t even know where it s going
i personally believe that us americans are unable to do so because i am part of this fifth
did she say like the irag and everywhere as such and
i believe the us must have lost all of their maps and therefore they cannot find anything on those maps thank you
bringing out the classics i see
perfect candidate for politics
that was definitely one of the answers to a question there has ever been
i agree with her
did anyone else see the smoke coming out of her ears while her cpu overheated from the complexity
south carolina s next republican congresswoman
i personally believe that
this never gets old lol
i wonder what she looks like now these years later
well being pretty is very time consuming other things clearly took a back seat
where is she today this clip is old af
a classic never get tired of it ms south carolina has left quite a legacy
mario loved the answer
epic clip mario lopez smirk as she was finishing sums it all up
facts
mario lopez is a saint i would have busted up laughing looked at the judge with a glare that said ain t no way y all are letting her past this round right then after that i would have given her her old billy madison response https://youtu.be/5hfyjsqahl0)
it really is sad watching such a young lady have a stroke on live tv
asking questions is no fair it s supposed to be a beauty contest
didnt she go on the amazing race tv show after this
it s a video to help south africa and iraq and such as have maps to help the americans such as find iraq on a map and slater is impressed
jimmy kimmels breakdown of this on youtube is worth looking up probably last time he was ever funny
it was a trick question
what you ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
at least she s pretty
where is she now and how does she reflect on this moment i need a follow up vid
the answer to why we aren t so great any more is always immigrants and minority groups
well at least she s pretty
is that mgt as a teen
goddamn that was a disaster did she do nothing but suck dick in high school
thats chanel west coast from ridiculous
thank you please show this to your kids so they can study and not sound as uneducated as ms south carolina
ol tammy lasagna
because a fifth of americans are too young to be able to do so what s the correct answer
man it had to be brutal when she hit the age wall

caite upton still smoking hot today
great answer
when you don t need your trophy wife to think
yes yes that was awesome
is that ivanka
this poor girl was utterly humiliated by this whole experience suicidal even i feel sorry for her
i wonder do some americans think africa and iraq are like down in south america
south carolina in a nutshell
wow i never saw this before
do you ever have a dream where you you when you when
wow
spot on for sc lmfao
it s amazing how her lips never touch
it s a good thing she s cute
when mario said alright what he really meant was stop
she s probably by now
me getting caught off guard by a question when in meetings
sounds like joe bidens daughter or some shit
have to give her credit for handling a stroke on live tv with such grace
how did he not laugh
and those grandchildren are hot and dumb af
but it never gets old
wayne gretzky
i believe she did yes
she went on the today show a couple of days after this to clear things up and did almost as bad
iraq
this is from the old nets i for one am glad to see the nephews are still rolling this one out its an all time gem
she s a real estate agent in california and tweets a lot about antivax horseshit so kinda on brand with our previous president
yes yes she has a couple nice points i mean made a nice point
your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart
you spelled democrat wrong

in her s
michael scarn
oof this was a good one lol
tsk god damnit that one is entirely on me lol im gonna think about this the entire drive home
surprised you could spell it at all
they don t do that there
i guess not to be confused with kate upton a fellow model
dwigt
lol i especially like the part where she decided that the us should be doing more to teach irag and african people about maps oh boy
i need to go through a day in life being this stupid it has to be a new adventure every time they leave their house lol

any abstract school subject vs fun game to watch or play this is a foregone conclusion
this just sucks don t trap kids into interviews that upward inflection to the statement clearly suggests he said that like is that the answer you wanted did i do good this is just low low low
what is the motive here what this little interview for so when holding a microphone please don t eat candy
desperate
political gotcha content has always been trash but targeting innocent kids is a whole new level of cringe
there s a special place in hell for those who do tiktok interviews like this in public
i m not sure why the dude interviewing was surprised he was implying the kid didn t like black people anyway because he picked a fun game over a boring ass history lecture
this interview will be used against him in years s
eating candy during an interview i don t like this guy either buddy
the boring subject i just barley learned about in school or the fun game i play with my friends tough choice
if you ask stupid questions be prepared for stupid answers
why is this even a choice wtf does baseball have to do with black history month
that poor child
that was perfect reminds me of my nephew when he gets confused and just says whatever
why is he trying to bully that kid
that dude is garbage
too many syllables vs funtime thing during gym class
i m black and i hate everything about this
i see a set up for failure response leave kids alone
i mean he gave the dude the answer he wanted to hear
is for tiktok isn t it
when a kid hears black history month all they hear is history and that s hard work baseball on the other hand sounds fun now you got the kids attention
i would choose baseball
the correct answer was jackie robinson
this kid is spitting facts
omg u should not get a lil kid to answer that that s messed up
holy shit this cuts off way too soon i need to know if that dude choked on his candy i need to know how the country folk in the back reacted i need the sequel
hey kid do you prefer something you enjoy or something you may have heard of as a school subject you picked baseball the fucking audacity
based
based kid
his father back there like thats mah boi
this shit was fucking funny
based
leave kids alone goddammit
when you try to trap children with gotcha interview questions for content you bettr be prepared for whatever comes out their mouth
he is now canceled for life poor kid
bro doesn t even know he exists yet don t ask him shit like this
i m so sick of tiktok nerds thinking it s ok to stop people for random interviews
baseball beats black people
any kid given a choice between a game they like and anything with the word history in it is going to pick the thing they like every time
the obsession with race in that country is going to really weird places it seems like they re never going to move on
because black history month is pretty shitty at telling black history anyhow it s more about claiming victimhood than celebrating black accomplishments
if i was i d probably say the same thing lol
why would you ask a kid that what a piece of shit adult
asking a kid if they would rather learn history or play a game then acting surprised when they pick the game
i sent this to my coworker whose am african american baseball fan and he s said and i m quoting him i d take a any sport over black history month
you re ambushing a kid into a controversial discussion while eating candy into the mix and wearing house slippers out in public i can t imagine why you couldn t find an adult to take your interview seriously
i bet most black people would also choose baseball over blm
i see this boy subscribes to the ask stupid questions get stupid answers school of thinking
fuck that guy kids don t understand the social issues to have this conversation you know because their kids
proud papa in the background
you can hear the kid say that at the end like he s asking a question then look at the guy while smiling he was likely told to say this race obsessed political zombies in this post eating it up though blaming the kid blaming the parents blaming society zero awareness at how they are being played
i d pick baseball too i d rather learn about history based on timelines location not races
this videos is dumb and the comments
ha that s what you get for hasslin a little kid man just a funny video obviously the guy doing the interview has a sense of humor kids say funny stuff when pressured chances are he would have said the same thing if you would ve asked him to choose between baseball and or world history i ll state the obvious though it s ok to like baseball history is actually cool too you shouldn t hate black people or any person b c of their skin color that s just silly black people don t hate baseball etc and so on black history month is actually very cool i did a research project a while back just for fun and learned a bunch
okay this seems pretty bad but you must ask yourself what is going on in that boy s mind so i m going to outline what happened here the black guy asks the child a seemingly innocent question about whether he prefers black history month or baseball the boy chooses baseball but the black guy presses on asking why he is choosing baseball over black history month going so far as to ask what about black people so i think the black guy is leading the conversation in a way that could be seen as biased by immediately connecting the boy s preference for baseball to a potential dislike of black people the black guy may have unintentionally put the boy on the defensive causing the him to respond with i don t like black people as a means to justify his preference for baseball what the he said probably doesn t reflect his true feelings about black people but it s probably a reaction to being put on the spot by that black guy s line of questioning people need to know that children often lack the communication skills to articulate their thoughts and feelings in the same way that adults do and this conversation may be a result of that this is why we shouldn t hold children accountable in situations like these for what they said we might say hey you can t say that that s rude but we shouldn t punish them for a simple mistake like that so yeah i think his approach may have played a significant role in prompting the boy s response
i prefer baseball too
what s political about black history month
lol so the kid doesn t like black people who cares as long as he is not going to be an ass about it when all grown up its fine by me
i don t like black people his parent s sphincter just went zip
lol he is so young he likes baseball not black people kids are very black and white the concept of liking something more vs just not liking something as much is not something they grasp at such a young age and the adults standing there are laughing because they are likely parents and know better my daughter loves blue it s her favorite color so she immediately thinks she hates pink when put against blue but almost all of her clothes are punk and picked out by her
i cannot stand the gotcha interviews the legit media companies do this and it should be considered dishonest propaganda you can sucker the public into saying what ever you want to support your narrative
i d pick baseball too since one is fun and the other isn t
history or baseball
because fuk u that s why
anddd hes cancelled for life
i mean it is funny though i think anyone with a brain can see that the kids reasoning is that he does like baseball and doesn t have much of an opinion on black people because he doesn t think about race the same way most kids don t think about race he is saying well i like baseball and i don t have an opinion on black people
maybe the child knows that dispersing the importance of black history over a whole month just waters down the importance of it all or he just likes baseball
op whats political about black history month
r adultsarefuckinstupid
the adult needs a kick in the azz
he is a racist who happens to be black
it s a kid not a call out good grief that was poorly handled
dude he is a little he does not understand he thinks what he likes more he likes baseball i don t think he meant to say he hates black people
why do you think black history is political
respect that kids opinion and move to another simple as that gif giphy 4givr6cmys8jc
based kid
this kid was probably fine with black people until he was put on the spot
think any child would take lgbt drag shows over fun either
what about white history month
reddit again full of boring people who think every joke is an attack on somebody
fuck you for trying to make a kid feel bad don t care what color gender or whatever the fuck you are you limbic fuck
according to this dudes logic if you like anything more than you like black people you re racist sounds like he thinks his race is superior to all other races it s like he s the racist
this is asking a kid if they would like to play a game or watch a documentary
r tiktokcringe
i said something like that when i was a kid too they laughed about it and we still talk they knew it wasn t my fault kids just repeat stuff they shouldn t even understand the concept of hateing another person at that age unless you re raised by a hateful parent
not ok to film littles embarrassing themselves bad enough when actual parents do it
well because of black people he has extra history to study issa joke
cuz learning about peanuts is more boring than playing ball
dont put some innocent kid on your dumb tiktok channel asshole i would go fucken ballistic
all interviewers like this are trash that s a given but why did the parents allow this almost encouraged it even shame on them
he means he doesn t like it as an interest like it s not a hobby poor kid this is dumb
and thanks to the internet that kid is probably never going to forget this
black people play baseball too
if i was asked something this dumb while shopping i m saying the same thing
what kid gives a fuck about any kind of history
in years this poor kid is gonna get fired from his job when this resurfaces
black history month is a joke let s take a made up construct like race and focus on this made up structure for one month out of the year i say this as a person with more melanin than some others and as a person who loves history from all eras and walks of life teach children to enjoy learning about the past without race they ll focus on the events and then they won t be able to get enough
the interviewer should be fired

see those long ribbons they are there to tie the rings to so this doesn t happen the pillow maker literally built in a way to keep this from happening because kids
i mean the real idiot here was whoever decided this was a good idea
if there s ever someone destined to work for ups it s this little g walked up delivered the package damaged the load and just fucked off without a care in the world it was inspired
sell a kid buy rings
kids are deceptive little fuckers that was on purpose
i always thought you put fake rings on the pillow for this exact reason
that was no accident that kid saw a path to christmases and took a shot
ah this is the last bit where frodo drops the rings into the deck of mordor
kid did her job and go back to her life lmao
this is why children are only trusted to throw flower petals at everyone
well no fuckin shit what genius thought that wouldn t happen
you can literally see the moment the wedding planner with the clipboard crapped her pants
as soon as i saw the deck i knew where this was going
and we still don t know that the rings go to the best man s pocket and the ring bearer is only symbolic also why it s important to choose a really good best man
r kidsarefuckingstupid
make him pay
i guess only the audience needs masks
he was just a lil nervous
get the crowbar we re ripping this wood up
when i was a ring bearer in my earlier years apparently i flipped the pillow upside down and was swinging the rings from side to side because i was bored
someone call ramona quimby
his name is not frodo that much is true
this is why the ring bearer gets a pillow with fake rings sewn into the pillow top
who doesn t tie the rings onto the pillow seems like a bit of a set up you wouldn t take a chance with real jewellery and kids
you had one job
adds to the old adage the only important thing is the i do s everything else just adds character to the ceremony
you had one job to do
did they really use the music from up for their wedding kinda cringe
sell him
true but really you don t give the kid the real rings let them have some nice looking fake jewelry that looks good from a distance and have the best man hold onto the real ones
i did not know that and i ve been married nobody teaches you these things there s no manual or anything
i was just coming to say that had my rings knotted so tight it took us a second to get them off
yea at my wedding the priest had the rings and there where fake ones on the pill just for this reason
if i cant marry then i wont let him too
could be wrong but i think they re a boy
came here to post this
that lady with the clipboard is potentially a wedding coordinator and she probably would have known this and should have shared that info but then we wouldn t have this video so alls well that ends well
there literally are several
there s probably a wiki how or two

understanding this means i spend way too much time on reddit
i was waiting for it to not spray and then throws it on the fire lol
it s in orbit around the earth now
am i the only one who hasn t seen wall e since i was a kid and am just now realizing that this scene is actually that scene
but you said the poor bastard was dead or does he talk to the dead

seriously thought that s such a beautiful baby
i think she s saying fuck it lol i know she s not but it sounds like it and damn she s adorable lol
i think she thought she was saying not perfect colorfully
there are some who want everything perfect and then others who just say fuck it

literally nothing wrong with it
reddit moment
i know right what the hell is with reddits freak fixation on hating children bunch of neck bearded incel basement dwellers i swear man
i think it s that a lot of redditors have poor social skills and are lonely so it s anger towards people that are living a life they can t seem to get for themselves
most of reddit wasn t loved by their parents or had good family dynamics so they project that on everyone they meet they view that as the inevitable outcome of kids so to them you re doing some sort of disservice by bringing a child into the world they can t wrap their minds around anybody having a decent childhood they also can t fathom being responsible for anyone other than themselves

that s just part of his dance routine they just took it the wrong way
what triggered him
he was dancing as a distraction
r abruptchaos
that s not how a dance fight is supposed to work
in seconds
i think the guy was laughing at him as he danced over which pissed him off
what was pink sweater guy doing
this has scorned lover beef written all over it
what gay bar was this at
nope he didn t won t to dance peacefully something you don t do when you to dance peacefully is start punching everyone in the room
this reminded me of how kangaroos fight it s an unusual combat style
wow powerful windmill technique there
drake had beef with these guys
fighting around a lit hookah is a brave choice
war dance
whats the name of the song playing
it s a slap fest
oh wait is him dancing with his shirt up like that subtly saying he isn t armed
this is like some gay club
ah the wonderfully chaotic world of party drugs
deleted
didn t look like he had a target maybe he was just under the influence of drugs
not moonchin again
there was an attempt in fighting manly
nobody puts baby in the corner
not how i thought that was going to go
drake be dancin
it doesn t look like there was an attempt
the guy he swung on is curtis from bad boys los angeles
ah yes the infamous drunken fist
oh that s ho wtf
lmao all the slapapaps
he ask for the hookah and the other guy said no dominicans dont play with the hookah
cat fights hit different when i was younger
he was mesmerized like a cobra and snapped out of it at the last second
he went from chillin to mosh pit in second flat
proper dance battle
yo
he throws hands like he dances
the guy he attacked tongue stabbed his left cheek in a pantomime blowjob dancer took this as disrespecting his sexuality and sought justice with his fists
it s part of the choreography
i love how his friend just spits out all his smoke in reaction to the punches
sneak attack
dance like a girl punch like a girl
was that tyler the creator in the edge there
when you see your ex
r publicfreakout
there clearly wasnt
r unexpected
he waited for the beat to drop
gay clubs in atl are wild
this reminded me how cats start fighting just randomly
never let them know your next move
he did him dirty dancing
this is literally how cat fights start
drake jumpscare
natalie nunn so you know there will be drama

my guess is that he had pre existing beef with that guy and just used his dance to get close enough without suspicion
somebody posted about this in the subreddit op stole it from basically everybody here is reality tv producers and actors apart of some show they have on their own weird reality tv website and this is staged
he was lifting his shirt up someone probably talked some shit
top anime betrayals
had to double check to see what sub i was on was surprised when it wasn t that one
yeah that seems to be the most likely reason
cat fighting haha
might have been a gay strip club by the way he was acting
with risk of permanent banishment having never visited a gay bay i would imagine this is every gay bar
they need to time this to a breakdown
chris brown under the influence
i think just really bad at throwing punches
seductively
that s cowardly be a man and introduce yourself then formally challenge the opponent and make a huge bet staking a large reward this way everyone is entertained you gain honor you win big if you win at all
there was an successful attempt to get closer without suspicion
he was waiting for the drop
seems like aberrant speculation my guess is that gentleman never tipped his coffee barista then they crossed paths we can all speculate or perhaps it was a land deal that went wrong
slap them across the face with your glove
my name is inigo montoya prepare to die
lmao
you bet on the opponent then take a dive first round easy money
there are groups of people who move in specific ways according to their traditions for instance if someone winks with their left eye in a specific way pay attention i ve seen something very similar to this video and it seems like that might be a factor speaking from prior experience for what it s worth
they re all gaining up on this one dude something tells me they wouldn t have the same honor
real friends to come for each other and he was surrounded by real friends
reminds me of kratos vs hercules in god of war expectations everywhere and they eventually all get demolished and our good boi kratos comes out on top

gif giphy 3o6zt4hu9uwxmxsaui
the doggies left the room they knew this wouldn t end well
grabbed the one spot your literally not supposed to
i will never understand why people think these are safe to use future injury just waiting to happen
it physically hurt me to watch that
a car like that and they don t take every single precaution heck my buddy s old focus would ve gotten more attention than this
what was the thought here why isn t there someone inside or some kind of curb on the end of this ramp this place looks professional i just don t understand
corvette for anyone wondering
two crimes here what they did to this car taking a landscape video and recording it portrait
well it s definitely unloaded
okay so this exact same thing happened to my father in law a few years back the driver owner calmly said ok so i have insurance to cover this nothing to worry about your car will be out of commission for a bit i know and i will cover a rental for however long it takes the only thing i ask is that you please don t give me a bad review my father in law looked at him and simply said one thing at a time buddy
so he s throwing a fit after this happens but i m not exactly sure how he expected any different outcome
when you lie on your resume
any professional would use a winch to back the car to the right spot
well they finally did it they killed my fucking car
i didn t know amazon drivers delivered cars now
someone s getting paid
they should just prop it up on some cinder blocks and put in reverse with the throttle down for a few hours that should correct any issue that may have occurred
not like it s a classic car or anything
i m no trucker but should a winch be used in this situation
shouldn t have picked the express delivery option
it ll buff out
that chock was so tiny
how is that supposed to go down when there s no one to apply the brakes
it s like watching an animal species go extinct it s such a shame
gif giphy d7rvf20pqnugksqghf not the vette
well at least it was the old car that he dropped and not one of the shiny new expensive ones on the bottom deck
i m not a car oligist but isn t that bad for the suspension just saying
is the hubcap coming off the equivalent of someone dying when their shoes come off from a fall
it was like that when we picked it up
that delivery company better have some damn good insurance
absolute knobhead
the biggest oof
so why is this idiot unloading the car by himself
shocks tested not as great on those older models
that fucking sucked i feel for the guy when he said fuck i felt that
i would ve cringed less for a brand new lambo or ferrari that was just criminal negligent homicide
just dropping the car off the lift
hello mr george how much you pay for the new guy
i don t think there was an attempt to safely unload the car lol
i really hope he didn t end his life over this i know i would have those thoughts i ve been there before tore up the fender on a customers lambo
i love those cars i m against the death penalty but sometimes it s not easy
it was a car but with a little bondo
watching that is like getting kicked in the nuts
if you are going to screen record please crop it before posting anybody else agree
i literally gasped what the actual fuck
the craziest part is this truck is from a company that specializes in transporting classic cars most of them have insurance on each truck so they can pay for any damages to the car i know reliable carriers has mil of insurance per truck still what a gut punch
oh god no
anyone else reminded of ferris bueller s day off
r thatlookedexpensive
that s going to leave a mark
nailed it
this video needs more letterboxing
could ve even pulled up to that loading down dock right there that even had a ramp down
this needs to be crossposted with r thatlookedexpensive

shoulda been in there ready to press the damn brake geez
goodbye rear axle
whatever mileage we put on we ll take off we ll drive home backwards
hurt my soul nice old vette
i m a grown man and i m crying
r thatlookedexpensive
that ll buff right out no problem
to someone who knows cars is this an easy repair or is it more difficult considering the age of the car
what the hell did this guy think was going to happen
i m no mathematician but i don t think it s supposed to be delivered like that

honestly that went better that i thought it would
let s just push a car that s in neutral down a ramp and onto a platform that has a downward ramp on the end and hope a single tiny mini ramp block will stop it brilliant
such a gorgeous machine looks like it was just reworked or was extremely taken care off shit happens but not like this come on man
if hubcaps equate to shoes then it might be ok only one came off
what did they think was going to happen better yet what was supposed to happen
might as well clock out and grab a beer you sure af aren t clockin back in
was it in neutral also this whole system seem really dumb to many possible issues to even list a bunch of dummies if you ask me

if that s what i think it is a polo white corvette convertible then i do t even know what to say really
it has two different wheel so it was already totalled s
it s funny because i know this car belongs to some grey haired golf playing chooch
always nice to see an idiot lose
who forgot to put the parking break
wouldn t worry about it
this video takes up 9th of my screen crop your shit before posting
still in better shape than a modern car that hit a speed bump faster than mph
not one got hurt i don t see the problem
if that much of an idiot doesn t deserve the car
deleted
somebody lied on their resume
oh man that sucks
if it was me i would have lowered the ramp
please post part two
well it s fucked now fire it up and go drive it like shit box civic
it s down
that will buff right out no worries
don t worry captain we ll buff out those scratches
it actually held up quite nicely way better than many modern cars would have anyway
i might have sacrificed my leg painful either way
noooooooo not the i think
aaaaaaaaaand totaled
looks like that was the plan we ll just give it a shove
that will buff out
their website is pretty cool
so the plan was to put it in neutral get out and push it back towards the ramp only for it to be stopped in position by one measly wheel chock i don t know what to say
ouch a year old classic and like most other things destroyed by an idiot
had a driver do this to a jag e type that was getting dropped to our shop luckily it was half way down when it happened but it still crushed the quarter panels

idk why but the word forbidden makes me laugh because i imagine the cop saying in like an ancient aztec voice it is forbidden to consume the vod of ka
solid effort not gonna lie gotta respect it
could someone explain why he s pouring it all out is alcohol not allowed on beaches
they sound like damn seagulls
you might be an alcoholic if you need to dive to the ground to get at best a gulp
she s a keeper
there s an aa meeting in her future
looks like we found an alcoholic
i need her number
i m just kwirky like that
trashy
this is the best caption
and this is how i met your mother
you would think that they realize that they might have a problem
when your whole personality is that you like alcohol
step we admitted we were powerless over alcohol
wow that s really sad that someone s that desperate for alcohol
damn that chick was thirsty af xd
the yak effect
my job sucks
she thirsty
so that s what happened to vodka sam https://nypost.com/2013/09/02/worlds-drunkest-girl-vodka-sam-just-blew-a-341-and-tweeted-about-it/).
that henny
where is this if anyone truly knows and it s not reposted in california your not supposed to drink alcohol on the beach but i ve never seen anyone be reprimanded like this
it s dumb as fuck when you can t drink on a public beach
florida
looney tunes type shit
aw now she s all sticky aw now i m all sticky
i hope she doesn t find any guy taking a piss in a bush
my ex wife
she is definitely a beach volleyball player
woman thinks she ll look cool if she gets a few drops in her mouth
wonder what she would do for a klondike
if there s no camera that girl is gonne get more than drunk
lmao they are literally like animals squawking birds of some sort flocking to catch their nutrients
he s probably thinking this is one of those rare days where his job doesn t suck
i think it may be hennessy the liquid is brown and the bottle seems the right shape but it s hard to see if that s the case this was pretty fuckin expensive and i don t blame her at all lol however that s why you don t bring it in a glass liquor bottle to the beach that doesn t allow glass or liquor
i read that in kratos voice lmaoo
i imagined it being forbidden for actually being someone s piss in a bottle that he s pouring out
every beach has its own rules some allow alcohol some don t some enforce aggressively some don t
it s because it s in a glass bottle probably
no glass on the beach no alcohol too but that s why you use thermoses and mugs
glass bottle on the beach probably maybe they have a confiscate on sight or maybe it was a minor caught and they are destroying it and the girl dove as a joke to her friends no clue could be a lot of things cops are unpredictable and arbitrarily enforce laws different all the time lol so its impossible to know
many beaches that are popular for spring break like in florida do not allow any alcohol on the beach during the month of march
its called not wasting booze
gif giphy j2hwoqym7fykpibjhj downsized
would bang
or we might have incredibly stupid laws if cops get to steal your booze for literally no reason but just because we said so american booze laws are asinine
she might be an alcoholic that is a red flag
deleted
what
he s probably thinking good thing the cam is recording or my wife would be so mad
and that s why it still sucks
she s stupid
same lmfao
thanks haven t been to the beach since i was a kid i remember because i got to ride a donkey
it s a glass bottle i d assume that s why they got called out where i live they aggressively hunt down glass on the beach and don t care about cans unless you re being openly moronic
deleted
i m guessing she bought it since that appears to be a bottle of hennessy i d dive too that shit ain t cheap lol
blablabla atleast they have less of a drinking problem
she might also have daddy issues and not want to be told what to do which might be a red flag or a giant neon sign depending on what one is into
she s more likely just got a sense of humor you not being able to see the difference is a red flag
jokes can be trashy too
you think that s how wives work
anyone who spends on a bottle is a fool that s for damn sure lol
yup my thought precisely i m sure they were far more concerned about the glass one broken bottle can hurt a lot of people
wtf have you been to every beach ever and checked
she might also just like to have fun
right they don t work at all thanks i ll be here all night
deleted
dog house now
no you clearly do not at least outside of your incredible narrow minded assumption of your local laws glass has been outlawed at certain beaches for decades by this stage if you re curious why smash a glass bottle bury it in some sand and then jump up and down on it to find out the fun fact why they do outlaw glass on beaches often
deleted
why do you assume i m talking about the us that s one country out nearly total now that s a narrow mind set i m talking from personal experience in a country not the us i know for a fact the us itself has laws about this and it s common in other countries with severe littering laws because any infractions could directly affect their tourism which beaches are a very large part of
never been to a country where that was true in the eu and uk beaches are public soil so you drink wtf you want yes you get fine if you litter same as everywhere else and boy do many countries here depend on tourism obv private resorts have different rules but they aren t enforced by police in the few asian and african countries i have been to not the case never heard of that from south america i could be wrong but it doesn t seems likely for brazil so which countries are you talking about can you give an example

italian chef and macaroni cheese should not even be in the same sentence
damn who pissed off italian adam sandler
gino d acampo and his two friends messing with each other they re all having some fun he was a regular on this show i like him because he s playful about it there s nothing more obnoxious than italian whos being serious and acting like only their food is good like jesus get out and see the world
for starters it a penne pasta not macaroni and whatever cheese that is it s not a powder you can pour out of a pouch
i never get tired of this one
let s give credit where credit is due the hosts genuine lmafooooo reaction is what really makes the clip
if you just take away the cheese macaroni then put in some curry it s just like a curry
not to be that guy but this has been reposted almost daily usually in uk subs he s funny as hell in the road trip series with gordon ramsey and french coat taker
for anyone taking this too seriously this is his schtick it s fun they intentionally say stuff like this to wind him up and he reacts wound up because it s fun for all of us and you know it s a tv program intended to entertain not a class at cordon bleu
for anyone wondering why the hosts are doubled over with laughter and you can even hear the crew bursting at the seams british slang for a loose woman is a bike as in she s the village bike everyone s had a ride chef accidentally called his gramma a ho on tv edit i ve been told i am wrong mea culpa maxima

well i mean they are all colleagues though just razzing one another i was hoping for some gordon ramsey level explosion but he wasn t genuinely upset by it but you can put ham on it at home
that was a good laugh i needed that today
no fresh tomatoes to peel and smash for your tomato sauce that s fine get that ketchup bottle out bc both are red and made with tomatoes so they re the same thing flavorings and all

famous last words before death by stab wounds
this is the kind of content we need on this subreddit can we stop fucking socio politicizing this shit please i ve seen way way too much sociopolitical polarizing on this subreddit lately
in britain the town bike is slang for a promiscuous woman because anyone can have a go that is why the hosts lose it when he calls his gran a bike
what is a british carbonara mei cojoni british carbonara oh yes next plate amatriciana with ketchup you sterilised bottle of sparkling water
considering the fact that british slang puts a whole different spin on his bike comment this is like back to back ridiculous comments
as a french i relate to this feeling so much we respect food and drinks you don t mix coke with red wine in front of a french if you don t want a thorough explanation on what a monster you are you don t tell an italian you love carbonara with cream or whatever this nonsense is and expect no reaction there is of course nothing wrong with adapting recipes or cooking anything you like just don t call it like a respected dish and frankenstein it
i think its funny the guy is like im glad you are closer because i think he knows he wants to smack someone
the look of offense in his face sent me
that way he looked at her i can t handle that
these italian dudes and food treat that shit like religion
how is ham crazy in this it s just like some mac and cheese right not some authentic italian recipe
he s just being polite the original italian version of this saying is if my grandpa had three balls he would have been a flipper
well i m glad they didn t die from laughing and choking looooool for the record i make carbonara often giada s recipe and if you haven t had italian carbonara you re missing out the tricky part is emulsifying the combination of olive oil egg yolk mustard and lemon but once you get that down you re golden
thegreatbatsby yeah i mean that s from a british news source look i didn t mean to get everyone s knickers so twisted that they can t laugh i didn t realize that you guys were so sensitive about this completely unfounded need to produce a news article saying its untrue not at all overreaction to this false propaganda i was just hoping for some giggles i would ve replied to the comment but i was blocked immediately after they posted the british article about how brits have the best teeth
italians losing their shit over pasta pizza infractions is an absolutely timeless genre
this is a personal opinion i do but i put maple syrup on my mac and cheese dont judge mee
god i hate the snobby italian chef type everything has to be made exactly to your own specifications or it s objectively wrong who made you the arbiter of food if you want everything to be exactly how it has been traditionally made then give north america all of its tomatoes back
you can drive your fiat through rome on two wheels at kph and no one will bat an eye but order a cappuccino after noon and an italian will look at you like you grabbed their mama s tit
never tell an italian how to fix a dish
sounds scripted ham is ham really just depends on how fatty you want it
bike or not i d ride his grandma
comparing british cuisine to italian cuisine is like trying to compare the nyse to a old monopoly board that only has the thimble and boot as the last remaining pieces
bri ish people ruining food once again
the face he makes when she said the word ham was priceless even the other brit knew she fucked up
sit down brits
carbonara is sheep cheesed egg sauce and aged pork cheeks ham on macaroni is not the same
repost it again tomorrow it ll be funnier
the irony of a british person telling an italian to make carbonara more british
i dont care what she said this women is so fckin hott and with the accent faaacck
chef is sooo professional held his tongue great response that s a lesson in working with morons
british carbonara is that like british bolognese
british always trynna colonize something lmfao
fucking pleebs
ok this is forcing me to give you my secret family recipe cacciatore americano cans of canned spaghetti pasta or zoodles alphaghetti etc frozen chicken nuggets or breaded chicken dump canned pasta into a casserole dish put the nuggets on top bake for around min at garnish with a sprig of parsley if you are feeling extra bougie
i m glad you re standing there bro knew she fucked up
i don t blame him but it s also not an classic italian dish
yeah and curry means something completely different in every country who cares if someone puts ham in their mac and cheese
marcello how are you cooking macaroni cheese alberto come and look at marcello
eh pasta is chinese and mornay sauce is french so he can go play with himself if someone likes something different than his own preference
deez nuts

wtf lol
oh man i needed this in my life thank you
dude could ve literally used like a pair of seedots or something to make the same joke

after like seasons of this show nobody did such a piss poor job as dj khaled and i include bobby lee who shit himself live
for context he tapped out after the second wing sauce which was texas pete s lmao
we can t play our health says the obese man that doesn t attempt to be healthy
khaled seems like a weak ass lol
this video is literally all i know about dj khaled and i feel confident it s all i need to know about him also the fact that he doesn t give head but expects to receive head
this guy has never said anything of substance in his entire life
his logic makes no sense because he agreed to go on this show
this guy is a clown everything about him bothers me to no end he has no talent i have ever seen treats people like he is better than them what he did with the bob marley signature guitar was a travesty this appearance on hot ones is just icing on the cake how many men and women have done this show since and have not done nearly as bad as this clown i personally hope it bothers him on a fundamental level every time he sees a clip of someone on the show at night when he is trying to go to sleep i hope the thought running through his head is i played myself
what does this guy really do i don t know what he dose
sounds like kramer and him putting levels in his house
i ll never understand how this fucking idiot became famous and wealthy
won t eat wings won t eat pussy
lol and here i thought he couldn t possibly be a bigger clown
this has always been the most confusing celebrity to me i m sure he does something amazing but all i hear him to is yell over other peoples hits and say ridiculous stuff like this not trying to hate on the dude i just do not see the appeal
gif giphy 347044wloezdo downsized
i mean you re full of shit but a ight
dj khaled will forever be one of the best examples of a loser he is just so pathetic it hurts
i hate him i just hate him
such a shame this idiot has an audience
that s the dude with the shoe closet
i d expect nothing less from someone who s literally made an entire career out of yelling self exclaiming ad libs
this clown is simple
he has gotten extremely talented at those mental gymnastics i mean he s spent quite some time convincing people he s talented he s obviously versed in manipulation
he gave up and played himself
another one another one
who likes that fool i ve never heard anyone say he s good
we the bess
there s a lot of things dj khaled won t eat any sane person would sip
is that jonah hill in blackface
i ve seen this one i think he actually treid to swap wings with the host dude
every time i listen to dj khaled talk i hate him more
this is the mentality of a person crafted by being surrounded by yes men
why is this guy relevant at all
saw him live once and he was an absolute disappointment like a backyard dj at a quinceaera did a monumentally better job than he did he just plain sucks at what he does the hype he has is because of his social media clout and marketing but this is a case in point of how terrible he is at doing anything in general
woke logic i only stopped i m not giving up and let me school you to boot trust me stopping is quitting in that context
why everybody so serious on reddit this is supposed to be funny
well he s kinda right
i love dj khaled goofiest man alive

continuing this challenge could potentially interfere with the security of the bag and or future bags big props for securing the bag under such stressful conditions this is why we train
this episode was one of the funniest fucking things ive ever seen dj khaled is an enigma
that s pretty damn inspirational actually i vibe with it
how americans justify their stupidity
actually i agree with this and like this mentality
i mean he definetily isn t wrong but it s still giving up the challange
anatha dj khaled inspirational
i refuse to believe dj khalid is real he s a cartoon character or at least not from this reality
yeah he does cardio so he has to watch out for his perfect body
this guy doesn t eat pussy or spicy stuff he s eating a lot of something else
he really shouldn t try to sound wise he s just playing himself
bro unless you have an allergy or a respiratory problem capsaicin can t kill or permanently harm you just admit you gave up
worst episode of hot ones ever because dj khalid is hot fat trash
the way the host says ok after khaled says he s gonna teach him something was so clearly condescending i love it lmaooo
will never understand the popularity of this goob
dj khaled schools some random youtuber about personal vietnam
khaled is such a doofus how did he ever gain success
and let me tell you something brah you can tell yourself anything you want to make yourself sleep better at night but that doesn t mean it s true you accepted a challenge and then failed that challenge by giving up you gave up you re a quitter any way you look at it facts are facts brah
this dudes still tryna bank off that one hit he had too lmao
unlikable douche
i hate dj khaled so much
this guy needs to just go away
i get what he was trying to say but man he does not have a way with words
still obese and telling people what he won t eat
pussy
we all wish he would give up in life that is or at the very least his shitty music
cant play our health coming from a 425lb man who s at best gtfoh
i truly believe he is intellectually disabled
dj khalid can t read
dj kalid seems like a guy if i had a chance to meet i would say nah i m good
the copium this man has been huffing for years man
congratulations you played yourself
i think dj khaled might be moonlighting as s speech writer
this conversation loops so well
without my glasses i thought this was fat drake and a thin dana white
do khaled is a fool
another one ya weak lump
we can t play ourselves we can t play our health dj khaled morbidly obese
this guy is a walking rolling joke
you know he drinks bud light
para que va entonces pinche nena
this man is a twat
i love how he has that outlook but then get super upset that his fans don t know his lyrics at concerts homie if you need to know when to stop so you don t hurt yourself shouldn t you be happy for your fans because they decided not to hurt themselves by memorizing your songs
i kinda get what he s saying if it was shots of alcohol and someone said no i m not doing this cause it ll fuck my health up i wouldn t t really consider them a loser or to have gave up maybe he was actually concerned about what would happen
bobby lee did more than he could handle he s leagues above khaled
jeff goldblum was pretty sad but he was a good sport about it
what u mean what did bobby lee do
he does a piss poor job at everything he does dudes a fucking turd
men who love spicy food have more testosterone https://time.com/3633813/spicy-food-testosterone/
that s about standard for bobby lee so he did great
it wasn t live but it was still embarassing as hell
holy shit isn t texas pete s basically american cholula
he didn t tap out let me teach you something today he simply was not playing his health
my exact thought he also gave up ridiculously early there is no way the initial sauces were so spicy that they could damage your health
i d love to know what his blood sugar numbers look like you cut that mf and you ll syrup leak out
he tried to lose weight but he cant because all he does is win
dude is a complete hack
he ate wing then quit lol
i have never liked him after seeing this it s ruined a bunch of good song intros for me since
he s definitely weak sauce

and that s why they call me crossbow charlie
your head of security just choked himself out
reminded me of childhood where we used to fire paper bullets with stretchable rubber bands
f slingshot at him out of there
the old don t worry i ll show myself out trick
he showed them
gif giphy nhzcw5engj0e8 downsized

yeeeeet
ohshitohshitohshithesgoingtodothereversearrow
blue collar wrastling ain t no joke
slo mo launched himself like a paper clip off a rubber band
he yeet himself out
fuck yea
his floor people needed him
would e been funnier without the edit
when you point the bazooka in the wrong direction
no you don t get to throw me i throw myself
man crossbowed himself into paralysis
tea finished up right at the end there lovely
that s like down b off the stage in smash
mission failed successfully
yeeeet
he was on the wrong side to do a slingshot attack what a noob
you won t push me out ill fling myself with most original style into the audienc
i don t think he got all of it michael cole
all that power but no ability
didnt expect an always sunny refrence
the power comes from the bottom
stretchable rubber bands hmm
the word you re looking for is fucking you look like a goober censoring yourself
this ain t fucking tiktok swear whatever you want
happy cake day
just a reminder that possibly the easiest thing a wrestler does is to get in and out of the ring so when we convince ourselves that wrestling is easy that we ll get jacked up doing the easy stuff
super saiyan yeeet
you certainly aren t aware of different kinds of rubber
as opposed to unstretchable rubber bands i guess
i voice typed
f_______ _________ ___ _______
its just that i m not aware of many non stretchable rubber bands
lmfao this thread had me rolling non stretchable rubber bands
and i just wiped gif giphy yg7kwyohjswd2
i sometimes choose not to curse on purpose no need to defend yourself for that and people who try to make that a bad thing are just confusing
that s what we endeavour for may the passer by s smile have the desired modulus of elasticity
username checks out
if you smelllalalalalalau what the rock is cooking
that s one thing but to type out a swear and censor it just looks dumb if you re going to swear swear if you re not use a different word altogether
i m an emotional arm thanks for pointing that out again
he used voice typing it auto censors
for me it doesn t matter whether it auto censored or was typed out it s the individuals style of communication and being bothered so much by it makes no sense
bro you can t just hate gays and then wrap your lips around the tip of a bottle like that
s kid rock was the debauchery king hookers drugs and beer no doubt he s a poser has been his whole life
drinking bud lite with a coors hat really
the earliest appearance of this photo i could find was from hours ago can anybody google better than me the watermarks make me wonder why they re there
https://preview.redd.it/ay127fef78sa1.jpeg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30aedac046a8d0640548c0d2cd97cdc5488fa870 kid n gay
kid rock cosplaying as a musician again smh
i thought kid rock was a mandela effect i mean did people actually like his trash noise music
a past where brandi still chooses joe dirt over him
i mean come on being a fucking hypocrite is basically a prerequisite for being a conservative these days
the talentless has beens found a home with the maga crowd it s a great match no one wants either of them the msga crowd needs someone relatively famous to draw a crowd and kid rock needs a paying gig
he looks like he s going to deep throat that bottle
he s a dip shit
that s right kid suck it down
removed
the way he s holding that beer to that pretty mouth and by pretty i mean s
he is the bull god after all
conservatives have the same permanence capabilities as a newborn they don t care about anything except saying the meanest thing possible at any given time
all career long
shit like this is why i think he s a little smarter than he comes off and he s just faking the maga bullshit to grift conservatives which would be all kinds of hilarious
because drinking a beer next to someone equals condoning them performing for children
had to be really recent i just saw that outfit she has on in the store last week
he s been fake his entire life his entire persona is based on whatever group of humanoids he can suck money off of currently
bud light at that
lol oh so that was really kid rock who blew up the bud lite cans
he deepthroating that beer lmaoooo
that beer wasn t the only thing going in his mouth and down his throat that night
the movement wasn t the same then as it is now
to rake in the cash sometimes you gotta do things you don t agree with you know when you lack autonomy and morals it s just that sometimes it s in public and sometimes it isn t
i think he s more upset that these companies all use lgbqt as a way to make bank none of them actually care in case anyone believed them they are all jumping on the money train which is actually sort of insulting i could care less about kid rock but i think that s why he s upset and making a stink about it
that is not an attractive lady
kid rock doesn t remember what he did yesterday
the fact he s drinking bud light with a transvestite is so ironic and so funny
i do like one of his songs but that s it lol don t kill me
he chugs beer like a man who chugs cock
gif giphy 1qhmdy91f9vemrlpvk
kid rock grew up very rich and has spent his whole life trying to prove he is just as street as any kid who grew up poor some rich kids get like that i m not less of a man because i had everything in life handed too me and i can prove it he is only famous because of his dad s money unlike people like jayz who grew up actually poor
made a lot of money off of it and it was all earned in bad faith
balls in your mouth is a hilarious song
he also drank a dark beer that night so i heard
fuckin poseur
fwiw that s a busch lite
https://worldredeye.com/2013/08/transformation-of-drag/](https://worldredeye.com/2013/08/transformation-of-drag/)
stop with your factual evidence that won t fit the reddit narrative
seriously though i could not see the allure of his noise
i know this is hard for people to understand but using a gay person and the most well known drag artist on the planet to promote your early act and then turning on them because of future politics makes you a fucking hypocrite don t get me wrong kid rock is a tool and always has been but he s a fucking hypocrite
your comment was removed because it was found to be hateful in nature please treat others as you would like to be treated and do not spread hate on this subreddit
removed
i mean being a fake redneck is kinda his entire mo i don t know if he s smart but he is definitely fake
yeah i know i mean who wants kid rock performing for anyone much less kids hey these dipshit redneck racist neo christian fascist scumbags like my music better start catering to them not the kind of person you want around your children
i mean it s not a bud light it s a busch light but still
easily asking for a dick to be edited in
sounds a little like that jamie kennedy character in malibu s most wanted
i see what you did there
as in anhueser busch
cool thanks also explained the watermarks superthanks
lmao towering amazons
what narrative they requested a source and someone provided it
first just to be clear drag queens and trans women are two entirely different things second yes it is supposed to be satire but they are satirizing traditional gender roles not necessarily mocking women some do drag badly and it is a mockery of women but most are not like that and making more of a commentary on traditional gender roles and they are good at it without making a mockery of women i hope that explains how some drag queens can be insensitive and inappropriate but that there are those that also break free the ideas of what it means to be manly or feminine by using satire of the very roles we are pressured to play
he s from freaking detroit but he likes to pretend he s some deep south redneck he s got a bar on broadway in nashville ffs if that isn t trying to be a southern imposter i don t know what is kid rock is all a gimmick to get himself paid if that means soaking up those gullible maga dollars than good let him take those idiots money
huh
you realize you sound exactly like the morons who hate trans people i m just saying you re just making yourself look stupid
same piss water
correct he s a rich kid source my ex went to high school with him
i love that you missed the point of that comment just hilarious
let me go straight for the godwin that s like saying people being assholes in support of nazis are the equal opposite of people being assholes to nazis and hey fuck nazis you re being a dick about those slave traders attitudes i think you were a little rough on that serial killer hey genocide has its purpose respect that dictator s beliefs
ag bud light gotcha
no you sound like the desantis followers who want to ban all the stuff budweiser is promoting trans people are ruining america blah blah blah said in a hillbilly voice i m assuming you don t actually participate reading for both sides cnn and fox enough to understand my point you may not agree with the pov buy the rhetoric is the same extremist gop woke and woke gop different sides of the same coin you all need to just go into a coliseum and pillow fight or something
no you mentioned condoning them performing for children meaning drag performers and igner_fartnsworth expertly turned it around to mean kid rock and you didn t get that which was hilarious then you still didn t get it when i replied to you lol
uh what you have evidently completely misunderstood what you just replied to
i m still confused going to bed
you called those folks nazis while those folks call you facist
tl dr kid rock is racist white trash so who in their right mind would want him performing for children
alone again like always sweet dreams precious little snowflake
incredible
no they don t they call me unamerican they call me a bleeding heart liberal and a socialist all things i m perfectly happy to be called well except for the unamerican part as i said you have seriously misunderstood what you re replying to
oh i def don t want him performing for kids
it really is
stunaud is an anti science antivaxx bigot and much more do not engage

i feel like you should probably know weather related words if you re a meteorologist
imagine this was her first day or her last
i think the correct word here should be precipitation not precipitate and the winner is simply just rain which is the most likely outcome of that slight chance
its rain lmao

it s clearly time for precipitation s participation
one time my local npr station had a sponsor plug for certified registered nurse anesthetists and the guy just couldn t get it out i died after he finally got it and let out a rather candid well i guess i ll never skip reading copy again

i don t play games bruh you sound like you spent your whole childhood playing call of duty
okay it s one thing to see someone get there head blown off in a video it s another to see it happen in real life in front of you
dudes got a bob s burgers chin
he s like a big year old
i ve always thought this dude is just emulating always sunny i for real get mac vibes
look at all the fidgeting and moving around bro looks like a cracked up sid the sloth
i promise watching a video is nothing like actually seeing it this is the type of dumb shit you hear before someone s first deployment and they are crying hiding after the first round cracks off in an ambush some of the scariest guys i ve ever met were generally the most friendly and you would never know until they were in that type of situation someone who is actually dangerous doesn t need to tell you
how did this degenerate get so much attention

saying that he s trying ro get desensitized by gore video makes him sound even more like a creep
man andrew tate is so awesome and such a hero that i think we should all encourage him to put his skills to use in real combat he could do some real great things in bakmut for ukraine or russia whichever he prefers as long as he s in the action in the most dangerous area because he s so solidly trained and desensitized let s all encourage him
retired marine here combat decorated i know violence this guy is wildly insecure small pp vibes would have no idea how he d react until he s in the situation though based upon everything he d likely respond poorly lives in a fantasyland in his head where he s the star is attempting to justify obsessing over gore which is probably indicative of a sick mind and would likely be a good candidate for the bad guy he purports to dislike meaning i can see this guy in a kill for thrill headline or as a woman beater this guy is a tool of the highest caliber edit i didn t realize who this was or what he had done when i wrote this i stand by my assessment yikes
weak chin
i hoped he watched videos of prison rape just so he s prepared
he reminds me of people that say oh i watched all the john wick movies i can definitely survive in the military yea ok bud
he is so incredibly stupid unbelievable
what a person sounds like when a single neuron is firing
why his lips so wet
he is comically unattractive
i am desperately waiting for andrew tate to get his ass beat senseless he needs it so badly he s seriously delusional
dude couldn t even handle cockroaches in prison
i get it it s like watching game of thrones to be better at d d makes sense
is that the really suspicious guy that forced girls to do porn while claiming to be alpha while fleeing countries the same one that got owned by a year old
so the weird thing to me is i also did this years ago i was terrified of dying so i thought i ll watch this to desensitize myself yes it desensitized me to gore and blood and horrific sites for a while but does that make you more equipped to handle situations no also it s just a lie you tell yourself to justify your morbid curiosity something you know is weird to spend your time doing but i have a good reason for it it honestly just messed me up more as far as fear goes and once this person finally realizes he is lying to himself he and stops watching it maybe he will also learn healthy ways to manage his fears
i wonder if he sucked a bunch of dicks to get ready for prison

sigh i ve been to war as an infantryman with the us army one of the most heavily trained armies in the world and there was still guys who couldn t handle it others who could only to get swamped by anxiety and ptsd after coming home theyre my heroes not this oxygen thief by the way the only way to prepare for war is having been there this shitbird couldn t handle jail let alone the horrors of war also this is a prime example of the psychological phenomenon they teach in infantry school called the sanctity of self it basically just means we are all programmed to assume that bad stuff happens to other people that our training is enough our weapons are enough that our technology is enough and that bad things will happen to the guy to my left or right but not to me because i ve never been killed before so it doesn t register as a possibility but the line about the gunman in his example the whole premise starts with someone else getting their head blown off by a random gunman it never registers to this asshole that it could be him so situational awareness be damned he s watched videos so he ll be the next rambo edit finished my train of thought

i ve never heard this turds voice until now and somehow it s even worse than i thought it would be how does anyone take him seriously he sounds like a basement dwellers experiment got out and joined society

he s not some kind of sicko he s a sicko
where s his chin
there was an attempt to dodge bullets from an ak
he s a living parody of a badass
andrew taint
the terrorists are pakistani also until youve lived that shit you cant really de sensitize yourself like he thinks hes gonna do
tell me you ve never been in a life threatening situation without telling me you ve never been in a life threatening situation
lmfao this guy has fans
every day this man bores me further from god
real question is this person mentally handicapped are we laughing cringing at a mentally handicapped person
this guys a complete idiot go rambo huh
his lips move like a year old still trying to learn how to speak you mean overa ther ya
no you re a sicko own it
god he s a right uggo
man that guy got a soft chin
he s still just a scared little boy
i don t play games except maybe too much call of duty
his miming of drinking a coffee looks a lot more like he s chugging a few dicks which might be pretty apt for his current situation
the only thing weaker than his chin is his credibility
people actually like what this loser has to say
his cranial capacity seems small
he talks exactly like mac from always sunny this is not a compliment
this mother fucker claims to be an alpha male with a hairline so high you almost can t see it no fucking chin and eyes that are staring off in different directions lmfao
bet he watched a ton of gay porn to get ready for prison
what a fucking chode
stop fucking posting his stupid bullshit for karma
i can guarantee with certainty that if someone sitting next to this ass hat had their head blown off he d wet himself and be frozen with pure fear
i watch tate videos to desensitize me towards people that don t have a chin
fetal alcohol syndrome
funny how those self proclaimed alpha men are always tough and puffed alone in their comfort zone talking to a camera
racist hateful and full of shit tell me your on the square without telling me your on the square
dick
i want to know stories of people who went to grade school with him i can still very much see the attention seeking child speaking
i watch people getting their heads chopped off or getting chopped up with chainsaws tbh i d watch it if it were him that its happening to lmfao
weakest chin
gif giphy n9vtep11fgrey
i watch porn for the same reason maybe one day
it s very very different seeing it irl
where s his chin
stop reposting him ignore him into nothingness
he always looks and sounds like he s fighting a battle to keep the spit in his mouth
i wonder if he was desensitized enough to handle the ongoing raping in prison
r iamverybadass
this is what happens when you don t become a man he s still

if slavery was just a product of the times how come half the country didn t own slaves and then actively fought against it even then people knew it was completely wrong
i know this is the internet and everything is fake but this feels particularly staged
she actually said there were probably some nice slave owners yeah and i m sure one or two guards at nazi death camps were nice so slavery defended
thanks i just wasted even more of my life
this feels its two separate videos put together and chick a is using pre planned talking points to respond to a video she s already seen
why would slaves enjoy being separated from their families wives and young girls raped by the slavemasters working from sun up to sun down inadequate food inadequate housing no basic rights not even to your own children no freedom not allowed to read or write just totally freaking mistreated why the hell would any human being enjoy that
this is fake right like not actually real please
but she was almost right i wouldn t say they enjoyed being slaves but yes if you born a slave leave and know only that lifestyle you would choose to be a slave because that s all you know my country captured my own people as a slave and when a revolution came the slaves were against it because they became unemployed and had or knew no way to feed themselves
is that the same woman doing a parody video
i don t know why the girl in the glasses would waste her time going back and forth with someone who clearly has a brain the size of a sd card
she does a very bad job of explaining herself but her main point is white peoples weren t the only ones involved in slavery yet that seems to be the only topic anyone ever brings up how bad whites were for having slaves and it was aweful yes there s no argument there but blacks asians you name it were involved in the process of slave trading and slave owning at some point in time slavery is and was horrible but whites weren t the only ones who owned them
have you ever had a quasi intelligent argument with a sibling or cousin in the back of someone s moms car on the way to the store this is the same pointless argument regardless of the topic
slavery goes back to the earliest recorded histories across the entirety of the world slavery is wrong and an absolute abomination thousands of people today if not millions still experience the brutality of slavery today and even more are living happily enslaved by the
they re both taking things wildly out of context one point is a stoic point that says if it s endurable then endure it which means that you can still find happiness in terrible circumstances the other is saying that it is all punctuated by pain and there is nothing enjoyable about it but both aren t mutually exclusive you can find happiness while living in terrible circumstances because happiness is subjective it s like going over to someone s house when you were a kid and thinking omg you live like this and they don t know any better until they turn and live somewhere else
gif giphy hvtouq08miyvo1a21m downsized me right now
i just see two idiot bad faith actors
this stinks like a bad parody dv is next on the list
the vocal fry in this video is just unbearable
so in an utopic far future people will realize that work 8h a day for a wage was some kind of slavery and debate if we were happy or not
actually it wasn t pretty normal to own slaves most people couldn t afford them and didn t need them those who could and did were the wealthy landowners who used them primarily as agricultural labor so not only was america not built on by slavery but the majority of americans neither participated in it nor benefited from it
i m a slave to the booty space dandy
hands up who wants to kick her in the face
if white feminine privilege were a person
wow what a pointless and cruel argument to try and make to argue what some enslaved peoples got lucky and werent beated as often as others wow that really makes the whole not being a full human thing seem more acceptable s
if someone asks you if you ve seen the matt walsh video about something that s the point at which you can start laughing pat them on the head and walk away
they are both dense as fuck if you keep asking the same questions the same answers are given the curly haired one is right but she lacks the ability to prove her point the blonde one is just stupid
please come to nyc and tell the local people of brooklyn this fascinating theory that a lot of black people enjoyed being slaves
oh yeah they totally enjoyed it they just built the underground railroad in their spare time for something to do until it was time to get back to slaving away
few people know that in some states if a white woman was caught having a romance or sexual relationship with a black man slave or free man a court of law could try her and sentence her to slavery for life wonder if this blonde would say that this white woman chose slavery
historically slavery was the economic engine of empires terrible but true
it drives me up the wall how blonde chick throws around the word logic without understanding what that means
let s recruit her to be a slave
ok i realize this is staged like everything else online but to address the argument the blonde woman was being illogical she said that because slaves only knew one way of life they would be happy with it assuming the slave holder wasn t abusing them which id pretty damn wishful thinking but the very nature of being a slave means you know two ways of life the freedoms given to the masters and their friends families and the lack of freedom to you and your family
both sides completely ignore the abolitionist movement of the us and anti slavery advocacy throughout history and i m slamming my head against a brick wall as hard as i can in frustration
so even if there was by chance a masochistic person who really enjoyed being owned and enslaved how does this change the fact that owning people in general is wrong and inhumane just because some people enjoy being hit we still can t go around hitting just anyone even if we would like to and even if we were convinced some people deserved it like some really dense people we as society decided on some basic rules based on moral on the common good and also about the integrity of individuals going with but back then should in alot of cases be followed by and obviously this was wrong society still evolves and grows up too but being blind to failures of humanity s past will also prevent to learn from it
if you treat em ok then owning humans is alright s
please someone anyone take away the blonde lady s electronics and internet connection all of it
blonde woman being a silly goose hehe
thanks for posting this this person is nazi garbage
if you did see matt walsh s video you d know he wasn t defending slavery
i wanna see vaush take on this woman lol
i mean it wasn t like they were trying to escape slavery all the time underground railroad you say what s that
it wasn t normal to own slaves most people didn t own slaves
it s the ad populum fallacy the claim that a truth or affirming something is good because the majority thinks so
because that s the only lifestyle they were aware of okay so this lady clearly doesn t understand that slaves were beaten and beatings hurt and hurting is bad and hurting people was the accepted and overwhelmingly common way for slavers to get slaves to do work but even setting that aside she also seems to think that there were slaves who didn t know what the lifestyle was of the people they were serving this lady thinks that there were slaves who even though they were totally able to see that the masters lived in a much bigger house than their own little one and even though they were able to see that they did a lot of work for that master and also that they didn t have anyone to wait on them the way the master did this lady thinks that if you re raised with that you don t see it as unfair cause we ve done studies and even babies can recognize what s fair https://healthland.time.com/2012/02/20/even-babies-can-recognize-whats-fair/). we don t just grow out of that sense of fairness we contextualize it by believing that some people are worth more than others and it feels like shit to believe that you aren t worth fair treatment that s not something normal that you just get used to it has negative consequences for your own mental health
chicks arguing about the past who they don t live don t experience as well an even worst reaching for moral superiority both are correct living long on a fuckup place make you fall on the same place because is the only shit you know and slavery was wrong an extremely profitable back then thats why was extremely common the human being on his path to always start a war it s pretty much on our nature
and her face and palm are properly introduced in hold hold now
nah nah let s take her to a recreational plantation and have her work like a slave
both are white and talking about slavery
she needs to not reproduce
this blonde woman is fucking dense
imagine being called and treated as non human by beings who are scientifically proven to be genetic mutations this is how you can tell logic was nonexistent for most back then
her argument is dumb but there were some slave owners who didn t know what they were doing was wrong because that s how things were i m not denying that they shouldn t have owned slaves but still
she really likes to use the terms majority and some interchangeably doesn t she almost as much as she enjoys using i think probably and fact interchangeably
the original draft of the us declaration of independence stated plainly that slavery was a horrible sin placed upon the colonies by the king ironic yes given the founders were slave owners it was removed to ensure southern states were onboard many many people were abolitionists back then fucking clueless idiot
removed
if your economy relies on slaves and we are in a war i ll free the slaves so i can screw your economy and win the war just like today the technological sanctions
which one is dense
white privilege omfg education and to a larger extent critical thinking is paramount to a more just and equal society like wtf even if you applied that f ed up logic it was the times they lived in we look back and see it was wrong just like today hating on trans and every other rainbow unicorn is wrong in every conceivable way
if they were slave owners they were the bad ones
i don t think she really meant enjoy i certainly hope not i think a better term would be ignorant of a better lifestyle or even conditioned to accept i also agree to believe that there were some owners that treated their slaves like family and have them freedom to leave i don t have periods of that but i do remember learning about the spectrum of slave treatment because we weren t in it we can t say for sure how it was for every family though i just say we keep trying to heal from it and move away from racism of any kind
i lost like iq points in the three minutes i spent watching this
braindead
the person in glasses handled this amazingly keeping cool while showing how rediculous the other persons words are very nice and foe blondy not to see that slavery is immoral but back then as she baselessly claims a majority liked being slaves is defending slavery astonoshing
got damn girl not every thought you have needs to be shared with the world red head was good at getting the point across slavery bad then full stop
i feel dumber having watched this video
people like that can only see the world through the prism of their own self they have to be made aware by putting things into a personal context i remember when i saw years a slave at a private screening people had wine and we talked about the film after and another clueless woman said that the problem came later when solomon had a bad owner and not a good one like at first i could not let that stand but had to explain it to her in a way she could understand i said that calling someone a good slave owner is like calling someone a good rapist if the guy holds your hand and plays soft music in the background while he rapes you that doesn t make it any better the logic really did not make sense to her until it was made personal some people truly lack empathy and compassion if it s not about them personally
anyone know the name of the girl in glasses i think it s really cool that she somehow manages to not loose it in a situation like this
totally belongs on r facepalm too
so how s her career doing after this
i think they are both wrong i agree that slavery was undeniably somewhat of a product of the times however saying that some slaves enjoyed being treated like property is such a terrible point to back up your argument slavery was so dominant in the us because of the plantation systems that had been set in place but using an argument that people enjoyed being enslaved is a dangerously incorrect defense
how do you cite matt walsh and still think you re right
slavery was a product of its time but that doesn t make it good or acceptable every ethnicity and every people known to man is guilty of slavery at some point in history many african countries and china does it today still
you re talking about the time when slavery was at its end in one country i guess the usa but slaves have been a thing for thousands and thousands of years
productivity the south was growing most of the crops and needed slaves to increase productivity that s a big reason morals went out the window horrible i know same reason black people owned slaves i am sure there are many more reasons but this was a big one the most vulnerable people were the ones to be enslaved throughout history
to be fare on that point they did own slaves at least a some although they cut that stuff out a while before the south northern merchants profited from the transatlantic triangle trade of molasses rum and slaves and at one point in colonial america more than slaves toiled in bondage in the port cities and on the small farms of the north https://www.history.com/news/deeper-roots-of-northern-slavery-unearthed although i agree it s a product of the time is a garbage argument
actually people in the north didn t care about slavery until they started hearing the stories of the abuse and the torture that was being inflicted upon the slaves then they started to care that is probably one of the reasons why it was illegal to teach a black person how to write
half the country wasn t involved in business that would benefit from owning slaves and a damned lot less than half fought against slavery there s a reason lincoln took nearly years of civil war to put forward the emancipation proclamation which only declared slaves held in rebelling states were free and still waited until congress passed a constitutional amendment to have slavery abolished in the union slavery was absolutely a product of the time whether or not a product of its time can ever actually be used as an excuse for violation of basic human rights is a separate discussion
only reason the other half didn t they were unable to feed and board moral views had nothing to do with slavery during the period northern states had slaves as well it was a show of affluence and after abolishment it took many years to get everyone on the idea that slavery was bad only reason abolishment came up was for political reason the north felt then south could actually succeed secession and become a industrial power house do to slave labor
indeed how come there is still black on black slavery going on in these times it is not a time period product it is a daily business these days
how far back in history are we talking
ya but at least some of them enjoyed it are you illogical
your baloney detection kit is working
i think the blonde girl sounds like she believes what she is saying too fully for this to be staged but it s also hard to comprehend people being this ignorant especially since she speaks as if her brain functions decently
i believe what was meant by nice slave owners is that they were not corporately punished were fed regular meals or allowed provisions to prepare meals were put up in houses as compared to barns and perhaps a stipend was given for work it did not mean they were part of the family but were treated civilly and as more hired hands than indentured servants perhaps that is what they meant by nice
people who were slavers weren t miserable at all times and occasionally experienced normal moments of pleasure with love ones and laughter and things all humans experience at one point so clearly they actually enjoyed being slaves because that was all they knew the mental gymnastics required to think that was a good point must be exhausting
there were probably some nice rapists during the nazi occupation of holland this twat
the worst slave owners were those who were kind to their slaves and so prevented the horror of the system being realised first as tragedy then as farce zizek https://danielmiessler.com/blog/slavoj-zizek-on-compassionate-crimes/)
apparently with the right owner it s disney world
i think what the girl was trying to say was that people tend to look back at the issue as a very black and white thing no pun intended i apologize but there is very likely a lot of undiscussed grey area i oppose slavery certainly but it also seems unlikely to me that the conditions you described applied unilaterally in of all cases clearly it was prevalent enough to warrant abolition but it seems equally likely to me that there could have been some few good slave owners who treated their slaves like people or at least better than the way the average cashier is treated today
but matt walsh said so and he s always so logical and unemotional about things who wouldn t trust him
because their name is darkness and got isekai d to our world
no she isn t right at all you re comparing completely different forms of slavery slaves in america weren t employed they were enslaved you received no wages many times they had to grow their own food and if the masters ran out of their reserves they ate those too did the slaves in your country enjoy having limbs cut off did the males seen as rebellious enjoy being anally raped in front of the entire plantation did the females and males enjoy being raped with their master and their friends enjoy being out in a steel box in the sun that turned into an oven that cooked you alive as punishment there were no good days only those that weren t as bad as the rest
the left can t meme they can t even recognize when their own people are trying to be funny it s that cringe it s obviously satire yes
i would keep going too the dumb girl was getting more and more frustrated as the conversation went on that s pretty entertaining
feels pretty staged to me both sides seem to be able to get their thoughts out pretty effectively even if one of them has pretty braindead thoughts
she s promoting an obvious majority popular option and majority moral response for views on a topic she will never be a victim of while shading an obvious bigot she s getting likes and views
it s like that little part of ram that you can t access

i love how the guy on the bike just keeps going for a bit
this is one of those moments she ll think about and cringe every time she gets a moment s silence for the rest of her life
i ve tried to take a hoodie off while on a treadmill i was convinced that surely i had the coordination to do this i almost died it can happen to anyone
that really couldn t have gone much worse
that s how i met your mother
well this confirms my worst fear at the gym they are watching they are laughing planet fitness cancelled
no one gets off the machines to help
she s training to play the next inspector clouseau brilliant
homeboy on the bike didnt budge at first trying to keep that heart rate up get that work bro
i bet she told the guy to stop flirting because she has a boyfriend
according to her she teleported
why did no one stop to help
all the people who saw her fall just continued with their activity even the lady on one of the other treadmills just turned to check and then continued walking
oh wow no one helps her the new society
i bet she can t walk and chew gum at the same time either
impressive how nobody helps what a shitty culture
everyone scared of being labeled as sexist rapist so nobody even attempts to help
at least she was wearing her mask
how embarrassing to be caught on surveillance gif giphy qwidyuezsnyxu
damn that hurt
hold on i ve got more seconds
welp that s enough workout for today i wouldn t be able to stay there after that
no no no you do the arms first and get the sweatshirt around your neck like a scarf then hurry up and throw it over your head before you lose your sense of direction
well gonna need to cancel that membership and find another gym
staged
they kinda didn t give a shit
i ve never completely transformed into a sack of potatoes while removing outerwear but that s just me
hey don t stop peddling don t want to help a lady out
dude on bike totally saw and in that moment made a split second decision to not help lol
nobody gonna comment on how badly the gym was designed
definitely something i would do
dude didn t stop until he thought she might have possibly in some way accidentally or not flirted with him
my man isn t trying to get slammed on social media as a gym creep he s just minding his own business
don t let the hr drop
earphone guys seen guys on a bench screaming for a spot while their spotter continues dancing wonder what people who go full noise cancellation mode in public even think
probably her bf for real used to the clumsiness lol jk
go faster
it s a good thing nobody got it on cam
i hate those sociopathy doesn t sound so bad sometimes
lmao damn that is dark but true
probably could ve done it fine if you took one arm out completely next your other arm out completely scrunched everything around your neck then rapidly pull it off remove it like you re driving a car not like you re standing still
i once whiped my face with the towel on the treadmill i almoat fell off its extremely difficult
guess this is one of those things like trying to remove toast from a toaster with butterknife that most people just need to hear about once to forever avoid it friend of my aunt died trying to get her toast out i suddenly have desire to ever attempt a treadmill sweatshirt removal for the rest of my life thank you kind person for sharing
if her pants went down this would be straight up movie slapstick
that s how i woke up in heaven ftfy
she was still moving when she landed didn t need help
i mean she can stand up on her own i would laugh my ass off if i were there
most wearing masks hard to tell how old the video is and what restrictions were in place for all of them i m sure if they thought the person who fell was injured in any way they would have reacted differently
i dunno what they did was awfully stupid to warrant help
shake it off gotta keep the rhythm
part of her workout routine
i would have immediately tried to help her him continuing to pedal also risks pedaling into her head if she had fallen back a bit further
natural selection should be allowed to run its course for the good of future generations
cardio
you can thank all the shitty attention hoes in the gym who end up posting videos on social media framing the guys who may or may not glance in their direction as being perverts
i don t know why you re getting downvoted for this
is this sliding in the dm s
hmm nah my man was just focused on his cardio especially if he was a daily gym person etc i would try to ignore the fire alarm when i was doing my min hard cardio on a stairmachine that included a min wait for the machine
you do this when you re driving
a turtle on its back would still be moving as well doesn t mean she doesn t need help
i probably would ve called it a day after that bit of embarrassment
said the er surgeon about the patient who didn t wear a seatbelt
fair enough
this they reap what they have sown
nice straw man misogyny
i just drove hours this week so if i had to stop every time i had to do something it would take much longer it s not dangerous if you know what you re doing it s not like i removed my pants lol
everyone paused and watched waiting to see if they needed to act and more than likely stunned by what they just saw they all saw them managing it themselves hence she was still moving and didn t need help as evident by them standing up at the end then by people then also stopping to check on their status once they were able to grasp what they were just witnessing people are strange creatures especially when watching other people and reacting to their actions
good thing she isn t a turtle then
i tried to take off my unzipped jacket once while i was stopped at a red light with my seatbelt on and decided never again
tbf i have to turn down the radio when i m trying to figure out where to turn so it could just be that we re built different
that s fair
maybe you shouldn t be driving in the firat place

you had one job
on tonight s episode of south beach tow
it has a subframe and hooks buddy wtf hook it to the plastic bumper bucks says the tow truck is stolen
probably because you got it on camera and there s no denying it that reminds me of one of my neighbor s here in austin she parked in a restricted spot in the apartment s parking and the tow truck took her vehicle away as it was allowed to do per procedure but in the process they ruptured her gas tank and it was still leaking all over their lot when she got there to retrieve it then they claimed it wasn t their fault because they found it just like that already ruptured when they went to hook it up haha yeah right like she just drove through the parking lot leaking gasoline everywhere of course they didn t think to take any photos of that extraordinary event to prove it
did he at least offer to zip tie it zip that shit up it will be fine
my guess is he has another one now not in the esteemed field of towing
yeah guy obviously had know knowledge or training i ve watched youtube videos and know better
it s my daily dude it s not some project car and i take good care of my car they ll fix it the right way
k
you re
my incompetent what
i think most people didn t so much as vote for joe biden as they didnt vote for trump
i would have no regerts carrying that sign
at least he spelled incompetent correctly
lol too but he was acting weird and like i guess was trying to make it hard to take a picture but also still standing on the street corner like ops mom
please tell me this sign ended with poo
it s always projection
your incompetent what
my incompetent what
my incompetent too o
r confidentlyincorrect
get a brain morans lives on in this man
look at the big brain on brad ladies and gentlemen
the irony
his right i guess
the punchlines write themselves
you got skooled
deleted
looks like its on purpose to mock
maga
i m pretty laughed out from all those uneducated people thinking that they are smart shut up go to school and prove it instead of making fools of yourselves
it s true but you re
if you think it matters who you voted for you re incompetent
he s using text talk with a bit of slang yo ur incompetent
their is a problem with your sign my dood
every accusation is an admission
what makes this so funny to me is that this subreddit says there was an attempt with your caption that means he fails to tell people about himself ooops
ah yes
your momma
you missed the full message bc the guy was in the way it actually says if you voted joe biden your incompetent too
well they would have never charged trump if he were a white man
you should never write words using numbers unless you re or your name is prince
he must have skipped a lot of skool
yet biden still sucks

you are incompetent
if you joe yo incomp tc voted bi den ur etent o
people like this make me happy it will soon be july here in maryland and weed will be legal because my god i need to smoke it to live in the same world with these people
i always make spelling mistakes and it goes viral all the time this is this stupid google auto spell
our other option was a guy who sold us out to russia said we could kill covid by shoving lightbulbs up our and staged a coup as a tempertantrum when he couldn t steal the election but sure biden is the incompetent choice
you know i genuinely believed they tried their best or should i say they re best
if you hold this sign you re stupit
my incompetent too
at least i can spell
i think i made this poor man uncomfortable cuz i pulled around laughing hysterically for the picture bless his heart
jesus cristoballs he sticks the landing on incompetent but faceplants on you re what a dope
yer
yo u r
i d also like to point out that the first mistake is that nobody voted four biden
this is the way
i agree in spirit as a full time puerto rican i can t vote for national elections just suffer the consequences
gif giphy h4pqdulmqt8ua
you know he hopped on notes quick and gave it a trial run
spell checked that one but didn t bother with your and you re
he looked up how to spell it but didn t bother checking the definition thought it was just a big word for dumb
spelt
thats the problem with the maga faction its anti intellectual and aggressively outrage based and so they support people who are under intellectual and rage based boebart green etc they support idiots because they actually believe that the problem is being over intellectual which is so so stupid its hard to comprehend
no too
yep
no don t
huh
you may need to double check that he got released the same day with all charges dropped
it was someone who had clout and respect and knowledge of the american system of governance versus an entitled brat who throws tantrums it mattered it mattered a lot
boom
no he failed to tell other people they were the incompetent ones
or if that username is already used but you have a clever way of making lowercase ls 1s or replacing an a with an symbol but only then
is what he was trying to say yes
lol that s cute
calm down tarotgirl it s meant to be less of a political post and more if a lol look how stupid post i have found so much peace in not engaging in politics
there best
thats just two funny murica
no way you caught him in the wild lol
i first looked and saw maybe hoping for incontinent
yore
y all uns
yur eo
lol

he couldn t spell for but clearly he s more competent
ok but that s common shorthand i get bashing the guy for a lot of reasons but that one is silly
your stupid if you dont now the difference
spell check can t fix that
we have to be more protective of our inner energy we cannot let these negative goings on compromise our peace
shhhh shh
the real weird part of this is that other than boebart and greene most of their heroes are very educated
please tell us more about biden kamala s intellectual superiority
you coulda let me have this vyxen17
i m saying that trump recently got arrested and faces charges but somehow the incompetent ones are the ones who voted for biden
i m not talking about the individual candidates that shows how little your understanding is
sorry i thought the shove a lightbulb up the has the same lol look how stupid energy the option to view it as just politics is a luxury i don t have
he didn t no any better
that s what yur eopan money is called
worse he couldn t spell four
is this not already enough
i take all of it back now you get nothing
no i inderstand you re a both sides person the gop wants to restrict education eliminate privacy rights eliminate medical rights and scapegoat people with absolute lies and bullshit both sides are very clearly and obviously _not_ the same anti abortion laws alone prove that true
why don t you have it
i know write
and yet he got your despite using you re incorrectly he was so close to four with your

i d shit myself too if i saw a blurry bunch of pixels creep up like that
to film something using a camera i can t event tell what animal that was
seems like a cat but why would they scream like that
if i had a nickel for every cat disrupting islamic worship video that i saw today i would have a dime that s not a lot but it is kind of strange to see two in one day
the video is such bad quality i m on my phone what was the animal a rat
1080p resolution
might be a cat or a giant scorpion
is this at the bank or r killthecameraman
some kind of minecraft monster
new potato phone turns everything into a pixel mess
what s that so blurry
thought youre not supposed to break your prayer
are cats welcomed in thay religion seen a few videos with cats in their church s
that s where we got the ohm sound from when we use to hear it from the giants
saudis are just
csi computer nerd enhance keys tapping enhance keys tapping enhance keys tapping
filmed on a first generation motorola razr
bro cameras from that era used film and actually have very good resolution
i m not sure what islam s stance is on cats but i know dogs are considered to be unclean particularly in the context of prayer as a human with dogs i have seen many big strong men from countries where pets are uncommon or reviled practically scale walls to get away from my lap dogs
because that one of the closest followers of muhammed and most important islamic saints was called father of cats and used to always carry at least one with him they are usually loved and tolerated even if they make some mess in their temples this reaction was not religious maybe that area has a lot of dangerous snakes and the first reaction if you feel some unexpected animal sliding against you is to jump away and look what it was after that s just my guess
i ve seen cat ramadan videos today and it s quite odd
ok doof
camel spider
it s a cat
it wasn t me
feels like r softwaregore cause that did not transfer in the best quality
shh don t talk about that now
yeah this is like action camera that has been ran through a heavy compression process
islam is ok with cats mybe the cat was thier jumpscare cuz they didnt expect it
weird you d think they would move into the 20th century eventually all of that is pure superstition based on lack of medical knowledge from ancient history
cats are seen as pure and clean animals in islam the prophet had a cat and one of the prophets close companions was called abu hurayra father of the kitten because he adopted a stray cat he found
a stray dog can give you rabies just by licking you that said a hate fear of dogs isn t completely random
well as a dog lover i wish everyone saw their beauty however given that i am an animal lover who is concerned about the environment and who lives very much in the 20th century one could easily argue that i should be horrified by the thought of eating meat it s inhumane contributes to ill health and worsens environmental degradation i guess my point is that we all do things that someone looking in from the outside would consider odd or misplaced closer inspection reveals all the very logical reason one might behave in unexpected ways
all of that is pure superstition based on lack of medical knowledge from ancient history so religion i m including my own in this as well
we re in the 21st century
oh what a beautiful story i ve heard this name abu hurayra somewhere don t know where
well in the 20th century there were vaccines for that and a tiny dog if that was a dog isn t really fear inducing to make a person scream
yea dogs aren t allowed in places where you pray like your home or mosque but otherwise you are more than welcome to keep dogs outside in a kennel or something
the meat we eat we developed for that reason it is the mechanical robots that humans created to go out and collect and process plants into consolidated proteins that sustain us so that we don t have to go out and gather all of that by hand not eating meat causes ill health eating plants that require fuel burning engines and top soil depletion is killing the actual earth it s a lie that animal poop is a problem it actually restores the health of the earth
yes religions are a conglomeration of that along with other manipulative pronouncements
but they are not medical knowledge in the 20th century debunks the superstitions

what is the story on bud light
if anyone is looking at getting rid of their woke beer send me a dm so i can help a friend in need
i have no clue why this idiot is doing this but bud light has been the gay beer of choice since the early s every gay bar i have ever been to meeting with my gay friend has bud light posters everywhere men hugging men kissing i m adverts
destroying things you ve already paid for the most powerful form of protest also he must ve forgotten about all the times republicans have decided to boycott coca cola in the last few years
that guy has too much money
yeah that s the truck i d expect him to drive pretty much everything in this video checks out as on brand
but also he already supported bud they have his money throwing away full beer cans that he already paid for doesn t hurt anyone anything but his wallet big brain at work here
by the way anyone ever met a guy who owns a truck like that who wasn t an asshole don t want to generalize but
i suggest we put rainbows on all food and watch these losers starve to death
these are the same people that have the audacity to call liberals triggered and soft
when people do these types of boycotts protests they often don t do their research anheuser busch inbev owns over brands in countries and if he s going to stick to his principles he should also throw out all the coke products as well since they ve scored a hundred on the human rights campaigns corporate equity scorecard since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ab_inbev https://www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs/how-does-coca-cola-support-the-lgbtqi-community
does the fragile ego make your legs go bow legged like that
what a waste of two gallons of water
hahahaha pffft what a clown i lived in colorado for years coors light has been a sponsor of the center on colfax and the pride parade and denver pridefest for nearly two decades https://denverpride.org/coors-light-supports-the-lgbtq-community/)
the big macho man getting his feelings hurt by a rainbow on a beer can
wealthy douchebag throws away his own watery beer i wonder if he knows it s owned by a european conglomerate
man all the millionaires are mad
i for one am shocked that someone with a truck jacked that high would have such a fragile male ego s
i guess the bar is no longer his safe space
budweiser has been supporting the lbtgq community for over decades why does it bother these sister fuckers now
he ll be back for it after the camera is off alcoholics ain t gonna let free booze get away that easy
oh man he sure showed them
dude spent on the case so he could own the libs on tik tok by throwing it all away doesn t he understand that it s not a boycott if the company still gets his money
do you think he knows they already have his money
what s pathetic is all of these sensitive manly men drinking the worst beer on the market
of course that s his truck fuck you buddy i don t want you drinking the beer i buy with a sad face when my bank account is low
when a bunch of folks are at the game state fair or whatever event they won t think twice about buying an overpriced bud light or budweiser
sigh what a waste of perfectly good beer edit jeez ol peetz fine perfectly edible beer flavored drink

i don t get it isn t this where this beer should go
now he needs to throw away his truck https://www.tiktok.com/t/ztrcxvxeh/)
they already got your money throw them shits away they dont care
the dude waddles like my toddler
sir maybe you should try an aa meeting instead
i m confused why does he hate gay people he s always said that there s nothing like coming home after a hard day s work and getting his hands on a couple of tall boys
already bought the beer that ll show them
these are the same people who call other people snowflakes for disagreeing with their politics cry harder
i absolutely love a good mantrum

ignore the hateful message and the stupid jacked up truck to compensate for his fragile manhood i hate when someone tells me to google it your making a god damn video tell us why your angry i don t have time to do the work for you
cancel culture bad unless evil rainbow
what a bunch of fragile idiots
doesn t this prove more than anything that he s just got shit taste in beer
your first mistake was drinking bud light there i said it
how can you play the tough mega hetereo male while at the same time replacing light beer with light beer
oh god what imaginary complaint do right wing snowflakes have now https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonyrobledo/bud-light-partners-with-dylan-mulvaney pissed that bud contracted with a trans woman let me introduce you guys to a concept invented by thomas jefferson you re still down with him right it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg what s it to you if bud wants to have a trans sponsor
lmao he walks like a toddler it s also hilarious how someone with this much money is holding back tears while throwing a tantrum
imagine being this fragile
of course he d have ridiculously lifted trucks has it written all over his douche face
that car at the start is just comically tall and it looks so dumb
so he s not going to recycle those cans
removed
i mean this in the best way possible drinking light beer is really gay
look at all the toys and big lifted truck and the way he switch his hips when he walk that boy got a little sugar in him lol
cool lifted truck bro
so who s going to break the news about coke to this guy send him this https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/coca-cola-fosters-inclusive-lgbtq-community)
raise your truck a little higher dummy
gif giphy oepnwzvrwxkca
who s gonna tell him https://denverpride.org/coors-light-supports-the-lgbtq-community/)
you can t fix stupid
tell me you re sensitive without telling me you re sensitive
he clearly has a huge cock look at his truck
imagine being this insecure about your sexual preference s
had to make sure all of his look at me i definitely have a big penis vehicles made the cut
this is where it now belongs in the garbage first off no it belongs in recycling after you ve rinsed the cans secondly it s garbage beer and always belonged there
dude has a lot of toys and beer fridges for being apart of the most government subsidized group of people in the country farmers i guess those handouts are being put to good use
magas have been drinking the gayest beers all along bud light coors light those are like alcohol tasteless pussy drinks get a fucking ipa like a man
man for a bunch of people railing against cancel culture they sure love cancel culture
i think more than anything he was just attempting to show off his garage
they are showing support for lgbtq
they sponsored a trans actress and the anti woke crowd are having a tantrum again
when somebody says if you don t know instead of actually saying their reason it means it s a bigoted reason and they know how bad it sounds to say it out loud
he ll get them out and drink then after the camera is off
do you like drinking piss that much
it s pretty crazy how much money some of these people have that s a huge property that coal rolling truck is 100k plus that toy in the workshop is another 100k
remember when bud light lime came out they were practically pelting cans at people from their pride parade float
i thought it was schlitz gay
the ties between the lbtq community and bud light date back to it started with a labor dispute between coors and the worker s union the lbtq community in sf supported the workers by boycotting coors and switching to bud local was the trade union division which represented the workers of coors the strike was over a clause in employee contracts which required all workers to take a mandatory polygraph test where they could be asked directly to reveal their sexual orientation there was initial scepticism towards the strike from coors itself workers and the public however local found an unlikely partner in the gay community of america s west coast particularly san francisco courtesy of the american federation of labour and congress of industrial organizations alf cio president george meany meany allowed the strikers to advertise the boycott in the sixteen states coors was sold by informing communities that coors infringed on the human rights of its employees due to the homophobic element to the polygraph test the workers dispute gained a receptive lgbt audience in gay bars when they removed the beer from their bars and backed local s campaign http://www.midlandshistoricalreview.com/a-political-fight-over-beer-the-1977-coors-beer-boycott-and-the-relationship-between-labour-gay-alliances-and-lgbt-social-mobility/
i m starting a beer company called real men don t cry our ads will feature real men hunting and fishing and driving big trucks and going to the firing range our logo real men deserve real beer a proud sponsor of the us republican party of profits will go to research showing climate change is good for the environment because after all it s just a few extra degrees and real men who don t cry instead they have an ice cold beer background will have wimpy skinny guys drinking warm bud light and coors light driving teslas and succumbing to the heat finally we ll feature trump himself in jail saying prison is not so bad when you get served the finest beer made right here in america because real men don t cry don t get me wrong i fully support lgbtq community just don t tell my target audience i m going to be filthy rich hahaha
as a top pbr is my preferred choice
well bud light might not be the gay beer of choice https://youtu.be/hcosejs1ssy).
i remember my dad was trying to boycott doritos years ago because they were supporting the gay marriage thing or something i showed him all the companies that did the same and it was basically every major company aka everything we consumed that was the last time he ever tried to boycott anything thankfully
and rockstar fridges they donate to pride as well as does ford guess he ll have to trash his trucks in fact pretty much every brand in his home has likely donated supported lgbt those companies have surely gone broke from all their wokeness by now
not to mention bud light and coors are owned by the same company https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/13/all-the-beer-you-drink-is-owned-by-one-company.html
all that money and was still drinking a shitload of shitty beer
honestly this guy has a big beautiful house a giant garage an rv several cars he should live his life and be happy but evil rainbow can got him living in fear edit thanks for the award
really this was just a video for him to show off all of his shit just jumping on the cousin fucker bandwagon to do it
owns a llc with employee took million in ppp and bought all the toys in the video decries government handouts
you would think with that much money you would get craft beer
he literally kept the video slow as they walked by his truck just him walking not even talking then sped it up as he went to go throw away the unopened 32pack of bud light that he supposedly likes to drink 32packs don t spend much time unopened that s why they re packs this video was to show off his shit
right wtf does this dude do how can someone be so fragile but seemingly doing well for himself
yeah this dude has big i can t afford to pay my employees any more money vibes
i would drink so much gay beer for that guy s garage
i mean it s not good but they probably pulled in straight from the street in front of the store if they ve got a placard and aren t blocking another spot i m not gonna be mad about it
looks like a typical parking job in florida
your honor technically i wasn t parked in the handicapped spot
this doesn t fly in la towed in less than mins
yah i m not sure if they pulled in from the main road in the front but they backed in and out a few times to park it that way definitely a good attempt and clean parking job
that it is lol

i apologize for being biased i suppose it s because i never liked peeps growing up cream soda rocks tho

why i m implying that while officially it is called research it is really just having a pet

you seem determined to not learn curious
bad day
tbh if you can t see the context then i don t think you should be talking i m not interested in arguing so don t expect any replies

very true we get so many more of them than they us and it s not their fault in their case but with us it is our fault i wish everyone could just be smart enough to leave them alone

lauren boebert has no business being in congress because she is actually very unintelligent mtg however has no business being in congress because she might actually be insane
the fact shit shouting lunatics like this get voted in to any position of power is why people are gonna be voting for that giant meteor again giantmeteor2024
did i hear her say i was allowed to believe things that aren t true from an adult and politician about something from only six years ago
the scariest thing about her is that other humans voted for her
if she wasn t trying to destroy the country so much i d feel bad that her need for constant attention has her saying such stupid things did her parents not hug her enough
i think apologies are impordant mtg is the classmate who said liberry except she s in congress
i have lost a lot of faith in humanity knowing there are people out there that saw this woman campaign and went yes that s who i want to represent me in the us government then even after watching her perform her duties with no dignity and with compete and utter ignorance turned around and then took the time out of their days to wait in line and re elected her
people never talk about the good things i ve done perjury trailer queen okay fine let s do those first uhm i guess it s time to look at the bad ones now buckle your shit in because we re gonna be here a while
what logical response she not capable
of course i stand by my social media look over there
politicians never fail to surprise me with the depth of their ignorance and incompetence they constantly prove how out of touch they truly are yet the same type of people just keep winning elections year after year need anymore proof of how sick our society actually is
impor dant the ignorance is astounding
have you ever seen those facial reconstructions of a cavewoman google it and watch this again tell me what you think
i feel bad for the interviewer this person s expressions were not picked up by mtg at all because she s dumb as a rock and insane
so how does this person get elected is it just having a lot of money backing her i really want to know people are voting her in aren t they like how in the actual f do we have this dummy so high up in the political food chain
her nose is getting bigger by the second
wow she s very beastly from straight on i can see why she s always trying to head tilt like some kind of hunting dog
obviously minutes deserves criticism for giving this nut a platform but let s do our part and not share or watch these clips
i have never broken a law i have broken the speed limit
by allowing this trash to have a seat in congress along with a few other wacko s i can never respect the gop as far as i m concerned they are what s wrong with everything an ounce of integrity would have stopped a lot of hurt in the nation but they seem entertained by watching it burn
softball bullshit
the state of us politics is terrifying we are one facist away from the persecution of the poor and undesirables the people need to take back this country from these evil pricks
god she a female trump this stupid b has a pathetic excuse for everything
i always have moment where i feel like i should get into politics given the current shit show but i m also immediately followed by the realization that even if i could get into a high enough position those crazy ass ones will still be there yelling away
as terrifying as her responses are she fundraises off her stupidity and is quite successful
why was this woman chosen to interview her this was not an interview it was an attack maybe next time choose somebody who can put their personal feelings aside for at least minutes
removed
i have two kids i hate meteors but you know what i m with you giantmeteor2024
zero accountability
to be fair she ran unopposed when she was first elected then when everyone saw how absolutely insane she was i thought this is fine someone will just run against her this time and we ll be done with her forever boy was i wrong
notice she didn t actually mention any good things she s done why doesn t anybody ever tell me about any of the good things i ve done i want to know what they are
i don t feel bad for the interviewer she should have challenged her instead of letting her statements go unchecked i m sure this felt like a big win by mtg and empowers her even more
see catching steam again go space rocks
that checks out voters should be able to vote no representation at that point an empty seat would be a better option than that

the logan paul hoodie is very fitting
holy shit good cop stabbed running and still has enough thought to switch to taser also out runs young kid with an extra lbs of gear
that s one hell of a cop give him a medal guy attacks him with a knife he still chooses to use a taser instead of his gun secures the guy safely until help arrives taking a knife wound in the process
i like the officers tone he isn t trying to be a condescending douche
so according to the news article i read the year old guy was going to be involuntarily committed to hospital for mental health issues i guess his way of getting out of it was to try to kill an officer and have them kill him suicide by cop luckily the officer was treated and released and the kid missed major arteries
kudos to the officer for showing restraint he had grounds to shoot
that cop deserves a medal his training was obviously on point
while making an arrest i was stabbed i can attest to the amount of adrenaline flowing through you the professionalism that this officer demonstrated is not only from his training but also his character it takes a lot to not overreact and retaliate i saw blood all the time but when it s yours the reaction is different
even after this officer not asking about his other hand that was obviously clutching something drugs or a blade he didn t smoke him after he got stabbed and when he had all that time dude couldn t drop the knife when tased and the cop made the decision not to smoke him well done
looks like a suicide by cop attempt
it s nice to watch a video of a cop doing an absolute stand up job bravo this guy in this interaction he was a first rate cop we need more like this guy for sure
i m surprised the cop never took note of the fact the guy was hiding his left hand the whole time
sucks i ve come across quite a few asshole cops this cop is actually level headed and cool and you try to kill him no sympathy for this kid hope he got the max penalty
that s what i call a good cop even switching from gun to taser mid run
by the way this is generally why cops are assholes about seeing your hands keeping your hands out of pockets etc because people pull shit like this
why wasn t he commanded to show his other hand i think it was a blunder by the cop to approach without seeing that hand this will make for a good training video
how to throw your life away in less than two minutes he s lucky he wasn t shot
the entire time i am thinking i cannot see his left hand he is favouring it cop too nice for his own good
anyone have link to news story
wow who knew cops could pull a gun on a suspect running from them who attacked them be in a full chase and have the restraint to switch from a gun to a non lethal method of incapacitating the suspect fascinating to watch
can we just pause and understand that this officer went above and beyond did his job excellently and while maintaining poise and decency that was damn refreshing to see honestly as it blows my mind how many police fear for their life over literally anything those cops are pussies this officer is not now to the idiot one would almost have to assume that he is some kind of mental case or flat out thought he d kill a cop and get away the officer had already radioed called him by his name he went from not in trouble yet to doing for attempted murder of an officer that officer was beyond cool with him the other officers and cos definitely will not be have fun getting your head bounced off everything on the way to your new home asshole
it s been years since the police academy for me but it was drilled into us so often every scenario test get their hands free no hands in pockets before we approach them this is why
holy shit that was some real restraint excellent policing
a rare video of a good cop being good at his job
lmfao watching him getting shocked like a cartoon has me dying
he s always hiding his left hand which was suspicious from the beginning
what a piece of shit poor cop
good cop start to finish wish all these videos went like this
more videos of cops doing the right thing need to be posted i feel better knowing this cop is out there
great job by the officer just shows how dangerous policing is he thought the guy was compliant and in a blink of an eye he was swiping at him with a knife probably could have shot him but used his head and tazed him glad the officer is ok
so that s what a well trained officer looks like
all through the first part of this video i kept screaming at my phone screen show me your left hand what s in your left hand i guess we all found out i m glad the injury wasn t worse
all respect to that officer but i don t understand why he didn t say let me see your left hand the way the dude was keeping it hidden seemed suspicious although it s easy for me to say sitting in front of a screen lol
that s weird he chose the path to run away instead of bushes or any other way
this cop knew it was a kid just fuckin up he didn t want to shoot him
amazing to see a cop showing restraint and using proper escalation of force
this is an awesome cop promote this guy asap control restraint integrity
this made me angry the cop is being reasonable and gets knifed where as we are used to seeing a lot of bad policing for lesser crimes a lesser cop would have shot the guy nb i was suspicious as to what that guys left hand was holding was it nave of the cop not to be a tad more wary
i was left hanging when he said number i run a lot i needed to know the rest also great move switching to non deadly force was fully expecting him to get lit up
real men use tazers
cop didn t shoot anyone good cop
i m black this is wack he shoulda got shot how was the officer not in fear for his life
scary fucking moment knives are no joke
finally a good cop appropriate force he deserves to be praised
my god there is nothing i love more than seeing shitheads get what they deserve
dude went from not being in trouble to having assault with a deadly weapon charges either he is stupid as fuck or its a suicide by cop attempt
this is proper fucking police work he was nice to the guy he s probably just a kid who s lost his way and the policeman seems aware of this then the kid goes too far
he zigged when he should have zagged
the cop literally said that he s not in trouble yet so why tf would he attack the cop what a fucking idiot
i kept thinking can t see his hand can t see his hand
the thought of being tased doesn t bother me as much the thought of landing face first on concrete
good cop he did everything he could including switching weapons
cop you are not in trouble yet dude well let s see if we can change that
cop made a huge mistake he approached a fleeing suspect without clear sight of both of his hands praise for his composure after but almost got himself killed
one i run a lot ok that was not a lie this whole thing was awesome except one part he didn t insist the guy show him his hands before approaching the first time his left hand was hidden the whole time from what i could see
where is this the cop certainly needs to be commended but this should also be the standard
we can say good job on the cop for going with less than lethal but that guy deserves a few rounds of 9mm
this is less about a good cop and more about a aggressive suspect with the complexion for protection
great job using restraint by the officer he had every right to shoot the guy in the back for those that don t like that the officer has no way of knowing if the maniac would have stabbed others if he got away but instead of shooting and putting random hikers at risk he chased down the suspect and subdued him without lethal force this video should be shared by departments around the country
now you re still not in trouble proceeds to get into a ton of trouble
even though he was obviously irritated with the kid at the start he still tried to take the time to reason with him then switching from gun to taser even though it could have been seen as a justified killing because the kid had a weapon and may have used it on someone else no notes perfect interaction from top to bottom from a citizens stand point
i was suspish of that hand hidden behind his back how was the cop not
maybe a show me you hands he would have seen the knife also the way the kid kept taking a deep breath he was trying to figure out his best attack
running won t work and here s why i run a lot
outstanding police work
that cop is ballsy success rate on tasers isn t something i d gamble on but i won t dilute the fact that this turned out best case scenario he had grounds to go lethal
with the logan paul merch
as the father of a son who is mentally ill i admire the restraint this officer showed even after being stabbed he acted without malice decided against lethal force and successfully apprehended this young man without causing him harm apart from the sting of being tazed i m surprised at all the comments about the color of his skin it s sad when people have to bring race into it a decent cop would have done the same thing regardless of the race of the other person downvote me if you will but i m just glad another mentally ill person wasn t killed in this instance
he had every right to shoot him
i hate cops if they all served like this they would have nothing but my up most respect it s refreshing to know there are a few good apples
ok now this is how you do policing right dude got stabbed and still used less lethal force and arrested him instead of lighting him up promotion for this guy
if the kid was black he would ve been turned into swiss cheese normally i d agree but i think in this case maybe not something about the guys tells me he s a genuinely good person
any other cop would of blasted that kid and this cop would of been completely justified in doing so
this action by the suspect is attempted murder he stabbed the cop in the neck cop while running could ve bled out and died and then the perp would be free to roam with the knife it seems the best thing to do is shoot with deadly force bc the danger to the public is quite clear these days however it seems that suspects are released after some very serious crimes i don t know how to make sense of it it certainly seems like the general safety of the public is not primary and we know that america has the highest incarceration rate in the world beating out china and india the most populated countries in the world so there s that
fyi just because an assailant turns their back after trying to stab you doesn t mean they have a can t shoot me now card there are instances such as posing a physical threat to another individual or endangering the public where shooting an assailant in the back is justified i point this out because it seems most people just think turn your back run away automatic cops can t shoot me
one in the spine would make sure that never happens again
god the sh t our cops go through this is why i always support cops
good cop
this is like that long forgotten ideal that under our justice system it is worse for an innocent person to be arrested and jailed than for a guilty person to get away if there are still people getting merced by the cops i don t give a shit what this guy did does he need a cookie he filled out the application
excellent take down and great use of procedure in using leads than lethal taser my very first thought on the approach was make him show his hands before you get too close
stabby mcstabstab
a running taser shot amazing
went from not in trouble to attempted murder good going idiot
when you re not sure what hand to put the gun and taser in so you just hold them both as a single unit
the phrase is show me your hands
officer should have seen that coming a mile off kid had his left hand hidden behind his back the whole time they were talking
ia is gonna give him shit for not telling subject to show their hands
watching people getting tased is never not funny
just for anyone who wants to see a an ex cop break this down here is a link to donut operator s vid https://youtu.be/3z1mgmfg6ja
u know kid was hiding something in that left hand surprised he didn t have taser out asking to show both hands
those cuffs would be tight as a ring on a finger also glad he tazed him extra too
not being able to see his left hand had me nervous the whole time
good that he didn t go for the pistol but never drop your pistol regardless of the situation
so relieved when he hit triangle
of course he had logan paul merch
how about a magic trick motion i m gonna make all these pixels disappear
the cops tone when he has to call for an ems got me its like fine sigh i guess ill get checked up hope he is all good bc that was some good policework and im sorry to go there but if this guy can take in this man alive it shows how many other cops have pulled the trigger too fast we need all police to be trained just like this once his life was out of danger and the kid was running away from him he assessed the situation and pulled out the taser if the kid was running toward him with a knife then it would have been a different story
ok gunpoint and bush
totally thought he was gonna start blasting good to see

shark s attempt looks successful
whoever built that is an idiot looks like plexi vs a shark
how i treat fresh pastries behind the glass
i see they went with the backyard patio quality plexiglass instead of the bulletproof variety that was bold choice given their subject is a predator roughly the mass of a mid size sedan
that s not a cage it s a serving dish
quint what d ya have there a portable shower or a monkey cage hooper anti shark cage quint anti shark cage you go inside the cage hooper nods quint cage goes in the water you go in the water shark s in the water our shark sings quint farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies farewell and adieu you ladies of spain for we ve received orders for to sail back to boston and so nevermore shall we see you again
excuse me while i change my underpants
there s nothing like watching your ultimate terrifying nightmare just before bed night night everyone imagine i ll be changing the sheets tomorrow
they made such a lovey gift box for the shark he tore it open with pure excitement
i am unsure how much nope can fit in one video but for me this one is right up there
this game is going to be crazy
maybe you ll want to use an actual cage next time
where s the full video did the diver get eaten
r thalassaphobia will love this
did did get out of there
shark watching yet another thing to add to the list of things where cheaper is not necessarily better
they forgot the cage that was the first mistake
fish are friends you re food
can confirm
whoever built that wanted to feed the diver to the shark
you have to use at least everybody knows that
military grade vs reality
that was a bold choice cotton let s see if it pays off for em
dead eyes like a doll s eyes
even if the diver was killed he wasn t he likely wouldn t be eaten almost all shark related deaths are entirely by accident or the fault of the human its very rare for sharks of any size to view humans as a food source
don t seem to be livin
oh i see it s ok then just a little mistaken identity when that giant killing machine rips you in half
that s actually exactly it lmao these animals are muscle and can weigh up to tons their gentle is more than capable of killing a human being so yes it is the divers and engineers behind this stunt at fault for this incident
i m being sarcastic the people are stupid here but just saying it s just an accident they wouldn t eat someone intentionally is kind of funny like that doesn t help someone being ripped apart also why wouldn t a shark eat us i thought humans were extra sugar filled and sweet wouldn t that be like a treat
so when i say sharks i m specifically talking about great whites given that s the species featured in the video and great whites aren t particularly interested in sugar they are interested in oil blubber and fat things that a healthy human diver have in comparatively small quantities compared to seals whales and other marine mammals that s why great whites despite killing humans in slightly larger quantities than other sharks aren t known for eating humans humans are too skinny and too boney for these creatures to consider food that doesn t stop them from test biting so to speak as seen in the video so when deaths occur its normally a case of too large and too powerful of an animal for a test bite not to be fatal
i remember catching little sharks off the piers they are so damn strong at that size i can t imagine being in the jaws of a large great white
electrosensitive tinfoil hats hate this not so simple trick
this is kind of genius because since it s a cactus people won t be touching it very often to see if it s fake

sounds like they ventured into native territory municipal police are not allowed on tribal land
why the music adds nothing
when city boys are sent to a rural detachment lol
trying to figure out why one of the cops is wearing a face mask while walking through the woods
i get why they aren t supposed to be there but i think maybe some more solid directions would be nice and even more efficient on getting them out
waste deep in snow with his tongue shined dress shoes get out of there police are causing the high of their own problems
i d appreciate a little context as to why they were being dicks to these two officers or w e they are
is compassion not part of tribal ideology
everyone in this video are stupid
i don t really know what is going on there except that woman is some loud mouthed pain in the ass she is going to get her assed kicked if she goes around cussing people out like that
removed
this if you notice the tiktok watermark it is tiachicome their profile lists them as an indigenous right advocate there is no way that a cop would let a random citizen talk to them like this or listen to their demands they fucked up and they know it they are looking for a way out and hoping they don t get reported to the tribal police or have a complaint filed against them
these are rcmp officers they ve got enforcement abilities everywhere
ok boomer
lol the winter has been the only time i still use my fabric ones from the pandemic maybe he just didn t want his face to be cold
teach them a lesson next time they are thinking about going out in the woods they will think twice
it appears that they are rcmp officers royal canadian mounted police which are canada s federal police the lady talking to them is an indigenous person it sounds like the officers are on native lands reservation which they are not supposed to be on native lands have their own tribal police it s legal for them to be there but they wouldn t be the ones enforcing any laws they would defer to tribal police the native population is for good reason very wary and mistrustful of canada s police especially if they are sticking their nose into native affairs i can t speak to this specific encounter but it looks like the rcmp officers just got caught probably looking for someone and they know they don t really have any jurisdiction to be there so they re just trying to minimize damages
it s up above
they re rcmp officers trespassing on indigenous land due to the history of rcmp officers trespassing on indigenous land to abduct and murder indigenous children it s a bit of a contentious topic
no these cops are where they are not supposed to be and they know it they are not allowed to conduct police actions against tribal members on reservation land she caught them dead to rights this isn t just a private property issue they are actively breaking federal law they damn well know it and they are trying to talk their way out of her filing a complaint with tribal authorities
if you wanna call other people stupid you can t be flipping between singular and plural within a sentence that short
you re ignorant and dont understand what s happening refer to aceoftoons comment he explained why she is being loud mouthed pain in the ass with every right to be
it wouldn t be the first time a cop was shot on tribal land
lick the boot harder
definitely
or permanently missing in the woods
you obviously have never been on a rez
gen y here what does the music add
yeez this is so unfathomable for me as a swede we have right to roam and basically you can go anywhere you want in nature pick berries and mushrooms anywhere you want and so on
makes them seem more stupid too i guess lol
i mean it s clear that they already know that they re out of place and they re doing their best to leave as quick as they can not helping just prolongs how much time they spend in the place they aren t supposed to be in you find a guy trespassing in a private building it would make more sense to show him to an exit than to just tell him to go in a direction and hope he finds one
i feel like it s worth elaborating by adding that the rcmp has a very very very bad history with the first nations of canada including ripping children away from their families to take them to residential schools where they were raped and beaten and it hasn t really gotten significantly better for example they are being used to strong arm the nation of wet suwet en who are protesting a company attempting to build a pipeline across their territory this has resulted in deaths of protestors in general it s a good idea to be wary of cops and try to protect your rights but the first nations people need to be even more so also the rcmp are notorious for lying especially in regards to the first nations so when they say that they are known to lie it s very accurate honestly i don t think that they are being that rude we don t have the full context as the video picks up part way through the interaction but it s likely the rcmp have already been a bit argumentative from the tone and the fact that they felt there was a need to start recording the interaction
as canada s federal police the rcmp has jurisdiction throughout canada just like the fbi in the united states although providing general police services within areas that have other police forces is not within their mandate they certainly have jurisdiction to make an arrest anywhere within canada s borders
canadian indigenous people don t just use the maple syrup they use every part of the tree
ok that pretty much excuses the shitty ass behavior from the other individuals then s
one small correction stop deep throating the whole boot
lol uh you d obviously be wrong in response to your disbelief look up first nations policing program
millennial here why the music
i don t know it s a fucking tiktok i m it was a joke
you don t have cops like ours though
the nordic freedom to roam everyman s right is a great thing to have so much freedom to do things and enjoy the nature
removed
so wait you guys can just go on to someone s property and it s okay as long as you don t make a mess
same in scotland aside from mod land for obvious reasons
they were on reservation indigenous land they are not allowed to be there by law
that s what i said just last week when i was trespassing at cvs i got arrested and i dun told the judge clearly i m lost it s not like i m tryna set the place on fire again i just thought it was a walgreens but he still fucked me wasn t even my fault i wandered in there there wasn t no signs or nothing
tribal land or not you can be as shitty to a cop as you want i have the right to voice my grevences with my government when they fuck up i ll let them know and if they retaliate then that s a violation of my right so in don t give a shit what you think of my behavior the police are civil servants not royalty i ll respect them when they respect me
when they re members of the same organization that abducted your grandparents to be raped and murdered by the government you tend not to have much respect for them
you mean narcs nah i m good
yikes
that s true
well lappland is that kind of land for indigenous and there was some really shady shit going on for a long time here aswell but you can still walk on any land you want if you don t leave any other trace than footprints
yes you can pass thru pins with animals aswell as long as you close after yourself you can camp anywhere if it s not to close to someones house then you have to ask for permission or if there is other official reasons you can t like where endangered plants grow it s pretty damn chill compared to the us i guess
what s mod land tried to google and all i got was minecraft mods
i get that also heard those areas have been shrinking and shrinking
i m not sure if that s a perfect analogy but i see the error in my thought process chalk it up to cops being stupid like always
ok that pretty much excuses the shitty ass behavior from the other individuals then s
you do realize and have most likely seen a recording of it that cops have no qualms on being disrespectfyl to a civilian to lie to harass to bully to beat up incarcerate and outright fucking kill you if they so choose and they always have a partner or another unit to testify on their behalf how does the bacon and boot taste it tastes like blocking with lightspeed after writing a useless comment apparently
learn your rights and stop licking the boot
all that shit just for me not to read why don t you send me another response for me to ignore
you re only if ignoring them because you can t read lmao

i just find it very ironic that a state conceived out of the horrors of ww2 to give a safe place for jewish people has now a right wing party that prosecutes anyone that doesn t go along with its views and beliefs
this is so fucked up but if you say anything against jews you are antisemitic
every year this happens the palestinians cannot have one ramadan in peace soon the bombings will start to test the new israeli war weapons so they can sell them to usa and their ucrainian war all business power land control zionist are the devil
context
removed
the israelis must be shot exactly as they are doing to the palestinian
religion is fun
honestly at this point regardless of what side you re on if you re a religious fanatic and you deserve what you get
oh fun another free palestine post which totally ignores history
sorry if this is a dumb question i have almost no knowledge about geopolitics but why would the us and the uk vote no in the un when asked if they want israel to stop this torture even their best friend india voted yes
some media said that palestinians were barricading and throwing rockets so israeli authorities had to intervene other media said that its the holy month of ramadhan and authorities were harassing and injuring worshippers backed up by the new far right government
oh wait they re just muslims lol never mind let the beatings continue s defend your downvotes
eventually the more people start putting things together
cuz y know freedm
how would that be a solution
what history israelis forcibly removing palenstinians from their homes
because if the israeli lobby in those countries
so a he said she said situation where the truth is more grey than black and white so in the end everyone just believes the story that lines up with their political views continuing the cycle of hating each other more and more all egged on by the media
i m inclined to believe the latter as there is no signs of damage or debris to back up hostile claims this is one of those events that will be taught as authoritarian propaganda and cruelty towards people of faith
tit for tat
the story is a tad bit more complex than that though isn t it
considering that one part is illegally invading and occupying another state and ethically erasing them there s a plain case of apartheid there s no lining with a horrible side that just wants power and money
nailed that one better than jesus could ve
correctamundo
still have to consider if the violence of the state institutions are reasonable
bingo nobody makes money off of peace unless it s after a large war and you are the only one with manufacturing plants left in the world
that s not very jesus of you
right contrary to what many people think violence is sometimes the solution to a bigger problem for example it is hard to argue against the violent force used to eliminate osoma binladin yes i probably misspelled his name but f that dude or the violent force used against hitler in wwii or wh n the police have to use violent force to stop an active shooter violence is not pretty but there are times when it needs to be used was it needed to preserve law and order in this situation hard to say without more info both the government and protesters of a government have the capacity to be a holes that need to be delt with
i m not looking for jesus rather than for equal justice have a happy cake day
neither are people who say that the world belongs to them and them alone and that anybody who isn t one of them should be considered less than cattle in other words israelis
but is biblical leviticus
i agree that sometimes violence is necessary but you can see clearly that they were outside and did not barricade they were not a threat and it is a place to worship and they were worshiping
maybe it does look like they are clearing the entire square not just the folks praying if you look in the background
lol do people really not understand how putting large quantities of hydrophobic powder in your mouth is gonna turn out
this had to be satire right
want to bet they also posted a no graffiti sign
at least they left it in front of here instead of here
i mean it is very difficult to leave wood chip hanging from a piece of paper so i guess people obeyed the here
woodchips look better than the graffiti

it s either psychotic parents or a crazy tv producer
i believe in past life stuff and all that but the way he talks sounds coached when my brother was really small he told my mom he didn t like being in the car at night because when he was a big boy named david it was night time when the crash happened my brothers name isn t david but his middle name is
lil dude probably just has a fear of highest or was shown a video and is now scared that it might happen again
guys if phobias are linked to past trauma why the frick am i deathly afraid of crickets
the kid knows how to fly too just not land
there s a follow up they found the name of the person he allegedly was and the boy met with a man who was a friend of that guy after talking with the boy for a while he was convinced it was him the video of them meeting is on yt make of it what you will
bruh
nah fam he was a part of in a past life he was just the pilot make of that what you will s but how hilarious would it be if he looked at his mom one day and said alah akbar mom
he was the tower that s why he s so scared
fuq u cade and f your parents too
stupid people stupid people
my brother was scared of planes after seeing live on tv the only logical explanation is that when the victims died their souls went back in time and one of them was reincarnated as my brother all other explanations like that shit is scary simply do not make sense
the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming the crickets are coming
what i make of it is it was all fabricated to generate views on their channel new series which it did
what
children of the corn jihad edition
oh dear god no d
and you and op of the comment you replied to just perpetuated it helping their view count
bruh
yeah but not really upvotes and i m only exposing the absurdity that wasn t recognized before look at the comments for the video and everyone thinks it s real which is kind of sad
no i know just hearing about it suggests how absurd the claim is any claim like this is really imo even if it were true so what what does it do to realize you actually had a past life and you happened to be someone at i don t think it gives the victims families or friends any more or less peace either

pretty sure i saw the cat whisper as salaam alaikum before he jumped down
you can tell the dudes a real one nice and gentle with the cat
i think the cat mistook a call to prayer for a call to dinner
from the looks of it they are buddies and this is a common occurence for the imam
this is wholesome dude doesn t even flinch and is totally chill with being clawed by a kitteh
you sir passed the cat test
that s dedicated prayer
cat was just lookin to share the love with his fellow church members gif giphy mdj9ibxxvduqm
i m not a religious person but i admire this man s concentration and commitment to the performance and his audience
y all didn t know r catsaremuslim
translation for those interested he is reading qoran to the polytheists will argue had it been allah s will neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with him in worship or made anything unlawful likewise those before them rejected the truth until they tasted our punishment ask them o prophet do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us surely you follow nothing but false assumptions and you do nothing but lie say allah has the most conclusive argument had it been his will he would have easily imposed guidance upon all of you
he s saying a meowslim prayer
what an amazing voice
he sounds nice
kitty likes the prays
a catwah was issued
lol this is cool
heeeeeeeere s my butt
man if catholic church was that lit back in the day i would be going there every sunday just to vibe fr
this warmed my heart
a good man prays with his cat when they can t leave him be
i guess his outfit does kinda look like a cat tower lol
you gotta admire the man s dedication to his faith when he can continue praying with a cat s asshole to his face
there s devout and there s ignore adorable kitty devout
he passed allah s ultimate test
in islam cats are regarded as holy animals and are revered for their cleanliness they would be welcome in a mosque
in fairness he sounds somewhat like cats about to fight cat is just confirming the source of the noise
and so the cia shelves project interrupting pussy
evil has many faces sometimes cute ones
pretty sure cat butt to face would nullify one s wudu
gif giphy 14u6vffnol7tzq
well there is at least one muslim i like now
it was trying to figure out how to turn him off

awe
nyanadan in full swing
i know this guy is chill as hell
i was expecting the cat to get up in the mic and go mmmmmroooow
affection for cats is apart of faith i m not a muslim but there s one thing that i will agree with them our daily life can be miserable and boring when we have no cats in it but when you put a cat in that same routine of your daily life doesn t matter if you re mad about something or somebody the moment you see and spent time with that cat all of those things that you were originally mad or upset about you will have forgotten all about it cats are truly amazing
very beautiful
when a cat does this they really love you
doesn t even try to push him away just starts petting him this guys great
just a prank bro
r catsareassholes
disappointed we didn t get a big meow into that mic
the video took a bit to load and i assumed it was some guy trying to disrupt their prayers but it turned out to be wholesome
absolutely and also imam see you after taraweeh
the uncle in the left casually looking up and realising its just a cat
mutual love n respect
that was the first thing i thought this is a pretty good endorsement for the character of someone i have never met that a cat would be like that to them
imam you promised fish after taraweeh dont forget
imam been through it a lot of times with him
i believe cats are revered in islam not certain but pretty sure
and never forgets a single verse while reciting hats
cat community welcomes you to their secret society
yes i would have been freaked to death
lol asking for food i guess after fasting all day
and termites are catholic
mashallah
you must be a hafeej or someone arabian to realize what s being said
i am literally crying rn
lol
yes prophet muhammad s a w one day performed wadhu by water which was drunk by a cat
we get to know in modern times that cats saliva has detergent like properties which keeps them clean
lol
i knew i knew someone who hates muslims will change watching this i dont need upvotes my post is successful i wont say most muslims are like this caring and sober but a significant amount are thanks
why would it try to turn it off
her probably that s a dilute calico
no the prophet had a cat
cat rule only go on human when they don t want you there avoid all other contact and give pedantic look
when cats sniff rub your cheek that s the moment i cry with laughter fair play to him
he waiting for iftar
that went right over my head
it was just a little joke i don t really hate or love muslims i m jew i was born in ukraine and moved to israel when i was years old im now i don t have hate for any kind of people because of their religion and beliefs we are all the same eventually
sorry i regreted after writing him
yes and watch the uncle on the left soside
anyways those words warmed my heart no hate to you or anyone but i want to remove the stereotype towards muslims and islam many muslims are suffering because of this thats why even a small thing can change someones life
funniest shit here is that we have drive up only atm machines that have braille on them
given the way a lot of people drive the braille is necessary

r kidsarefuckingstupid
next time put cones that way atleast no water is poured when someone is stupid enough to walk on non solidified concreet
all that water on the concrete is far worse than the dent she made it hurts to watch
and just letting that water flow
some kids are fucking stupid
when i was young they d often but up a few sticks and connect them with string for some strange reason people understood what they meant
all that water messed it up more then she did
when are some people going to realize that barricades around wet cement are not suggestions
wet concrete
oh man her falling in there sucks but thats fixable all that water spilling in there on the other hand concrete is totally shot ooof
that floated concrete looked like shit anyhow she did them a favor
oof that shit burns too she ll learn a lesson from that
still how do you see all that different crap on the driveway and not think maybe i ll go another way it s like kids these days can t problem solve at all and this is not a complex problem
poor kid she s probably no older than or just running around having fun and then gets a face full of cement probably didn t even see the string since it s so thin and the people in these comments so quick to judge like they never had a lapse in perception as a young kid or even as an adult
this should be under kids are assholes
bad site management not her fault
who has that many water jugs versus hell anything else for a barrier
self completing failed barricade easier to chip out if an idiot does this and spills the water too
lmao footprints and jugs of water they gonna have to tear that whole shit up and redo it
if she cleaned it off right away she might have not got her skin burned from the wet concrete should ve been taped off
if you are running those jugs are at knee height no way most people will see them just use something taller and more visible
to be fair somebody cheaped out and didn t put caution tape and that string was like a trip line so she couldn t have seen it was supposed to be a solid barrier who the hell uses water jugs instead of cones anyway
i m fucking pissed off by this video
at least the stupid child is fine i am really glad that she is o k
came here to comment this lol
i saw a grown ass man do this too
why the hell are they using water jugs and string as a barricade
or at least keep the lid for the bottles
they use the jugs because if they re knocked over then the water leaks out and the concrete stops from drying meaning they can come back to the site and fix whatever accidents happened
it s a kid i would think unaware what the string meant or what wet pour looks like rather than a stupid act
you can see the water infiltrate the concrete up past the two yellow poles
no kidding that concrete gonna turn so brittle
water is an essential component when making concrete the moisture that water provides also gives concrete its strength during the curing process while water is one of the most important ingredients in concrete it can also be the most destructive in excessive amounts
they need to put up a proper barricade with cones or at least some caution tape
thanks cap
gif giphy 6hzclwqq7ah4fpnr59
who runs through people s yards through a neighborhood while looking the opposite direction who sees a perimeter of jugs or anything and doesn t have a second thought about what they re seeing it is her fault
yep if it s open to the public and you don t prepare for the stupidest person you ever met coming by that s on you
as fifteen gallons of water pour into the concrete
guess had the jugs needed something to weigh them down diy
poor ass country
i wish i could tell you but this is against so many whs regularions
cone cost something jugs cost nothing dont underestimate how poor some countries are
that much water will fuck the load anyways it will need to be chipped out later or the effected area shovelled out now and add more concrete with the appropriate slump
ugh yeah that s painful
whatever you do don t add any sugar
yes but if you finish concrete then you know this is on the destructive side of that
they could use concrete barriers to prevent this but then they would need even more jugs to protect those
we use caution tape at my company but people seem to just take caution while they duck under it
not because it was already wet but because water is spilling on the wet cement oh stop it you
maybe she hasn t seen something like that before and doesn t know what it s for she s probably just playing around outside plus there should absolutely be one or two workers keeping track of the site
that may have actually helped depending on certain circumstances i believe
you re answering why water was used at all not why water was put into the jugs lol
that s true that s most likely the intention be easier to chip out
we ve discovered what made roman concrete so strong
i was gonna say that even if you re young it s not too hard to see a whole strung up barricade and think maybe i shouldn t go there but now i m kind of on the fence hah cause i went to look back and that string is really hard to see looked probably more like a bunch of water bottles just sitting around in a square still kinda dumb but also more understandable especially for a kid
what
needed something to weigh them down
and their buildings taste so good
i still stand by the who runs through other people s yards and while looking the opposite way that you re running it s her fault she tripped it s also unfortunate that there was a giant slab of wet concrete where she fell but the biggest point is that it doesn t matter she s a kid kids make mistakes and that s okay that was hopefully the day she learned to watch where she s going
you explained why the jugs were filled with water but the question was why were jugs and string used as a barricade
yeah at the end of the day i m definitely in the annoying for the people laying concrete but not a tragedy kids are gonna kid camp
diy also the other guy wasn t me
oh sry

i m reminded of a line from archer oh right because you just walked into strippers discount warehouse and said help me showcase my intellect
man i love conan he s impossible to embarrass so good in any interview situation handled her almost as well as jennifer garner been listening to his xm channel recently and he s truly one of the best to do it
girl my eyes are up here guy i ve made my choice
i doubt it if conan o brien is really embarrassed it s more like what do you expect
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=te6srbndhx8 this is her talent far exceeding the pussycat dolls her talent is so real time mark or watch the whole thing you won t regret it
conan and craig ferguson are the real deal lol
i thought this would be the with jennifer garner lol
conan whipping his head around reminds me of a cockatoo doing the same lol iirc his hair style was compared to the bird too
love it he totally owned it
i mean i don t want people to see my butthole i ve never not worn non butthole covering pants i know this vid is jokes and all but it reminded me of people who were genuinely upset when someone looked at a part of them that is usually covered by most clothing other than the ones they decided to wear that day lol
i m with conan on this one y all
removed
conan is untouchable
they were looking at me first
don t look at these heaving bosoms
honestly don t even know who she is even after reading her name but she does have a nice set of tatas
she s the girl at the gym complaining about creeps looking at her camel toe you wore it
the overexaggeration act and he still looked again focus you expect me not to look big exaggeration skit a big long stare with mouth open
conan doing a quad take there i like to see him pull out the big comedic guns
aaooooga
conan is the goat
he was focusing
removed
what did she expected
how to never get booked on a talk show again
basically she wanted the attention
who s the girl
sorry what
removed
if there s one thing i ve learned about conan over the years is dudes a freaking perve but i guess it s ok if you re part of hollywood scene
boat or moat
based
hahaha first time seeing this hilarious
then quit puttin then out there jeez what s a guy to do
i m amazed he didn t just put his feet up on the desk and just ignore the entire time after that that s what i would have done and never had her back ever again
jesus what the hell is wrong with the men on this thread i wonder how many women are made to feel uncomfortable because such men can t keep their eyes to themselves such an assaulter mentality to think that just because a girl has some cleavage showing one can just stare like that so disrespectful let it be a glance not a stare how hard is that and conan could have just played it off and apologised instead of leaning into it also this is a few years old pretty sure if he tried this now people would not be pleased edit the downvotes are a yet another indicator of why so many women have been sexually harassed assaulted in the world too many men think this disgustingly
how old is this if he did this now booooooy lol they d call him all types of predator
isn t it staged you know tv on another note what a beautiful woman such sensuality is wow how old is she and that smile
he looked like an angry cockatoo when he moved like that
bro started howling
like larry said in curb you wore that dress so people won t stare at your shoes is that it
who even was that woman
ask yourself this question why would he be doing this
conan is the best
fuck it just doesn t get better than prime archer
for those who haven t seen it https://youtu.be/pjvnzwtnfbk
im surprised everyone wasnt freaking out because he did a sexual like that tbh
that s a homer simpson line
he would be cancelled for this now
dude has been in the comedy scene and hosting before she probably even famous so it s a futile thing to try
if only there was a subreddit to showcase the there was an attempt to do something but you failed to do that thing
that was where the attempt part comes into play
this is all rehearsed lmao he probably wrote this joke
something tells me you didn t finish the video
it s more like well you know me
i think he s so funny and quick because he s embarrassed all the time and since a small child has developed a fantastic defense mechanism
there was an attempt
wow i did not think she could sing like that it s too bad she went the pussycat dolls route i think most people myself included just figured she was just a pretty face some music exec threw together for a girl group
as soon as the song started i knew which part you linked because that is some hard singing and she freaking nailed it
was truly amazing thank you for this gif giphy nmbkinb7h3tiv3bo8d
holy shit i had no idea i just gained like respect points for her
ferguson is wild because more often than not it s the female guests that are flirty or make inappropriate comments to him first i get that he s known for being racy but a lot of his guests lean into it
fun fact i ve been motorboated by a cockatoo
your comment was removed because it was found to be hateful in nature please treat others as you would like to be treated and do not spread hate on this subreddit
ok boomer
you must attend the most mild strip club if you think that s what a stripper wears lmfao
thats just for my million ig followers it s disgusting if you look irl
you wore it yikes bro this has the same energy as she was asking for it wearing that you do realize that right this line of thinking is inherently misogynistic check yourself
dude you can dress sexy i support your slutty choices
that s rough fella
i dont see how womens bodies just existing has to be sexual or some kind of statement men can go around shirtless and it s fine but women s chests are somehow different not fair also you re weird
nicole scherzinger
lol i was sleepy i thought u were asking if conan is a girl or the guest
calm down it s a late night comedy show everyone s joking around
assaulter mentality
well now we know why he s a famous interviewer and you re not i guess
you do realize there is always the chance that this was scripted right sometimes the things on tv are fake i know unbelievable but it s true
why would you display your giant cleavage if it s not to be looked at it men looking at it makes you uncomfortable don t display it
i mean it s a lot of cleavage out being pushed up to make it pop if i walked around with half my dick hanging out you don t think people would look
some cleavage
hey bozo its a skit and it s scripted calm down you also must be fun at parties like holy shit
agreed idk why you re being downvoted either egregious
an amazing singer
gif giphy osxqmbruishwc1zfxz i miss it
first seasons were the best even with that shitty animation
phrasing
the feeling of conan busting out the dictionary is how i feel when someone on reddit goes on a virtual crusade to be right only to be owned badly never admit or acknowledge it and eventually slink away
i know they say no one is perfect but they have not seen this woman good lord
it s late night show accepted that things can get a bit risqu and naughty
from a guy who used to write homer simpson s lines too
conan is right there presenting man
conan s good at making jokes like this without offending anyone this is also most likely scripted making it all in jest
news flash no one cares and no one will
you can delete probably conan was famous and in the comedy scene almost before she was born friend conan was hired at saturday night live in but he graduated from harvard in where he was a writer for the harvard lampoon humor magazine he was a writer for the magazine as early as the woman in this clip was born in she became famous while conan was already a comedy king
and will be famous long after she isn t
let s be honest it wasn t the pussycat dolls it was nicole and her backup dancers
she can t find opportunities in classical opera theater so she went pop now that she is famous she is going back to what she originally wanted to do
why is it bad she wanted to be famous and she succeeded
blows my mind everytime

is there any basis to his statements like did the other person actually play dirty or something i didn t follow the race do i don t know
this is definitely a good thing for wisconsin
everyone in office or a government type job refuses to speak like a normal person
i wouldn t be surprised if he was right though
hahahaha america
no he is mad that he lost a race that he should have won considering wisconsin s embarrassingly anti voter district lines he is an idiot
if this pos would have won the gqp agenda of no abortions the legislature s gerrymandered maps which gave them a majority would have been written in stone

cost cutting by have a dual role dj bouncer
mon night s at applebee s be off the chain
my man thought they were going through his search history
plot twist the first guy is the dj
djs get high strung because people are always one drink away from spilling all over their expensive shit
i wonder if the kid asked him to play stairway to heaven half unconscious on the ground towards the end that he got mad a second time
he shouldn t have been touching it but godamn idk why he came in that fucking hard
pusher is jack millz you won t find much on him because he delete all his social media after participating in jan 6th insurrection https://www.videodjbooking.com/artists/jackmillz/
moby s gotten aggressive in his old age
let me set this next beat while i put my foot in your ass
dude is an idiot for messing with his gear and the dj is a fucking psycho
at one wedding last year i returned from the men s to find a guest standing behind my console headphones on touching shit i wanted to body slam him like the video but being a wedding i had to be more discreet so i said loudly dude what the actual fuck he slinked off to the nearest table where everyone was giggling i went over to him and told him that gear is how i make my living and he was fucking with a 20k investment not amused i don t know what would possess someone to think it is ok to do that
as a former dj total fucking over reaction to physically assault someone at that level
don t touch other people s stuff don t try to kill people that touch your stuff
gif giphy hidxrnaszevq5xrcvr downsized
basically me if i see someone start to type a p into my search bar
smashvidz
at the very end dj took his headphones off and was going back for seconds
that s assault brother
x gone give it to ya
right i swear to christ everytime we hear a what the fuck in the background it s the same goddamn person across the entire internet like the fish who keeps screaming my leg in spongebob during chaos
dudes gonna be selling that dj equipment after the kid presses charges
that dude had something on his laptop he didn t want discovered
what an asshole that was an overreaction
that really seems like an excessive and probably criminal reaction assault at least
i found the dude whose adult children no longer speak to him
bet he wouldn t have done that if the dude was bigger than him
the dj is insane and should probably see a counselor for anger issues
you can hear the tbi that was a little much
touching his stuff was wrong but dj is a psycho and needs to catch charges
that was quite the overreaction
that s assault plain and simple
i thought that was charlie kelly at the beginning of the clip lmao
that guy has something bad on the computer
no the kid is young no experience going out he just needed a warning guy should be charged with assault real a hole
the kid shouldn t have been doing it but that was just too much and unwarranted
that s a pretty strong reaction for somebody who djs at a pizza hut
hope that dj got charged with assault
lawyer here enjoy that assault charge dj what a giant asshole
i thought that was charley day at the start when i glanced lol
they took my hair my youth and my will to live but i ll be damned if they touch my dj equipment
my mother in law is a dj and honestly i understand this reaction that equipment is surprisingly fragile and extremely expensive not to mention it s the dudes livelihood
when you accidentally trigger a boss fight you weren t at all prepared for
i think this may be the same guy https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/100wnbo/to_prank_someone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
was that charlie kelly in the beginning
now he can change his name to djail
he didn t want him finding the little kid pictures
didn t know the dodgers security guy was a dj on the weekend
bit extreme for an olive garden
lots of hard guy wannabes here trying to defend assault against a minor
looks like a restaurant birthday party fuck this dj what a piece of shit person
i once had a drunk dude pick up my instrument at a wedding went behind the stage and got it hard scenario to deal with i had to calmly talk him into putting my valuable instrument down without breaking it he was blabbering i m jamming duuude i seriously wanted to slap the piss out of him but then it would have been a broken instrument probably a hospital bill who knows what else a lost pay check for ruining a wedding i kind of felt powerless lol no way to win that was the last time i left my instrument out of the case on a job situations like this all i can think is the guy has a drink spills it and zaps the turntable or his arm grabs ahold of it on the way down
fat boy looks for excuses to hit people
don t touch his shit
dj fatboi shows no mercy
sir this is a wendy s
ok the guy was out of line but holy shit that response from the dj was vicious
great lawsuit right there
bit fucking over the top no
this dude just got himself banned from wherever this is will likely get his name spread around not in the way he hopes from the court case he just caught after assaulting a minor and hopefully that kid learned a lesson also why was someone filming for a tiktok
i don t look for conflict am not particularly hot headed and strive to be a pacifist but if a stranger put his hands on me like that dj put his hands on that guy i think i might actually snap all bets would be off that man would think twice for the rest of his life about whether or not the person he hits could bring him to within an inch of his life with their bare hands
some fool tried to update my mac when i was performing i was like wtf is wrong with you had to do a hard reset to stop it from updating
as a dj i ve had this happen i completely put them on blast over the mic nobody touches my stuff but me and my partner
lmao dudes just mad he s 50yo djing a dive bar
trains coming through the fucks wrong with youuu
next dedicated to our fella young friend on the way to the hospital can t touch this by mc hammer edit credit to right artist
i can feel god in this chilis tonight
i think the dj had a few too many tabs open on his browser
dj harshmello
literally anyone can be a dj
enjoy jail mr dj
this is assault i would sue his ass also the kid wasn t touching his expensive shit he was looking up the song list on the computer deej probably thought the kid was going through his moms naked pics
so what happened to the dj did he get away with that i just have to ask
so assault charges on the dj right
looks like the dj let the music stop so probably a young amateur was trying to save him by maybe clicking play or whatever they do i get being mad but shoving the kid against the wall and what this is in an applebees
jesus christ he did not have to push him that hard
i hate people like this dj is obviously a child its a teen looking at his very sub par dj setup no need to push someone will full force when you weight 100lbs over them definitely a lawsuit
i mean i know it s expensive equipment but i feel like the dj overreacted a little bit
that s assault brotha
kid is an idiot dj comitted assault
way over the top reaction
they don t call him dj bad temper for nothing
bro that gear can cost up to 30k for top of the line equipment plus it s someone s way of making money i don t condone the level of violence but i understand the frustration
overkill
to be fair that dj equipment can be ruined by a drink instantly that ain t cheap
bit of an overreaction but don t fuck with the dude s shit man i ve had my bass and guitar strings fucked with during a show and it fucking enraged me
looks like assault to me
guy pressed back back forward and flew in like raiden
yeah that s assault
whether he touches your shit or not what do you do if the kid slammed his head and don t wake up that equipment is meaningless if your in jail because you didn t handle your business like an adult first and not like a thug right of the bat
guy got shoved so hard he s in the back rooms
djing isn t cheap
dude sounds like danny devito
nah dj after a take down like that you gotta put on a rager
i swear djs have the worst temperament especially the ones that aren t very good i tried to talk to a friend who was djing once who brushed me off and i shrugged but later she came up to me and screamed at me not to interrupted her while she s on set it wasn t like she was hands on with the set or anything just listening and sliding bars into new songs it was a small club bar and she acted like she was at some huge show i just wanted to say hi and maybe ask what song was currently playing cuz no way would i know how to asked that later anyway have plenty of other dj friends who would never act in such a way and are chill af just confused the shit out of me that she d act so ego headed about it
big angry bald man
harold has been waiting for that moment
that dj was wrong to put his hands on that person he over reacted
yeah assault charge incoming dude it s just equipment

a three wheeled cycle would be called a tricycle
erm a tricycle tri meaning wheels
surrounded by pure genious thank you for being so articulate to correct a not wrong adjective to describe a mode of transportation you both a literary savants and should be teaching at any of the major universities
i think in this case it s considered a try cycle
he should have tried it with a two wheeled tricycle instead
are you on rumspringa
i wanted to say tricycle but everyone said it first
genius you re a
first time welcome to the downvote club
it is wrong a three wheeled bicycle is saying a three wheeled two wheeled unmotorized vehicle it s like calling a bicycle a two wheeled unicycle

was she going to try to stuff it in that gigantic purse of hers
i legit thought she was going to piss on it or something
she pulled the banner from underneath herself
ends too soon
it makes complete sense that a magat would try to steal the rug they re currently standing on
i really hate how it s common to stop videos just after people fall or do whatever dumb thing they where doing can we start recording the aftermath let us see them bask in the embarrassment of their stupidity
that was funny
this strange performative art piece epitomizes the trump era pretty well i d say
most athletic trump supporter
she had a plan until she didn t
unintentional self satire is the best satire
fucking maga cultists the times married adulterer who openly brags about it openly talks about banging his own daughter attacks those he disagrees with openly mocks people with disabilities calls for acts for sedition and terrorism caters to racists and literal nazis and is a massive cheat and failure of a businessman are who republicans have sworn their entire identity to god republicans are the dumbest fucking people to exist and or they re all cultists they give the cult like fanaticism of the north korean people a run for their money
removed
too much cushion and nobody pushin
if the roles were reversed the trumpanzees would be screeching about muh first mendments and freedumbs and stuff in other words we only want to suppress speech we don t like f them
i like the part when she falls over
her follow through is as good as trump s
literally a bottle of spoiled milk in a dress and a red hat
i m glad so many of us had the same impulse she s gonna shit on this flag isn t she
didn t hurt the pavement i hope
this is the kind chick that has a maga themed wedding
maga will fly flags put pro trump wraps and stickers all over their vehicles yell let s go brandon every chance they get brandish and threaten with firearms but lose their shit when others use that same right against trump i d like to explain to them the definition of hypocrisy but i m sure those words might be to big for them to understand
people should have rushed around the edges and tossed that assbag into the air
did she just pull the rug out from under herself
i heard margie greene was going to show up and protest i guess it was true
not only is trump crazy but so too are his zealot followers i ve never liked a candidate enough to act bat guano crazy in their name
oh i love watching magats making fools of themselves
politics in a nutshell
maga shills always cry about their first amendment rights being violated and are always the first to go and try to silence others conservatism is a cognitive impairment
she s gonna be on truthsocisl or gab like antifa attacked me i was murdered donate to my gofundme
another example of how moronic these people are
it s truly epic how much more efficient and effective it would ve been to start from a corner dummy picked the absolute least effective method by trying to pull up from the center comedy gold
he s a war hero because he was captured i like people who werent captured trump on mccain i wonder how it feels to have his own statement become relevant to his own life
big news anchor stomping grapes on live tv energy at the end there
i thought the was tryna stuff the banner up her coochie till she fell stupidly on the ground lmaoooo it s what she gets for playing stupid games
best trump trap ever they should have waited for more of them to get on it before wrapping it up
the fall was majestically in slow motion
why is it always a fat blonde
hey kkkool aide
ah the quintessential self rugpull
apparently free speech only applies to magats
she s lying right now
the confidence of these maga mouth breathers i wish i had just a tiny portion
perfect i was hoping something would happen to her
she grabs produce from the bottom of the stack
ah yes maga s trying to pull something you re on top off classic
most intellectually gifted trump supporter
why do people think their right to free speech means they get to limit the free speech of others
she lived laughed and loved her way into our lives without consent
magatard
excellent banner though
on brand for a magat
i would try to steal it after it gets used thats just an awesome memorabelia need a whole ass house to drape it on though
i saw that banner in the news i wish they would have shown her too
saw the red hat and immediately knew some comically dumb shit was about to happen
if i had to guess what s next she cries on the ground waddling to try and get up saying why would you do this to me
met the badass banner owner today https://i.imgur.com/v8cunc5.jpg
typical maga dunce hmm i ll just lift this up while i m standing on it
gif giphy 3oejhauoqg3lss0f1c
trash going to be trash
most trumpers have that same body type
oh my god this is so funny
this seems awfully on brand for a trump supporter
trump is a politician of course he lies all the time
there was also a failed attempt to understand reality by the magat imagine how much of a credulous idiot and a delusional cultist you would have to be to consider the statement trump lies all the time remotely objectionable after the last seven or so years these people are unsalvageable
they really pulled the rug out from under her
name a politician that doesn t
politics and lie s are like tuna and mayo
looks like she s falling for trump
another great visual metaphor for maga
have people not realized it s politics they all lie
snowflake maga
you gotta give them credit for training these idiots to play victims so well went for the i m being attacked help scream before she even hit the ground
imagine if a democrat did that at a trump rally
missed opportunity they should have pulled the rug out from under her
she goes to the gym to deadlift the floor
trumpers are the dumbest breed of person i ve encountered to date
i really wanted to see more of this is this the same crazy tit that jumped in front of the k pop video
jesus she s perfect
the truth hurt
trump should be one of a pair of guards in a fantasy novel
imagine having this much time off work
arrest her for attempted theft and resisting arrest
so uh what was the end goal there
she lied down
trump supporters are so fucking stupid

if she was a real fan she would have taken a shit on it out of for me edit i am not a fan
find me a politician that doesn t
thought that was mags turd green for a sec
every politician ever every business man ever all liars all of them
the maggats are always in the best shape and make the most sound decisions
literally the entire trump camp i m fixing things as they fail miserably at fixing things
most intelligent mage supporter
she had not even hit the ground yet before she started playing the victim
stop the steal
instant karma
tumble fatso
can we honestly stop making this thread political like honestly it s gotten to a point where it s annoying
