is it just me or is the client extra crappy and buggy lately mine crashed 4x tonight in a hour time span basically every other game
why is it actually that it counts as a defeat in my placements when someone afks after min and we have to ff like seriously that happened times already out of could be half a rank worth of lp you lose because of that
when is the laning phase considered over when should i be leaving my lane to help in team fights and or taking dragon ect i play kayle usually
no sales in the shop today
what you guys think about udyr top i am a top main but i love udyr playable
anyone feel like they re not getting enough content out of the recent event pass x200b i admit this is my first time buying one of them but it seriously feels like i m not getting enough compared to what i paid for i think i ve only gotten or so new skins and thats through grinding for the orbs but the money for content items is really bad imo
i notice that since the recent champion price changes shard discounts are hinky for example whilst i can buy seraphine in the shop for be using my shard actually increases the price to be any idea if this is due to be fixed in the next patch
when i hover over my name on league why does it now show a rank with points under it cant seem to find anything over this
has riot fixed the bug that caused people to crash multiple times in game yet
how do i stop getting matched with premades in norms
anyone know what s this new points section below the rank on a user s profile when you hover over their name in your friendslist https://imgur.com/a/rbefvgi](https://imgur.com/a/rbefvgi) can t seem to find any mentions on the latest patchnotes
what happened to the champion pricing update they said the changes would be implemented in then and then there was no mention of the update in the patch notes i am confused about when this is coming out does anyone else have an idea
not ganking a losing lane is counter productive ganking is supposed to give the laner an advantage so they can get ahead if you gank that is already ahead you re wasting your time because they never needed your help in the first place the only exception would be if they grant you kills really you should focus on ganking losing lanes because they are the ones who needs supporting and if you cry that all your lanes lost which makes the game lost you re only looking to be carried by your team mates and not contributing anything to the match yourself if you disagree explain why
how does backing work for top n mid especially in top i find it hard as a new player to know when base or push in to reset
is it possible to finish the battlepass to buy katarina if i start it from scratch today and playing only tft
how do i get out of bronze
aaaaaand aurelion is shit again even when they rework him they find a way to make him unplayable by nerfing him
will riot ever bring back na west do you think ping seems really bad since i moved out to bc canada
is there a website to check normal games mmr been put into games with masters and plats i m a hardstuck silver for years i m fine there i just like to practice different champs in normals but getting put into games with this huge of a level difference is sad
if i make an app that alerts you every time your mid laner dissapears will that be useful
the afk thing at beginning of match is such bs devs need to fix this bullshit
just got thrown into a diamond monkey player as a bronze and i think i will be taking a break for some time i just want to ask how was this possible

why i can t get into game every time after i finish champion select it doesn t open league play and it sends me back to client
why riot didn t implement a disenchant all blue shard champs yet
when are the new skins getting released
12h40
fix the bushes man they re so weird creepy
today my account got permanently suspended because my support decided to troll i only play top lane and jungle but today when i decided to lock in teemo my support started to flame me that he won t roam top if i play teemo he was playing senna btw then he picks teemo support and goes to the top lane and takes my farm the whole game i picked sett in that game and i went in that game as soon as my game finished within a few minutes i received a message that my login session had expired and when i tried to login in again i saw that my account was permanently suspended is there any particular reason for this and what was my fault in all of this
so why is the auto trigger of chat bans so sensitive like the word cancer will flag it
why doesn t wu kong have more skins from what i remember he s pretty popular in china i think and he s obviously got a pretty strong pro presence poor guy only has one modern skin since they started giving chromas to every skin
since it uses her weapon and prevents from attacking sejuani s w should scale with ad alongside max hp instead of ap
is the bloodline rune lifesteal still a better option than alacrity attack speed for adcs even after its nerfs
so after maybe years of playing adc solo i wanna swap to a different role is top or mid a better role to play i mean people say top is an island which i dont mind but i kind of like to rotate to help the jungler for example to secure an objective
hello i have an account that i want to transfer to a different region both regions currently don t have this option available does anyone know for how long is this situation going on
where or what is the new feature player a have muted themselves i see this at the beginning of a game is it an available feature or is it related to chat restriction
hello 1st april event is over already
how can i know weekly skin sales for april
removed
what have been the most exciting series or matches to watch in na lcs since mar i haven t been able to watch any
hypothetically speaking would an org be able to have a team in or more leagues eg t1 buying an lcs spot
there was this list of champions that had people select the coolest champions by appearance and it sorted between regions anyone know where it is i can t find it
currently can t check how much money i ve spent in lol says pardon our rust with broken blitzcrank message anyone else getting this or is it just my account
is ranked queue disabled right now also cant see blitz mode in tft
trying to remember the name of an old lol youtuber i used to watch can t remember the name but the dude looked to be asian or mixed had long hair and like this fumanchu mustache thing going on i think he used to be reasonably popular but i can t for the life of me remember the name
is it possible to finish the battlepaqs from scratch if i start it right now i mean for the katarina prestige skin
i ve just started playing the past few days i ve played co op vs ai using tristana suddenly i cannot pick her as my champion why is that i ve just played another game and one of my teammates did pick her but that idiot then left the game
are there any champs that play like old lethality sivir i really enjoyed the safe ranged ad caster playstyle and the short ranged hypercarry autoattacker crit build she has now is kind of the exact opposite
are there any good lategame champs that isn t an adc or mage i d like smth tanky and good damage
trying to get back into the game but haven t played in about years any resources to get caught up to speed
trying to expand my champs as a support main any good suggestions i usually play lux seraphine or brand atm not that experienced as a general player so easier ones would be appreciated but i d like to learn some more skillful ones too lol
how do i turn off the new proximity pings
factor auth is broken can t log in
did the client change some colours i swear most of them are super saturated now and the red one seems to be the most changed
did they ban overlays or smth i ve been using blitz but after this update it won t show up in game
i ve got a few hero shards but the actual price for those heroes is isn t it more profitable to disenchant them and buy heroes full price how did this even happened
i can t figure out why i m losing so much lp per loss i am currently bronze just demoted with a wr and i feel i m playing my games well even if it s a loss i linked my op gg https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/swhimsical) in case someone cares to check it out last night i went and was losing 25lp each time
whats going on with queue timers minutes in euw silver at 5pm seems tough
my persistedsettings json file doesnt safe my video general settings is that normal everything else is getting saved just not those not even my quality i have a 2560x1440 monitor and a 1920x1080 monitor is that the reason
this might be a stupid question but why do we get so many new champion releases a year like there are champions in the game already at this point so many champs in need of rework and it just continues to add a new barrier of entry for new players who have to learn what everybody does
i havent played in around years i remember the basics and don t need any of that is there a way to just browse a hero roster and play solo with a bot team against a bot team
i m at lvl on the event pass and i only have coins do i miss something here do we get the missing from missions or something
there is a subreddit for support mains r supportlol is there one for jungles
i want to find a mage hero or skin that has multiple types of magic i hate being exclusively a fire mage or an ice mage i want to find a character that seems to have different flavors of magic any ideas
i don t know if this is the right place to ask but my boyfriend keeps talking about some advertisement he saw for lcs that we can t find apparently it got meme d on a bunch for being dumb silly and highlighted like a nautilus hitting a hook with a caster voice over going lets go nautilussss he thinks it was prob around any ideas
why do i gain lp and lose all my hard work to be taken away in two games i practiced played better went on a game win streak all to get it taken away by first time adc supports https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/flip
i consider it over when the first tower falls
most analysts claim laning phase is pre that doesn t mean you have to group overgrouping loses many games since scaling champs or sidelane threats might not want to group until much later in the game
not that bad as a whole but ranged matchups are pretty much impossible to deal with
the passes have been this way for years now if you don t like them i wouldn t buy them again because they re not changing them
passes are you are getting more than you paid for just by getting skins worth and the mythic essence included in the progress track the rewards you get from the track alone and not including what you spend your tokens on is already worth more than what you paid
points are your challenges progress
not yet still crashing for me

if i m wrong then let me know but it seems like you haven t jungled before and are speaking from the laner side of things in which case i d really recommend you try to play jungle since that will give you the most valuable lessons and experience i will give you that junglers in low elo will cling way too hard to the don t gank losing lanes rule even to the detriment of the entire team but like almost everything in life there s caveats and lots of them just off the top of my head here s what i m thinking when i want to try and help my laner when they re not doing so good who am i playing who is the enemy playing what is my teammate playing very introductory information but one of the most important by far self explanatory what summoner spells do i know they have down up also self explanatory for the most part this goes hand in hand with does the enemy champ have lots of dashes escapes that will make a gank hard do i have gap closers and or flash up does my teammate have gap closers and or flash up knowing all of this is essential to making a good decision on whether a gank is worth it or not on those fed enemies where s the enemy jungler since i should already be wary of the 1v2 outplay a 2v2 will most likely not end up well for us at all i don t want to gank if i m not positive where the jungler is maybe depending on game state i ll take a risk if i m not sure of where they for sure are but i m relatively certain where they should be given their camp timers or other factors but again it depends and i don t want to get too in the weeds can the enemy easily 1v2 us what items do they have if any also pretty self explanatory if the enemy darius already has a stride while my kayle has a recurve bow that s typically not gonna be a good gank also goes hand in hand with the last one can i even fight the enemy or do they dumpster me times out of this one is one of the most important in my mental checklist i play a lot of kha zix so toplane bruisers in general like darius sett kled illaoi etc are extremely hard for me to even walk up to without getting 0d immediately regardless of how ahead i am assuming i am at all if my laner is already doing badly that s just the cherry on top good junglers know that ganks and actually just about every decision is all about risk vs reward it s extremely important that i don t fall behind and ideally don t die at all so that i have options if i see enemy jungler on the other side of the map doing anything i ll invade their opposite quadrant or take an objective on the opposite side of the map i can t do that when i m dead the darius you fed kills to will absolutely turn around and auto w ult me and then i ll be looking at a gray screen while the enemy jungler is doing a free dragon likely one of the only ways i m going to go in on that darius is if he s health getting turret plates and i have ult and flash up otherwise i cannot gank him simply because i have better things to do that are guaranteed gold sorry to say it a lot of the times every or almost every one of those things on my checklist is going to not look good which then swings my risk vs reward heavily towards risk and therefore i m not going to gank this is why that rule of don t gank losing lanes even exists because generally times the risk vs reward for ganking a lane that is hard losing is not favorable
it s not that cut and dry the issue is if you have a laner that is getting absolutely gapped there is a fairly decent chance that that player is not going to be able to effectively use the pressure you exert if i as a jungler gank top to stop them from bleeding out and then as soon as i leave they die again that time is completely wasted even worse if their gold value gets reset by getting a kill and then they die you ve actively made the situation worse for your team by investing in someone who is just not going to be useful meanwhile if i gank a lane that is already ahead and get them even further ahead that extra push can put them in position to straight up 1v5 the game in the game theory of league it s commonly accepted that having person who is uberfed is more well equipped to carry a game than people who are doing ok now none of this is iron clad the whole reason league is popular is that every game is different and forces you to adapt to new situations and not everyone is going to be behind for the same reasons a person who loses lane because they are playing a late game hypercarry is different than a person playing a lane bully who threw lane and will now be useless for the rest of the game ganking for kogmaw lulu botlane who is down kill and cs to a lucian nami lane is very different than trying to pull your renekton out of the gutter when he s playing against a now fed illaoi
the issue with ganking a losing lane is that you are often putting yourself in a situation where you are guaranteed to lose 2v2 if the other jungler shows up and you are at risk of losing 1v2 as well purely because the opposing laner has an artificially inflated advantage over everyone else in the game so not only are you potentially putting yourself and your lane even further behind by ganking but you re spending your most valuable resource as a jungler time on something that has a lower chance of working out than ganking someone who is already ahead and can set you up for success and there s a decent chance that the opposing laner who has more damage and tank stats can simply walk away even with the jungler s added damage and cc which is just as much of a waste of precious time then there s simply the fact that in solo queue it s hard to put trust in any of your teammates much less ones who are already behind probably tilted and have an even smaller margin for error than they did when they fell behind in the first place as a jungler in a situation where one lane is losing and the others are performing well i would much rather have the losing player chill and try to keep things at equilibrium than desperately attempt to claw their way back into the game that way i can push our leads where we already have them the only factor that really makes people die repeatedly trying to kill someone who is way ahead of them is tilt it s not inherently bad to gank a losing lane every single time and there are situations where you should be ganking a lane that s down because it s just too free not to do so but it s a fairly good general rule to follow in solo queue
i m by no means an expert but from my understanding the idea is that a single gank is unlikely to fix a weak lane your opponent probably already pushed his advantage and a single kill might not be enough to balance the scale even if you somehow get back to a neutral state that doesn t guarantee your lane doesn t fall behind again which already happened in this very game creating the situation how much of a time investment can you justify trying to fix a weak lane while the enemy jungler is actually pushing his team ahead if the opposing lane is exposing itself to ganks it often doesn t hurt to go for them of course but generally speaking you are better off pressing an advantage because the chances of success are higher so that is the first place to look for opportunities
it s a big topic and something that is especially important in top lane but the best back is going to be one where your opponent is away or dead and you have shoved a wave into the tower if you re away from lane you can t influence the wave so the best thing to do is to deny as much from your opponent as possible and then set things back to equilibrium there are of course a lot of variables that could tilt things in other directions maybe your opponent is fighting in bot lane and you can t match so it s just better to hard shove and get as many plates as possible maybe you re low hp and you just need to back there s even something called a cheater recall where if you time your back properly you can leave on wave and not miss any minions almost everything in this game is going to be answered with it depends and this is no exception unfortunately
usually more farming less dying
stop autopiloting and start thinking twice about every play trade and map movement if your decision wasn t wagered with anything even small things you are not really trying to play to beat the opponent you re just in the match existing and playing your average self there is risk reward to everything and in of the situations where the risk is high don t do it i can kill this opponent _maybe_ but i don t have vision and if i die my team loses inhib baron recognize these types of situations then never ever do it unless you are like 10k behind and it is the only actual option probably best advice i can give that isn t unnecessarily in depth it is something i got superconscious about at some point and it made me miles better
stop doing stupid stuff bronze is full of people making stupid plays if you don t do them then you will stop being bronze although tbh the only climbing technique that s worked consistently for me is to spam games on multiple champions like crazy until some champion or other clicks with me and then spam that champion lots and rank just naturally goes up
how do i get out of iron can you give me some tips
no there was never na west just the na server was on the west coast the majority of the population is also more towards the east coast which is why they moved the server closer to them na west doesn t have a justifiable population
you could try whatismymmr com
why just move around game starts at
riot only hires competent people as artists for splash artwork everyone else is running around the office playing smell my nuts and guess where they ve been
you re best contacting riot support won t get you banned
yeah i can t even discuss astrology in my games fucking bullshit
because a lot of people will wish cancer on someone and that s pretty hateful
he s vaguely popular because he s op right now but historically he was very unpopular total number of skins doesn t just track current popularity but also that of the past
most adcs take alacrity if you rely on attack speed exceptions are stuff like samira mf ezreal jhin
check winrate pickrate for your specific champ
whatever feels better for you honestly personally i prefer alacrity and building lifesteal but in the past i used to enjoy bloodline and building attack speed experiment with both and see which one you like the best
don t play top i left the role after maining it for years
i personally enjoy playing mid more as it has more variety when it comes to characters and play style it also gives me option to rotate around the map more and help my teammates or finish some of the enemies off very easy to play with your jungle as well if u have a duo
you can say muteself and deafen in chat to do that muteself make you unable to use chat but can still see it and let other players know that aswell deafen make you unable to both use chat or see other player text and let others know aswell both options can be undone by using the same command again and will let other players know you undid them there is a cooldown if you undid them before you can do them again to discourage clogging the chatbox

this is basically a legendary skin holy fuck
the piston and the portal are so good after seeing the piston i could not wait to see what you thought up for the ult and the portal still really caught me off guard well done
this is hands down the best custom skin i have ever seen the custom animations are incredible well done
the download hope this isnt spam https://www.runeforge.io/post/the-iron-golem-mordekaiser
nah legendary doesn t even cut it man just casually made an ultimate skin
they need to hire you this is mind blowing
this is the best made custom skin i ve seen so far
lol that s pretty good the piston really got me
what mod the animations are really good no way these are minecraft animations though right
the nether portal is so satisfying just off to detroit you go
holy fuck thats actually kinda insane
easily one of the most high quality custom skin i ve seen
how long did it take you
iron savior enjoyer
this is actually so damn good
this e looks interesting probably was very simple to make right
beautiful
zamn
the nose jiggle is so good
bro out here outdoing the skins department
now iron stands eternal
holy crap prestige skins from riot nah this is the real deal
jesus christ this is a custom legendary skin what the actual hell
can you get banned for using it
this is absolutely out of this world dude lets go
you should add the warden and give to morde cause his ult goes well with the wardens darkening effect
this is extremely well made
that is so cool i had no idea that you could do mods for league
what song is that
holy fucking shit how is this so good well done
true piece of art some objects looks blurry but its nothing compared to general idea and work that was done with animations
i would love a zac skin from this just seeing the flappy arms haha
the recall animation got me cracking
holy jesus this is some next level shit kudos to you for trying and accomplishing something so amazing
goated
as much as i wouldn t want riot to be a sellout they could do so much cool stuff like this just like the themed rift mods people have made but their excuse is they can t do it cus drag map changes yet the modders can i would love to see crossovers or more good themed content even skin lines i don t even play minecraft but great job modder
are you the guy that made dio panth good work man
this is the most exciting skin i ve ever seen in lol history
mordekaiser the iron revenant golem
with how long riot says skins take to make this must have taken you and a team of artists the whole past decade amazing job
thematically him being a skin for ivern s daisy makes the most sense but this is very cool
the fuck is this this is the most amazing custom skin i ve seen ever i d pay to use this
bro no lie you gotta put this shit on tik tok
is this safe to use in game i know the website op linked says i most likely won t get banned but i want other opinions
damn that ult got potential doing anime domain expansion
should have made it for blitzcrank or make over skin with villager who summons a iron golem or something
quieter music next time please it doesn t need to be so loud
just here to appreciate this gaddayum
man i just love it
nice and cool but i got a quick question why is this custom skin more visually clear than the original game itself
maybe for the dance instead of the quitar he jams on the noteblock or the quitar is good enough
god i missed the dib build live iteration of the golem amazing work
the ult was clean af amazing
this has to be the best custom skin i ve ever seen holy fuck
this is an ultimate skin wtf
ok but like this isnt a shitty meme skin but actual effort so good
wow man this is the only custom skin i ever liked and it s the fucking best
this skin it s unironically better than a couple of legendaries released on the last year
modding communities are always gods when it comes to stuff the spirt blossem map is riot level quality
riot should hire this guy
damn you went crazy with it
what if league of legends had iron golems
you might not see this but use your powers to make peppino rammus it s what the world needs right now
holy shit dude your work is amazing this is some ultimate skin level of detail and if it was sold as one i would rate it quite a bit above other ultimate skins i would buy it and start learning morde just for this god damn hope to see you do more minecraft themed league skins
just imagine if there d be a moba longer smash
man mojang should ve dipped into moba instead of dungeons or whatever
this is so cool damn how wonky league would be if every skin would be like that
nice work haha is so amazing
yeah the fact that we have broken the barrier with custom animations being possible is crazy that mario gnar had a fantastic model but the base animations were slightly too obviously gnar s the day the modders mix together is going to be sick kinda wild to compare this to stuff like vending machine singed from the good old days
the portal smash alone makes it toppest tier
agreed the effects are different
yeah this is how you get them to crack down on custom skins again
jesus christ that website is cancer on mobile
bro can i use this for malphite
damn you should make or more and then submit them as a resume to land a gig where you get paid bank to do this for a living super impressive
all hand made
let s be real the nether is probably more like gary indiana than detroit michigan
days im stuck at home cuz i broke one of my toes ok
angry spanish noises
riots stance has always been maybe
considering that popular streamers are using it on their streams i feel like it s not something they regulate too strictly they will be the first on the chopping block if riot decides to bring down the ban hammer just use them and pay attention if they re banned or not if they get banned just stop using them
technically yes use at your own risk in practice not really don t think anyone s ever been banned for using custom skins other than people who used those oldschool 3rd party programs for custom skins yet also came along with jungle timers and things that gave you some advantage in game
next in line for rek sai
nocturne r is purely darkening
no guts no glory iron savior
a single guy and in days actually lol
druttut uses custom skins on stream and hasn t gotten banned i think its safe it would also be shitty of riot to ban normal players but not streamers
just dont use hackskins putting real riot skins into the default skin with a mod and you should be fine also this kind of mods dont have the visual clarity of official skins so you will probably get tired after some games theyre great from while to while imo
yes it does it s power metal
10iq people when you tell them you can adjust device volume be like
from the good old days reminded me of my favorite custom from the early days ronald mcdonald shaco with happy meal boxes lmao
custom animations have been possible for a long time as far as i know just nobody wanted to learn them most people go for modeling and texturing which is nice too
i must see this mario gnar
to be fair gnar s animations fit perfectly to mario besides the dance ofc xd
as long as the custom skin isn t just an actual riot skin being used for free they don t care obviously that could change but that s been thier stance for yeeeeeears
riot is perfectly aware that people are using custom skins if they didn t want people to use them they would make an announcement long time ago
they dont care
they never cracked down on custom skins they just did some changes to champions which in turn broke all custom skins
doesnt that one gragas streamer always use costume skins etc
you re a legend wtf i don t play minecraft and i assumed you just used an idle animation asset or something awesome job

tl dw nrg acquires entire clg lol vertical from the top to the academy teams including staff and the training facility msg becomes a major shareholder in nrg they will eventually flip the brand from clg to nrg in lcs my personal thoughts with the entire rest of the org being laid off msg becoming a major shareholder in another esports org in nrg and the brand eventually flipping it would seem that the clg brand is on it s way to being killed off fuck this shit
man now i know how my parents felt when the oilers got moved to tennessee back in the day and it s an awful feeling maybe i m just emotional right now and will get over later but this has killed any investment that i had in the lcs i would watch every week and now i don t know if i ll tune into anything other than the two international events we get each year obviously a few clg fans no longer watching won t hurt the lcs bottom line or anything but man this is just personally such a bummer
so what happens with gam now also the eventually flipping the brand seems like it s a v5 nip situation where they have to finish the year out as clg and then change brand to nrg next year
wait are they changing in summer already i thought clg would remain for the year atleast
clg
long awaited sorry but by who lmao
are they using clg s trophy in their promo fuck this
so why would msg sell off clg to then become a major shareholder of nrg they think nrg sounds better or something
sucks to see one of the og league brands in clg go but can t really fault nrg for jumping on the opportunity to get back into the lcs
i m so fucking sad nrg league has no soul or story off to c9 i guess can t wait to root against nrg
genuinely pissed off i hope i m wrong but it sure as hell sounds like clg as an org is just dissolving entirely msg becoming major shareholders of nrg means they ll still probably own the clg brand and i highly doubt they ll let it go y all can clown us all you want the org i ve been backing for years is gone fuck this shit and fuck league esports
rip clg
ngl i wish it was imt or dig but who knows that might still be on the way sucks to see such a storied brand like clg go instead of the waste of space orgs
over a decade of supporting clg through all the ups and downs means i ve seen some shit i was there for hotshot and the ggs i was there for the doublelift trophy case memes when tsm fans were still trying to push chaox and eventually wildturtle as the best na adc i cried when hotshot cried after the win at msg i saw aphro shape the meta of an international championship almost solo at msi i suffered through support locodoco gm tafo coach scarra there is literally nothing that nrg can do to convince me to jump to their brand and org i don t want to see an org that just worked with msg to basically hollow out clg try to ever claim any of the legacy that clg built good or bad if they can t even be bothered to keep the branding stick to footage of a washed up gbm if you want to show the lcs history of your org you bums i ll always wish the best for the current players and staff watching them this past year has been an absolute pleasure and the most fun i ve had since xmithie played for us keep the faith friends
i went from being an echo fox fan to a clg fan everything i touch fucking dies
clg has been a part of my life for over years and no matter how low things could get i always tuned in every lcs week to show my support i can t even begin to describe how much it hurts seeing the legacy your team built get sold off to another org to be rebranded and forgotten about i really fucking loved clg
i m definitely not rooting for nrg the same way i did clg
sucks to lose such a storied brand and especially with all the upper management drama around teams like tsm and eg it sucks for the lcs to lose a guy like greg kim he really seemed to kick ass and put together a management team that turned clg around from the dark ages at the very least i m glad that nrg has the good sense to preserve the entire league of legends division all the way down to clg faith even if the results aren t there right now
now all we need is mr beast to enter the fray
look how they massacred my boy
damn he didn t wanna clean his ears before making the video
day of asking nrg to return both lcs trophies to hotshot and give him the rights to the clg brand
we clawed our way back to the lcs by buying our way back in and letting msg become a major stakeholder lolol ok sure
nrg is now public enemy
the way this deal is structured seems weird to me i m guessing msg wanted to do some asset shifting by taking a stake in nrg while probably also getting some cash separately this is maybe a vote of no confidence in greg kim or at the very least a bet that andy will manage things better my impression is that andy is good at splashing money admittedly for results but greg was better at community building and moneyballing
with lcs having this garbo schedule and clg literally dissolved i m just gonna watch lck lpl from now on hope tsm trash these clowns
andy miller is a smart businessman leave rejoin lcs at the right time cheaper the esports teams under nrg lol valorant rocket league apex legends overwatch cs2 are the future of esports
another corporate no charisma and souless org barely showed any care for clg its all about value market negotiation brand call me salty but i doubt you will have many fans with the nrg name clg might have had poor showings in recent years but a lot of people still are fans of the org and watched lcs for their games because people were attracted to their passion faith is not just a meme they built a whole culture with passion then the first thing you talk about is stakeholders shares msg
yeah don t care if they aren t branding the team as clg and extending the culture i could give a fuck about nrg i m sure it s all related but you would think using an existing brand with a rich history in competitive league would make more business sense
i cannot support anything that has msg behind them fuck msg
this sucks fuck nrg sad for clg fans
clawed our way back yea lol totally that money really made you claw all the way back into league
wow can t wait to see this terrible org take their rightful place at 10th in the lcs
happy for the people that are keeping their jobs
slick of them not to mention that they basically purged most of the org as part of the acquisition presenting a corpse to me is kind of in poor taste don t you think nrg
welcome nrg and also rip to nrg as msg is nothing more than a parasite and anyone that crawls into bed with them has only themselves to blame at this point
deleted
nrg has been a much more entertaining and successful org than clg in the last or so years so this a welcome addition
i hope that nrg crash and burn clg forever
i need a gbay documentary immediately no thanks this community doesn t need his sensationalist clickbait takes cluttering up discussions
lcs dead at this point seems like an awful decision by any org to buy in even at what i m sure was a low price
can someone explain to me why people are so upset about this this was a business decision and i don t get why everyone is up and angry about nrg clg is an old brand and has its fans but let s not act like it s a successful brand anymore everyone is so emotional and stuck in about clg people have been memeing clg for years now saying the tsm vs clg riverly is bs because clg is so bad but now everyone wants to come out of the woodwork and act like they care fuck off i don t believe it we should all hope nrg makes a bigger impact in the league than clg did and brings some great content players etc clg is dead there is nothing to discuss about that
honestly i am happy i know its gonna be a hot take but i never felt clg had aspirations of winning anything but rather just coasting obviously i am not speaking about the players but rather the org as a whole seemed their priorities simply were not winning worlds i think to many orgs in the lcs have this issue x200b i think tsm suffered from a similar issue where their priorities were to win worlds their methodoloy as a org simply was garbage and lead by a toxic owner and so basically had the same result x200b in fact i ll go a step further and say that now that money is drying up in the lcs the orgs have a real oppurtunity to make some top tier teams and change the meme region around basically from the begining of the lcs you were either on a top org or you were trolling who that org was had changed slightly but it was essentially always c9 with tsm clg tl being interchanged 100t started to creep in there and maybe eg alot of these big orgs had the money and they had the brand recognition so they for sure got all of the top tier talent now with money dropping off and brang recognition being not nearly as valuable we might just see a far more equalized league in terms of orgs this year jensen turned down a offer from c9 because dig offered more thats basically career suicide a few years ago and maybe even now but i don t think so in the past teams like gg couldn t get top talent and when they did have a lcs winning team they had to sell it due to financial limitations they might just be able to keep top talent and be a top tier contender moving forward x200b we have the oppurtunity for every org to develop their own methodology their own systems of generating top tier teams this might just be extremely healthy shedding dead weight we just need to drop imt i mean it was only a year ago that they were trying to sell their spot and couldn t sell it so its clear they are just not invested in the league
they gonna make the org about lifestyle and often you see player doing gym stuff every week it s happening to gam they even have a performance coach whose job is basically your gym pt they are about balancing gaming and life quality activities it looks like it s working for gam because they literally bought the best team in vcs have to wait to msi to see if this shenanigans is actually working or just a pr front
lmao this is a complete indictment of the clg management msg isn t getting out of esports at all they ll be investing into nrg they just wanted out of that management s operations and be on the ride with a competent company
so why aren t nrg keeping other clg members like ibdw
are we going to see nrg in summer split or is that too soon
will they be called nrg for the summer split
with this news and whatever the hell is going on with tsm who else could throw their hat into the ring mr beast another large e sports org like faze clan or sentinels maybe an entirely new org
justin justin this is lol
taking shots at nicole already
it feels like msg wanted to divest from esports but couldn t find a buyer so they had to settle for an equity plus probably some cash deal from nrg if it was possible to find a buyer i imagine they would ve gotten more by selling clg a whole instead of laying off everyone other than lol and writing off the brand i d bet msg is probably looking to get rid of the nrg equity at the earliest possible opportunity
never royal gave up
who would buy an lcs team right now i can t imagine they paid much for it
i m surprised that the nrg brand is more profitable than the clg brand considering it s history and fan base
you can claw your way back all you like i m not rooting for you just because you re parading the corpse of my team around get bent nrg
isnt this similar to the koi rogue deal koi bought the rumored of rogue and they are now just koi with people from both companies
they owned a controlling interest in clg now with nrg it is a noncontrolling equity interest
msg as in madison square garden
good
msg was a major stakeholder in clg as well not a good sign they re notoriously stingy investors means nrg will just be clg meaning still a low budget shitty team in lcs for anyone who knows the nba msg owns the knicks so yeah
yup that s probably the worst thing that could happen to your org

you re dead kiss your ass goodbye
they were relatively hands off of the clg brand so i doubt it affects y all much if at all
wait lol this is wild msg is truly just creeping death
this explains nrg s layoffs recently they let go about employees across their companies
wtf not even a goodbye post or something they fucking vanished thanos snapped gone like my dad when he said he went to get some milk
worse they actually just renamed it so they could keep all the followers
it s not just on its way it s already there
yeah if nrg continues to retain the clg name and branding to some degree counterlogic energy then i ll still keep rooting for them however even if they keep the same players and structure it wouldn t feel the same if they fully switch over and there s no more clg anywhere in their name i watched almost every single clg game for the last years and i could care less about rooting for nrg just because they took over clg
hotshot should just offer to buy back the clg brand for like 50k
you realise the brand failed standing alone right all the players and staff being bought out at once is the best possible case for it remaining

perfect time to bandwagon to gg
i remember when seattle sonics went to okc nba finals heat vs okc only florida and wa out of all fifty states rooted against okc or some shit lmfaoooo actual deja vu moment
come to c9 you know all those clg va c9 bangers imagine being on the winning side of those that s what being a c9 fan is like
they have to sell gam although i imagine it wasn t a very expensive acquisition considering how cheap vcs teams are
same happened with clutch they changed their logo to yellow and black when dignitas bought them but couldn t change name till next year personally i hope they can recognize during this split still as clg that the brand has value and has lots of fans i personally like counter logic energy for a brand name and i think if they keep that the black and blue and run back this roster they will inherit a lot of league fans
nrg is a bigger brand than most lcs teams
i didn t even piece that together because i was just annoyed the whole time that s kinda fucked
copying this from r clg if they start claiming our trophies as theirs i m going to kms this isn t like a geng samsung situation where the original owners wanted out and there was no way to keep the existing branding you can t have the samsung brand without samsung sponsoring they bought and killed clg and are parading around its corpse
its nrg s trophy now bro
this is not unusual in mergers and acquisitions nrg sold equity in their company to msg for the lcs spot rather than paying straight cash
shares were probably just part of the dealing it s just greener pastures
msg reduces their costs this way and gets some return on their esports investment from the sale of the lcs slot they no longer have to run a full fledged org and be fully responsible for expenses wages instead they can be minority shareholders in nrg hopefully passive and still get exposure to esports but with way less direct risk i wish nothing but the best of luck for nrg that being said fuck msg and fuck james dolan now that s two storied sports teams that he s run into the ground first the nba s new york knicks now clg
it s really not complicated they don t want to run the spot but they want a return on investment so they sell the spot to nrg and part of that deal involves shares in nrg this is not complicated
also puzzled by this seems like a bit that only makes sense if we could know the details of the transaction i m guessing nrg placed a premium on getting into the lcs so the deal was likely structured in a way msg made an overall return while still maintaining equity in the resulting lcs org this is speculation and i don t know the behind the scenes
they have way too much money and are probably genuinely clueless deciding to buy back into the lcs has to be the most stupid move i have seen yet lmao
from the sounds of contract league nonsense msg was the one who always owned the spot and over just running the spot themselves they just said another org can have the spot so long as we own it i assume nrg is the only person who was chill with this since their ownership team is the most random list of names as it is already
nobody should be clowning you the whole situation is bullshit and the reactions i have seen are justified
i don t think average league player viewer has any idea about how much dolan has fucked clg up till last year after hsgg was forced to sell the team to msg because riot wouldn t give a spot to clg it s not like dolan wasn t entirely running the team to ground over all the leaks we had surprise surprise only year they were actually hands off and just observing clg was actually reviving from it s ashes fuck this
anyone that clowns you is an asshole ive been a c9 fan for over a decade shorter than some clg fans and if c9 left esports i would he massively depressed for awhile since its been a huge part of my life
i m not sure why you re trying to blame league esports as if it wasn t clg s own fault esp with the shitshow last year they legit have no presence anywhere outside of a few good fgc players just go look at their twitter and youtube channel their social media engagement is very low the lol clg fanbase took a massive nosedive after to the point that their lol youtube videos can barely get above 1k views now despite a good year for the lol squad they ll still probably own the clg brand and i highly doubt they ll let it go what would even happen if they did let it go who is going to shell out the money to not only buy but also run a dead brand only relevant to a few hardcore league fans
the real clg org died years ago when it was sold to msg
nah it fuckin sucks i feel your pain
yeah it s not just league they dropped all their smash fgc players and other teams as well i m pretty sure they completely are out of the game now
i m all up in my feelings when i see that clg s twitter header photo is still the team from their first lcs title
i still have faith in the fundamental idea that so long as people enjoy competitive gaming there will always be a future for esports it s been an honor and a privilege to defend that faith clg may be gone but we can still have faith
this hurts so much i know everyone loves to clown on clg cause we were dogshit for a few years and had the bud light ace but holy fuck the organization was seriously turning it around not just in league but in other esports scenes too just go on twitter and look at all the outpouring of support that from people in the fgc smash scene once it was announced that they were leaving the scene clg had a youtube channel for fgc stuff that gained almost 10k subs in only months and had its view climbing they were also had a speedrunning channel that had just started up and had some pretty good videos too in apex legends i watched the org pick up a team that went from almost getting relegated to qualifying for lan they signed a bunch of pretty popular streamers and their womans team s in valorant and cs go were always contenders in their respective scenes and that s not to mention the league scene some people community members love saying dumb shit like oh we gotta get these orgs like clg out of lcs that don t care and are just phoning it in we get it you haven t paid any attention to what clg has been doing for the past year and a half sure we fucking sucked for a while but every team has ups and downs and clg was on the up last split we took steve s seven million doller roster to game and finished top both splits when everyone was saying we might not even make playoffs and everyone likes to complain that teams don t put out content but clg was actually making content for their league team and more than a bunch other teams i might add seriously go check their youtube they put out mic checks and some other less serious content which like half the teams in lcs can be asked to do and players stream too less than i d like but dhokla keeps a pretty regular schedule and luger steams a decent amount too not only that but clg was actually addressing the things that reddit loves to complain about in terms of talent development and imports clg has teams in the academy series a challengers team and an amateur team and are actually using new talent not just recycling old lcs pros that can t cut it in the league anymore plus they actually use na talent on their team and didn t just throw billion dollars at whatever player just won lec or worlds or whatever oh and before i forget clg s presence at worlds was more than every other lcs team s combined like are the other teams even trying idk what i m even trying to say here but i guess basically that one reddit comment i saw put it best if clg isn t your favorite team that s okay but if they re not your second favorite team you re just a bad person this is just a massive loss to the league of legends scene and to esports as a whole and idk if nrg or whoever is actually buying clg will be able to fill it
im honestly wondering where lcs viewerships gonna end up with clg and tsm leaving old orgs that a lot of older viewers tuned it to see
greg kim did a good job he should be remembered fondly by everyone who considers themselves a clg fan i do wonder though when he says stuff about still believing in clg if there s a chance we get to keep the name somewhere even if owned by nrg or whatever i know it s most likely a pipedream but if you don t have faith why are you even here right
dig or imt should hire him this guy made clg relevant again if it wasn t for the clg resurgence most people would be happy they are leaving
it s a terrible day for rain
thank you for everything clg no words or actions can ever express how much you guys will be missed
did an amazing fucking job seriously compare from the clg from that horrendous bud light clip to today and it s a stark difference the org showed up big at the long awaited worlds in na while everyone else was fucking afk and the team had so much personality and energy hope he gets the keys to another ailing franchise immortals and turns it around
can t believe his signature is literally g2
clg was one of the brands that made me into the esports fan i m shocked and sadden
can t believe it s actually the end of an era thats almost as old as the game itself i got into esport community since season and clg is probably the first esports team i ve ever heard of just sucks because greg kim and his team completely revitalized the org from years when people were calling for clg to be kicked out of the lcs i hope those who put in all that hard work and efforts gets recognized and their talents are utilized elsewhere in the esports space
i m not crying you re crying u sorendiz
really heartbreaking to see clg was the first org i started to follow and i ll never forget the excitement of watching the finals at msg thank you for all the memories
i m a tl fan but that clg faithful moment and i never doubted them from kobe will always give me goosebumps
it s a terrible day for rain clg forever
i remember like or years ago clg dropped all their players and staff to bring new people and i think if it wasnt for this clg would be 10th place in the lcs today but they bounced back and turned into a competitive team consistently punching above their perceived weight i wanted to see them go to worlds again and they got close but it seems it will not happen unfortunately rip clg
greg in case you see this thank you for everything it was a rough couple years for us fans when we were not only sort of losing constantly but also we just lacked any sign of direction for improvement from the org served as the laughingstock in the already designated laughingstock region etc a big falloff from the glory days of old and then even the competitive but falling short period but when you came onboard i think almost every clg fan will agree that there was an almost tangible shift in the air around the org it was easy to remain faithful with you at the helm with the immediate culture shift improvement in transparency and focus for the org and the willingness to take risks that other orgs maybe weren t it s pretty rough right now to see that the clg so many of us old faithful have been following for years will be either partially or even completely rebranded but nonetheless i was happy to have rekindled hope in the org these last couple years and to see the community coming around to appreciate it as a result of your and everyone else s efforts i ll root for any team that decides to bring you on besides tsm and i hope you continue to stick around the league esports scene you can change the players the era even the organization itself but the faith remains clg will live on in our fond memories even if nowhere else and you will always be a piece of that as well and now maybe for the last time the question is not if we have faith everyone has faith even the tsm pleb has faith that his grief has removed the possibility of even more disappointment other fans have faith in their teams abilities skills rotations ratios drafts and themselves everyone has faith the question is where is your faith anchored sooner or later the storms of lcs will begin to blow and then the question becomes will the anchor of faith hold george gives us three reasons that it is important to anchor our faith in clg first faith in clg is imperishable second our faith in clg will be rewarded finally our faith in clg is incorruptible all of us have faith but will your anchor of faith hold in the mighty winds of playoffs is your anchor of faith a true anchor like the miracles of greg kim is your faith built upon drafts or team fighting as good as ours is your faith blessed by the mighty kobe buff has your faith been tested in the ways our faith has been tested for over a decade is your faith timeless or will the newest overhyped import or the latest overpriced super team cause you to tie to a new anchor only a faith in clg is true tested and timeless only clg is worthy of our faith
all those tsm regi vs clg hotshot rivalries and bets were great back in the day even though regi won most of them in the end george is actually a good person while regi is a piece of shit rip in peace clg
i honestly blame riot for making lcs a franchise literally every org had to sell their soul to some corporate bigwigs in order to come up with the franchising money sure they might not have the capital to expand into different esports titles and have their own org facility but at least they won t be beholden to whenever the corporate fat cats decide to cut their losses
o7
i really hope there s some kind of post mortem done on clg something caused them to go bust we can probably speculate accurately as to why but it s important for esports as a whole to not repeat whatever those mistakes are
been a fan of this team since season i spent hours and hours watching solo queue games uploaded on youtube by the likes of jiji hotshot and saint through all the ups and the downs of the team it s always been clg or nothing i grew up with this team and to see it fade away is a terrible type of sadness
pain
rip clg from a dig fan gone but never forgotten
someone has to hire this guy
where can i get a clg jersey
thanks for bringing clg out of the pit they were in a few years ago devastating to see clg go but hope greg kills it on another org in the future the faith remains
im surprised hotshotgg hasn t made any comments yet
out of the loop what s going on with clg and tsm leaving league
goodbye counter logic gaming welcome no reasoning gaming
the faithful shall not be rewarded
thanks clg for giving me so many of the players that got me into the game froggen doublelift aphromoo for hotshot and the ggs for that incredible msi run i hope msg sells the ip so some other org can become a spiritual successor some day sad day for a fanbase that s used to being sad all the time we might ve been a joke for a really long time but it was a joke i enjoyed
what even happened to hotshot he went from talking to fans and giving updates to just completely disappearing
man that is just insane to me that clg the longest standing league of legends org will no longer be in the lcs from franchising to hotshot fully selling clg it was all downhill from that point on
i fondly remember the nidalee top games msi performance and the el classicos never was the biggest fan coming from eu though we had clg eu but always kept rooting for them the latest roster was nice to watch growing
they have done nothing intelligently proactive in the neutral game for the last minutes sad
bye
i legit don t even care you see teams move in sports all the time anyone expecting this weird insulated industry to not have things disappear after years or more is living in a fantasy land this scene is lucky to be running in na at all at this point shit the west even they re both just participating in an asian run race msi and worlds needs some severe leveling up from the west or it s just more of the same waste of time as an entertainment product sport this is why real sports have things like major leagues drafts salary caps etc so teams can eventually have a chance to compete for championships if ran correctly what does league have couple import slots this doesn t help overcome competitive environments being bottlenecked where only mediocre bad teams exist
fade em
good riddance hope the next org is run by more competent people
notice how nowhere he said anything about turning a profit a ceo that s hyperfocused on spending and not making any money no wonder esports is a joke
the final donezo manifesto damn
the truly faithful will be rewarded
build a team around palafox and i would be happy
i m in pain
and here ends tale of clg unforgettable memories of hotshotgg in early days and legendary clg eu line up time flies
as the song says gotta have faith get the f ck up this is a bad sign that they are selling their spot and are close to a deal
i ve been a tsm fan for years atleast and this fucking sucks rip freelg it won t be the same without you
been clg faithful for about years this news really made me sad gonna be hard to support another team the same even after franchising and everything 100t is gimmicky now and bjerg is tsm tainted in my mind still if you have no faith why are you guys even here
just a reminder don t cheer for corporations cheer for players
i searched clg to take a look at the picture and i was suggested mrbeast account hhmmmmmmmmmmmmm edit nvm looks like nrg bought it
clg may be gone soon but it won t be gone forever clg will never die
this is the ethos that has to be embraced if we re thinking about future proofing this industry clg forever the faithful will be rewarded
god clg will always be my favorite roster by a huge margin i ve put on various flairs over the years i put on the gg flair when they announced stixxay huhi but i ve always rooted for clg to do well and i ll always be a faithful clg fan clg has never left my top it really is the end of an era
there will always be potential
fuck i m about to cry rn
i have never doubted them
wherever the faithful suffer clg shall be clg wasn t just a team it is an idea
oh man brings me back to the faith age
its fun to shit on clg but not like this hsgg gave us i dropped it clg gave us chauster ratatouille ing doublelift memes link gave us donezo manifesto clg gave us doublelift s trophy case memes and most importantly hsgg spawned the now infamous if you don t have faith then why are you even here it wouldn t be an exaggeration to say that history of the lcs as a whole has been intrinsically linked with clg i thought a couple of the other orgs would sell but not clg oh well end of an era
fuck the people clowning on clg this is just terrible news for the esports system overall i m sad that an og org is potentially going to disappear and am worried about what is truly happening behind the scenes really hope all the staff players that were laid off are able to find something soon
the way i see it clg had eras one of the greatest of all time founding msi dogshit era i don t wanna talk about it what every team but like should aspire to be everyone clowns on us for the dogshit years but if every bottom team was doing what clg was doing this past year there would be way fewer complaints about the lcs
agreed seeing clg go is like parting ways with a very old and close friend so much of na s history is tied to this team that even through all the difficult years it always felt like one of the orgs that defined what the lcs even is
clg had a youtube channel for fgc stuff that gained almost 10k subs in only months and had its view climbing that isn t much
as a splyce fan i understand your pain stay strong
think tsm is putting it on low prio rather than leaving not necessarily better or worse investment money is off to cs
the clg league org is still continuing on travis gafford believes it may be bought by nrg
i personally am done with lcs even though my interest in it has been trending down for some years from watch every game to watch a few games a week to tune in basically only for clg games mostly related to my own personal and work life rather than the broadcast itself it s just not there for me anymore and i m saying that after having watched lcs since literally its first ever game not to mention the pre regional leagues era
i m an older viewer and i ve always been more a fan of the players first and orgs second i usually have a couple of players i m a fan of who i think are strong that i follow regardless of team back in the day i paid more attention to specific orgs because there was a lot more innovation going on to separate them like who was the first to get a gaming house the first to get a coach the first to get full support staff nowadays i don t think they set themselves apart quite as much i ve always thought it made more sense to follow players you think have what takes to be the best and compete internationally or to follow whichever team is putting up the best result and has the best chance to compete internationally rather than stay loyal to some org that s flopped really hard for a few years that s what drives my viewership at least what really killed my viewership here and there was a lack of international success and i started to just not give a shit who was best in na anymore
down and down riot got lucky with league i feel and it s just random stupid ideas being thrown around instead of actually building the competitiveness by doing what asia does with bo3 games multiple days a a week they do bo1 while they get short term viewership numbers long term it makes the teams not as good yes there will be boring teams playing at the bottom but the goal is to make all the teams better riot refused to do this lcs sucked and the worldwide audience just doesn t want to watch poor players play
literally none of the top watched games from both spring and summer of had one of those two orgs so i d guess it won t have any impact especially with probably more exciting orgs replacing them
it s been a while since tsms games had more viewers
the same way it d end up if they were still there there weren t more people watching these orgs for a while now
i think this will entirely depend on if mr beast buys tsm s slot
the way i see it one of two things will happen either clg will continue in lcs under the parent company of nrg and clg will remain under new management sad for the amazing current management team but the legacy will live on or nrg will shed the clg branding and iconography and someone passionate enough who loves the team will take the opportunity to get ahold of the unused brand and make something new happen with it optic came back from the dead so did dignitas we ll see clg again some day in some form i have faith
greg will absolutely find work if he wants to stay in the industry his work on clg was genuinely amazing he turned the org around in such a short amount of time
dig imt may leave lcs though
clg have been part of so many iconic moments it s seriously so sad they re leaving the msg game against tsm the donezo manifesto dls trophy cabinet the double tp against tl msi then the level one asol cheese at worlds heartbreaking stuff man
i m about to cry
big sad
they had an amazing turn around over the past years before then they were reliably putting together terrible rosters even with noteworthy players that would be near the bottom of the league and in recent years they ve worked with lesser known players and managed to turn it into so much more i don t think any org has done a better job of getting the most out of their players in recent years maybe c9 but they ve always had some really strong players to work with so it doesn t feel too comparable
clg remains undefeated against g2 at
until this happened clg was actually the oldest active professional league org these days i feel like not a lot of people know how long it s been around end of an era almost feels like an understatement
_ you re not wrong bestie i was a bit choked up when i saw the initial news between this and the whole slow prolonged collapse of rng going on over the last couple years i m about out the door when it comes to esports just don t have the same interest anymore with my teams dead or dying
clg forever
yeah hotshot was known for being a rager but i never remember anyone thinking he was a pos
part of it wad good part of it was bad team stability rose alongside player salaries after franchising allowing more people to make lcs their careers it gave team sponsors more incentive because their investments didn t have a chance of falling out after a few months of course that was the end of teams of five high ranked solo queue players making a break and getting in which does suck and it makes bottom of the table matches not matter as their spots are not on the line but imo franchising has been a net positive for the scene we shall see how that continues with tsm and clg bowing out
every single org was giving a permanent spot stability to attract sponsors and removes the stress fear of demoting out of the lcs you go back into the past with what you know and every single org chooses franchise again they just stop blowing all their money on players because surely this is worth it lcs to the moon
it was the big orgs themselves that wanted franchising if you remember at the time all teams in the league except echo fox signed a letter requesting it even fnatic signed it and g2 applied to na franchising to protest bringing franchising to eu
but at least they won t be beholden to whenever the corporate fat cats decide to cut their losses no this would absolutely still be an issue and players retention would be terrible because nobody would get properly paid franchising is probably the reason that league has continued as a viable esport
remember when rick fox was the only one to oppose franchising
damn riot making the teams spend millions of dollars on foreign imports
blame riot it was them being scared of losing the spot what drove the lcs to become franchised no the other way around
clg may be relegated though
i don t think they went bust per se it s probably more so that msg group didn t want exposure to esports anymore and decided to sell clg off nrg made a bid didn t want to keep the branding or the other teams since they have their own and dissolved everything else
the lcs is a money pit and tsm should leave because riot denied them a valorant spot after being in business with them for years and years as franchise partners
i don t know if it s also part of the story but tsm had a deal with ftx which uh didn t go as planned
he was bought out by msg years ago
he sold his remaining ownership stake a few years ago and the last thing i remember him mentioning was his work with a mental health nonprofit organization around years ago from what i can recall
is this the same nrg that imported gbm then disbanded when they got relegated
biggest winner in all of this after it s all said and done ended up being hotshot imagine getting all that money minus the stress negative pr and being portrayed as incompetent for sinking his own ship if he didn t do it that decision to sell a few years back is looking real good right now
counter logic gaming will no longer have a brand in esports that does seem counter logic
finally my nrg summoner icon is relevant again
honestly devastated about this news i ve been a long term fan of the organisation since season when u hotshotgg just simply did a kind gesture of paying for a picture of a goose because they couldn t afford to go to a pc cafe or meetup my memory escapes me i even bought a jersey after many years to support the growth of the new boys and their uprising but alas since then even during the worst times i could always have faith that on any given day that clg could beat the best teams in the world and that the organisation always had that x factor this is not something i see in other teams you know that quote let that be a lesson to you all nobody beats me x times in a row that was always the feeling i always had with clg when watching their games did we lose to a team yes did we lose to a team sure but can we beat any of those on any given day damn right we could thanks clg for everything
well probably the biggest positive here is nrg s massive youtube presence league on youtube is still doing very well with na content creators hopefully nrg can drive some of that audience to the lcs
i was a clg fan back in my college days had a phone case of clg s logo and everything because of dl unreal they won t be part of lcs anymore
i think the brand can still be sold off and another team could at a later date rebrand as clg i ll admit to not being certain of the mechanics but it s happened before
clg s last day needs to be a true sendoff chauster driving doublelift brain meme peeshotgg with bigfatlp narrating i dropped it elementz sona go way back to kobe24 amumu days annualshallowblackwidowspider one last donezo manifesto for the gang
i m devastated man put so much into being a clg fan over the past decade i don t know who i m even going to watch and pull for anymore
i guess this is really the end years of fandom just gone in the blink of an eye its probably also the end of me watching lcs then i just don t have a reason to stick around
man now i know how my parents felt when the oilers got moved to tennessee back in the day and it s an awful feeling maybe i m just emotional right now and will get over later but this has killed any investment that i had in the lcs i would watch every week and now i don t know if i ll tune into anything other than the two international events we get each year obviously a few clg fans no longer watching won t hurt the lcs bottom line or anything but man this is just personally such a bummer
they played playoff series like weeks ago and now clg is just gone unbelievable team i supported for years vanished in a blink of an eye
where were you when clg dies i was at work reading reddit clg is die no and you
goodbye lcs the last few years were real and they were good but they were never real good
someone please check on kobe
i guess welcome nrg sad to see clg go
hey neat nrg has some good established presence
truly the end of an era i feel sad but i m glad to have been there when they made history the brand may be gone but faith is eternal
holy shit
guess that s it for me watching lcs it was a fun ride while it lasted this sucks
man that feels bad it s a huge chapter of lcs s history ending an org that was dear to so many people even fans of other teams as a c9 fan clg always felt like the epitome of friendly rivalry and i ll surely miss all those bangers we played throughout the years truly counter logic
esports really has small profit margins so i never got why some orgs gave players figure salaries even a solid 90k per year salary is well above the average that people make in that location
i for one am gonna miss watching lcs been a good run everyone
in the end tsm and clg ended up the same
nice my interest in league can finally come to an end was just following for the memories of tsm clg it s been real
i wonder who will own the clg brand now msg nrg someone else
congrats to hotshot gg played a good nidalee created a team sold it to a sporting franchise and made bank before the lcs imploded
nrg has an apex team that is one of the fan favourites definitely a welcome presence to see in lcs
hotshot is probably set for life personally after this deal but damn clg as a name becoming another one in the pile of classic esports orgs hurts me was never a fan but i still respect the old dogs that shaped esports with tsm potentially being gone as well there is pretty much only fnatic and sk left from the very old era
so is the lcs just okay with losing clg and tsm at the same time that s like of the entire dedicated viewerbase for lcs my prediction is the lcs disbands or combines with other regions within years viewership numbers are abysmal as is but it s about to get even worse
am i the only who thinks it would be a good idea for nrg to keep the clg branding
nrg msg tbh sucks to lose clg but really what made clg what it was got lost a long time ago
a team like nrg willing to buy into lcs is actually a good sign
isn t nrg a shady org the last time they were in lcs i m pretty sure i heard they did some illegal shit
well guess i wont be watching lcs on a weekly basis kinda sad i know the team still around but i like clg brand better i remember becoming a fan after mid seasonal event where it was more of an all stars vs all star tournament watching doublelift getting a penta on ezreal made me a clg fan kinda sad will always have the memoires
got rid of relegation for stability they said but there s been plenty of turn over and now i m losing some of my favorite legacy teams not even cuz they lost but just because of cost to run a team and no profit from the league franchising just ain t doing it for me as a fan personally
will be wierd to not have clg in league but tbh clg pretty much died anyway since they were sold to msg in the first place so not really a loss kinda more just namesake more than anything
nrg has been an org recently that picks esports players up and tries it out for a year then just leaves if it doesn t work they throw a lot in at first i dont see this as a good thing
just call it clg nrg don t make me cheer for c9
lets go been an nrg fan since smite esports days
this double sucks honestly because clg is well clg and it s a big loss as they were a big org much like tsm and curse that changed their brand to tl nrg on the other hand was hot garbage in lol and i can t say i want them anywhere near given they were so bad they almost had impact leaving na if not retiring altogether and santorin as well almost retired when on that team the nrg people know from other games is not the nrg we had in lol previously who had a legacy of importing gbm getting relegated then vanishing immediately it was a shit show
man clg really fucked everything up they could lmao
clg s last couple youtube videos have 600ish views nrg s has 130k
good finally frauds are gone
i still have my season clg mousepad sad times
so this is confirmed rename and within the season
andy miller is a smart businessman leave rejoin lcs at the right time cheaper the esports teams under nrg lol valorant rocket league apex legends overwatch cs2 are the future of esports
u hotshotgg
tsm and clg fading from the lcs a bit like austro hungary and the ottoman empire during ww1
isn t this gonna be a conflict of interest nrg already bought gam in vcs so now they gonna have team in different league that can hypothetically fight each other on tournament right
clg just got snapped out of existence
welp fade me i guess
as a business they were the middist of mid tier teams
i was never a clg fan but i never hated them this feels super shitty and i firmly believe esports is worse off
well just figure i ll comment here for posterity s sake clg was my first and favourite esport team doublelift was my favourite player those first few years of losing to tsm were rough but the rivalry was intense the same feelings and rivalries aren t there anymore in this age of lcs and when clg finally conquered their tsm demon and won the lcs i was jumping and yelling around my house i ll always have good memories of clg and those early days of the lcs but all good things must come to an end at some point gg
does hotshotgg still own clg
nrg had impact and santourin rethinking if they really wanted to be lol pros
yes
didn t know nrg had such a bad history in league i really liked their brand in other esports hopefully they can figure it out this time
gbm the goat
huh
i still remember hotshot getting me interested in reddit way back when he was streaming on own3d with his two gigantic dicks
anyone know how much he walked away with for selling the team
he made out like a bandit i d rather be him than regi right now
yeah hotshot exited the right time it seems
retires at to play mmo all day truly on that sigma male grind set
when asked for comment on the matter george of the jungle had this to say on his involvement with the org that s what chauster is saying it was the right call i dropped it i dropped it i dropped it exactly i dropped it etc
truly counter logic
maybe now they can fulfill their name and have a team in jeopardy or are you smarter than a lcs caster
if anything good happened from this selling it is that finally the boring repetitive meme is dead lmao edit i know some of you agree
so crazy this is a brand that everyone knows it is hard to believe that there is no value in it
they just need to bring back quas and im on board
that logo with the pink was so much better than the boring shit they have now
i m still waiting for immortals to come back
well said clg were my favorite org especially the current roster
sapnap is on nrg thats the ultimate way to get people to watch your lol content also he was in the mrbeast vs ninja showmatch so its not like he knows nothing about the game edit look hes even in their announcement video
league content on youtube is horrible atm obviously their are outliers but so much of it is terrible
most league youtube content creators either stopped making league content or completely stopped uploading videos years ago this isnt
from what i ve heard nrg is one of the biggest esports brands in the west especially in comparison to clg just for the crowd presence of lcs this change should be a net positive right
yeah but the problem is anyone that has watched lol for a while probably won t know about any of that and just remember what nrg was in lol previously which was terrible and so bad it almost made santorin and impact leave na i personally don t know anything about them in other games cause i don t care much for other esports like shooters and the like and the names people keep mentioning in comments i ve literally never heard of before
no it sounds like from this article nrg is buying the spot and the team but msg is keeping ownership of the clg name maybe that s incorrect but that s what the article implies
clg s brand has next to zero value people massively overestimate brand value of lcs teams and organizations check their social media and youtube pages for example the brand is trash
i think the wording implies they won t do pro gaming but will still exist as an org for things like managing content streamers and such
clg doesn t have enough brand value you re better off starting off fresh investing in smaller newer orgs like m80 xset etc if you want to get into esports
that would likely end up like dig where a group that has absolutely nothing to do with dig has the name and is a bottom feeder since they rejoined they would be completely irrelevant if not for having that brand name imt at least was the same imt just minus the previous owner that people knew of before they left lol the first time around
never 4get kobe s bandage shot while phreak and riv went crazy from some basement in sweden also it was a bit later but that one tsm clg game in anaheim that shit was unforgettable
same brother at least our boys huhi and stixxay sre still in it
very possible that somebody snatches up the clg name and rebuilds the org might be in the wilderness for a bit but don t lose faith
same here clg was the only thing tying me emotionally to pro league maybe i ll root for gg for the old clg ties
we re free bud
wait you just watched clg for this many years jesus that sounds miserable
yeah i quit league a couple of years ago but i kept watching lcs because of clg this is the end of the road for me as well
at least you got nine years my poor old curse didn t get half as many and before anyone says liquid is the same no they aren t what if instead of selling the spot to nrg clg announced they were merging with nrg and the team was going to continue under nrg brand would clg fans feel that nrg was truly clg no crs or die
ggs fan time i guess
hey take it easy they re keeping the same roster and color scheme in fact you re only replacing letters instead of counter logic gaming it can be uhh no reasoning gaming same principle applies
be free return to the cesspool that is corporate american living
dolan ruins everything he touches
which time when msg killed them and started puppeteering their corpse around or when they got bored and took them behind the wood shed for good
and a terrible history in lol
direct link to the ballots for anyone interested https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltad9188aa9a70543a/blt42099c597fcf7a11/642efdb5ab116a10dd6a3c95/2023_spring_split_awards_-_mvp_ballots.pdf
damn hope prince s hospital fees aren t too bad
while i think prince struggled with the weird support swap when winsome was winningmorethansome berserker was on one this split he got the dawg in him
c9 with the spring mvp oh no no no no for real though there were players that i could see winning mvp and i wouldn t have been surprised congrats to berserker he was my choice though
an interesting fact c9 in the past years has had at least one mvp candidate summer c9 jungle svenskeren spring c9 jungle blaber spring c9 jungle blaber spring c9 top summit spring c9 adc berserker say what you will about c9 but god damn do their systems work the level of success they have post franchising is nothing but incredible props to the players coaches management and other staff of that org
award voting organized by player https://i.imgur.com/nhiwvfg.jpg i said max votes because there were listed voters but eg coach didn t vote and players and coaches can t vote for someone from their own team so the max you could get is
i don t think there was a bad choice out of blaber berserker and prince spica and gori also had monster splits i think this is a split where there were a ton of reasonable guys to have somewhere on the ballot i m guessing most of c9 is probably happy about this since it s berserker s 1st while it would have been blaber s 3rd but i do wonder who they d pick if they had to give their honest choice for who deserves it my guess is blaber not that the team is always best at evaluating such a thing
yeah that s a fair winner honestly could have gone to fudge berserker blaber spica or prince and i would have said yeah makes sense i dont think it was a landslide win by any means though this was a tight competition
berserker fighting
blaber was robbed blaber was not in fact robbed
consistently the best player in the lcs week in and week out well deserved
definitely gonna be a lot of people saying prince was robbed honestly i thought they were pretty even with prince having a harder team to carry would have gone with prince myself but i can understand berserker deserving it also
makes sense it s hard to give mvp to the 2nd best player in a role berserker was deserving of it by just being better than prince in every way blaber had another strong case for it but i m glad berserker got it he could be one of the best adcs in the world right now
dude well deserved
berserker is just too fucking good i m glad he got this he deserves it
deserved never seen an adc who plays like this much of a psycho and succeeds he was gonna win mvp eventually anyway
completely deserved best player in the league by a mile unrelated but it s absolutely fucking hilarious that the flyquest coach voted for closer as mvp in his 1st vote just to increase prince s chances of winning only for him to lose by points anyway
he was the best player on c9 imo still feel bad for prince can t help but wonder if his performance in the first and second half of the split were reversed would he have won recency bias is very hard to ignore naturally
jatt voting for berserker over blaber after that massive blaber campaign tho lol
so deserved happy to see another c9 spring split mvp four in a row
berserker was more clutch when it mattered blaber was the core of the team dynamic but didn t make as much of a difference this split compared to other ones it s well deserved that berserker get the award he s had solid growth and great decisionmaking in and out of lane
ik i m biased but it s very well deserved berserker was one of the few wincon players who remained highly consistent throughout the split and early in the season there were even a fair amount of games that d be otherwise doomed for c9 if it wasn t for him finding a miracle play the playoffs don t impact the voting but last match completely buried any prince vs berserker debate that remained as well
no doubt berserker deserves it but go back and watch any of the highlight montages and look at zven if berserker is mvp zven deserves 2nd place
imagine if berserker stayed at t1 and joined the main roster if he played like this with a role swap support imagine with keria well deserved
honestly i am shocked more people aren t on the fudge train he was by far the best top in the league and was a huge difference maker for c9 the entire split berserker was consistently very good but i think fudge was just on that extra level
blaber robbed
definitely deserved but i ll die on the hill that the adcs up for the vote this year were carried by zeri so i m glad they highlighted his draven plays
felt it was fudge who deserved it but beeserke is a good choice still
the most valuable player at least to me is the player most important to their team s relative success all pro lists should be where the highest skilled players are recognized independent of importance the fact that there were c9 members in the top voting implies that none of them were of outsize importance to the team in comparison to one another i m not gonna pretend i know who it should be i m not that good at league but the theoretical argument of for example gori being a very key part of gg or 100t only finding success playing around doublelift would be more compelling to me
kinda torn can t say he doesn t deserve it just feels like nobody had a standout mvp season so why not berserker good for him i suppose
prince deserved mvp what a joke region and joke mvp award
when was last time a lcs mvp was from na
should have been fudge who is the engine that makes c9 go
how did berserker get mvp when he unironically performed a little worse this split when you compare it to his previous split
removed
i know people are memeing but it really is dumb how berserker is playing with other potential mvp players and all pro 1st team players while prince has no one else and still finished 2nd yet he doesn t get mvp berserker support is considered the best in na and prince has who they should really list the criteria for mvp because these votes make no sense
please c9 vs t1 g2 and vit pleaaase
i disagree how can you be an mvp when you are playing with other nominated mvp s and a midlaner who would have been mvp nomination if he played from the beginning it should have been prince
well deserved i don t think there was another candidate that even came close to what berserker individually brought to his team
lots of people talking about how strong the adc role was this split and jungle being less oppressive for once if an adc performing at berserker s level didn t win then idk what it would take for one to win
well deserved he really lives up to his name
i hope berserker makes a name for himself at msi in front of all the other regions best adcs
berserker is the strongest after all
let s goo
i can t tell if berserker won mvp or zeri from these clips s
wtf is rafaa s votes lol dude sucks so much
jatt hyped up blaber being first multiple times just to vote berserker as mvp the betrayal is real but i agree berserker mvp
this is definitely a case of best performing player on the first place team is berserker the most valuable member to c9 no but does any team really have a player that is clearly the most valuable the obvious one is prince but i think that discredits how well impact and spica played yes he was often their win condition but his top side kept the game in a winnable state gori maybe but river has been playing out of his mind and stixxay greatly stepped up
good job lcs production this was a really good video
can we all recognize the incredibly difficult task it must have been for the lcs content team to find highlights that weren t zeri
makes no sense how can someone be mvp if two other teammates are also in the race he is never the most valuable player on his team
berserker really lives up to his name kid is as cracked as he is jacked i hope to see c9 pull the draven renata once again
berserker is slowly turning into a kpop idol
i wonder how prince and flyquest would have done if they never put in elya or if eyla played from the beginning besides that berserker is a monster and congrats to him i can t wait to see him and c9 at msi
is this the first split that bjergson has played and not gotten a single mvp vote
i wish they would change the award to best player of the split instead of mvp
anyone notice all these highlights even in the prince vid are almost all zeri zeri is really bad for pro play imo
it wasn t even close
interesting the disparity between broadcast votes and player votes when it comes to blaber was the same in all pro votes with blaber being almost unanimous from players and not even close from broadcast the broadcast for some weird reason really does not respect blaber very much
no crazy outlier ballots everything looks defensible also noticed both c9 voters included dl on their ballots lots of respect there
it seems players and coaches are much less likely to have prince as top for mvp than media broadcast
the person who voted closer is trolling lol
if zven gets tired of playing support i hope vulcan comes back to us vulcan is not afraid to publicly support and befriend his former org teammates and i love it
are 2nd and 3rd choices weighted at all or just in case of tie
why all of the declined to vote for the eg coaching staff does it have to do with the danny scandal
it s funny that both fq and c9 were obviously avoiding voting for the other team s mvp candidate except gigachad spica
prince is still the closest thing to a rival to berserker even if prince s team hasn t come together the way people thought prince s skill is undeniable
ppl will meme the hospital stuff but prince deserved to trash talk this split if you swapped prince to c9 and berserker to flyquest prince probably wins mvp
i hope he has insurance or else it ll be smarter to just fly back home before the debt collectors start knocking
i think winsome s korean was probably undervalued it probably gave prince some comfort and make communication in the c just a bit better
that dawg got berserker in him
was really on one in the first half of the split it just felt like he didn t make many big mistakes while blaber fudge were making big plays it just feels weird because for most of the split no one was really talking about berserker imo the mvp should be a defining player of the split that when you look back years later it represents their dominance really tough this split to think of any player who really did that though
blabler is more valuable though depends if you consider mvp the best or most valuable player
we excluding zven or emenes
if you start only at summer they ve won mvp of the time i don t think anyone on c9 deserved mvp for but summer jensen should have won would have been pretty crazy to have that type of a streak
say what you will about c9 but god damn do their systems work yet you would have been blasted if made this same comment right after c9 and ls parted ways lol
another interesting point here is that in both spring and now spring blaber was the runner up to his teammate who ended up winning mvp
you mean winner right not candidate
so people didn t have berserker on their ballot i know c9 couldn t so that would make people also crazy that blaber had more 1st place votes than prince
i don t think they counted pog awards in this years mvp vote at least according to the lolesports website https://lolesports.com/article/2023-lcs-spring-split-awards/blt902eff2623a058a3 doing the math they only seem to have added the votes from the ballot i thought the broadcast at one point brought up pog awards influencing mvp so maybe the number on the lolesports website is just wrong berserker still gets mvp either way so it doesn t really matter whether they were counted or not
seems like they were messing with berserker somewhat while still serious but ya zven and fudge were saying they d have fly even if they swapped berserker and prince i would think c9 would honestly say blaber fudge than berserker
spica got points out of
spica
blaber was robbed i actually agree with the results of the voting yet want to shout out blaber since he has been great this split
prince hasn t looked mvp caliber in weeks berserker is just the better player
prince had the best team the first half and berserker the second half the difference is berserker kept his level up the whole split while prince fell off
haven t seen any of those comments yet especially with how far prince fell off later on
i think better in every way is a bit much he was definitely better in the second half of the split but prince also played with a black hole at support
berserker has teammates better than their flyquest counterparts coach of the split and is better than prince but c9 ends up with the same score as flyquest thinking emoji
where are the points shown or you did the math with the ballots
and the c9 players ballot from blaber had spica i wouldn t say that either of those are particularly ridiculous sharkz is a former jungler who probably is just very impressed with closer and gives him a lot of credit for the 100t turnaround just like blaber or the c9 players as a whole however they did the ballot probably identifies spica as the main driving force when they are gameplanning for flyquest it s also important to remember that a lot of the team side people end up heavily influenced by scrims and i would not be at all surprised if closer dominates those as an aggressive jungler so you have a former jungler watching this crazy jungler run over a scrim block every week
it would be a different story if his performance was flipped starting at a lower point and growing stronger is always perceived better than starting strong then faltering you never want to see teams regress as the split goes on so having fly go from to tiebreaker included really hampers enthusiasm if the performance was flipped i definitely think prince would be front runner
c9 has been cleaning up mvps since sven in summer right they ve had an mvp for every year and if you do the totally arbitrary summer start they have like a mvp wr i believe
think so going backwards it s beserker summit blaber blaber iirc
i don t think he d have gotten on the main roster considering gumayusi just got 1st all pro in the lck i doubt t1 would replace guma for berserker unless guma really falls off sometime in the near future
he was never even considered for the main spot joe said that guma earned his right to an uncontested spot
massive downgrade for the fact that berserker is a resource hungry type of player comparing guma and berserker s first international competition is not even close guma clears berserker
top was largely a nothing role this split was mostly tank duty all season fudge was one of the few playing other stuff but even when c9 focused topside often berserker would pop off in a mid game fight and then just shove the game down the opposing team s throat from there fudge was miles better than the next top but the role is so weak disconnected from the team that it would have to be win through top every game like when summit won for it to be considered mvp
i for sure feel like fudge getting first team top was the more correct award the gap between him and every other top laner was massive the rest of the top regardless of role was a lot more muddy while i could see him as mvp and not argued against it i also see the same with berserker any of the final could have gotten it and i d have gone yep
in part i think this feeling may be because there were actually a handful of players that looked really good whereas in some prior splits there s a far and away best performer
with the benefit of hindsight it would have made more sense for them to be based near chicago so that pros would be playing on the best ping and it s a centralized location to the rest of the country i also definitely agree that la s cost benefit is pretty terrible with that being said riot never expected lol to be this successful and were originally a studio out of santa monica it did make sense to have their tournaments be close to home especially since staff like phreak were casters for the longest time building their studio out on the west coast was definitely a mistake in the long run but i think it also made sense why we ended up here
i dont think its just basing themselves on the west coast its the extreme lack of road shows events for lcs across the region they expected that lcs finals a year was enough engagement to keep a whole community engaged long term lcs should have been on the road or more times a year imo superweeks playoffs and opening weekends all could be at different locations across the us can does not have to be arenas but smaller theaters can work perfect too college campuses are always looking for events to bring in that their students community can enjoy and would actually be cheap for the lcs to rent out the space instead we are just stuck in the lcs arena that brings no live audience energy and only locals really can get too
the thing that this post seems to overlook is the fact that riot also just has to spend so much more for production talent in la than anywhere else in the us the daily rates and competition with all other major media sources tv hollywood etc etc means just from a labour perspective they are paying a premium when the same qualitatively is possible in other markets the lcs in chicago just seems like such a no brainer considering overhead and ping but the fact that most orgs have multi million dollar facilities in la makes me think we d see tremendous pushback on that front
dig is owned by the 76ers can t get more philly based than the coaching staff running it down and doing nothing
bro i want to see the lcs so bad but the usa is huge and i can t travel to a place as far as raleigh
someone else talked about cost of talent but how about cost of living in general lcs minimum being 75k is peanuts in la whereas many places is perfectly livable and even wealthy in others cost of real estate is ludicrous too side point i ve been a religious follower of lcs since and i ve only ever been to one event and it was worlds in new york this past year you want more passion from fans how about try including more than la
not included but also relevant how expensive it is to have the studio in la as well as players living there i m not sure if nyc would be much cheaper but having it anywhere else would probably save them tons of money
counter point all the money that allowed the lcs to grow was on the west coast companies and investors want to see their product and while chicago is a huge city the league never would have been able to secure the same level of investment that they achieved in cali
i mean it sounds nice and all but hindsight is when the lcs started that s where the servers were also riot had an even heavier hand in it then they do now and that s where riot was located when they moved them to chicago that would ve been the ideal time to change over but it still would ve been a massive shift basically telling everyone working on esports they could move to chicago or kick rocks same with all the teams who had started building their own facilities etc and the players who had started to have lives over there and now that everything is even more engrained into la it would be basically impossible to make the switch until the league is basically dead
the server used to be at la ca by the time they moved the server all of the teams in na has already headquartered in la and are established there it was too late at that point
the discontinuation of iem and riots refusal to add more international events hurt league the most
i m sure there are a number of people in this thread who understand the costs and logistics of this subject but most of y all in this thread are talking straight out of your asses about costs and talent and what you would ve done differently and you know it
what the fuck are these whack ass population reasonings are we trying to fill a seat arena the lcs studio seats like people if they built one in nyc it would hold the same amount also the lcs makes absolutely no money from their studio shows and never will lol you re also making it sound like los angeles hardly has any people the nyc metro and socal have almost the same exact amount of people vs million also it doesn t matter where you put the events we aren t going to all of a sudden get a ton of na vs eu tournaments
la proper might only have that many people but cities like santa monica beverley hills el segundo the beach cities are all bordering la proper or surrounded by la proper there is almost million in la county if you consider the greater metro area of la oc it s close to million people
companies move to cities like la san fran boston nyc for a bunch of reasons but from my experience the biggest reason is not actually profit but instead pleasing the owners of the company who would rather lose money than live in a less than top tier metro area big boss man likes la weather so everyone and every thing has to follow through and make it happen then they offer relocation to a handpicked group of employees cram everyone into a tiny office building refuse to raise salary to match the cost of living and eventually sell the building for a huge profit the company itself sinks but the owners have already taken what they want
lcs times do not cater to pst what most games are played and done with before the business day ends in pst
fair point but west coast east coast simple as that
these are the best threads when everyone has no idea what they are talking about but speak with the confidence everything they are saying is a fact just braindead takes all around gotta love it
i feel like people who make these types of posts have no idea what it s like in la outside of numbers they see and hear from other sources there s a reason why a lot of streamers and influencers live out in california la instead of chicago or ny the culture and the tech spaces are much more conducive for building out an esports scene
points and are absolutely irrelevant live audiences are worthless running stadium events for esports are a massive waste of money and they never turn a profit and having regional franchise based teams is a terrivle idea because league doesn t have a big enough player fanbase in na to sustain multiple regional franchises point is just a pipedream not going to address that logistical nightmare however i completely agree with your other points having the lcs is california has always been a terrible decision not only for ping and viewership from eu but also because of how fucking expensive la is
counterpoint west coast best coast
wow we ve finally reached the lcs is failing because it s in la arguments
the money and development skills are based in california you wouldn t have had league without the way it was set up also they moved servers over there so it s a fair compromise
most of us in central time zone even down into some parts of tx route internet through chicago which sure chicago is midwest its a hell of a lot closer than the west coast chicago would ahve been the most geographically intelligent place based on packet routing in the u s imho also labor and vendor rates are less in the midwest
so being in la lcs is at times that cater to the vast minority of north america remember champions queue i always wanted to watch it but it didn t even start until after i went to bed and that quantity of people isn t just for viewers to be a pro player you need to move to california as it is it would be much easier to be based where people actually live than to have to move across the country so it would make a pro career more accessible for more players this point is actually counter productive because with the starting times right now pm pst the times are quite okay for most of the country to watch since most live in the eastern and central region as you have pointed out yourself imagine the lcs being based in ny and starting at pm est that would be terrible for everyone this is dwarfed by nyc s population of million that s more potential players how s so every player who has the chance of playing in the lcs will instantly move there people in the us are very open to moving somewhere else it s almost in their dna given the entire college situation and how sports teams with draft and trades work i personally have flown out to europe for a long weekend several times it s totally reasonable to do this combined with some other points you have made with the cities within a 3h flight radius tells me that you are not really in tune with how exhausting and expensive constant travel and setting up such events are there is a reason every sports league is based in new york where the headquarters of a league are based says absolutely nothing about where and when games are being played and where teams are based many companies are based in ny if only for the reason that it s the financial center of the us
do you have any idea how expensive shit in nyc is or even chicago also studio and games being based in pst actually helps est a ton i lived in ny and moved to la and its way harder to catch games that start at than start at
i believe there was more talent on the west coast just look at wow bg9 all other bg s lol playerbase is just an extension of wow s if west coast does not have low ping na never becomes initially huge with talented players there is still a lot more talent on the west coast imo moving servers to chicago was the beginning of when everyone started sucking
i still thinking allowing teams to have a majority of players being imports as the biggest lcs killer
how about plushies of meta champions and little team jerseys for the plushies as a collectors item seasonally
there is no regional connection for any lcs franchise since they re all based in the same place they have to be based in the same place since there isn t really another city that close to la i guess you could spread out to san diego san francisco and las vegas maybe phoenix but that s about it and it wouldn t be easy meanwhile new york boston philadelphia baltimore and washington are all on the same train line it takes a few hours to get between these cities and that s not even counting all the other short flight cities around on the east coast if we count those here are the major cities within a ish hour flight of nyc miami orlando chicago atlanta toronto boston nashville washington montreal baltimore pittsburgh st louis detroit charlotte minneapolis cleveland cincinnati columbus jacksonville memphis indianapolis milwaukee and i m done naming cities but there are a whole lot more also a lot of these flights cost like bucks or less round trip for la the cities are las vegas san francisco seattle houston dallas denver phoenix portland san diego san antonio salt lake city you could spread events around and teams could have regional territories hell even if they all wanted to stay in nyc alone they could split up the boroughs and neighborhoods to have some kind of regional connection i know clg tried to be the new york team a bit but i mean you play in california and come here once every six years this is an entirely irrelevant point proven that by the success of the lpl and the lck neither of them have any regional branding and are doing fine the lpl doesn t have specific regional branding astralis is a danish esports organization but its not like they re waving the flag at every game it means basically nothing
best coast is best coast
i think the worst thing is having nothing to keep my attention even pokemon realized that kept ash and pikachu an integral part of the franchise all these years most teams have zero players i care about the casters i cared about are pretty much all gone the ganeplay is worse than most other regions so what reason do i have to watch the lcs
lcs should ve moved to chicago when the servers moved yeah it would ve been weird not having it in la anymore but production costs would ve been a hell of a lot lower and we wouldn t have had so many years of na bad cuz la ping bad might ve actually given the top level of our scene a realistic chance to improve mechanically
abhorrent post
they should move to atlanta
california has the best weather people want to live there
to your first point west coast times are also way too late for fans in eu and i remember there being more european fans watching lcs na in earlier days
the lcs should have moved with the servers to chicago probably then the teams doubled down by opening these huge team facilities that would never allow the league to move from la to east coast biggest punt ever
another huge issue is the la mentality in my opinion it s been one of the biggest issues with the lcs and the way the teams are handled managed ever since the beginning they are ran with this ridiculous silicon valley mentality like they are some tech startup when in reality they are more of a club like how they do it in eu eu really seems like they are doing a great job and i don t just mean the lec either all of the leagues there we could never have other leagues here like they do there because of the way people over here think a team is supposed to be ran
chicago chicago chicago chicago chicago
all the vc money to fund the teams was in california and so there they were
stay mad east coaster lmao be happy with your chicago servers you glutton
the franchise system should have been teams in west in east top each side advance to playoffs and we get teams on a double elim bracket
take him support ward alot and steal some kills
they hate you because you tell the truth youarecutexd
not sure if somebody has called it out but i would include culture too the west coast specifically california is in a fantasy land compared to the rest of the us people there just think and act differently which makes it hard for the rest of the us to relate perfect example was worlds in chicago fans were fired up and booing the other teams then everybody started crying a river about how inappropriate it was sorry that is america we are the most competitive country in the world and we go crazy over sports but for some reason the lcs wants to paint a picture of a bunch of nice kids showing up for tea and crumpets it s disgusting the lcs should be moved to atlanta they have the production talent there and a culture that is more aligned with what resonates in the us
love reading la people s butthurt or cope comments
should either be based in chicago or texas both are much much cheaper but riot like many american companies have this california lifestyle they must insist on
look up how many software engineers work in the west coast
nyc lcs would literally never not be packed the auditorium at msg sat like 5k people and there were maybe a handful of empty seats
there s a very obvious reason why it s in la and why it will stay there no overseas talent is going to move to waukegan even for a big paycheck
of all the hypothesis i ve seen about the lcs dying this has to be one of the worst ones sorta fair point but you can t act like there people and a bison in mt and pt there are enough people there this is entirely an aesthetic choice and depends on what a person individually prefers sure better public transport is better than bad public transport its just weird to pin it as the reason that the lcs is doing poorly this is on the teams not re investing back into the community and trying to grow their brands on a local level more regional events would have been a better investment than spending millions on shit imports but alas the lcs itself could have done a bit more but if teams want regional fanbases they gotta put in work to make them this would never happen no teams would do this just no you can t just punt the west coast because that s the only place teams have attempted to make regional fanbases you punt the west coast like that you loose a lot of fans yeah the main offices are in nyc but are every single game from the sports league played in nyc honestly if teams actually invested in regional teams maybe an lpl style partial home team thing might have been possible but yeah gotta pay swordart 6mil to come run it down for no reason instead of trying to improve the scene i guess
the biggest mistake in league esports was thinking the west was ever going to compete they re all geologically crippled same with eu b b b b b but g2 go d in the finals move them all to china korea for a massive major league there is a reason every sports league is based in new york and most games and events happen in est this is one of the dumbest comments i ve ever read it s a colonial accident that the east was established as the main hubs of the u s that s the only reason all western fans just have constant excuses and losers lament s about everything the goldilock s porridge isn t just right and here s why
la makes sense for the location of lcs though riot is based in la twitch is based in la influencer culture in general is largely based around la it would make lcs detached from gamer culture in general if it were based anywhere else also points are completely irrelevant la is still the second biggest city in the country so how is basing the lcs in la ca not catering to where people live regarding regions there wouldn t be any regional affinity for viewers regardless of where its located people aren t driving hours to watch lcs anyways so why would people fly hours to watch a regular lcs game anyways lcs dying upvotes to the left
moving at this point is probably wayyyy to expensive not only for rito but also the teams orgs who bought built etc facilities and it was set up on the west coast originally because when the lcs started servers were hosted on the west coast remember east coast rocking ping as you mentioned
when talking about europe are we talking about the whole region if so the population difference is basically double of the us and canada put together that definitely will take into account in viewership numbers and player base
it just seems that being based out of la was purely out of convenience the corporate offices were in la so it was easy to build the esports studio nearby
as an east coast viewer for over years i completely agree with this take
riot also with valorant had the chance to relocate they could ve made a new studio and trialed it with vct this year then switched lcs to the same east coast studio that vct would ve used
i have always found clash similar with the late start time has always made it incredibly uninviting i understand the importance of being inclusive but the majority of players are to the east
i think it s obvious that they made those initial decisions based on what was easy not what was good for the league long term it s probably biting them a bit chicago or texas would have likely been idea hub cities maybe even georgia due to it being a major travel hub and eu being the most common travel destination though ga would be an insane culture shock for imports
california has tax write offs and shieeet for this type of stuff
hotshot sold the brand off ages ago right does it really matter what happens after that esports is all about getting paid nothing lasts forever
i agree with this post would be cool if they actually came to philly instead
nah the biggest mistake to the entire league system was trying to base it off of traditional sports there should never have been leagues or region locking or any of that silly bullshit it should just be an open circuit with international tournaments all year round x200b also don t give me that jet lag bullshit sitting on a first class flight for hours isn t fucking hard millions of people travel far more for their jobs while making a tiny fraction of what these players do the league system ruined what could have been a great scene and e sport
i definitely agree it shut never been in california dallas chicago or new york majority of the players base in na is in the east of the country
move it to chicago just to piss travis off at this point
california santa monica weather ny weather done
isn t california the place to be for vc especially in tech or am i misinformed
the lcs was based where it is when the servers were in la
the only reason the lcs is in la is because riot is based out of la and they could set up the lcs across the street it s literally across the street that s sadly the long and short of it guess where the lec is in eu berlin guess where riot is set up in eu would it shock anyone to know it s berlin riot is lazy frankly when it comes to planning ahead and setting up the lcs lec down the street is what s easiest for them it s a miracle they bothered to move the na servers to a more centralized location to be quite frank because they argued against doing it for years before they did
in summoning insight monte also had some great arguments why lcs shouldnt be in la with the biggest being that having the studio and production in la is expensive as fuck and would be more affordable in other parts of the country the only reason why lcs even is in california is cos the riot hq is there which shouldnt matter at all
if only they moved when the servers did chicago or atlanta or even toronto would have been better west coast location has stunted the leagues full potential
point to be in la riot is in la it literally doesn t matter about any other point you re right obviously there are a billion reasons why being elsewhere would have been better honestly chicago would have been the best place overall that s with hindsight though
if it was in ny we could also see eddie kingston cut a great promo for it
truly a shame because la apart from the lakers always lacks viewership for all other sports they don t sports as hard as they do in boston and new york venues are always packed here even for niche sports
number is not entirely true people on east coast na with good connections can get ms depending on your isp routing including people in nyc source me in eastern canada playing at a steady ms down from back when the servers where in california
i think chicago would have been better in hindsight when they moved the service to chicago they should have packed the lcs and the whole studio up and moved there as well
one of my favorite stories to tell to new league players was back in my day i didn t have these fancy computers i played on a walmart laptop and got fps in team fights and had ping and i still managed to hit silver high elo
i think riot completely missed the mark with how they have evolved into franchises in relegations dividing between cities states regions would ve given the opportunity to create the regional rivalries op talked about instead lcs orgs are having to revert to hiring your favorite streamer and throwing a logo on their chest to attempt to build a wider community to be honest as an lcs pro league enjoyer i find it hard to truly identify with an organization rebranding roster turnover orgs treating their players like garbage i think roster continuity helps here but overall it s kinda like okay which team treats their players the best and has good non cringe content i d love to see them even attempt this model in challenger series with the potential to take players from universities in the same area that were once rivals and form them into a regional team boom instantly two fanbases are invested side note probably not super sustainable to establish a pro league in the highest cost per living area in the us i wonder how many orgs went belly up in lcs and when relegated just because they couldn t afford rent food gas and transportation in la
the biggest mistake lcs ever made was not basing themselves out on the west coast are you telling me that the video game and esports industry was just as if not more alive on the east coast in the early mid s than it was in california here s a primer most video game companies are based on the west coast very few design animation studios are based in est on top of that none of these companies are based in the tech hubs of their regions sf and la but rather a little bit out santa monica san mateo irvine your geographical argument doesn t hold either you re smoking dick if you think that the city of l a is a better representation of the population here than la county everyone from the played league of legends and probably still do moreso than any other area in the united states and from personal experience everyone from north to south o c would also flock to league of legends events in s3 s7 a good majority of the most famous lcs pro s came from california too riot s biggest mistakes have nothing to do with where they based the show honestly i feel like it s a moot point because the lcs eco system in america would ve probably been 100x better if there was an eastern and western conference similar to how the nba is there s simply too large of a distance between both ends of the country that you can t please everyone the import rule is stupid too especially since they essentially grandfathered half the league and still retained the fact that you could have of your team be international players
i would be very surprised if they didn t float the idea of moving lcs to chicago or to the east coast for whatever reason they decided to play it safe and root themselves in la which at this point it is way to late to move away it is an interesting hypothetical if they didn t have just the la bubble for lcs maybe more players on the east coast would gravitate towards being pros it would have to be a good possibility as it seems like most younger lcs pro players are all west coasters obviously it is too little to late for lcs to improve from their declining viewership i think rooting themselves into la has contributed to the current state but it is a bunch of things built up over the last years as well
regional teams make no sense the teams have no base in different states cities its such a weird thing to force overwatch league tried to do this shit and it just made everything worse being in la makes no sense but at least everyone is near each other just because traditional sports does it does not mean esports needs to do it
i wish there was a separate east and west coast server like there was in diablo growing up
but the east coast sucks no one wants to be there
this is such a fun thread the community could start local leagues and test out the theory about if regional leagues are possible organize some local teams in either boston new york or philly new york there should be enough players in both cities to at least run a local tournament in both cities and let the winners compete against one another i think at a certain point if the community doesn t organize games and makes it fun for new people to join then we share a portion of the blame for why the game is dying in na
even tho most of op s arguments are let s say clowny at least with whole 4th point being like wtf is going on and weirdly playing with percentages leaving whole context to make his argument stronger example being of us of canada even tho whole population of canada is like lil more than of us s i have to say doesn t change the fact that his point is overall valid and even in some parts resonated with person like me who is from outside na especially 3rd point for me being from eu and seeing lost potential in my region on that matter
imagine how much cheaper the gamer mansions would ve been in chicago
when the lcs started the servers were west coast i was in chicago when they moved them in before that we were on ms ping
riot employees also don t want to move away from la
it all started with season worlds in phreak s basement
there s zero large cities around chicago most us population is near coasts the best solution would have been us east and us west the rivalry between leagues would be popular in us and outside the continental rivalry east players could interact with eu and west players with asia an underrated reason why na players do worse on world stage is because they re used to playing on much higher ping us east west would make na more competitive not less because of players would have low ping instead of
building their studio out on the west coast was definitely a mistake in the long run eh i kinda have to disagree realistically having everything in the east coast would have done nothing to stop the problems the lcs is having right now the server move to chicago was supposed to help out the native player base hone their mechanics to compete better but as we saw lcs has less native talent since the switch not more because import talent puts natives to shame ping was always a cop out single digit ping in champ q but pros preferred to play 50ping soloq anyways population doesn t matter people aren t going to be packing stadiums for regular split games proximity to eu literally means nothing in this context logistics and travel will still be a pain to organize regardless if lcs is on the east or west coast and unless they are super serious tournaments nobody really cares about na vs eu battle of the atlantic was a meme also east coast weather sucks unless you are in florida
no one wants to be in illinois it s a shit hole you can t attract talent when your first question is are you willing to move to chicago
kansas city would have been best since they have google fiber
league esports starter before the servers moved to chicago they used to be west coast
in season they used to do weeks at mlg and pax which they outgrew but they definitely could have engaged non la audiences outside of the finals if they wanted to
this is another issue with the lec format if na switches to it there is only a single road show all year
look at the old school halo pro season orlando raleigh anaheim columbus providence dallas nashville etc
i really want road shows and finals to include canada again it s been so long
the real funny stuff is that they all sold their spots back to orgs that were once in lcs none of the orgs are actually new to the lcs at least in their branding
echo fox was forced to sell which is abit different but the rest is fine
the same is true for lec misfits splyce schalke origin and rogue have all been replaced
how much did they sell it for is the value actually lower or did they just cash out
if you are gonna make a doomer post about teams leaving the lcs and trying to throw shade at na at least get your facts straight instead of half assing it and clearly not knowing what you are talking about with random assumptions this is what really happened echo fox was forced by riot they didn t do so willingly which immediately doesn t at all fit with the narrative you are trying to spin they failed to properly sell their spot in the time given so the spot was then in turn through riot not echo fox directly sold to eg clutch didn t sell their spot they absorbed dig and rebranded into dig so technically they didn t go anywhere as much as it was a rebrand with slightly extra steps optic gaming didn t sell their spot either their parent company was bought out by immortals which gained them the lcs spot and the overwatch league spot again doesn t fit your narrative as optic had no intentions of selling their spot but their parent company was bought because imt wanted the owl and lcs spots respectively x200b so basically of your right off the bat are just not at all what you are trying to dress it up as out of the other two only one is technically selling their spot but that s a whole can of worms x200b tsm has been trying to leave the lcs for a while now this isn t a sudden oh noes the lcs is dying like your post is trying to insinuate and more to do with issues regarding regi they were talking about trying to get a spot in china around the time franchising was happening which people seem to have forgotten as well as trying to get into the lec at one point the brazil news was newer at least so i guess this half sort of fits but not in the way you are presenting it or at least not the reasoning clg was doomed when gg cashed out to hand ownership over to the msg group and have been on life support ever since the fact they msg now own nrg is just an immediate bullet wound for them before they are even in the league unfortunately given the way the deal has gone down this still doesn t fit your narrative as it isn t clg selling their spot to another team it s the ownership group shelving clg as a brand in favor of nrg as a brand as both are now owned by the same parent company to top it off they aren t really going anywhere and it s more like a rebrand as the announcement earlier today talked about all of the current infrastructure in place with clg was staying in place but the nrg brand is taking over again not selling their spit https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440](https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440) twitter comment with a video where the nrg owner states msg as a now major shareholder of nrg which is the opposite of the op trying to claim in this thread the exact opposite of what the owner himself states just thought i d add that context since the guy is just lying up and down the joint at this point final count yes i said because i stated why tsm was false and op themselves already said why fly literally doesn t fit what they are trying to sell he just added it to pad his stats so i left it out not to pad mine tl dr you got half of one of the five right
lcs salaries were unsustainable and then add to the decline in viewership the esports bubble bursted
yeap now everyone can understand why some teams that got the lec franchise when it was introduced refused after seeing how riot is gonna market the league i think north and another org didnt take the deal and why rogue and splyce got the franchise spot later on or so its so obvious lcs orgs are gonna jump ship with the state of the league the state of the lcs and how riot abandoned any form of revenue for the teams and didnt introduce new stuff after the first year and the fan pass team wards etc
so glad i picked 100t for my fandom
brands aren t but majority of these old orgs coming back are owned by new owners from their og days
inb4 clg buys tsm
the rest aren t fine cause clutch didn t sell they rebranded to dig after picking up the ip as dig didn t exist essentially after they didn t get a franchising spot and optic didn t sell their parent company was bought out by imt to get the lcs and overwatch league spots cause they failed to initially get either
splyce and origen weren t replaced overactive media and astralis respectively owned splyce and origen the same ownership groups are still in lec
not even half of these teams sold their spot and got replaced what are you on about
cant say how much as they didnt report that but we do know a lot of payment was done through giving msg a large amount of non controlling shares into nrg esports people around the scene were surprised about nrg being able to afford a spot so we don t know what was given in cash until something public hits the msg side
it is more than the franchise buy in but montecristo implied on summoning insight that its less than the lec spots went for up to mio and nothing riot would likely be proud of hence the actual number will probably never be disclosed
million nun crazy tbh
they only kind of sort of sold it at all msg actually owns nrg now much like they own clg so it s a bit of a brand swap more than an actual sale as msg is keeping all of clgs infrastructure in place as was said earlier in one of the announcements one of the many actually important elements op is leaving out https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440](https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440) for reference where the nrg owner says msg is a major shareholder of nrg now getting downvoted for stating facts with a direct link now people are really doomer in this place lately huh
you re just coping and making excuses for each team
it was imt of all people that started this bullshit overinflated salaries when they built their first roster now they re a bottom team that just does the bare minimum fuck that org
most of this happened years ago so that narrative don t really fly clg and tsm are current but the other were or before plus one was a force out because of owner issues was rebranding not selling a spot and the other wasn t selling a spot the parent company was bought out optic into imt the esports bubble had nothing to do with any of those
isn t this the exact opposite nrg is a larger more popular and more well financed org than clg and they re choosing to jump into the lcs if they re still paying above the franchise fee reportedly then they must see value in the lcs still
yeah people are jumping ship that s why literally of those didn t actually sell their spots like the op is claiming and clg is being replaced by a much more well known brand in nrg also is still owned by msg so in essense they didn t go anywhere at all they just swapped named as all the clg infrastructure as announced earlier today is staying in place
personally i think a bigger issue with league is that teams continually give players more money it isn t sustainable
north the north is not here anymore movistar riders spring superliga champion if i remember correctly
meanwhile teams like fnc and g2 literally applied for initial franchising in na lol
oh boy it sure is exciting for every team to be a corporate collective rather than actual players coming together and making new teams at least they have all lost money trying to buy into esports lmao fuck the franchise model it s completely anti competitive and when people tell me and others that is just how things have to work because reasons then they don t understand why viewership drops esports isn t like a local sports team people have no default reason to support a team personally i follow players between orgs like right now i d vaguely prefer vit to win lec became of perkz but there is no long term loyalty there from me
tcslmg gonna be harder to chant
last time i checked dig s parent company was the one that did the acquisitions portion of m a
also rogue was a partnership with koi so it s just misfits and schalke that straight up bailed
yeah and even koi rogue was more of a merger than rogue selling the spot it was only really schalke and misfits that actually decided to sell the spot
not even half of the teams the op stated sold their spots either so what are ya gonna do lol
why do you keep stating your made up assumptions as fact https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440](https://twitter.com/nrgleague/status/1644082584765501440) he literally says msg has become a major shareholder in nrg essentially now being the owner of both clg and nrg in the video by the owner of nrg he literally says the opposite of what you said
as long as it is above million then it means a profit was made at the very least
it s easily in the high range as they not only paid in money but enough shares to make msg a major shareholder for nrg now as stated by their owner
major does not necessarily mean majority
climb back in your cave with your less than a month old troll alt
you surely are a literate person that comment has accurate characterized why most of the examples of brands leaving aren t relevant at all to the decline of lcs
nah he s not coping literally all of what he said for the first three are true clutch was owned by houston rockets backroom they bought the parent group of dig and rebranded to dig since clutch was basically only in lol immortals did by optics parent company no reason to have esports orgs in the same arena so they basically merged them only for optic to be rebought by the original owner echo fox was starting to push into other esports but lcs was the linchpin no lcs no reason to expand group imploded after
the clutch one is also just wrong from a procedural perspective
new imt is completely different from old imt iirc at least old imt bought good players don t let anyone forget that new imt is responsible for importing eika and soaz
i get people want a player collective like relegation but i think markz on the blame game did frame it correctly what started happening is orgs would just bring in veterans that they knew could keep them in lcs or win their relegation games to ensure that their spots weren t taken you even had c9 using their stacked secondary roster winning and then selling the lcs spot after they got in it hasn t been the five players and a dream style for a very long time and the closest thing we have to that right now is in nacl with the cincinnati fear being a solid amateur team but still not lcs caliber
at least they have all lost money trying to buy into esports lmao except they haven t none of the orgs leaving lcs or lec through selling their spots lost money leaving either of them most have either recouped their losses or made massive profits ala schalke or misfits they don t understand why viewership drops you don t understand why viewership drops either people like you who think franchising is the ultimate boogeyman which killed the lcs are coping hard lcs dying is because of a multitude of factors including but not limited to a massive decline in league of legends in general in na plus building up of years of bad international results and an awful stale broadcast which didn t change until it was far too late if you think franchising decline in interest please explain to me why every other league be it lec lpl or lck or even cblol have witnessed massive viewership growth since franchising while lcs has declined
misfits still owns of the slot i would put misfits and rogue in the same boat because both of them own minority stakes in the slot still and both have handed over operational control completely if i had to guess both misfits and rogue will get bought out of their shares eventually once koi and heretics can get enough capital to do so
if you start getting into the weeds then echo fox was forced to sell flyquest just had a change of ownership which is not selling their spot
he literally says msg has become a major shareholder in nrg essentially now being the owner of both clg and nrg nonsense major shareholder and majority shareholder are not the same msg is not the owner of nrg they are equivalent to a significant equity shareholder
you have years of inflation and operating at loss to factor in on the other hand the sale is not a clean cash vs entire spot as msg already has majority shares in nrg which makes the effective numbers hazy
you re tying to insinuate the lcs isn t going downhill when it s been losing viewership year after year for years straight now not sure why when every data point shows that whatever helps you sleep at night trying to spin the fact that tsm or clg leaving the league is going to be okay
french coaches importing french players i am shocked
it s not completely different actually just that the original owner isn t involved anymore after they purchased optic s parent company which is why imt is in optic wasn t looking to sell actively
damwon lmao
do you have a source for a hake and misfits or are you just looking at cost of slot at buy in vs sale of slot at exit time
he is probably talking about lcs orgs specifically
you know we are talking about lcs and having to use lck to prove a point doesn t make you smart it just makes you an ass
a hake and misfits typing error or autocorrect maybe i m not sure what the question is
schalke my phone doesn t like german apparently
schalke is a one off scenario they got relegated in soccer and had no choice but to panic sell the lec spot among a bunch of other cuts
ah okay yeah mainly cost of the slot selling price i also have gained a general understanding of the finances of esports over the years this video will give you a quick summary of the costs associated with lec https://youtu.be/96frqiolcc8 this was of course before franchising operating costs went up a decent amount after this point but so did revenue and league rev share from the lec which experienced massive growth in the years since both misfits and schalke also generally ran lean operations on the lower budget side of the lec aside from the outlier misfits superteam while i m not sure schalke made a profit from the sale because their sale was essentially a distress sale though i suspect it was still profitable misfits definitely made off like kings from selling their slot
yeah but they would only theoretically sell it if it was negative whether the sale made it overall profitable or not is another matter
as an adc player i can t wait to never being able to escape udyr
it s sooooo much worse for vlad ryze and seraphine a very important detail people are not noticing on the twitter feed is that there s a cooldown of seconds between stacks meaning to fully activate it you have a minimum of seconds after which all you get is ms which is like more than the burst of ms the current one gives but the current one almost every mage can proc it immediately to get that chonky burst of speed and reposition like phase rush on top of getting more ap vlad ryze and seraphine do not want to wait seconds for ms at the end of a fight if it even lasts that long edit someone corrected me it s actually seconds to activate if you chain damage instantly at perfect intervals of seconds since the first stack doesn t have a cooldown from but still considering that s the most ideal scenario and not very realistic i m still not fond of this rework
not a single person in this thread mentioning singed this seems like it s tailored for him and lillia
unfortunate that it s losing the ap boost when active it s gaining passively but is effectively being nerfed by ap if you were able to keep it active before
this sucks this has long been my favorite second item on seraphine and now it is just lame
for swain he would love it but there are other items that he wants needs he likes ap health items more or items that prolong his presence in a fight
time to play lillia
what an unnecessary change
it s a trade of damage for ms personally i would have kept the current version due to the bias of what champs i am playing but this new version would also go really well on some other champs that i might consider trying again while still being somewhat good on the current users it s probably a net positive change
honestly i feel like current cosmic drive is in a pretty decent spot right now this change feels like it will just make it broken
while i like the idea of an exciting movement speed item for ap champs can we get an item focused on cdr too then like for champs that just want to have a lot of haste but dont care about the movementspeed
so ap ivern is no longer going cosmic probably better question in the ivern sub
makes it slightly less powerful for the existing users who can autostack and maintain the buff but makes it generally a non troll item for every other ap character bc anyone can proc this consistently hopefully we will also see meaningful ah buffs for other items like horizon focus or banshee s lmfao at 10ah because this is the only non mythic giving more than 15ah whilst bruisers get from bc hydra serylda shojin and even from dd again
hear me out garen
seems kinda bad with these changes i think id much prefer the current one instead of the new version seconds seems like an eternity to get fully stacked in league time
i think its interesting riot said that a hard part about designing ap items is that unlike ad champs which enjoy ad atk speed armor pen cdr onhit or crit ap champs enjoy a much smaller range of ap magic pen or cdr so its hard to design items that diversify the pool usually new ap items are either super niche with a tiny amount of users or end up being a superior version of a pre existing item and replace the other item wholesale
i just dont understand who this is for because the item has raw offensive stats 100ap haste yet the ppl who can work with the 5s cd probably want less gold value in raw damage ahri and lilia come to mind who really like this
rip bomba
if this works on dots then it will surely mostly be bought together with liandries
seems like skarner just got a new ap item
sounds pretty good on champs like lillia udyr with dot being able to refresh the buff constantly interested to see how it performs when it goes live
this would make playing liandrys viktor even more fun
so it s basically just a swain morde item now
well to begin with the current passive of the cosmic drive did not make much sense as the mage could gain ap and ms after shooting most of his skills previously buying cosmic drive in the 2nd was very strong because you could permanently gain ap at ap the change ver has made passive milder but it is better than the current passive however i think this passive is weak because the other items are recovery inhibition additional damage and mr penetration
oh this will be definitely abused by non mage champs can t wait for some udyr lillia singed bullshit to show up at msi maybe even mordekaiser tbh
there s no tradeoff item seemed good but those buffs are huge
wonder how this will feel for karma it ll make her even harder to catch and it s not like she needs the ap just the ah and ms stats are enough
sounds interesting on kai and varus
ah great so when i buy force of nature to be able to catch up to some mages they just buy this thing now and run away even faster perfect
i love how lethality legendaries have been trash for over a year now to the point where even if you go glass cannon you at most buy and they get no work done whatsoever but cosmic drive now gets changed for the third time because of reasons
katarina maybe uwu
mmmm kayle
isn t this ridiculous on gwen like she can run tp ignite again and is not forced to go ghost anymore feel free to disagree if im wrong
cosmic feels so good on lillia currently it makes her a bit squishy but even at 2nd item i feel it hits hard
won t this be amazing with liandries champs since it just keeps refreshing
gweny likely
teemo item babyy
i very much like this
cassio gonna mow people down now
forcing it to be more niche making it more oppressive for those who can properly use it we should be working to bring out of control movespeed back into line not the opposite there s a reason we see lucian and zeri so much while jinx is too easily shut down cait is rarely attempted and ashe is only picked as a support fix movespeed don t add to the problems
anyone else thinking hecarim will abuse this regardless of it being ap if you worked this into a max movement speed build with duskblade might be disgusting
this change seems kind of bad for seraphine less ap and a slower ramp up
currently on pbe your stacks fall off instantly after it times out considering it takes seconds to stack it would be nice if the stacks quickly fell off one by one so you have a chance to save some
bro please just bring back spellbinder
yeah you never gonna run away from udyr
how many times is this item going to be changed
wait didn t they just change it like a month ago
who builds this
dot mages go zoom
makes sense to remove old passive by the time you activated old passive you already used up a ton of your spells anyway so the old ap increase was meh and didn t benefit as much for many champs who already blew their load not sure about the lenght of the full activation tho it s not like the mages grabbing it are tanks that can just resist and wait the full stack that said the of old active was only up for a short while before decaying to anyway i can see it working as a strong effect anyway since at stacks you will keep the current of the decaying effect and at max stacks you get a stronger effect than live and for longer less frontload more backload gain it s probably gonna be stronger than the description may lead one to believe
where is the bonus ap slightly changed move speed is a bad trade for the ap
item will still be underused because its basically black cleaver but with no passive riot doesn t understand the concept of slot efficiency and opportunity cost anymore it seems and so they ll probably nerf it if people actually use it then it will go unused or they ll buff it until people use it and it will get nerfed then go unused as with every cosmic drive iteration before it
singed loves it
bruhhhh
this sounds amazing on morde
skarner go brrrrrr
so good on gragas
this might shift into third item for gwen or be fringe build options for lillia swain etc not sure anyone else actually gets the needed benefit out of the changes to actually fit it in build order over other items
dot mages are going to go fast ekko chase down power singed temo trololo potential some ap off builds may also benefit with increased mobility
everytime someone mentions udyr or hecarim i get severe ptsd symptoms thinking about the chemtank meta udyr flying at me in his lamborghini
as a player i can t wait to never being able to escape udyr
inb4 secret dark tech prowlers hydra horizon udyr
removed
why seconds though 1st stack at second at third at and 4th at or am i missing something
yeah now that you mention it i do agree that vlad will probably not like it a lot but tbh seems so much that i don t really see many champs use it as effectively as i originally thought probably will be better for longer ranged mages like viktor and ori
something that you might be missing is that its just ramping automatically not individual spell hits that you need to stack each one dealing damage generates a stack every seconds not generates one stack 5s cooldown or the guy that usually does passivs text is on vacation and this is from an intern there is chance this text indicates individual hits
i mean the total amount of movement speed the item grants is that s by and far the strongest consistent movement speed item in the game alongside ap and ah this item is a powerhouse
nothing a little ingenius hunter can t smooth over edit apparently it is champion damage not quite as nice but still an auto here a burn there you have to pre game a bit looks promising for dot mages
probably since they want to move it to ap bruisers and not give vlad ryze which can already go ghost phase rush even more movement speed
i ve been getting it as a boots replacement on many mages as 6th item honestly even though it will take a while to get full stacks it will be even better compensation for boots
its not that much worse for vlad who often wouldn t have it stacked up when he went to blow his load its better than the old total ap one which he bought with protobelt still and without having to stack it being worse for seraphine is a good thing tbh she s one of the few champs that wants it that doesn t really pay any tangible opportunity cost for it she s the exact reason the passive it should scale with the inverse distance squared x to the target rather than taking time to stack once its passive is actually worth something i mean
all of those are disgusting bullshit right now so that s good
idk why you mentioning seraphine sera doesn t build it she has more important items to build
not really sure why singed would want this amount of ah when his main spell is a toggle
i willfully remove that champ from my brain because i hate him with all my heart but yeah it does seem really good i don t know if he d prefer this over a demonic or rylai s tho so maybe as a 3rd item
the fact that ah isn t the best on singed and there is no hp means it will probably just be a for fun item
as a certified fawn i think demonic rylais will still be better than cosmic for wiwwia it could be a good slot item on her but i would rather have void deathcap in lategame
probably gonna be decent on gragas as well but he just doesnt have the item slots for it anymore
lillia with her current ms buffs basically only gets a boost or less from cosmic she d probably rather have other items if she wasn t already building it before if her q ms ever gets nerfed however starts to become much more significant
just saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efneoptc3fe), it seems like most poison dot s won t work to stack it
the lower ap ratio and removal of hp made it less interesting for ap melees and the new passive made it less interesting for ranged mages who will build this
its still decent because the ah is important the only other option is tear for that slot sucks losing 30ap tho
yeah maybe if it had health
this is the thing riot doesn t realize almost no mage will build this item because they re a crutched on a flat pen vs mr arms race b require some core items first c what mages who want this aren t getting deathcap void staff or shadowflame item or if they don t already have them riot doesn t understand slot efficiency or opportunity cost anymore they fucked up the item system and have no clue how to fix it
i was thinking about this one possibly replacing demonic embrace as a 3rd 4th item option cause for sure you can t remove rylai s and zhonya s spot from his build
sounds really good on lillia maybe her passive can proc the movespeed stacks without her being close at all as it says only dealing damage i can already see it you hit e on the enemy while being stacked up from minions monster and you can already start running like a mad deerwoman at them
honestly this might just be a great item for all dot champions makes sense if you can proc it a few times off a dot walk away from a fight and hover safely until you can apply another
this seems like it s only meant for lillia like this version is straight up worse for seraphine and ahri
i am totally biased because this is a nerf to the way i build my sylas but i have to say that i completely agree especially when there are some other mage items i d rather see getting changed
you d think with bc hydra serylda shojin giving 40ah and even dd they might throw the ap class a scrap bone because as it stands only cosmic drive gives more than 15ah yes literally this is the max ah a mage can get from a non mythic
seriously i play lux i have horizon focus for ah and that s it she can t build cosmic drive and i would really like a 30ah item lux can use
i can see him liking the ms definitely should allow him to play on the edge of fights more safely throwing out shields and q s
we won t most mages are too crutched on flat pen or rylai s to care about this item and after that they start needing items like void staff zhonya s etc riot fails to understand the simple concept of slot efficiency and opportunity cost yet again
cleaver is hydra chempunk and axiom arc sits at rest are or less haste but mages are balanced differently than bruisers burst mages artillery mages dps control mages battlemages and ap bruisers must be different if you buff cdr on mage items you end up with burst mages being able to kill in rotation while being able to also get another rotation off which is not good mage items maybe even mages themselves need to get overhauled because its fundamentally flawed when every mythic can work for every mage the only bandaid fix is have two clear distinct builds with one filled with cdr so you get more rotations off and another that is just straight rotation burst but it goes against the build diversity thing
ahri doesn t like the lower damage plus mandatory stack time
item procs typically don t proc other things because they re of the default damage type x200b on top of that most liandry s users want rylai s shadowflame void etc way before they d ever want cosmic
it doesnt
dot doesn t count and viktor has an easier time activating current cosmic drive and utilizing the movespeed than he would slowly building up this one
no hp resists so probably not
ap champs building ap items crazy
the day r doubleliftstrophycase finally got a post lol
clg vs tsm summer and that fnc vs og series before it both at around million peak viewers was basically the peak of lcs for me ever since then lcs has just been slowly dying never got that hype and interest back and now clg who was a part of making that happen is gone and tsm may be following suit rip
savage memes cant melt playoff dreams
was peak esports in na that meta was incredibly fun to watch the game is so much more formulaic now was the most watchable league when it comes to just gameplay variety now you just see the same jungle pressure and playing around objectives every game remember when you could skill check in lane and make big plays without stopwatch or insane healing ruining everything
i was fortunate enough to get row seats at this event and made a sign for the savage memes can t melt playoff dreams and even made an ama kinda cringe looking back but no regrets the amount of happiness when clg won all those years falling to tsm in their peak baylife roster that meme was ours to share
the worst part about this whole nrg thing is that i still haven t seen a single comment from any nrg fan even though they are supposed to have this huge fan base not a single one i play lol and am a nrg fan excited for them to have an lcs team or whatever you d think with this fanbase of supposed millions of people someone would be saying something
clg also got to msi finals the following year i think if na had invested more into developing talents instead of mass importing the league would be a lot stronger then it ended up being
as it should be that was the biggest holy shit series in the na lcs until that point and it has a great argument for still holding that spot today nobody and i mean nobody would have predicted clg to come in and just sweep house to finally break the curse fill the first spot in doublelift s trophy case and get sweet revenge on tsm after a couple years on the losing side of the rivalry especially when tsm were heavily favored to win their 3rd or was it 4th by that point i can t even remember title
was also the perma waveclear meta and juggernauts iirc it definitely had its ups and downs
i actually remember lane swaps every game with handshake farming mid
not cringe at all brother thank you for your legendary sign
is this you https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3i506g/_/cudcwad/?context=1
clg s legacy and history means a lot to me i was watching clg vs tsm live and upvoted the thread we are talking about i do not care about nrg but this is such an ignorant take if nrg is popular in the lcs they get there by either acquiring fans from lcs watchers or and getting their existing fans excited for lcs not from people that happens to be already watching lcs and a big fan of nrg and like the other person said maybe they do have a big fan base but they just aren t active on r leagueoflegends you re in a bubble this subreddit isn t even a good indication of org popularity of the lcs why would it be a good indication of org popularity outside of lolesports
theyre mostly a youtube crowd which is surprisingly very separate from reddit users a lot of sub communities here and on youtube have entirely different and usually clashing opinions on things
fwiw clg has always been my team but i watch a lot of apex too and nrg is my favorite team there i would never choose to trade clg for nrg in the lcs but if i have to lose clg nrg is one of the best successors to it i guess i have to say that i thought nrg was going to die once they left the lcs before but they ve somehow managed to keep themselves as a tier one or despite that and shown good growth in the industry compared to a lot of other esports brands so i m a die hard clg fan but i ll still be rooting for this roster and likely for nrg as an org
says more about r leagueoflegends than nrg this platform might as well be dead for esports discussion doesn t even aggregate content well
i think that was there wasn t perma waveclear unless it was a sivir even then people didnt have sustain and it was much easier to poke and force people back
that happened a lot more in a lot more after they increased the hell out of turret gold it happened in late but it wasn t that often and i don t remember it in at all mid lane meta was a lot of assassin play and a lot of solo kills i think your remembering when it was a lot of farming mages and mid laners like corki and azir
it is honestly pretty interesting reading the youtube comments the reddit comments and the twitter comments on some news or change they can be drastically different
ziggs and anivia were meta iirc as was cass
yeah i think that was it the nightmare azir vs corki every single game lol
it s kinda wild i swear both communities would slash each others tires and pour sugar into each others gas tanks and act like it s a totally passive response to being pissed off
i honestly believe if faker left to lpl during the korean exodus the korean lol scene wouldn t be what it is now the average salary of players in lck would be a way less so yea without even his gameplay just by being loyal to skt and lck he raised the overall quality and impact of lck and made the pro players life of lck to what it is now remember how lck players used to have a single room to stay without any ac or anything etc etc
til faker is years old
your website is basically ads on mobile couldn t even read more than lines of text with this disaster
a lot of general takes and not much in terms of interviews can be done way deeper but i guess they don t wanna put an effort
for all i know this dude can t tilt and will keep pushing thru mental is thru the roof
i miss doa
faker the chad https://i.redd.it/btxrbrucnsaa1.jpg)
arguably it would have died because a lot more talent would go to the lpl granted its not like faker doesnt get an absurd salary too but he could get an even more insane salary in china
impact mentions this but faker also defeated the stereotype of younger better imo we ve seen younger players fade into obscurity and lose their edge but faker remains consistent as ever no matter the meta he hasn t been the best mid mechanically for a while imo but the man will probably outlast most players in terms of consistency and adaptability motivation is the main driver that makes players better and keeps them on edge it ll be a sad day when he retires from lol
what a prodigy
use mozilla firefox en mobile ublock origin extension
true
iirc joe marsh said in a podcast or something that faker gets super insane offer every off season from china
agree
he hasn t been the best mid mechanically for a while imo but the man will probably outlast most players in terms of consistency and adaptability no he s literally the best mechanically too i swear i ve heard this same drivel for years at this point if he plays for laning phase then he s never failed to go even of ahead of players like chovy
he won worlds when he was just months old that s insane
fair enough but i doubt that was the point of the comment
fyi for people using ios you can get adblock as a safari extension
correct me if i m wrong but didn t a rumour float around last year that some chinese team offered him like a million signing bonus
there were points in time that he was not the best mechanically but nearly the best for example the ig era was definitely rookie s year and even the one following he and doinb were apparently better while you can count on faker to setup iq engages or escapes by mechanical prowess alone he does have competition throughout his career last year zeka had similar stats to faker and outshone him in the finals also had bdd going supersaiyan on geng ripping through a deep worlds run to 4th place faker is the best overall but throughout his 10year career he has definitely not been the best for all
he won his first worlds when he was just months old that s insane fixed then more
yes there is doa also spoke about how lpl teams were grabbing up high tier talent at the time and impact spoke about how the lpl was an option for him before he went to team impulse i m not sure exactly how accurate mil is but that would track
i mean usd or korean won there is a huge difference in value xd
reddit moment
my man said last year i doubt when the korean exodus happened there were any contracts above mil an insane contract at that time would have been a few hundred thousand
oh yeah for sure the amount has definitely gone up but the idea that china wants to pay big for kr talent hasn t the thing that sucks is that often comes at the expense of other players who don t command big paychecks minimum wage in the lpl is 20k yuan around 3k usd per month according to xiaopeng former top esports sub and some players at the bottom really struggle it s tough out there and that doesn t include the ldl either which is around 6k yuan that s tough i have immense respect for any lpl pro who manages to make a name for themselves and stand out from the crowd
average office job in china pays like 4k yuan per month lol chill
thing that sucks about esports is that it s kind of a hard sell on a resume to find the next job if things don t work out that and having a teammate make like 20x what you do has to be tough on your mental i d be pissed
if that teammate is better than me then i wouldn t be pissed i would strive to be as good as him i don t think any aspiring pros would have your mentality

nice win for edg omg made it close but ale had a really good series
blg vs omg is gonna be hype
game was some absurd macro diff holy hell
bruh why did able fight for that red that play changed the entire game
zeri lulu is war crimes
thankfully fofo woke up game especially since game was the only game where ale actually fell off hard in the early game plz don t put fofo on annie again
lpl looked like superteams forming all over the place and meanwhile edg replaces scout and viper who had great individual seasons this year with fofo and leave to cruise straight into the semi s no sweat
that mid jayce did wonders for edg there also able played pretty cocky there and got punished but the same goes for leave lol shanji did try his best lol
meiko will not be denied another chance for an msi title
put dom on suicide watch
meiko s shotcalling is so fucking good edg played those last fights so masterfully
edg not frauds i repeat edg are not fraudsss
cho cho cho the train has not derailed pay attention the train has not derailed the almighty ppgod just wants to play more games before he reaches and wins finals msi and worlds
hate it when the underdog run falls short there goes the dream of blg vs omg finals oh well hopefully one of them gets to msi at least
unable to flash
who tf got excited
ppgod should have blocked that sion ult for able at least that way they got a chance him running away with able just kills them both
jiejie hit every cocoon past minutes in game
oh able really unfortunate timing to make a bad call like that at least it wasn t the entire reason they lost honestly tho any of the top seem like they can beat the rest on their day which is pretty exciting just don t put shanji on sion pls
ale showing shanji how to play sion yep
fofo off annie finally impacted the game omg without xayah also look much worse
was a bit worried coming into the series and omg didn t disappoint but looks like their momentum fizzled out after game2 that was a good series fun to watch
horrific g3 draft from omg b1 vi is so bad when stuff like veigar and xayah are both up and available able throwing g4 didn t really help matters either omg are at their best when shanji gets to do his thing and they didn t really do that this series and got punished for it
that guy with his butt is probably feeling really nice right now
leave gapping the life out of able really good series from ale as well
giving priority to sion against shitters like wayward or zika works fine but do that against an elite top laner also able pp are fine in teamfight but they got spanked in lane omg pretty quick go and get some fund to pay shanji and creme
fofo shotblasts ripped through omg game damn
i really want to see leave at msi but rest of edg did great job peeling for him especially in the match where jiejie and ale blocked omg s cc for him
ale playing thomas the tank engine
the levels of bot gap this series was incomprehensible able and ppgod need to be apologizing to their teammates
bot diff
sad that we ll be seeing blg or omg out soon would have loved to have them both on msi
ale is the omg kryptonite shanji gets banned out but also can t outlane their best player was made irrelevant almost the entire series
jesus as a mostly lec watcher the difference between shanji s k sante and then everyone else s is just insane nice series to watch though now i know to expect in london
top gap ale won lane in first three matches and had killer sion ults in the last one jiejie damn that s a sick elise game first three were eh but lost a lot of smite contests even if they had two smites mid fofo was pretty bad on annie ok ish on veigar and godly on jayce redemption arc bot leave giveth and leave taketh support leona and fiora had negative synergy that was a bad pick the rest of the games were fine great shotcalls and macros omg better in teamfights but edg macroed thanks meiko
seems likely that edg will beat jdg kinda crazy if blg or omg kicks them out considering how close the last series before this was
please don t put shanji on tanks
edg after game one live was fun lol this series wasn t honestly as close as it seems ya omg botlane threw game but there shouldn t of even been if it wasn t for a single bad macro play game at baron
lettt gooooo edg is not fraud i know it if only lng made it sadge
part of it is omg s draft but jesus christ leave s aphelios in game channeled viper energy
no doubt leave is the best ad in lpl rn also fofo kinda underrated he plays pretty good and does what his team needs him to
what a top gap this series damn ale wp to that sion sure he had a few deffs in lane but he was a monsta in teamfights
bad series overall for aki
aki is what kanavi would be without great talent around him bro farming up a storm and end the game on 8k damage
how the hell you can keep your flash as adc with half hp when sion is ulting on you
oh able really unfortunate timing to make a bad call like that at least it wasn t the entire reason they lost honestly tho any of the top seem like they can beat the rest on their day which is pretty exciting just don t put shanji on sion pls
can able use his flash twice in the next game is that why he didn t press it
really thought omg had game even after all the losses i still thought they had it until the eldar fight edg just better at macro and teamfight better team won
i can be convinced able is matchfixing
at this point i don t care which one goes to worlds as long as its not jdg i just want to see some epic top gap at msi
deleted
these lpl teams are so sloppy they really have to do better and stop making it so easy for lck to dominate those international competitions insane how every other region is steadily improving but lpl is the only region that s been getting from bad to worse with each passing year considering how huge league is in china they re surprisingly bad at the game
deleted
if ale plays jax instead of ego fiora game this is an easy
dom s enthusiasm for this team was so infectious now i m sad
having a shot caller like meiko is exactly what ale needed he still has some int moments but he s been playing fights and objectives so well this split
really sad he isn t on lng still but glad he s doing well
i wished it wouldve been the finals oh well
meiko reinforcing his claim to goat support
yeah that was harsh macro diff
smartest team in the world
able and ppgod threw game so hard
the sides of able
bot lane brains when they have a chance of losing the red buff over losing the entire game
probably didn t think about the chemtech blastcone being bigger that always tends to fuck people up
dying with flash up with a sion charging at him
meiko being the most annoying lulu ever early game sheesh
dude zeri ult activation has less ad scaling now and she lost like hp lvl she s weak and won t be picked every game from now for sure
only good annie in playoffs so far was knight wonder why the teams put so much prio on it has to be a scrim thing
ale still smurfed the teamfights though overall just a huge everything gap with only creme being a standout for omg
seasons in we still haven t figured out that league is 5v5 and individual strength doesn t matter as much as team synergy this is why fpx won despite not having the best players in any role or why superteams keep failing on repeat
i don t think any other than jdg could have been called superteams when all of them had major weak links or what should have been major weak links going into the split hell even jdg ended up basically having two weak links
lpl looked like superteams forming all over the place more like washed up players forming new teams lot of big names but not in their prime
i wonder if in the case of edg its just that their coaching staff is really good and are able to get everyone on the same page or that stylistically fofo and leave are better for edg than scout and viper
winners finals not semis
as an edg fan im glad vipers team boomed bye bye snake
meiko vs keria coming
i am so sad now either blg or omg gotta go really was hoping blg at least would make it to the next round so we don t need to see them play against each other so early both of them are so much more fun to watch than the other two
sorry i doubted you edg x200b you are legit
based really hope they make it to msi they are fun to watch
its his time chamber
world skin gold color with god theme
i got excited for edg
i needed something to hold on to after clg so my bad
me sorry my bad x200b i was not aware it wasn t allowed
i can t get excited from vi first pick to let enemy pick xaya veigar after
he a world champ jg and diffed canyon at his peak jiejie is a god
nothing about that series said omg is on the same level as edg but pop off
sanji caught bans i couldn t believe it
i mean shanji s not lane tanked every sion ult able had flash at the end and there s no reason to put shanji on sion
huh ale s sion fucking sucked shanji is weakside king drawing mf five top lane bans from edg
okay edg threw in draft game as well
ye bro d
shanji gapped the fuck out of ale in lane game but yea was much better rest of game
wayward gapped shanji on every one of his sion games it s the nature os sion with no draft prio
it s not that they give priority to sion it s that edg was banning from to shanji champions every game
at this point it look like they really need to drop sion it only ever work when they play with newer top but against veteran he just cant get advantage there is no way he could keep playing sion if he want to win internationally
he is maybe best ksante out there but they needed to ban of his champions lol
meiko shotcalls is crazy it doesn t matter if they change roster as long meiko stay he would shape the team into a winning team
the client would implode on itself and create the second big bang nevertheless good idea
i d love a little poro zen garden to tend to while in queue
chogath eating poros minigame
this will def open up some avenues for them i love the idea
chao garden from sonic adventure
personally i just browse on my second monitor and catch up on things like email messages
this unironically sounds like an excellent feature to include in a league should riot decide to make one
a poro garden idle game would have me feral
i believe every game in existence needs a chao garden hub in order to be perfect so i would support this
chao garden hideout
i recently thought of a similar thing but with the jungle pets which you could retain between games so if you keep choosing the green one it would be your green one which you can name pet level up in between in lobby by playing more jungle games with it of course it doesn t affect anything in game i prefer your idea though it feels more league appropriate
this is a wonderful idea i d love to see it added to the game
bro bra you just created an entire game riot is gonna make now
give now if the client didn t self destruct just by think about i d love something like that
i actually would love to have little games like a bejeweld clone pinball or something like that with the mini champs or other little games to play with my friends
cool novelty that will be interesting times and then whenever i happen to be a voice call with premades otherwise forgotten instantly can t imagine it s a good use of resources
are you years old
would love this maybe they could use the tft maps and maybe the little legends as a base i m not sure how hard it would be to implement but it s a shame that you don t get to see the maps outside of tft and the little legends are more of a nuisance on aram than anything lol a game similar to the jumping dino game when you have no internet but with kled and skarl would be hilarious
can we get account transfers back
it wouldn t work for the same reason urf didn t work it would be too popular to the point where the original game would die out
would probably need a supercomputer to run a game in that client
homie we cant even get the game not to perma crash this patch riot cannot do this even if they want to still a good idea tho
this is a golden goose of an idea i would love to tend to little poros and unlock ones with sunglasses or a top hat
basically just the chao garden from sonic adventure but with poros please
then those poros will chestburst chogath mere seconds later
the dark age of sonic started after adventure and those games didn t have chao garden coincidence not at all
this man here just destroyed your inner child desire with his sigma adult desires chad
if you could visit other peoples farms this would make a shit ton of money through cosmetics no reason to flame
are you ragingly insecure about seeing fluffy animals
ugg app porofessor x200b i get my builds faxed to me straight from the lolalytics api
i keep phreak locked in my basement so that i can always get the best item builds straight from the source
at the very least you should be able to see every champion s full runepage in loading screen they can put mastery eternals and challenges there but won t show us useful information like runes
it is embarrasing that the api exists and 3rd party tools already do this but the game company itself can t or can t be bothered
agreed game information like that shouldn t be left up purely guessing
dota does this stuff so much better than lol and has for years i m surprised lol is still so far behind in dota if you click a champ you see everything they would see in their hud you see full spell and item descriptions and can just read up on what enemies do and how they do it while dead or smth while i don t think cooldowns and spell ranks should necessarily be shown just being able to read spells item and maybe rune descriptions of enemy champs would be such a huge quality of life improvement
can t even check datailed damage taken information until you die which is bullshit imagine having information in a real time strategy game
riot client is crashing just from existing and you want this it will set shitton of pc s on fire
you can play around their runes if you know what they are
but this doesn t make them money why would they bother
we should be able to see how much damage ninja tabi has deduced but they still haven t given us that either
currently when you hold c just to see your own stats it grays out your basic stats while showing the other stat boxes extended stats runes eternals didn t used to do that
how about just being able to read all their skills
i agree for stats i don t really agree for runes
because it s useless rofl you ll already know what the enemy is taking based on your first trade with them
the pressing c has been a thing for a long time i use it every now and then like to see how much lethality mpen i have i don t think we need to see that detailed info from the enemy because you can gauge what they have based on their items and runes
i disagree when i play laning phase i like to click on the enemy so i can keep track of their passives stacks potions etc so if pressing c pulls their detailed runes i wouldn t be able to see mine most of the lane it could just be a different keybind
there should be a way to see opponent runes at least by hovering scoreboard or something
its actually shocking that you still can only see keystone after what years but offscreen pings and useless objective voting sure
there should be a card in loading screen that shows the full runes like how it shows champion mastery summoner level etc
i have the mobalytics app installed and it s been a god send if i maybe want to play top but i have no clue what riven or fiora do
deleted
being able to hover stuff on twitch for dota and see ability details aghs items etc is incredibly useful every time i tab to a league stream and try to hover abilities to get details and stuff i m just so disappointed in how far behind league is
https://clips.twitch.tv/originalflirtybaboonfeelsbadman](https://clips.twitch.tv/originalflirtybaboonfeelsbadman) reminds me of this clip of ee literally opening the practice tool to test an interaction mid match the league client is so fucking inferior to dota s
i m surprised lol is still so far behind i m not
the engine is not designed for you click control some one else this is why some thing like the lost vikings in hots can t be added in lol it was answered in one of thoseboards questions which i m not sure i can find anymore also besides maybe free boots do you need to know any other lesser mastery bone plating and second wind you see them when you first attack the enemy so it s not really necessary
even then it s still full of bugs gotta live true damage from unknown source
maybe it s time to update the system requirements a bit
deleted
third party tools like porofessor already show what runes someone s running
i can t tell what secondary runes someone took however for example i might know the fiora top is running conq but not if they took the tenacity secondary rune or if they took cut down coup or the other one that means she does more dmg when she s low i think that s what the post is alluding to
you could always see keystones since they were added what
deleted
they might have changed it but i thought you could hover over ppls summs to see cds
some companies make games some companies make money
the dmg from champion ability that isn t even in the match and the 1hp from flash
they will lose good amount of players
the client already runs on bit that s what about of people run something riot said themselves seems pretty logical what they re doing instead is just deprecating the bit client basically it will borderline not work in the next couple months in conclusion client will probably still run horribly no matter what
as you said third party
that s exactly the intention of my post
after years the only rune you can see is the keystone despite people asking for all runes choices being visible from day one
not sure why your being an elitist asshole i ve been playing for years but i played top maybe times cause i m not great at it i m following off the previous statement in which the person said third party app such as moba do these things maybe stop being a asshole your playing league not grandmaster chess
valve makes games
when the mobile version has higher minimum specs and looks better it s time to re evaluate a bit
that s why every game in the industry has a low req version and the generic version x200b also this game is probably getting reworked in bugs of were kind of a disgrace in competitive
this is not entirely true the bit client still has the same limitations as the bit one in terms of memory allocation so that they don t need to maintain separate branches riot has openly talked about how this impacts the game not client by limiting how many polygons models can use and how detailed animations are deprecating 32bit opens up a lot of opportunities for 64bit altho it s unlikely it s gonna be in terms of optimization more so in terms of adding things that were previously impossible edit nvm this is just wrong the game client used to be bit for everyone here s a riot comment from today we recently upgraded the game client to be bit in the patch this change was tested for compatibility as well as soaked on pbe but since it was a significant change it can still cause some unexpected problems we are currently investigating new issues that have arisen since the upgrade
so it s okay for a third party tool to give you a distinct advantage in knowledge but bad for that knowledge to be available in game because people could take advantage of it
why do you say it as if it were illegal or not the intended way lol
jungle timers would never have been added to the game if third party tools didn t provide them first doesn t matter if it s third party the information is available anyway just make it easier to access
riot endorses these third party websites btw
only years you are a casual this game has a decade s
this is such a low elo take years should be enough to know the basics if every champion
deleted
half life came out buddy gotta update your memes
unfortunately people actually upgrade their phone every couple of years but still expect to be able to play league on their netbook from
also this game is probably getting reworked in source your ass bugs of were kind of a disgrace in competitive imagine thinking game will not have bugs if reworked tell me you never touched software development if you expect a bug free experience
the fact third party tools are allowed to do it is riot signing that they know we need this feature and they just don t care
its not illegal but it was not intended either
lol yea all my friends i play with played since the beta i played a few games back in but when i played i got super high and forgot which key was r and yea i tilted a few people on a big clutch play
yea i do i m saying sometimes a refresher is needed but apparently that s not allowed
and now your just proving the whole league toxic crap wow a champ that s bearly ever played and last time i played against them was months ago yep totally remember everything they do i know people who played since beta that need a quick refresher on champs and their ability s not that terrible to look something up real quick
and there s a new counter strike on the way
game s having a bug are a thing which you try to fix it sofware developing years of code on code is when you start to have problems if you really think most of the really complex bugs in league are easy fix you really are giving riot code a lot of credit there is a motive why years old bugs resurge out of nowhere it s because not all fixes are permantent they are reliant in the version of the software these are temporary line of codes that did the job at the moment until some line of code is introduced and enters in conflict this temporary fix and the bug resurges this is standard in any instruction doesn t matter if it s a game or not another point when competitive game s have bugs that are not listed which yes there is a list of bugs that pro players are aware and should not abuse nor can report as a bug should they happen guess what they are not a whoopsie moment from riot companies that feel that their teams matches were impacted by the bug are able to ask for indemnity when you build your entire code around temporary fixes you start to create an environment where every patch you can introduce more bugs to it environment and introduce more risk of old bugs appearing again it starts to create a risky environment thats for any instruction that s why even riot is aware that the game is due to a engine update so they can renew their code again it s standard process in any long running software to update is core version not because it s a game but because it s a software that has weekly based patches are very likely to have bugs specially if they are as complex as a game the engine rework is a balance of how much is worth the time and money the moment it starts to impact the integrety of their highest level of competitive play it when it is worth
second part is too true my gf is a product owner at work while i m a dev it s a never ending cycle trying to convince her not to be stressed about the amount of defects in their backlog people really out here thinking computers understand human language and vice versa
same with buff timers dragon timers baron timers pinging summoners pinging our cooldown timers and more then riot added the third party stuff into the game why not the same with runes
it s not intended until it is that s what the post is asking for
just saying but neither riven nor fiora are barely played champs skarner or ivern would be a better example
i agree with most of it problem is not time or money true cost is feature freeze that is required for catch up or else you never catch up and will start with very messed up code if you need to constantly catch up to the live version and feature freeze will probably kill the game because it will require atleast at hte bare minimum to change engines as we can see from wild rift it is years of development and still doesn t have all the champs and has barely of skins it is a very different game i will say but problem is they are already working off kits that exist off models concepts design that already exists and they are still not there another question that riot faces what bug do you keep becasue some bugs have become the core of some champions like riven and cait combos cancels problem is you have to design them not as bugs but as features and that creates issues of what do you redesign and what you cut they are not a whoopsie moment from riot some bugs take months and months to even find a source not even talkign about a fix should htey be higher prio ofcourse the moment it starts to impact the integrety of their highest level of competitive play it when it is worth not really esports is money sink not a profitable endeavor even for riot it bleeds money what they consider and calculate is how many players they will lose due to change and required freeze if you lose of players probably worth if you lose then it starts to become not worth dont forget league runs of bloody potatoes my old ass laptopt that i had could run league at fps at full hd medium in you also have to calculate how many players you lose due to sheer inability to play the game because league is very popular in places with lower incomes if game now requires series gpu you are so fucked even series is pushing it is upgrade really worth it if game dies
pragmatically speaking you already know the majors such as keystone and secondary from loading
ok well it was a name off the top of my head yes rivin is a more or less easy champ fine we can say ivern is a perfect example cause no one plays him
yet you dont know if they have cookies boneplating scaling or laning runes demolition approach velocity hexflash and more game changing runes or stuff you need to know to be able to play around until you see them use it
been a clg fan since the old days kinda liked their showing at s1 worlds though i ll be honest and say i liked epik gamer even more but then doublelift joining clg afterwards helped of course clg eu is what really helped me become a true diehard fan of their brand and i ve been all in ever since the epic rivalry with m5 all throughout season the comical failure at s2 worlds of clg na oh no only blue side strats the next two painful years of lcs with lots of close calls and then the most satisfying win in msg you could imagine with doublelift s trophycase finally being filled instead of being a meme it won t be the same without them in my eyes you need clg tsm dignitas curse tl and c9 the old guard carries so much narrative
so what will happen to gam now currently owned by nrg s asia division does this means nrg is ready to drop them when you think about it that wouldn t really be a good decision gam might be making less money but that also means cheaper to operate and their absolute dominance in the vcs currently undefeated right now means they have a higher chance to qualify for international tournaments and represent the brand
do people outside of league really care about the nrg brand i almost feel like it d be smarter to gradually transition than just drop clg all at once but i get why that s difficult glad to see that the players are sticking together though at least that s what they say right now we ll see still a lot to do from them
why is the nrg sub so dead i ve heard they have a large fan base but do they just not care enough for reddit or something
i hope that over the summer lcs fans can show that clg the clg name still has a lot of value and that nrg will possibly change their mind on rebranding i personally think counter logic energy is a great name and think it would be cool if they took some branding from clg like the black and blue to make a hybrid of the too but clg isn t my main team and based on the reaction from the hardcore fans in the clg sub these ideas may not be that well received
while it sucks to lose such a historic org this is actually a pretty good thing when it comes to the health of the scene no especially in an era where the narrative is the lcs is dying league in na is dying etc etc x200b aren t there a ton of huge content creators attached to nrg
watch as nrg s huge fanbase fails to transfer to league lol 100t was supposed to be a huge brand as well i wonder how much money they are making
fuck these guys and fuck msg killing the oldest league team in existence
i m excited to see nrg take over the spot they seem more enthusiastic than clg ever was
great addition to the league
hey nrg fuck you
idk dig has been dead weight for almost the last decade
its like im seeing the old evil geniuses disband after losing to m5 all over again
in my eyes you need clg tsm dignitas curse tl and c9 no you don t out of all of those the only teams which have any pull whatsoever are tsm and c9 the rest can fuck off whenever and people will shed a few crocodile tears before returning to not giving a singular fuck about them
you overestimate how many people give a shit about clg outside lol and smash the closest thing is clg red valorant but nrg have a vct slot so
they will be forced to use the clg name for one more split i think then likely just unceremoniously drop it for next year
yes check out their twitter yt accounts etc they are a big org who cares about the future of esports
they re big in ow and they have good social nedia presence in valorant also signed the core of the best historical na valo team
i had never heard of nrg so it s weird to hear people say they are very popular i guess that s true based on metrics but clg is certainly the stronger brand in league this feels like if bank of america bought the white sox and renamed them the bank of america sox like sure bank of america is a bigger brand than the white sox but still seems weird clg tsm and dignitas are like the og lol na brands renaming clg feels like messing with history
they have 1m on twitter 7m insta 3m tiktok and 1m across all their youtube channels most popular rl team top apex team which is very popular they own the sf shock most popular team in ow and have the best na team in valorant and their valorant youtube channel does insane views
sf shock is historically one of the best teams in ow but outside of that i don t think so
this is like one of the dumbest comments ever nrg have acquired a huge brand through valorant and other esports ventures overwatch league where they have the most popular and successful team and almost certainly have a much wider reach than clg clg outside of league and some of the fgc are actually irrelevant you are viewing it from the wrong lens no one outside of league cares about clg except us smash fans
based on the average twitter likes nrg is about 60x more popular than clg as a brand
hardly any esports teams have active subs lcs wise go to any sub other than tsm clg c9 it s just dead
younger fan base that is more centralized on twitter because a lot of their fans come from fortnite originally
i think the problem is clg has a small but dedicated fan base as opposed to a larger one so from a numbers side perhaps it doesn t matter i think all clg fans will probably keep their spirit alive honestly i d like to hear clg and tsm chants in the future ahah
i think that s an awful idea and people should accept that clg is a dead brand while nrg is one of the biggest
somehow counter logic energy makes even less sense than gaming tho
i frankly don t want anything to do with nrg it s either clg or nothing i don t want to be cheering for anything nrg
couldn t be worse than clg their league videos get views
yeah fuck nrg for finding an opportunity to grow their brand
how about fuck clg because they let their org fail and need somebody to buy this team and thankfully some of their staff still get paycheck next month
but dig have big personality alumni s3 dig were disgusting they d be mid sweep alright kiwi grab the soraka scarra get the kat qt you re on twi cai blitzcrank welcome to the big dick club god bless you
lol tsm has been nothing but mid since other than lucking into a free championship in summer because the rest of the leauge was dogshit and doublelift came in to save their asses again
lol if you think tl can fuck off
people don t give a shit because clg s been bullish about expanding into any meaningful esports leagues outside of league and smash we were finally expanding our fgc division but of course too little too late we ve been begging for clg to get into or at least try to get into one other major esport but haven t gotten in every single major esport we d ever gotten in we found ourself out of within a year or two sucked
i mean does anyone on league even really care about clg they couldnt even get 1k views on any of their lcs youtube content
no i know clg isn t big outside of league but i m wondering if nrg was ever big anywhere i guess they have had an extremely successful rocket league team for years but i never saw that as a particularly big crossover esport
probably the clutch gaming treatment they will have a tiny little logo for clg on their jersey s but aside from that everything from team colors to branding will be nrg just like when clutch transitioned into dig
i think their branding will meet a lot of friction in the lol community right now though since as an outsider looking in they look like a brand with a lot of vc money and no clue how to spend it like they have a million dollar gaming castle that isn t even sponsored they re definitely bigger than clg though
nrg has a strong valorant team core comprised of best na team in recent years
idk how they are nowadays since i havent watched in a while but they hd some of the most legendary rocket league rosters in its history
one of the dumbest comments ever ok dude lmfao
most just use the league of legends main sub for discussion it s not like t1 doesn t have any fans it s just that most people are used to just posting here
hey tl is pretty active lol don t forget about us
clg chants whenever nrg plays
when you kill clg for it yeah just because you make a decision for business reasons doesn t mean you re not a dick
oh you mean msg the company who bought clg for what riot calls a generational sport squandered their brand for years by mismanagement and then sold the org when they got the chance yeah thought i covered that
mid is 100x better than what clg and dig have been for the last years
they absolutely can tl isn t as weak of a brand as dig or clg but their fanbase is entirely predicated off of winning if they have the results they had this splits for a few more they will be in the exact position clg and dig are in now
people act like they care but in reality no one really does besides nostalgia and will forget about it a month into the new rebrand people pester teams to create more content they create more content and no one bothers watching
nrg is big nearly everywhere
the cg to dig transition was smooth i hope more orgs do the same and maybe take it to another level like clg already progressed to neon colors
nrg did say that they ll be using the same color blue jerseys
i mean as a long time league fan i recognize nrg i just recognize them for there failed league team and poor performance before having to just leave league so nothing very good
i mean i m being downvoted because i m right and i pointed out that r lol lens is just incorrect here you genuinely typed out of ignorance
hell naw
it s more likely to be the opposite of that lmao it s kinda like how almost every fan of the seattle supersonics now has a burning hatred for the oklahoma city thunder because that s the team that used to be the sonics and now at least for the moment seattle just doesn t have a team the sentiment s not that s our new team so much as fuck you give us our team back
nrg didn t kill clg msg killed the org and sold its property to nrg
that is a baby boy worldview i m sorry
when you kill clg for it good riddance
clg has a small er but passionate league fanbase the clg subreddit is always relatively active
i think that s just a problem of not understanding the yt algorithm that s like over half of making youtube content figuring out the thumbnail tags etc to get it to people s recommended page and how to get them to watch the whole thing its so obvious none of the orgs beside maybe tl has someone who understands the algorithm
just count the views on all their videos https://www.youtube.com/@counterlogicgaming/videos it s actually so beyond dead and it s been like that for a few years now
i have followed multiple esports for a little over a decade and while they have had teams and players i have never seen a bona fide nrg fan always felt like a random brand with no identity and a lot of vc money to buy temporary teams in tier games hoping some of them would work out it seems like things are different in the past year or two and they are really pushing now but clg is still a super popular brand in this game and nrg is largely remembered as a meme they could definitely do something like immortals keeping the mibr name maybe they don t want to maybe i m underestimating the excitement for nrg or overestimating lcs fan attachment to clg
c l g fuck n r g chants
i made a decision for business reasons i don t like this decision fking baby boy world view
buddy we re literally talking about cheering for fucking esports teams none of this matters why would the discussion revolve around anything but personal emotion nobody shows up to watch treating ooo im gonna cheer for team like it s some sort of business decision obviously the responses to this are going to be rooted in emotion and that s how it should be for fans
dw nobody asked you kiddo
yep clg base is the old timers wouldn t be surprised if most of us don t even play anymore i always rooted for clg and it is sad to go but also means i ll probably tune in that much less i do think clg fans are the vocal and passionate minority here but i also think clg s departure does reflect where lol is going in na
case in point being ovilee any time she does something for an org it gets amazing results she knows her niche her audience and how to engage them
clg is still a super popular brand in this game hell no they aren t they are a dead brand in this game and were a dead brand for years they get no interactions no youtube views before they had some minor success in their last two splits people actively despised them for being a shit tier bottom feeder org nrg is largely remembered as a meme i m pretty sure you don t actually know who nrg is i also follow multiple esports not including cod or overwatch so those are the only places where nrg might be a weak brand and in every game i have seen them in be it csgo valorant or rocket league they are or were anything but a meme
there were a bunch with the pre overwatch league team that had seagull on it iirc
i think you re right that it s not that many current lcs fans are excited for nrg but you are very vastly overestimating the lcs fan attachment to clg their socials have close to zero interaction and the only hardcore clg fans left are the ones from way back in sure a lot of current lcs fans know about clg s history but that doesn t necessarily mean the current lcs fans are excited about what clg does maybe they are excited for dhokla contractz palafox luger and poome but very few people will care if they continue their journey as nrg players instead of clg players the past few years clg existed only as a team in the lcs and not many people really cared about them which pretty much made what they were doing unsustainable hence this current move sure they are a nostalgic brand but nostalgia doesn t make you money and it sure as heck didn t get them many new fans to help them sustain their team
i don t need the salty clg fans to ask me for my opinion to be able to express it that dead irrelevant incompetently run brand leaving lcs will not have any noticeable impact whatsoever
yep i haven t played league in like years lol my wrists can t take it anymore congrats nrg fans but count me out
i remember when they had broxah and wildturtle they were getting so much hate on every post game thread
that lineup was when clg hit rock bottom in my eyes at least they overpaid for an expensive roster of mediocre to bad players and still managed to have it be less than the sum of it s parts at least in they made it obvious that they were going for a budget developmental roster and they even managed to overperform with it
most likely an erl jungler unless excel is down for something really degenerate like bringing giliius in
i don t see jankos leaving heretics anytime soon wouldn t be surprised if they go cinkrof selfmade route
i don t envy excel s scouters rn the team is so out of sorts that it s hard to think of who would make them work slightly better together and anyone coming in is gonna have to play for a bottom tier team at least they ve got a better window than the winter split where the time off aligns with the world taking a break for msi hopefully they can find something
get noah7 and some other promising rookies maybe keep one veteran to teach them the ropes this year is already f so you should be aiming for next winter split
yohan winter
thank god i have no idea why excel held onto him for two splits i would say invisible was the best way to describe xerxe s jungling and that s not how it works in pro play rarely saw him go for objectives successful ganks anything good riddance
if he has good options in lfl or lvp he will be one of the best jungler in erl
going from markoon to xerxe was such a mistake for excel even now they won t be able to get anyone better than markoon
is vetheo gonna be back for summer or was his mental health leave just an excuse for them to bench him
i am glad that xl tanked after the benched of their best players limit patrik xerxe show nothing this year at least targou and vetheo have hands but patrik is main character in this team so no one can speak about him and his inting
jankos
i have to be honest xerxe limit have mouths but no hands probably not good callers vetheo patrik have hands but no mouths not sure about abbe odo is just odo it s hard to fix without changing the roster they wanted the roster finn yike lider patrik mikyx before winter unfortunately it didn t happen
just tryout agurin excel common give this guy a chance
odo abbe limit and gilius just need neon and schalke reformed
xl peach yohan pleaseeee
nothing degenerate about that gillius has shown tome and again that he can help teams to improve
wheres my boi zanzarah at d
i m dying to know what s going to happen with th i ve been checking the twitters and whatnot but most of them are radio silence only real info is that evi is going back to japan because th have so much time off now after being done with the split but not sure if this is a sign of something more permanent or just a visit i tune into jankos s stream when i can but i doubt he s said much on there honestly either way i feel reasonably confident saying that th will probably be attempting to build around what jankos wants and given that xl is a sidegrade at best unless they offer bank i could see him on th for another split if they make roster changes
yeah jankos isnt the problem on that roster and the only way for jankos to be replaced is if he himself wants out
why not we got the info that the buyout is low and i can t imagine that jankos enjoys the situation
isn t selfmade making big dick money on vit bench unless g2 ask him to join i don t see him ever leaving vit
why i can see jankos trying to leave heretics asap lol
on paper jankos is the perfect fit experienced shotcaller good mechanically aswell and needs to leave his current team asap but patrik is failing too hard and picking up limit was not smart
jungle pool is pretty strong at least and one change can go a long way in fixing a team
just ff the next split and save money for next year if they don t win summer i don t think they have enough points to go to final split anyway
yeah get some rookies so they can play games and get booted cause no b03s
did they bench vetheo or did he step out iirc he had a tweet about being mental boomed or something
team has no future with patrik and limit i mean patrik was pretty much never a win condition and almost always dying 2v2 in the lane vetheo was the only win condition they had and they benched him what a shame
pretty sure agurin doesn t want to go pro again
the saltiest of runbacks
hell i d be a fan
but they went in the first round and new format doesn t have a second round xl is playing a dangerous game here
they aint getting dylan
araneae and other th manager said in esportmaniacos that there will be roster changes this split
hopefully heretics will be able to get wunder
players going home is not a sign of anything they have massive break till summer jankos is in poland right now
evi was interested to bring his family to eu idk if that happened tho but if they did it he might be going back
there are rumors of a low buy out in jankos contract xl and th are both bottom of the table teams but for xl their worst performing role is jungle while it on th is the jungler that s the best performing role it is by no means a sidegrade you got odo that although haven t had a fantastic year undoubtedly was the best toplaner of last year and got a crazy amount of longevity it got abbe vto with vto being mental boom so far this year i don t know if jankos would be the one solving that issue
wunder is available and they have of course played together on g2 there are plenty of good mid laners to pick from if vetheo isn t going back to xl then he would be a great pick up jankos is someone who can get him ahead and wunder is someone who can play with less resources if needed i think th s bot lane is promising enough moreso jack specifically so they could keep developing them
idk i think jankos joining xl should flip everything on its head tbh when they first announced that squad my biggest was xerxe the players are definitely capable of being good if they have someone to guide their macro n shit
i don t see selfmade on g2 ever at least while caps is at the helm they are a team that heavily believes in team atmosphere and synergy and selfmade is not on the g2 mental wavelength they took a chance on rekkles and we all saw how that went
yeah but that s because jankos is a great player he d be a perfect fit on many teams everything just seems completely wrong with that excel team over the two semi splits we saw them play
honestly good point both xl and th would need an absolute monster run in summer to qualify would be tragic if a team finishes second in summer but doesn t make it to the championship xl would be at points and you can easily have teams with more points than that that didn t win a split however i think most situations require them to be quite unlucky for example g2 is already qualified if g2 wins another split they are opening another slot through which xl could qualify or even if they don t win another split g2 could help by getting second in spring and 3rd in summer effectively removing points that xl s competitors wanted to get likewise a team like mad i know they are not looking great atm but who knows what happens in bo3 and the same is also true for a team that does great in spring looking towards summer might not win a split but they already have points if they get another second place and then a third place they would reach points which is comically higher than xl but actually good for them because they don t care about most championshippoints they just want to be in the top looking at past years for some examples in we had the same teams in top in both splits so the next highest points misfits would have points in the current system so they would need at least 6th to be above the potential xl miracle run and then xl should still qualify as the fifth team or the sixth team if the winner of the third split is another miracle run mad won both splits which is immediately great rogue is coming in with points already fnc got g2 got but schalke sk vit msf all only got decent points in one split so it would be hard for any of them to reach points so again even with a miracle winner xl should be 6th at least is more of the same g2 won two splits fnc got second twice so they are over xl already mad rogue is on probably made it as well so two spots are left but origen sk and schalke all only had one good split so even if one does the miracle run xl should qualify atm it is easy to make it look doom and gloom for xl since everything could happen in spring but as long as the points aren t spread out very evenly they should have chances alive of course that is ignoring the possibility they get 3rd or fourth and that isn t enough to qualify which is both more reasonable to achieve for them and still unfortunate because that would be a team i wanted to have a shot at worlds tl dr yeah they could get screwed over by the system but i think a good summer is going to be enough to qualify you most of the time
his tweet was about depression i don t think these terms have the same meaning also he explicitly said that he wanted to play whole split and it s not his decision
iirc he got benched but also was mental boomed so maybe he also thought it was for the best idk
count me in
are you sure you want to proceed to inject miracle yes no
saltiest would be dreams over limit but i get the idea
the new format have rounds so far the first rounds didn t go so well
new top mid support could do with an upgrade but it wasn t exactly the main issue could go for double lck challenger imports or erl
i don t think wunder is enough to get them to top he kinda got carried by razork and upset except for like gragas games and he probably costs way more than evi did a budget roster isn t going to drop like 400k yr on a facilitator player when he s still going to be stuck with ruby jackspectra and mersa
well that s true and he is objectively better than other players like sheo and but that doesn t mean he is a perfect fit for bds and astralis i am saying this because jankos can t be happy with his current team and both odo and abbe didn t play poorly or uncoordinated in those games that they had together jungle was really the key thing missing in excel and even tho the botlane would still be dysfunctional it is a perfect upgrade
it really depends on how the other teams place th still has more points than them and if they even end up place higher than them then they are fucked but i don t see teams like bds astralis fnc etc being much worse than them in summer even if they don t make any changes and xl doesn t really have money to sign big names anyway might as well roll the cheap dice on some erl player which xl management will replace in offseason anyway
not his decision to not play so he got benched
then you have to bring forg1ven
bot duo is kinda pointless to replace they are bottom half lec tier but they are passable when the team loses it is rarely really their fault double import for top mid would probably be fine but it might be bit hard to do it mid season
tbh as the spaniard that i am i want flakked
wunder alone is not but top mid upgrades would make them a whole lot better than what they are now solo lanes are too important nowadays and wunder is too good to not be in the lec
listen totally normal budget roster for heretics get noah adc doinb for midlane wunder toplane and zoelys support this team could place top in summer
carried by razork and upset lmafo wunder and upset were carries in that dead ass fnatic razork did wunder dirty many times by inting his ass off to enemy toplaner
playing weakside perma getting carried
yeah i agree it is all a giant hypothetical because i don t see xl getting close to 2nd
who quits after weeks
they re not bottom half lol they re either the worst or 2nd worst bot duo in the league
they are passable when the team loses it is rarely really their fault this is kinda true for all of heretics but jankos nobody is gigabad but they re all mediocre if i were there management i d have no idea what to do since no improvement can just make this team good at best you can put in complete rookies and hope to roll high or keep the roster and hope they can at least be mid which seems to be what they re doing
not really i d change both but jack probably still deserves a chance with better support
yeah he d still be probably a top half toplaner but like mersa and ruby are the worst players in the league and by a lot imo if i were wunder i d rather vibe for months than join a team that isn t making worlds and probably isn t a great team environment
he was literally a role player in that roster lmao just pick gragas and let upset do the carrying
wunder was literally griefing half of the games last summer lol upset zeri and razork poppy are the reason that team made worlds
perfect to get them into groups
it is easier to look awful if the rest of the team also sucks ex jankos so i give them some benefit of doubt
depends if you look at overall performance or spring only sk botlane have been playing like shit lately especially doss honestly mad and koi botlanes have been super disappointing in spring as well
right now they should be looking for solutions rather than to get rid of problems like when xl got mikyx its difficult to do mid split but perhaps something like wunder top could be a starting point
nobody is gigabad evi on sion was probably worse than even week of orskarinin
evi is the worst professional top laner i have ever seen
if i were wunder i d rather vibe for months than join a team that isn t making worlds and probably isn t a great team environment depends on how much he earns on bench and also months he won t play pro until winter split that s a very long time and considering his performance before denying tryouts benching himself he might struggle to join any top team
mersa is not even the worst in his role limit
how wunder would be a top half toplaner if he was not that level for the last splits
i mean ruby isn t good but at least he s somewhat invisible and not hard griefing the things evi did on sion and tryndamere honestly deserve a ban from competitive i don t know how you can perform when you re on the same team with someone who does things like that anxiety must be through the roof knowing your toplaner can just yolo it every second
wunder wasn t griefing but he also wasn t carrying he legit just played weakside and that was it didn t really affect the games much he was just kind of there his name gets him so much praise and sometimes rightly so but on fnc he was legitimately bang average
im sure u meant getting griefed by razork and it s correct
it s not mid split tho it s mid season since they re already out they got like months to make their decision
do heretics have the money to buy him out though
no offense but i don t understand how you can arrive at this conclusion ruby was making game losing misplays almost every game not in the same way as evi running in on trynd or playing inting sion on stage ruby s misplays were probably a lot less obvious to lower skilled players because they usually stemmed from him missing an opportunity rather than going too far i don t really feel like pulling up th vods for obvious reasons shit team but there are a couple plays that still stand out in my mind the first is when evi attempts to engage as gragas while jack skates over the wall as zeri i think this may have been the bds game and ruby is on cass they re by herald pit while bds is at river brush mersa is standing around being useless and ruby is watching the fight if he r flashes it s probably a or for fight there is literally no way th could fuck it up if ruby went with the call and i m going to be honest this is the type of opportunity that doesn t even need a call if you re a pro player and you don t see the angle immediately like jankos jack and evi did you are not good enough for a major region another example is the evi inting sion game with ruby on azir he is literally always doing the wrong thing they re supposed to be doing little front to back skirmishes before objective setup because th absolutely outrange instead he s just wasting soldiers on getting or hits on the jax in teamfights he s almost always misplaying shuffle on the game losing one around the dragon he holds ult shuffle until the fight is already completely over when all he had to do was stand near his adc and press r just put out consistent damage and go for the peel imo ruby has mediocre mechanics by lec standards but beyond awful game sense he has no idea what the advantages and disadvantages of any given game state are he looks good on only one champion even in his other good ahri game he was doing far less damage in teamfights than evi on gwen or jankos on vi
if i have this gun i better know how to aim might be on of my favorite support quotes of all time
advienne seems like such a good addition to fnatic exactly what they needed imo
damn rekkles was month without scrims no wonder he s looked rusty that plus his fever sounds like a really rought deal but really good to hear how rekkles and advienne feel that theyre clicking and actually have an idea of how to play together definitely didnt feel like that with rhuckz
great to hear the level getting hooked wasn t mispositioning but intentional just didn t work out
not sure if the caitlux lvl hook was a real 5head strat or like drakos said the greatest cope of all time but i respect it nonetheless this was my favorite episode so far this year the botlane synergy is real
you can tell how good their relationship is between the two i hope it amounts to greatness
really wanted to see rekkles with caedrel kinda sad
euphoria curse will strike fnatic again
no caedrel oof
that whole analogy was gold
yeah seems like the kind of lane leader rekkles needs
funny how all i was seeing during the week was how advienne is trash because he abandoned rekkles after lv
i bet that people are gonna on that opinion after the season advienne is really mediocre so far
damn rekkles was month without scrims no wonder he s looked rusty yeah i ve been pretty critical of him but this really explains a lot would have probably been a smart move if he went to korea in offseason
even in the first disaster weeks the team looked worlds better than last split
so advienne talked about this lia cause i initially also didnt understand why he just gets hooked lvl and dies what he advienne saw lvl was that jinx had fleet instead of tempo so on lvl blitzcrank only has hook and jinx has fleet auto attacks vs double ranged cait with tempo and lux aas advienne also had guardian so he was gambling on surviving that initial burst from my observation that plan got fked since lux missed the e initially which led to blitz walking up and going for the hook so maybe fnc miscalculated some damage otherwise yeah cait lux should always win that lane at lvl etc
it s a good strat i ve seen mikyx pull it off before as well they just played it badly
it really gives an insight of what happened because everybody was like eyh how can you get hooked but rekkles himself confirms it was an all part of the plan thing
i saw mickyx take a hook exactly like this in champions queue and got a double kill
how so
use me
beside lane leading he seems like very competent on the psychological side of things which is imho really important if you play with rekkles
well that wasn t such a good idea don t you think
i remember many moments where rekkles was left alone i remember them because the casters were calling it out during the game
his first weekend was indeed bad x200b he played hob ashe and then didn t play out the lvl for some reason surely he also had a thought about this but i did not understand this at all as a viewer
hope they don t get bodied in groups
wracaj do postowania niemiesznych memw na twitterze
guardian janna use to do pretty much the same thing enemy botlane would think she is an easy kill and try to burst her meanwhile she would survive and her adc would get at least kill
rekkles could have killed jinx in that fight 1v1 trade would be good for cait lux but rekkles walked back slightly during the fight which caused him to lose grip on jinx running away
content homie
he said that he was in college before becoming a pro so he s definitely more mature than your regular pro who has played all their life since being a teen
apparently they re really good on scrims and players from other teams see them as top fueling my hopium immensely
they ve performed very well the past two weeks and that was while recovering from illness and still gelling as a new team with a new coach not to huff the hopium too much as a fan but i think they can legitimately win the split if they have a good understanding of the meta and humanoid is on his game
nah i believe broo
they re not wbg don t worry
nie znam ci typie i tym bardziej nie postuj adnych memw na twitterze
hah i m in college and i am definitely not mature xd
even if they might be in fact a top team i doubt they are seen as a top team by the others given that astralis chose them rather than mad and bds would have chosen them too they said so before seeing the groups
still more mature than high school dropouts or graduates i suppose
it depends on how much time he spent on college really obviously someone that it s just starting is still gonna be inmature but if he spent a couple of years then you definitely grow a lil bit and learn a lot more social skills than your regular gamer
yeah i do know this one graduate who isn t doing post secondary school and i legit feel as though i m speaking to a hs freshman at times that said that isn t always the case
yeah i m and a half years deep i definitely am a lot better socially but in terms of life skills i am still pretty much a teenager lol
doesnt have to be like that a lot of people are just there for the hard skills
that said that isn t always the case of course but on average it is age and experience correlates to maturity
i blame op for placing the quote title so far out of context that it takes on a new meaning dude literally said we trash them in scrims but we still lose onstage who knows
scrim results shows a win rate no matter whether we are facing a strong or a weak team starting from tomorrow i believe we won t lose one single game
this entire split we ve been told flyquest are awful based on scrims but here they are in the top maybe scrim results aren t the best metric for evaluating this team
thanks for watching guys if you like it please subscribe to the channel and let me know what parts you like and don t like
removed
riot should start a subscription service where you can subscribe to watch scrims it would probably be a solid money maker then all this what happened in scrims rumor shit would go away and we d know for sure d
why do people think scrim results matter at all is it not just practice why is it inconceivable that a team might try use different strategies to see how they effect the outcome of early game mid game late game regardless if they win or lose players bring scrims up all the time and it is rarely an indicator of actual success this leads me to believe that when it is an indicator of success its most likely just a coincidence
pride before the fall
because historically we all know that scrim performance directly correlates with live match performance xd
why do people still comment on scrims in like we know scrims are no indication of how good a team is as they get used to try new things out and improve on weakness s
i will never forget clg stixxay all of them for beating t1 at msi
not just that it sounded like the scrims werent recent at all
hm my bad yeah that s fair there are lots of really nice other insights that i wanted to grab as well but just wanted this to be relevant to the widest audience i tried to express his whole take in the title but then title looked way too long so i cut it basically i clickbaited you guys my bad
nah tomorrow you ll start having a win chance but will roll the thrice in a row
tl and eg were also supposedly scrim gods
yeah if you watch the interview stixxay mentions that fly are odd we paraphrasing here been crushing them in scrims but yet we are vs them on stage maybe they are a stage team idk but based on scrims i can say that it s not even close
indeed scrim fallacy has really become a bigger and bigger false indicator of teams standing
we re just now finding out that scrim results aren t the best way to measure a team this has happened with teams since season
on the other hand the past few series and the last few weeks of lcs they haven t looked all that sharp and might even be the underdogs against gg so maybe all the bad scrim results played a part in that as well
almost like stixxay knows that and is just messing with you
yeah man loved the interviews also watched the vulcan one as well as all other gg players interviews you did great content with your own flavor
weird that you just kept on calling him big dixxay for minutes straight but i guess thats just your interview style keep it up dgon
the east is yet to catch up on this aspect we takin every win we can huh
i mean i feel like we can say for sure that fly are bad in scrims someone from damn near every team has said it at this point
this is a great idea maybe they could get some casters to commentate the scrims maybe even build a studio and have the teams come in to play in front of an audience what might we call such a thing
haha that s interesting but as a gm i d never allow that how can you try things you take away an opportunity to surprise folks in draft i expect to see something like that by gg this weekend but that all goes away by showing scrims also riot can t mandate that they could say each team is responsible for putting out a minute recap per week of scrims which then gives the power to the teams to control what gets shown
that d be insane entertainment but it d never happen since then all the secret strats picks won t be possible
it matters to the pros if you re losing a huge portion of scrims then you re going to feel like a weak team it s a mental thing try to imagine what it feels like to go weeks of scrims and lose nearly every game people aren t robots it s going to affect them mentally
no as another guy answered above it s just that people always notice and remember the moments where teams scrim results widely different from stage results whenever scrim results align with stage results those things are usually not mentioned and when they are easily forgotten because that s the obvious expected scenario
lol i remember rekkles talking about scrimming an insane korean team back in turns out it was dwg when they were still in lck challengers years later they win worlds it s not like scrimming is irrelevant it s definitely correlated to a teams success
it only matters in the sense that stronger teams tends to win more games no matter the setting
if you knew the tone he said that in you wouldn t ever think to post this comment lol really wish people would be tarred and feathered for commenting on interviews they didn t watch or listen to
goddamn it if i knew that of the replies won t actually watch the interview i d never take liberty of leaving out the full context of that statement stixxay said that flyquest is odd cause we scrimmed then and it s not even close but then we are vs them on stage so maybe they are a stage team or smth but based on scrim results i can say that it should be not even close between us also bro wtf is that unsolicited images you put in my head with that reddit name
it s ok you meant no harm
you re forgiven for admitting it gracefully
times they lost the tiebreak as well
tl makes complete sense though almost every single game this split they were getting massive leads just to slowly throw them over the next twenty minutes in scrims most teams probably just ff the second they are down that far which is probably one of the reasons tl wasn t able to improve their mid game over the split
well gg also said they have a good record vs eg
tl had massive leads in scrims they were early gods
except against c9 apparently at least for tl zven has said in a few interviews that they absolutely farm tl in scrims over winrate and have lost more to imt overall than to tl
makes sense though prince can t carry team fights in one sided scrim games but can in stage games that are closer and go longer
i really want to see some of these scrims where flyquest gets shit on like are they just limit testing every scrim or are they fraudulent and every other team is just fumbling on stage idk
it s pretty well known that teams play more aggressive in scrims not sure why people use it as a metric for rating teams even players bring it up which is weird to me i can t remember a single situation where scrim results translated to on stage power rankings accurately
i mean have you seen zeka that man is jacked they catching up for sure
they just need to implement arm wrestling into worlds somehow
lpl
yeah that would be a terrible idea for teams but they could still try their strategies vs their academy team i gudss
oooh that d be cool
interviews are not supposed to be read watched on this site you just read the headline and then shit on the player based on the headline
i was just throwing out a cliched statement no tar no feathers regardless competitors should always hype up their opposition it makes their victory over them seem that much more substantial and if it is true that scrims are going well for them and or poorly for flyquest then coming out before their match and stating that actually flyquest are looking good in scrims twists the knife that much more
im sry
he meant clickbait
tbf this also describes eg in a lot of their games
i still dont get how coaches and orgs let them ff if i was a coach of an org we would play out every game you need to learn to play from ahead and behind and thats what practice is for
you can t remember because you only remember the times when scrim results don t match up to tournament results s4 ssw was stomping people in scrims s5 s7 skt and lck were stomping in scrims same with dwg grf later on and then the lpl teams when they won worlds we just don t think twice about it because well it s not really worth talking about when tournament results follow scrim results if dig came out and said we re not doing too well or c9 jdg t1 came out saying they re stomping scrims literally no one will even bother paying attention let alone remember it
grf dwg was slapping teams so hard when worlds was in korea that it destroyed them lmfao c9 literally gave up scrimming before getting 0d because of how hard they were getting ran by grf and dwg
yeah and vasili was like a literal fitness model when lmq was a thing in exceptions do and have always existed just like the west still has their fair share of not so fit people the east has some that are conscious about their fitness and healthiness
return of the swole bros
that s what most teams do anyway with their super secret strats since there s a long history of scrim leaking in league of legends
this discussion always starts up in these threads but i m just gonna be honest i don t care enough about stixxay or anything that he has to say past a headline and same goes for most topics and people in this world but if i were to think of something interesting or cute to say as a response to a headline i d still post it and these threads would be pretty empty anyway if it only consisted of people that had done their due diligence in fact i m willing to bet that some of the people downvoting that guy and upvoting you haven t even watched the interview
yeah he should just lie when asked a direct question i guess
regardless competitors should always hype up their opposition i agree with you but na has been brainwashed by the slogan everyone else is trash for so long that ideas like that don t resonate in the community and the international community is always willing to gleefully dogpile on as well that said you should watch interviews stixxay is a real one
surprisingly normal profile page proud of you
ur clickbait
i think folks were saying it s more of a soft ff people just limit test and make mistakes which doesn t happen in stage games
i agree it s unacceptable to ff but it is incredibly hard to motive people to do something they do not want to do pro players are emotionally a decade younger than their actual ages in most cases with some exceptions such as bjergsen if you try and get a player to do something like play a specific champion that they do not want to play they will half ass their play and turn around and blame it on the coaching staff for being incompetent this has been talked about in several interview over the years one of the most important parts of being a coach is just massaging egos na and eu are not like the lpl where if a player refuses to listen there are dozens of people capable of taking their spot so teams naturally cave to the players wants and desires moreso than listening to coaching staff
i doubt they actually ff they just sorta stop trying once they re behind because they don t think the effort is worth it when its not on stage
well looks like they were right because tl were absolutely shit on stage maybe bc of that
probably because most games are decided by good early games i m pretty sure blitz scrims are common practice in both lck lpl they get to focus on fundamentals and laning get to experience more matchups you re not getting much out of just waiting around minutes each objective and waiting for picks which is just standard and it s not like it s lategame meta either you get a guaranteed games that are always effective an hour compared to playing games an hour with a lot of it waiting on objectives
that s fair criticism my take probably wasn t the greatest
i mean it s pretty common reddit behavior after all and there s a difference between being cute or memeing compared to trying to sound like you know the context or sneering at a player while being a clueless title skimmer
sorry but i just don t want to accept that if the comment section has to be barren because few people are interested in the posted content then so be it maybe that means this sort of content doesn t do well and other stuff can reach the front page either way leaving a remark or trying to join start a discussion about an interview you didn t watch or listen to is ignorant and i wish it would be called out more
its called showmanship
i guess this is a sign of maturity i wonder if this kind of behavior occurs in more successful regions such as korea and china heck does it happen in eu as well this is the crap i wouldnt put up with if i was a coach org thats the point of coaches if you dont want to listen sit on the bench
a decade younger than their actual ages in most cases trust me bro
people that do that never heard the phrase play like you practice my old sports coachs used to say that and its so true
this would be a good argument if teams were not throwing late games left and right in some cases also what better place to attempt things to comeback with repercussion than practice
lmfao most reasonable redditor
lol both you and the guy you answered to make very good points
but the headline is advertised on the front page of the subreddit it s not like stixxay gg fans are seeking this out imo you can t have both
na owners tend to favor players with trash attitudes over caoches we saw this with jatt getting the boot for some guy that has never even won a domestic title in eu or na
look up age of fame it s an actual thing
the alternative is not even reaching a late game and being behind in match up knowledge so
commenting on an interview you didn t watch is ignorant i don t know how else i can put it people can easily just not click on the comment section yet they feel compelled to share their uninformed thoughts if someone talks out their ass in real life people will understandably find that annoying it s the same thing here but on a smaller scale
unfortunately na just doesnt have the talent pool to be able to fire bench bad players you can bench your best player and come 10th or keep them and come 5th yes it s not good for the long term but na was doomed from the start see dardoch being employed by almost the whole lcs at one point even though he is a known toxic he was still picked up because there just isn t anyone better mind you dardoch was actually toxic enough to be kicked from every team which is honestly impressive considering his talent
my dude he s saying most pros have the mental maturity of year olds a year old is a 2nd grader cmon
i just don t see the problem
talking about things you don t know isn t some moral failing it isn t a problem it s just dumb behavior and it s fine if you don t see a problem with people being dumb on the internet but i personally find it annoying and wish it was more frowned at
that s a very reasonable response i appreciate that
it s actually just banger after banger maybe pcs won t do good internationally this year because each teams has a clear weakness domestically but holy shit it creates the best domestic playoffs for sure
for the sake of the oce boys i m going to pretend i didn t see dcg vs tb
psg dropping game isn t surprising tho psg isn t as dominated as two three years ago despite they won most of their game in spring the games aren t clean and lots of questionable gameplay decision
fak fighting fak 
unified and hanabi retired or
just wanna ask how is solokill doing he was a pretty hyped prospect from edg y last year some people said he was even better than yskm
i thought they were gonna disband pcs no longer the case
there s been way too many reverse sweeps and game series in general the two or however many other pcs fans are eating good
nice to see mission atlen and kaiwing still playing
doesn t the new playoff format mean the death of oce teams internationally
there sure isn t a powerhouse team on the level of psg that had a real shout about getting out of groups but the playoff has been really entertaining which i ll take over being bad and boring any day
sheamus intensifies
that wasn t pleasant none of the series involving oce teams were sadly wonder how chiefs from last year who were dominant would do
as for their starting lineup other than junjia the rest where meh i was never impressed with wako who used to be ahq mid who never successfully take over westdoor s role and got knocked around by better mid laner in the league like fofo and maple even after he switched to adc he was still considered as alright slightly better than average adc
fak  hololol
regardless fak needs to sign kennychan from wbg in summer
hanabi is now in dcg while unifies is teamless he has not officially retire but seems to be taking a break and words are that he s recently been playing a lot of apex
he s been smurfing best top in pcs no doubt https://youtu.be/gtkk42upcye?t=385
there were rumours but at least this year it s still going i think it will be around for a few more years at least
atlen was surprisingly good in playoff he s having a resurgence rn if not for him holding his own imp would be out sooner
it means the death of the weakest teams among the pcs top and lco s top
sadly yes essentially there s no longer a guaranteed spot for international for oce and they have to compete with pcs teams which tbh will trounce them they can still theoretically make it but they won t realistically make it in a while
iron sharpens iron too hope the hyper competitive state of the region causes everyone to get better
probably more or less the same tbh maybe they win more map being dominant in oce doesnt seem to mean much
wako has been absolutely killing it this split and is pretty much the undisputed best adc granted it is not a strong adc pool ubao and azhi can be underwhelming though so yeah this lineup was definitely underwhelming by psg standards mainly though i was impressed about their run with junjia so i was looking for them to do better
that s cool i hope they can keep going and keep improving
lilv and unified come back but kaiwing did mention that uni5 s surgery might have played a part in his declining form from the end of spring and onwards
it s in a grey spot right now if the level gets higher they ll all just go to the lpl salaries are higher if the level drops everyone is stuck in the pcs or other minor circuits and fans will stop watching
tbf i think that wako outperformed both in and you gotta feel for unified he had his best split in spring all geared up for msi and wasn t able to go and doggo who went in his stead got all the attention then he never was able to replicate his spring form
the goat when faker debuted he was better than one of the best mid laners in the world ambition and within the year established himself as the best ten years later he is still one of the best mid laner in the world i wish him the best
you think of how many legends of the game have came and gone and yet faker is still here competing with the best of them what a story
there s a clip of faker bang bengi wolf and a couple of members joke about how many floors of the new t1 building their legacy contributed to and to think that the entire t1 brand was built on faker s legacy is mind blowing
crown rookie doinb showmaker scout no other world champion has maintained their form quite like faker and in the words of medic form is temporary faker is forever https://youtu.be/sozesg1-paq)**
rip ryu
pros come and go faker stays there on top
i ve said it before riot won the lottery with faker as the goat the guy has had people kissing his feet and worshipping the ground he treads for a decade now and he s still super humble and never says anything other than i m grateful for the fans support i will try even harder next game please continue cheering for me never a controversy barely even harsh words during his worst times faker has been a proper celebrity in korea since he was an year old nerd and he s handled the fame and attention much more gracefully than many others he just continues grinding and improving that s all he cares about
anyone know where i can find a version with proper subtitles
i recently realized just how insane it is for faker to have maintained the status of one of the best mid laners each season throughout his entire career i think there is an argument when easyhoon played azir better and started over him but his azir now is a thing of beauty and not get burnt out playing for so long
legend after years the man is still at the top once in a generation talent tbh
probably the only goat this game will ever see i wouldn t expect this game history to carry on long enough like real sports to create another player like this while carrying himself like an absolute baller professional eat him up while he s here
what makes you legend is not one play one match or even one tournament but the consistency being top midlaner in top world team for years created that legacy also least but not last the loyalty to one team like that
g o a t
i hope rumours about him not having to do military service is correct i want to see year old faker winnng lck
the face of lol
what makes me admire him even more is thinking how hard it might ve been for him when new great players who came in and were kind of close to take down his status yet this man remained strong and kept working hard and he s still at the top once again competing for the best title this year the great passion he has towards his career is something i don t think i d ever feel to anything that s why i find it so admirable i am so proud to have been following him as a fan years of passion hard work and strength congrats to the goat
probably one of the only times where celebrating years is actually warranted
for a company that relies so heavily on its global community it s beyond my understanding why riot hasn t invested in universal translation for its videos i can watch the first take and turn on closed captioning and it will give me english translations of a song sung completely in japanese but riot can t be bothered to assign translators for its youtube videos feels like a total waste riot is uniquely well positioned to be unlikely cultural educators
that s funny because it s been years of mediocrity for me edit wtf guys i was talking about me edit2 the joke was that it s my 10th year on reddit tokay btw
goat of esports
the real goat tired of goat being thrown around when there can only be one
you can have a debate over the best player in any sports or esports and everyone will have some right to there claim but in league there is only one who lives on the top and you can t have a debate against him the eqeq unkillable demon king faker
deleted
runes reforged ruined him
i m better
for some silver stucks he is washed up tho lmao
removed
ok but can we not suck his noodle too hard there are a plenty of talented players that can compare atleast its just a brand at this point to be fair
holy
absolute respect o7
even years later i still can t believe he s real
faker was so good he banished ambition to the jungle
ten years later he is still one of the best mid laner in the world and at the carry position which requires great mechanical skills we do have players like this in dota puppey kuroky notail ceb etc who have been in the competitve scene at highest level for over years but all of them have transitioned from the carry position equivalent to mid laner adc in league to the support role as they couldn t compete with the new young and talented players faker on the other hand still being one of the best midlaner after years is crazy
and the riot lads still wont give him his ahri skin rip
he isnt just one of the best for the last two years he has been clearly the best midlaner once again
faker would definitely like to win another title now because he hasn t won a world championship since bengi left which is brutally true and if he can get a fourth title then i think faker will retire
not just better he made ambition look like he belonged in gold like the skillgap between faker and the 2nd best player in the world was just so fucking massive i will never forget watching cool try to duel faker v and just going like what the fuck am i watching i mostly watched na eu at the time and vaguely paid attention to china we so i knew the omg hype machine but holy shit that match just made me go like yo what s even the fucking point of this shit
it s even more crazy he may outlast showmaker and chovy as well despite them making their lck debuts and and a half years respectively after him
lck 10th anniversary spring finals you see a bunch of them standing at the back welcoming none other than faker who s still playing crazy
man is hitting his second prime
hes a brand its money thats all
t1 is boxer s but faker is right there with him
the fact that s7 was considered as one of faker s peak do hit different dude just carried that wash up team all the way to final and that galio games are still burned in my memory
man that line from medic was absolutely amazing and he said it when faker keria and guma pulled an impossible baron play 3v5 what better place to say it
i swear that was a papasmithy quote about faker like years before this one and this was homage am i crazy i couldn t find the original i m thinking of with a quick google
ehh scout is has been really good since his debut
scout and rookie are still incredible though scout arguable just had his best individual split ever and rookie has been in elo hell for years
rookie still good tho just elo hell in tes
_________
my boi never got a second of rest ever since that moment every time faker is talked about ryu is burned again and again
fr the only thing bad i heard him say about the game and riot or the fans was when he complained about solo q and was angry and said he will not play it anymore which he was right btw and to have a clean mindset in a game like league alone will put you in the goat title
it will be uploaded to the lck global channel in a day most likely
i mean not just in lol apart from fighting games i cannot think of any other esports player that has mainteined himself at the top of the food chain for so long and we are not even at the end of his career right now
don t forget he debut at the age of what an absolute beast
was when he split time with easyhoon but he was still a monster in s5 and was absolutely one of the best mids in the world i still think they would have won msi if faker played all games vs edg and at worlds it was mostly faker playing and he was super strong there
how is the future looking for us
and ontop of that he has one of the coolest nicknames too so simple but still so fucking cool
unironically keria is the only one the that might have a chance to contest the goat title but he would have to mantain this form for at least more years
well by definition there can only be one goat
theshy deserves a little credit for the goat season performance dude put on a clinic
few things to note despite the law chance i believe old high school drop outs aren t expected to do military so he d have an alternative service he was given a year contract despite t1 management knowing he s reaching the age of enlistment before the contract is up so they probably know someting we don t if he s picked for asian games which he most likely will as the only other korean mid in the coversation is chovy and south korea win in september he only has to do month of alternative service and or he already got exempt due to long term waiting akin to nuclear and ambition
it will probably be translated on the lck global channel
only it s been mediocre for years for me
well at least they cant say you arent consistent
my bad bro happy cake day xd
you haven t watched enough t1 content then
why are you making things up lol do you even watch t1 content
the second half of your comment is completely untrue
based winetime
i ve only ever really watched pro because of faker and usually only watch t1 games apart from worlds msi at some points i was starting to think they might be right and casters pros might be a bit too generous when they talk about him but i ve never been happier to be wrong i don t know how he does it goat through and through
i feel like there s no point in baiting if it s way too obvious no i guess i ll just never understand the rationale of people like this
u forgot the s buddy
lpl mid laners are weak lol
which player has been playing for close to years in the best league in the world and making finals for most of that year period
like who
you keep saying hes a brand in the comments but you dont seem to understand what that means
no there aren t
i like that ambition talk it to the t1 talk show host by bang and wolf that he glad being 1st killed by faker when he was on rookie debut
ambition s stream https://image.fmkorea.com/files/attach/new3/20230406/14339012/5204298581/5652366544/76cc50ae677ca7008f6cac5645b8fc95.png) today was titled year anniversary of getting hit by that spear and he was playing kha zix lol
makes rise even better what an arc that was to behold
all good he then had an amazing career in the jungle and won a worlds trophy with ssg beating skt in the final no less
the caps caedrel incident
my god courage of the colossus was such a stupid mastery holy shit
xd
nah mate he s good but certainly hasn t been the best not even in lck despite having the best teammates in almost all roles
if he can get a fourth title then i think faker will retire why does everyone keep saying this maybe because it would make for a cool narrative story i guess but faker himself has gone on record multiple times in recent years stating that he would love to play well into his 30s https://twitter.com/gumayusing/status/1588331355221655553?s=20), and that he thinks that age isn t that big of a factor as it used to be interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvmv2yebrm0), interview https://redd.it/squzl6)) realistically the only things that would stop him would be drive motivation but faker has constantly stated that he is still hungry to compete at the highest level also just signed a massive year contract with t1 https://twitter.com/t1lol/status/1597170986914578432?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw)). mandatory military service of which he could still be exempted if he gets called up for the korean national team for the asian games this year was supposed to be last year delayed to and win a gold medal which will count as lol esports is listed as an official medal event this year https://dotesports.com/general/news/asian-games-2022-in-hangzhou-china-will-feature-eight-esports-games-as-medal-events) in it was just a demonstration event as he also dropped out of high school he should be exempted to some degree anyways https://redd.it/ylncph)
can you reddit users stop making trash narratives please thanks
rooting for chovy and showmaker they looked like they had the skill to actually beat fakers goat status i m sorry faker for ever doubting you the man is at his 4th peak now or something absolutely unreal
hell he s already outlasted nuguri
chovy will be around but showmaker s decline is concerning
i will never forget that moment it was insane everyone looked older retired but most of them started the same time if not slightly earlier than faker but have all left the front scene ages ago then there s faker in view clad in his t1 sportswear as an active player still holding on beating the best was emotional for me i can only imagine how it must have felt for him
world titles world finals msi titles msi finals lck championships no one is close to his accomplishments or brand
its not hes been to finals in a row and by the end of this year thatll probably be
boxer paved the way but faker asphalted it and turned it into an airport
do more people associate t1 with boxer than faker i find that hard to believe
i will never ever forget faker using the first part of galio e to dodge a skillshot while simultaneously using the second part of the e to cc enemies x200b this was such a simple but maybe the best play i ve ever seen
huni bang wolf and kkoma talked about s7 skt on the first episode of wolf s talkwave they were watching a clip of kkoma dishing out a lecture post game from lck and the topic of s7 worlds came up with the eyes on docuseries where kkoma was chewing out huni and telling him not to make any plays or try anything apparently during one of the games against rng huni told bang wolf to start a fight bot lane because they had tp advantage but huni s tp got interrupted and the bot lane died bang said that if kkoma hadn t yelled at huni after that game he would have completely mental boomed it puts a lot of context into this picture https://i.imgur.com/xljcub7.png). at the time i thought bang was sad because his performance wasn t good but turns out he was just omega tilted lol
form is temporary class is permanent he didn t make it up but he used to say it all the time
i know it is a bias but i cant treat scout seriously after that one annie game on worlds haha
people need to stop saying this rookie is not in elo hell he just got gapped by cremes in some key games from the bo5 jackeylove was better performer and sometimes still even dealt the most dmg in the whole game even when they lost some ppl also love to say theshy is in elo hell which isn t true either it s time to admit that players fall off and it s happened to rookie and theshy i can agree with scout though he s still played pretty darn well throughout most of his career besides a few slumps and random inting periods let s especially forget what happened at worlds
azir q max winrate going up to almost match w is hilarious
i wonder how that one guy who claims to be a challenger veigar onetrick who said anyone who didn t think he would lose at least winrate in midlane was a moron is feeling right now when he straight up gained winrate across almost every rank
outside of zeri this patch seems horrendously low impact
you should have included vladimir who got a significant buff this patch due to the bug fix his winrate went up as a vlad main the q bug would happen at least once a game and the lack of sustain would sometimes result in me dying or having a bad trade he actually feels so much better to play now that i don t have to worry about it
i hope alistar kalista wr increases put a smile on everyones face on surely these are champions that were dire need of buffs especially alistar s
people gonna fear my azir support now
we re still gonna max q heads up emperors
the biggest impact from is the game perma crashing for a lot of people great job riot
what about vi
it s cause q max s pickrate dropped almost now it s just stubborn azir mains doing it meanwhile w max azir is being tanked by people adjusting to the switch and especially by people just trying azir
if i had to make a guess i d say new people on azir are gonna try w max while the ppl sticking with q are probably mains
i can t wait until phreak says something about this
you mean a clearly biased player made an extremely biased hyperbolic statement about the balance of their champion not surprised idk why people still try to quote hard core mains or one tricks about their champion especially challenger ones because their view of the game is so extremely skewed its absurd
i will admit i think v2 and others overestimated those nerfs although mainly due how useless of an ability w is especially mid lane and you still don t care about putting points into it just kinda ruins your waveclear pre 2x rod though bot lane is still the better role though what it did is make roa more forced so he s more tied to it than before
source
or the ones that said this was a slap on the wrist to olaf lol
veigar when riot comes to nerf him after he gets nerfed i didn t hear no bell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdrxkwwuflw)
i tried it i smurfed on people honestly his best role however adc s found me a menace and that meant my own adc i was left with only depression i still take pride that at on point if you u gg d na ranked flex diamond azir support you could find the winrate dark tech azir rune page it was all me like literally the amount of games and wr on the top rune page was just me i left my mark i made my clashmates suffer through it because the randoms wouldn t let me they don t play with me anymore i m back to depression
might be a possibility x200b might also be just people not reading patchnotes ever
yep according to u gg https://u.gg) azir had same winrate as in same patch in last one if he maxed w first people just needed extra help to understand wtf is going on here which is weird because usually op picks appear literally a day after patch
too many factors to really access the wr for example azir players have transitioned to a different playstyle of farming and playing safer this shift in style could have an impact that is unrelated to the actual strength of the champion unrealized potential being tapped into that said i would argue that while you are most likely correct the nuance is slightly different the population of azir s that transitioned to w max first were a different subset of the azir playerbase aka the people who transitioned to w max first were most likely better azir players so it less that the wr is being tanked but that the previous wr was inflated by or so i watched the w max winrate decrease overtime in as the playrate increased of course the overall playrate was also in half to early in the year q is most likely inflated now by the same factor different demographic that made w inflated in the past it is further enhanced by intentional spell order optimization certain matchups may favor q still and so azir one tricks bite the bullet and go q max tl dr azir is currently a guinea pig in what will most likely be a failed experiment just wait until a pro player picks azir in lck and that creates a domino effect of him being picked again azir was picked in pro play when he was objectively bad there is nothing to stop the arbitrary whims of a few select players the changes are a house of cards built on a faulty perception shrug
it s still quite likely putting some points into q in some matchups to hard win lane with poke rather than just waveclear dps is still a valid option too
theres no way u2 are presenting this as a real argument days into the patch and bming him he may very well be wrong but lmao u arent being better in this thread
i think the problem is people overstate how useless w is w seems useless in part because it s at a base level already a strong spell a ap ratio on a perma scaling champion this means that putting point on it is stupid not just because e stun is strong but also because the damage you get for putting points in it you can get by literally just farming with q like normal person and get a damage increase meanwhile e ranks give you reduced cd and extra cc so if you come to midgame with a stacks congrats you got rank w by farming stacks rank w and the cooldown the cooldown gets reduced depending on your passive stacks there s was no tradeoff for not putting points in w and putting them into e cd which the changes to reduce the spell s ratio at early ranks actually address and i mean veigar mains will somehow tell you it s stupid to put points in such a missable skill like w but then turn around and say e is super strong while also complaining about how easy it is for enemies to dodge it too or just stay in the middle dodging your q and w like if someone is trapped in your e and they don t touch the edges no matter the points you are literally getting the same effect of rank e flat sec cage outside of the cd reduction despite actually caging someone but nobody says e is useless in these cases edit especially mid lane and you still don t care about putting points into it just kinda ruins your waveclear pre 2x rod though the data is pointing to q w actually being better than q e now that your damage is getting chipped you actually should care about w ranks now
https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12br7k2/patch_137_notes/jey9m7p/
people always laugh at the we reduced this ability by damage and they always seem to knock off the winrate
i mean that wouldn t explain the nerfed max going up in winrate generally people that don t read patch notes tend to drag winrates down
he bmed tons of people who said he was being hyperbolic and yeah we re only days into the patch and he was super far off of the mark with his guess and it was a relatively simple set of balance changes not a rework if they gave veigar a rework i d agree it s early to say but these are pretty simple nerfs and we re looking at a wr drop not a wr drop like he claimed even if his winrate drops another entire it ll still be about half the drop he estimated
from personal experience putting points into w hasn t felt that great i ve noticed that putting points into w doesn t feel bad but it forces into going a heavy ah build everfrost ionians rabadon cosmic drive with transcendence and ah shard you need points into e anyway though at the very least so people don t just ignore it because of mercs legend tenacity that s why i m saying it hurts also for some reason u gg doesn t let you check exact ordering rn i feel like it s either points w max e or points e max w but likely to me it will be the first thing my main complaint is that veigar s build diversity is going down and down and roa seraphs is probably dead for veigar due to need for fast ah if you re spamming q every seconds that s pretty good and w every second it actually starts to be threatening outside of the cage though you need blue buff for that i m mainly salty because i would ve prefered veigar to be stronger early game and go into a great mid game with okayish late game though i feel like that s not something people in general want so he ll probably receive more changes coming down the line to make him stronger there without hopefully harming lower ranks diamond and below
e and w aren t really comparable as spells though if you miss w you miss w trapping someone in e regardless of stun denies movement and enables teammates
did he hurt your feelings that much that you are gonna nitpick and skew data to feel better about your little reddit argument with someone you dont know im not defendingh im but claiming he was wrong and you were right days into a game where the champ has small amount of games played of those the majority are played by people who are should be good at him because those are the ones who are the first to start keep playing the champ comparing that dataset to what it was at the end of the last patch where people played him for literally times more games you really taking the wr delta there and stroking your ego with it lol
bro i aint gon lie you seem to have gotten your feelings hurt as well here
no he didnt hurt my feelings which is why i ve done my best to not insult him beyond simply saying i m not surprised a one trick of a champion was wrong hyperbolic about the impacts of nerfs to their champion which i d say about anyone over any champion even the champions i play i remember calling out moe yassuo for over reacting about yasuo nerfs a few years back too and many other one tricks when they go all end of the world about their champion getting nerfs idk why you re so angry at me or think i m so angry or whatever the other dude yeah i could understand especially after he literally links to the dudes comment and basically implies a witch hunt at him
the 16k 21k depending on if you use u gg or lolalythics is enough to get a rough idea on where he is heading and after 30k it s pretty much stabilized and you will be able to form a concrete conclusion for the rest of the patch you absolutely do not need over 150k games for confidence in what is being clearly shown to you in your face if he would have dropped winrate he would have done so on the first day and not recovered
found his alt boys
thank you for caring so much about your kitties
these are so cute and look well done please share photos of your kitties inside of them when you get the chance
oh my gosh i love those great job i showed them to my wife because they re cool and her immediate response was no you may not
these are super cool y all did an awesome job
post this to r catwalls too
pay the cat tax
i love it and i love cats
if i know cats they are going to somehow exclusively sleep in the cat house for the opposite character great work really cool idea
they are absolutely spoiled
will post a follow up soon the kitties are still warming up to the new terrain
just did thanks for the suggestion
i actually tried all of this and different variations of it and it keeps crashing for me the moment i load in cool that this fixes it for you though
we recently upgraded the game client to be bit in the patch this change was tested for compatibility as well as soaked on pbe but since it was a significant change it can still cause some unexpected problems we are currently investigating new issues that have arisen since the upgrade we have noticed that some third party apps like discord blitz and others may not be working properly causing instability if you re experiencing issues we suggest checking these apps and making sure that your drivers are up to date
doesn t work for me still crashing matter of fact it made it worse
once only damn u lucky i crash atleast 3x
still no answer from riot that s weird because this bug seems to affect a lot of people let s hope we don t have to wait until next patch it s kinda unplayable right now
the new patch is so buggy no dragon icon in dragon vote item description tooltips don t close crashes every minutes if only we had a special public beta testing server right
if the task manager thing happens again close the task manager open a new desktop win tab in that new desktop open the task manager and you can close league from there sauce i work at an internet caf and we have a lot of problems with fucking valorant being stuck on a black screen
it is a critical error with a full memory dump happens for me one or two time every game i need to restart the computer if the windows alt tab supp get frozen behind lol just to know if the issue is similar i m gonna try to uninstall and reupload the game from zero
if your task manager gets stuck behind your game you can try using win tab to create a new desktop and open the task manager there that usually worked for me in civ vi didn t have to try with league yet
thebausffs and tyler1 both crashed on stream hope this gets fixed asap
i tried this and still getting the critical error got it twice so far in aram https://imgur.com/a/3wwhtha
thanks i ll give this a try later
gotta love when the client crashes and you get punished for it low priority queue ftw
in task manager you can do view always on top
im having the same issue game crashes in random moments tried reinstalling game and enabling dx9 legacy mode and still having the same issue game is unplayable rn
i have a very similar build to you and don t crash at all maybe it s an app overlay issue i ve disabled all overlays i7 12700k 32gb ram rtx
ahh that s why i ve been crashing all the time past days keeps crashing in the middle of an aram team fight and then i lose the game and it s infuriating
before you try to open the client make sure you ve closed the client to the client the client to the client to the client and also the client to the client to the client to the client and don t forget to close the instances of the client and the client to the client that are not responding in the task manager
this solution is toggleable some versions you need it some version you don t but its a recursive what i can t find is a solution to the black output prtscr no don t say f12 i don t want to browse a folder to find my screenshot i want prtscr ctrl v like in any other game
okay so i found a way to do it control panel firewall add an app hit browse and find c riot games league of legends game select the league of legends exe in the game folder allow it for public and private done enjoy a crash free league
updated to w11 and it fixed it
remindme days
tried everything related to graphics and your suggestions but nothing works keeps crashing every single game at the random moment and then cant quickly reconnect cuz the game is frozen and can t be closed
omg i thought i was the only one experiencing this i crashed like times in the same game last night
i crashed last night as soon as my poppy ult hit a shaco box i laughed my ass off tbh because why wouldn t something like that happen in a ranked game
it s happening in tft too for me that s once every game random moment
my game also keep crashing every game atleast once after 3mins starting game it is very annoying
i was wondering what was going on after yesterday the client is very buggy i have big problems even in champion select and then in game it freezes every minute i have amd too and i never had problems with any game and lol previously
i have queue to minutes for this bug i try to play times and never can start the fucking game give me this error and after this riot give me queue for afk lol
this is still happening today unfortunately
when i put the game exe to run as admin i can t get into the game at all the client will just freeze with a reconnect button so if anyone else experiences this uncheck the run as admin box and try again i have no idea what causes this but spaghetti do be spaghetti
classic riot how is this not fixed already this makes league literally unplayable it s happening to me and even if it wasn t i wouldn t wanna queue especially for ranked knowing my teammates have a good chance to dc
i can t even get in the game it crashes with this message right after champ pick
rtx3050 here these fixes didn t work get to it man
my crash occurs in the middle of the game i don t know what to do i got the pass but unfortunately riot doesn t allow me to farm it p
lolclient exe is the league client and not the in game exe that launches when a game starts that s why it did nothing i m not sure why op thinks changing the client s permissions will somehow prevent issues with an entirely different exe the in game exe you re looking for is c riot games league of legends game league of legends exe go to properties compatibility check run as admin and disable fullscreen optimizations also for me the issue got resolved after i updated my nvidia drivers to the latest version can any amd user confirm if they have been getting critical error crashes since the new patch everyone i ve seen list their specs so far has rtx series
ah my game was only crashing once a match randomly thinking your problem is different if its happening instantly are you getting the same critical error pop up trying to get to the bottom of this
the main one we ve noticed is discord game streaming cutting out on entering exiting a game since the patch before this is that a discord problem or a league problem
i dont have any app open except league i am in the middle of the ranked match and the error appears times per game how can you fk up the game this much and not say anything about it in the client or act like nothing is going on at riot game service status i ve updated all the drivers twice how is this not fixed instantly and why are people allowed to play the game with this bug in the game for days now
the game is pretty much unplayable i get like crashes every game during fights hopefully the files i keep sending help with things
i m sure your internal testing is much more robust but i have been fiddling with the settings trying to recreate the error so i can find the root cause it only happens once per game for me though so it takes some time but please read the edits in my original post for some info that may help your team narrow it down
no this is something else you really need to get on this dude i m not using any 3rd party apps nothing else is open the game code is fucked new good computer something is really broken
we have noticed that some third party apps like discord blitz and others may not be working properly causing instability if you re experiencing issues we suggest checking these apps and making sure that your drivers are up to date i am sorry but this sounds like a typical thing a 1st level supporter would say if he doesn t know what he is talking about x it never ever happened before it happens now with the new patch it s not the fault of some random other program
so why is the client marked bit in task manager and uninstalling reinstalling only has the bit available what s going on
so why isn t there notice on the main client instead there is a warning about challenges when you ve ruined of my games and i m getting reported and flamed in all of them because you re failing to do your job to even put out a single notice about the issue and you re posting on reddit like this is a live forum for your game
it was bit all this time amazing rip windows support i guess
you mess something up in the update and say that other apps are causing it considering it s happening to a lot of people and you re not even making it a public thing is also funny
fix your broken mess you lazy bottom feeder
just wondering for discord league instability do you think it would more likely be due to discord baseline behavior which would be strange because there re so many online games which work fine with discord in which case it s discord s responsibility to fix or would it be due to league s discord integration behavior in which case i assume it s riot games responsibility to fix
let s remove 32bit despite buggy indie code being built off of it certainly won t cause problems
cool fix this fucking shit already if i get banned for leaving a game because of this shit i will be gigapissed can t play league cause you guys just want it to crash right now and tft is fucking horrible because of cancer force rn
ofc this is because of discord and other apps no other games have same issue but league of legends but you still tell us just to close those apps so maybe problem will be gone thanks a lot
i was suspecting it had something to do with streaming at first i was crashing while stream with obs on twitch after that i was streaming on discord and crashed found out when i stopped streaming i was fine i wouldn t call this a third party issue tho it s still something related to the last league patch
i crashed yesteday no crashes today after struggling to reinstall this shitty game just permanent fps now they ruined league for windows and linux users legit need to play on macbook to get regular fps lmaoooo
suck your dead grandparents what a shitty deflection fucking do your jobs you goofs
i got crashes in games at minutes into a game the other one right at the start both happened as i alt tabbed
brah fix your game i don t even have any third party apps downloaded
it s your game fault not discord blitz or non updated drivers fix your game or revert the changes that made the error happen
u spawndog can you make the client not lag out during champ select anymore
ur a fucking clown man
bruh i can t even load in so consider yourself lucky d
how would they fix it without a patch that s literally how you fix things
i mean in this instance the pbe isn t perfect there are thousands of variables hardware configurations to account for and would not be covered during this timeframe
i ll try this if the game crashes again seems like this would do the trick and if it works you are a lifesaver
did this yesterday this is the way
i get the same error as soon as the game starts loading in can t reconnect either i ve tried all the suggestions i ve found with no success
or just click options on the task manager and set it to always on top so this never happens with any games
also if you have multiple monitors win arrow keys should be able to shove the task manager to the other monitor although i ve never tested this myself in op s specific situation
in theory yes but when i do that it always bumps me out to screen with the frozen game before i have a chance to click anything
this happened clash finals i restarted pc but i was too late couldnt come back game sucks
on windows what i do is alt tab to see the task manager in the screen with all of your open applications then use the arrow keys to select the game that is unresponsive alt tab again to make sure the placement is right then press the delete key
was just about to say this as well
ram i suspected it was overlays but after disabling all overlays the game continued to crash you have inspired me to not be lazy and check the options one by one to narrow down the source of this problem i ll update you as soon as i test some more
nobody upgrading to that dogshit os for league sorry lol
today i got demoted cause my game crashed and i couldnt rejoin
damn just logged on and crashing all game too
days going on sadge
amd user here can confirm also getting crashes
updated my drivers and still crashing i think this ain t fixable for the moment tbh
this no wonder the first steps didn t do anything for me it wasn t until i did step and that it stopped crashing could just be pure coincidence small sample size and all edit unless some interaction with the client on in the background is causing the crash
i do too
i have a pretty old gpu r9 390x and i get this issue ever since the new patch
when i change my client to being run as admin it won t even open the league of legends exe anymore also i did update my drivers and still have had two crashes
i got this one once while loading the match up as i was having internet issues it went down for a second i was guessing it was something loading halfway through that was being detected as fully loaded the game is actually much smoother to load than the previous iteration for me yet a small video lag happens when minions spawn
my theory is that discord implemented a feature to swap the streamed window into the game when it detects that it s running but the game executable is different now so discord doesn t see it i think it s likely but take this as a speculation
seeing as you just posted this appears it s still going on since 00am est on to now pm est seeing endless threads of thousands sharing this issue indie company runs a patch and the game becomes unplayable for days
they ruined the game for windows and linux users it works fine on mac os
facts lol it s definitely league especially considering i played a match just fine right before queues went down just fine smh
riot employees downvoted this xd
i literally got punished on one of my accounts demoted two ranks and put on low priority because of this bug went to my other account spent bucks to get my champs i main and a couple skins and first game i got crashed again
are you running fullscreen windowed or true fullscreen
i crashed yesteday no crashes today after struggling to reinstall this shitty game just permanent fps now they ruined league for windows and linux users legit need to play on macbook to get regular fps lmaoooo
hotfix micropatch they can force changes anytime they want
bro i have the same problem
sometimes you need win shift arrow key
it s literally the game engine itself that s crashing other programs wouldn t cause this don t waste your time on this lol
it started happening last patch for us though which would be before the official bit launch
figured the npcs would lol good
bro you re an addict wtf are u doing x200b why are u even playing ranked lmao
and of course blitzcrank bot just said its not cool that i left games lol
oh boy i can t wait to see my fav jungler play
that filter on rekky at https://youtu.be/nekqtoylfvq?t=274).
it s been so much fun watching bds and ast climb
there are just too many good fucking narratives this year makes it so fun to follow as a neutral fan heartbreak and glory to be had for sure
im rooting for lider finn redemption
yea man me and finn stocks are high atm you know jeonghoon as an import he is expected to do well kobbe is having a really great split everyone fucking hates that guy
i still don t get that bds and ast are at the top of the table
aware
lmao he s so shiny https://i.imgur.com/rdtprzw.jpg)
bro looking majestic
i really don t get what the point of you making shit up is since that is nowhere near what he said
everyone beats everyone however bds clearly looked like the best team in bo1s let s see if they can do it in the best of series
i totally agree it would be even cooler if we would able to select mutators for the game
tbh since howling abyss is much better suited as for fun map why not add stuff to allow for very custom games on off switch for aram balancing ultimate bravery mode just randomizes champion runes and summoners while also picking items you have to build disable certain champions entirely so you can do 5v5 arams with melee champions only no more ezreal completely ruining the gamemode things like urf or ofa would be fun but riot whould have to actually keep that shit updated for newer champions and we all know that ain t happening
dude we re still spawning in the corner of the base riot just can t deal with complexity like that there s no doubt in my mind that they probably have people in senior engineering positions who don t belong there
so many great ideas in this thread to keep the gamemode fresh and to actually allow players to play proper custom games yet i have literally no faith any of it will be added in the next years halo a game from had more customisability in multiplayer than lol the most played game in the world i don t want to outright call it negligence from riot but i m running out of kind ways to describe how slowly they act and how little they put into their game beyond skins and balance patches
yes but custom games is zero profit for rito so they obviously won t do that
hahaha keep dreaming this client is probably deprecated and no riot employee even wants to touch it let alone put custom options for custom games consider yourself lucky we are even getting rotating game modes but yea u agree i do custom arams for 1v1 s and the power creep levels are completely different for some champs cough bard
riot client devs probably too lazy incompetent or they won t do it bc higher ups
custom games are the only stress free way to play league me who tries harder in custom games with my friends than my ranked games
not trying to antagonize just want to gently share my opinion that if you feel custom games are the only stress free medium you may have an unhealthy relationship to the game i ve certainly been there just some food for thought sending positive vibes
i dont quite understand the reasoning players can choose their champ therefore champs dont need to be balanced if i want to play my fav champ in a custom howling abyss i would like it to be balanced to that specific setting i can imagine a few champs that would need to be differently balanced in a 1v1 or 2v2 scenario but that would be a different argument
mutators what s that i was thinking adding game modes like urf one for all ultimate spell book also having cheats on like mana regen and heath regen or infinite abilities
in my discord we would do this tank champs only with a list we wrote into its own text channel no item rules debates to decide what champions count as a tank 5v5 was a really fun time until everyone i knew quit this game
its called custom for a reason plus aram without any long ranged champs is by far the best thing thats rver happened to league
because this game is built on sticks and potatoes imagine the possibilities if they had an actual good client
they had money to put in tower rubble but its just a metaphor for how messy the client is
lets give them years atleast maybe in the next decade ersary
my friends are silver and gold im master get worse friends
yeah i havent played ranked since last year and normals for me is either challenger or silver team mates which is exhausting aram is where its at until u get zoe ezreal karma enemy
if i want to 1v1 my friend like we are laning against each other on summoners rift i don t want aram balance adjustments when we re not playing aram
not individual champs archetypes which are weak strong in large teamfights champs that are specifically designed for 1v1s 2v2s are way overcompenstated the moment you scale the game down to even 4v4s it becomes a problem no reason for qiyana to have dmg dealt dmg taken and free mercs in 1v1s the other effects like the global damage reduction to minions also makes smaller teams painful
imagine trying to play adc ashe vs someone who has damage taken just because aram
mutators came from unreal games https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/mutator](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/mutator) https://rocketleague.fandom.com/wiki/mutator\_settings](https://rocketleague.fandom.com/wiki/mutator_settings) it s just a bunch of settings that allow you to change some gamplay mechanics for example urf is basically a normal game with mutators high cdr and cannon it s kind of like cheats but for everyone
mutators are basically mods just like mods you d find on say nexus sometimes they re glorified game settings and sometimes they re a level below total conversions i don t know many games that use the term outside unreal games only one i can think of recently is genshin during a few events where the mutators in combat events made things harder for better scores
i m better than all my friends lol cuz they all quit but even when they were playing i was better i just like to try hard in customs games i wouldn t stomp them games were still fair cuz i got stuck with the really bad friends
hahaha im with you there
why not just 1v1 him on summoners rift
urf also has unlimited mana and reduced healing tho
because aram starts at level and has portals when i need to test things it s much faster in aram because both of us can ding much faster
and increased attack speed move speed crit damage reduced shielding a modified level cap not extra tenacity and those are just what i remember and then cdr is all types with summoner spells item and ability haste
i forgot about the levels
also buying mana gives health and buying mana reg gives health reg iirc
which makes seraphs absolutely bonkers especially on mana scaling mages like kappadin or ryze but even without mana scalings these items are still great
you re right but there is a time for everything after a while some people just deserve to be flamed
a lot of times people see first blood kills in other lane and lose mental because of ranked ptsd they think game is over so no matter what they do flame feed go it doesn t matter
it s never going to end this game has been out for years and it s still a thing
thanks andrew huberman
i don t usually say anything if my support dies to a gank i pinged them away from or we lose level but if it s your 5th death and you just run into them again i m sorry if i m a little frustrated and flame but what are you doing
what i thought flaming helps people s mental ive been doing it all wrong
there is literally no time during which flaming is a net gain for you or the person you are flaming if the game isn t over yet then you haven t lost and flaming your teammate will only increase the chances of you losing if the game is over why the fuck are you wasting your time flaming someone who probably has the post game chat muted and probably wouldn t listen to someone literally playing at the same rank as them actually wait if you flame you ll get punished pretty quickly nowadays so you do you i guess
if they are still trying then no and honestly even if they aren t trying you typing to them is only making you play worse
i can give a bit more insight on this data since i pulled it i also moonlight as a data analyst in addition to my day job d is the correct number of vote failed early ff s a significant number get dragged out however if a game ends before minutes are held hostage get ff d end naturally by open mid or just lose of the games resolve by minutes games that make it to minutes have a winrate games that made it to minutes had a winrate but the incidence was very low while the come back from behind win at minutes moments are some of the highest moments in league the vast vast majority of the cases are experiences where the majority of the team doesn t want to play the game out and are trapped in a suboptimal experience add on to that that a significant portion of our playerbase is paying by the hour to play having said that there s clearly a player behavior portion of this and we re still coming at this from multiple angles also addressing afk etc fun facts when i was initially pulling the data i was really confused how some games were going from surrender failed to victory within a few minutes after inspecting the games it was from teams meme surrendering lol after correcting for this the data made a lot more sense sweatsmile
because people give up and go for a surrender vote minutes later lol
i think this isn t an indication of the game state but mostly that people have already given up on the game at so it doesn t matter how small the gold lead is for the enemy team member have already called it quits and they won t do the effort anymore though i m not against this change i highly like it i hate hostage taking in ff votes when people on my team don t want to play the game it s a sign that a win is nearly impossible
i mean surrender should not be a public event in the first place each player should have a private toggle that they can flip that means they want to ff and if everyone wants to ff privately and no one changes their mind in a say second time span then the team ff s if you suddenly win a miracle fight just flip the toggle back and the ff won t go through same mechanic could work for vs surrender votes instead of unanimous no tilting or public bashing for calling a surrender vote
the problem with the whole why play if you re not having fun when losing mindset is that league is very different to play when behind than other popular games out right now being behind in games like overwatch valorant etc is obviously not ideal but it s not like being behind hinders you from having fun there s a lot more solo carry potential in those games and you can still enjoy yourself from behind league is completely different though being behind in league means you can t walk up to the wave it means you can t do any objectives it means you can t interact with your lane opponents enemy jungler it means you have to sit at your tower and wait for your wave to crash or else you ll get ganked and die it means you get flamed by your teammates when your lane opponent roams and you can t follow it means you re getting one shot by the enemy bruiser assassin with little to no counterplay i can keep going on and on but the tl dr of my point is that playing from behind in league is far less enjoyable and tolerable than other popular games out right now it just sucks and people would rather ff and go next to possibly have fun in that game than sit in a game and have to play the extremely boring way that being behind requires you to play in order to catch back up
i d be interested in the stats for how many votes at are votes at and how that influences loss rate overall the change is good though i ve been in too many games where the score is something like at minutes and person doesn t want to surrender it what happens is we surrender it at instead why waste more minutes of our time when we know what s coming
it s a self fulfilling prophecy makes me want to play snowball champs so that my team don t want to quit once we re a few kills down
how does something with this much data take so long to change did this used to be a much higher winrate and recently went down to
how much of that is the the game is already lost vs the players have already stopped trying obviously ranked is different than unranked anecdotally in aram the loss percentage is a lot lower maybe even closer to people seem to just give up if the early game isn t fun for them this happens a lot when our team has a lot of scaling champs but when we just play it out to the late game we often just win i ve also seen plenty of early ff votes when we re down kills in aram
your titling post makes it sound like a fact but phreak just says he made up a number doesn t remember said it was a surprisingly high percentage though
i ve been in many winnable games where the person who initiates the surrender basically guarantees the loss while yelling let me out in all chat
in my experience someone who wants to surrender is going to stop playing well and so a surrender fail means it s now a v
people who actively type that they quit and stop trying to win end up losing majority of games they ve decided to lose wild
and every redditor who thinks that it should not be implemented perceive themselves as the that win
surprising number of people including thinking this will lower their winrates you miss out on the fictitious win chance the change also applies to the enemy team surrender votes any difference left after that is surely no more than background noise the meaningful change is that everyone gets is shorter games and less of the miserable hostage games
that comments makes no sense attempting to surrender almost unanimously except for one hostage jackass doesn t make people play worse it s a sign that out of players have mentally given up on the game and want to do something else in that respect yes it is extremely obvious you will play worse when you don t want to play anymore this has been a huge problem with league for ages especially in lower elo
heh a vote that s just how i like it time to show these kids how a real carry plays league loses
its about how hard you can get hit and keep movin forward
the only people voting no on those votes are a people trying to punish their team and waste their time because they are mad b wholesome chungus never surrender people
people be drafting late game comps and then wanting to ff at min when things dont go their way i fucking hate surrender mentality
just comes down to the fact that some people only have a limited amount of time and that time is precious to them i haven t played much lately because works picked up and i only have time for maybe games when i do play i ve kind of avoided it lately because as an enchanter main there s very little i can do to influence the game if another lane feeds too early on it s fun trying to come back from a slightly lost lane it s not fun getting your shit pushed in by a akali constantly roams down with their jg for a 1v4 because the rest of your team has zero prio due to getting shit on so hard at the start am i supposed to just ward our base at that point there s nothing you can do if the game goes out of control too early people are good enough at this game to know how to push an advantage that big at this point i shouldn t have to play grey screen simulator or chill in base because one guys who can t handle his kda being bad and he needs to try to make up for it
this subreddit about to implode with actually it s winnable
well even if the game is winnable after the votes someone is going to open and refuse to play anyway to veto the vote
so your saying there is a chance
the issue is that a lot of people who play this game don t understand the sunk cost fallacy you ll probably lose less lp in the long run by surrendering minutes earlier and getting into a new neutral gamestate instead of dragging the lost game out and maybe clawing back of that lost maybe someone only has time for one game of league so they really do not want to surrender even though that one game is essentially unwinnable and in such a state that a comeback would require near perfect execution from their team and a complete failure from the enemy surrendering games where you re down towers kills dragons etc is completely sensible and probably a better use of your time objectively and generally yeah it s solo queue and it s never not winnable but understanding when games have become unviable due to the time and energy needed to turn them around is a skill in itself which most players who are simply on me play league autopilot don t have most people understand on some level how to play league very few understand how to win at league
garbage game state where people give up by mins i get some games you re outclassed but it shouldn t be the most recurring flow of a game a balance between stomps and tight competitive games is a must
i think people are really glossing over the fact that this is when four people all decide to surrender at once if literally any single one of those people looks at the game and thinks we re not that far behind it s winnable or simply hasn t run into the sylas with a fully stacked mejais yet and doesn t see what the big deal is this changes nothing this is for those games where master yi has seven kills then quadra kills you for soul point and drops the herald down on your mid t3 turret your entire team is getting mowed over nobody has the counterplay required to lock him down the only person who doesn t want to surrender is the lee sin still crying about his laners not collapsing to save him level one people in general have a pretty good grasp of what they can beat within their own elo i rarely see an entire team surrender at unless the entire map is getting curbstomped or we were losing in general and got trivially aced by their fed guy when we tried to win as
who would imagine that people playing like shit because they don t want to play anymore would result in a defeat
there is a huge bias that i have not seen in the comments or maybe people commenting have not read carefully the post we are talking about loss rate for failed surrender this is really different from gold deficit gold deficit 15min would be much more relevant to analyze your team can be 10k gold lead but everyone is insulting each other and vote ff
there is fair trepidation on people s minds about the idea of the self fulfilling prophecy issue and while it does happen as the stats reflect here even if its a gross generalization even would be very very high i think its a lot more rare of a condition than people think in my experience even though toxicity is an issue a lot of toxicity that results in people throwing away games afk completely refuse to play literally running it down etc are usually the kind of shit when people know the game is nearly impossible to win in that kind of scenario its usually problem player and if you scale the toxicity back i think you see the same kind of issues more commonly but with less drastic outcomes people not completely trying to lose basically when shit hits the fan even if it doesn t turn into a complete afk death int fest players that agree on a vote are usually in a situation where they know the other player will sink the game outside the chance that almost the exact same thing is happening on the enemy team so they know there s no point in playing you should also consider the unknown of how many games are not surrendered that are loss with more than problem players in this kind of analysis the number being 9x could be that its not only that people know when games are lost at votes but even and votes but because such votes are more likely to be emotional surrender votes off a single bad play its also possible that a very high of games at for example are pretty much lost as well but because a surrender vote is too easy to take hostage by grouped griefers that those games are mixed in without any distinction as to the veracity of whether such votes are accurate assessments of victory viability tldr personal experience for me is that votes is a pretty good sign of veracity for determining a good surrender vote because its way more likely the problem player is voting no versus problem players voting yes and possibly even votes to surrender is still a good sign of a team being realistic but these stats aren t distinguished so it could be the player base is actually quite accurate on viability of a win with fewer votes
of these losses are purely out of people griefing because someone didnt want to surrender people spam this way too much
i have a pretty positive mentality and a satisfying enough winrate on my main positions but there are games that are simply doomed from the start and i don t mean unwinnable i mean those games when someone runs it down or people simply refuse to play anymore and we start a ff vote just to be trapped by that guy who can t carry but has a no fetish some of those games are technically winnable but the truth is when i find myself surrounded by players who simply don t want to play or spam the k word nonstop i d rather lose 24lp and go next than sweat my ass off to give them an undeserved victory i ve recently carried a doomed game at min we had no inhibs botlane was etc everyone was flaming me with insta bannable shit but i somehow solo won the game it wasn t satisfying at all it simply felt like offering people free lp at the expense of my mental health i would have rather ffed bit top mid were trapping us
the fact that so many redditors are so firmly against a surrender being possible really does give some great insight as to the sheer mental state of people beyond narcissistic main character syndrome freaks
i personally don t even think there should be a surrender button it alone puts defeat or giving up in people s minds and having that awful fallback option is a bad way to play maybe keep surrender options available for most game modes but not in ranked the most valuable information and growth for me has come from unwinnable games
the larger staggering issue that never gets light is how big of an issue it is that from minute to minute controls the game you have minutes to gain a win chance riot claims to balance so much in this game but they keep refusing to look past how insanely imbalanced the entire gamestate is i ve been playing since the game was sold in boxes at gamestop aka open beta the games use to average minutes and they were quality minutes now we spend half the time in lobby and hostage situations because the game is at lightspeed compared to what it was years ago they tried changing this with bounties but that s just a negative impact repulsion all it s doing is making the issue worse by forcing people to try and coinflip open objectives outside map control the issue is the ramp speed of early gold accumulation and minion xp to solo lanes i don t understand why this never gets looked at as a year top lane player now mid lane convert there was nothing worse than getting turret dove at level on a well executed wave crash that often would literally cost you and your team the game because of the xp loss alone the biggest thing that needs to go are turret plates that s the first step to slowing down the minute window of winning riot knows this which is why the introduced turret plate armor they need to just remove them entirely
i wonder how many of those losses came to be decent games and not as frustrating as it felt at minutes
having ff vote in a game creates a bunch of losers that give up at the first sign of difficulty
thank goodness they re implementing this in ranked tbh
it s because people give up and aren t willing to actually try anymore everything is doomed and people just softly concede the game while going through the motions of playing the go next mentality is so ingrained in people nowadays that they don t even care to know which games are winnable and which ones are doomed that number seems ridiculously high though
good change
they should implement this into professional sports go back home every one we suck tonight no refund and now get out
it also doesn t help that the person who doesn t want to surrender often gets flamed inted into oblivion who voted no is one of the most fun questions in the game
honestly it shouldn t be in either ranked or casual in ranked because it s just against the whole point of the mode you shouldn t be just throwing in the towel the moment it goes bad you should be there until the end in casual because it just fosters this mentality of defeatism and an eagerness to just split the moment it doesn t go your way this change hell the surrender vote in general is a really shitty quick fix patch job for a complicated problem that is only made worse by having the surrender vote we all know just how fragile many players can be the answer is to stick them in a losers queue and foster a healthy relationship with the game and your teammates
i m so sick of the ff mentality play the game to win if we are going to ff minutes then can the person who voted no lose less mmr that would keep more people hitting no which means more people trying to win
the never ff people are some of the most cringe people on this planet especially when the surrender vote is legit exactly the same as that one player throwing a tantrum after dying once in lane just some self centered douchebags
i think the change is overall good even though i m usually the one person not surrendering i wish there was more of a culture shift within league to play out games even if you re behind since so many games are winnable if people just keep a good mental but overall i get it and with people playing the game as they do now i think the change will help a lot
i know it is anecdotal but i definitely win more than games i don t ff in when its votes
idk how about we make the laning phase slower so the games don t get decided in the first minutes because bot lane didn t ward and went in a bot lane meta it s unprecedented how impactful that lane is the moment you win it unless you have terrorists in your team you already won the game probably it s borderline impossible to win vs a winning botlane unless you re playing some assassin in jg or mid that can somewhat shut them down in a teamfight an even bigger problem is whenever enemy bot is winning and you don t have a single tank that can engage in the entire team at that point you are just gonna lose
ive won so many games that was in all the games are still alot of games
you lose of the games you surrender i have been that lone no surrender vote many many times and can t tell you how many times i ve won
it s much easier to lose a game than to win when people vote to surrender they want to lose i completely understand not wanting to waste one s time but i still believe it s worth trying to win every game you play i don t know of many video games where you can surrender counter strike can feel hopeless when you re down but there s always huge comebacks and those always feel great
so you re saying it s winnable
still not voting yes
lol why even play a late game scaling champ at that point
my thoughts are that the data could easily be oversimplified as well if we re going to lose anyways the ff should go through as if to suggest players making the call are right that the game is doomed rather than it being far more likely that if or even if it was only2 out of players don t want to play and give up by mentally checking out you will almost certainly lose that team game i mean perhaps the vote should go through since it s almost inevitable the toxic f2p game will have people afking running it down opening mid etc to end faster rather than trying their best til the end as someone who still wants to play pretty much all games out i still dont want griefers and people w suckass cancerous attitudes on my team however i would argue id rather stay those extra brutal minutes so those people expose themselves we report them and i move on i want to play games out to improve individually if my team ints and gets toxic because i chose to vote no as my given right then whatever lmao that s their choice i can still enjoy trying my best til the end it s their toxicity that sucks the joy out but that s what the mute button is for
a few years ago during season or i did a little social experiment where right at minutes i was going to initiate a surrender regardless of game state i felt that some people were surrending simply because they lost mental due to losing lane even though other lanes might be winning out of the ten games in a row that i put up an ff15 vote of them surrendered one game in particular i remember everyone on my team had won lane i had just gotten my third kill of the game no deaths then put up the surrender vote immediately my entire team clicked yes it might have been a meme surrender i m not sure because no one on my team had said anything after that game however someone on the enemy team said it was a dumb surrender because my entire team was winning only one game of those did they keep clicking no to the surrender vote because they felt it was winnable despite if memory serves it being a fairly even in gold game take away what you want from this but i found it interesting personally i feel like there should be some kind of change made to the game i know they are speeding up the games but some still get dragged to or minutes it seems like the majority of league players want quick easy wins so maybe they could make a ranked map that has towers instead of per lane i had a thought that the second some clicks surrender the game simply ends and the person who surrenders loses the lp obviously these have issues but there s just so many problems with league and i feel like the devs are just now starting to explore options
so you re saying that there s a chance
it s because the game has inherent design flaws same thing goes for watching pro play how many of the games are just wasted time playing out literally slaughter rule type shit i ve probably wasted days of my life watching gold econ just create bad sports viewing the game is never changing but the inherent flaw is power accumulation through gold it creates a great power fantasy but it also creates something that doesn t happen in real sports no motherf er in sports is growing in power during a single match they come in with their skill and capacities already in some static like state sure they can go into zones but that doesn t change their physiological strength then when you have a group scene of people who all think they know exactly how a game is dead means people are going to instantly mald when everything perfect doesn t happen in their games this also would never happen in real sports unless you got turbo slaughtered which means you either completely shit the bed or you re way out of your league you re going to find it harder over time just like rts to get people to buy into dumb rules of engagement when the time cost is so severe it worked for a generation years ago kids who were years old then aren t running into league anymore just like everyone years ago ran from the rts scene and it s time pressure tax real sports will always beat this shit out because the rules always are created at parity no fucking gold bullshit or convoluted comeback mechanisms to compensate for how you generate power
my man broxah in shambles of the games he wins he pulls a reverse uno card after getting stomped in the early game and his team ff ing he always declines and then proceeds to carry the game and win
why continue to play if you see a failed vote if you know your teammates will force your loss at min
those wins are by far the best games especially when the team aren t a bunch of weak soled losers and never start the ff vote seeing the ff vote pop up especially when i m doing well is so frustrating and makes me feel like i have to play faster instead of smarter and show the team i can carry by getting more kills or that i have to babysit that one inter who s crying about dying solo minutes in so he doesn t just leave game or actually intentionally feed i love it when my teammates aren t babies they can be bad but nothing is worse than babies
this thread is exactly why i and many many others stopped playing league
literally losing because of paper mental
when people give up and they know that of their teammates have also given up ofc the team loses everybody whos talking about hostage takers and saying that it s always the one person who says no is doing poorly is suffering from horrific cognitive bias first of all if ur team is in a losing position then its likely that any one person is also doing poorly 2nd your bias is singling out the one person who didnt surrender so you will judge that one person who isnt surrender far more than anybody else because now theyre ur obstacle to getting out of the game and if they really are griefing then thats only going to stick out more making you go well that just proves all those people stoping me from leaving are just holding me hostage yeah when ur behind u have a lower winrate that s obvious you could be so far behind that even if u tried ur best u have single digit chance of winning but surrender is not reflective of the actual gamestate and the chance of winning if people kept their cool and didnt give up just dont show the surrender vote and if it fails dont show the numbers what an obvious change that somehow nobody came up with in more than a decade absolute clown design
totally a psychological thing you font have data on the situation what would ve happened to the game if the vote wasn t even cast corellation and causation i m sure people are going to use this as a way to say hurrrr durrrr see you should just vote yes hurrrrrr but the opposite is still true having a surrender option makes people bot want to play the game to their best ability it breeds a mentality of giving up
the main problem is that a winnable game becomes unwinnable cause players give up after a few deaths especially at lower elos i can understand at high elo a kill has a huge impact on the state of a lane if the kayle top kills ur laner pre minutes u might wanna ff but in low elo that happens so many times and it s easily recoverable if people didn t give up especially cause at lower elos players don t know how to close out games and need barons even if they are 10k gold ahead
yeah not surprising that when people are expecting to lose and want the game to end as quickly as possible they usually lose
think this is a really good change
this post proves that of league players don t understand numbers and statistics
lol changed and games are way shorter i remember when games would go at least minutes now it s rare for me to get to minutes games often end after minutes surrender at is a normal surrender timing with that game lenght
i hate ff ing always just play it out the funnest games ive ever had are the minute comebacks
i refuse to surrender unless a the team score is below the enemy team in kills or b the enemy has already broken into our base we already lost a vs before that point i ve seen many games do a win them people need to take some of these losing games as learning experience to improve at the game stop giving up because they lose their lane it s pathetic behaviour you are not going to win every game so if you are just going to give up at the first sign of a loss go play something else stop crying
so i ve got a bit of a weird perspective on early surrender votes i never agree to surrender in normals but my reason is not because i believe that the game can be won i am confident that the single most important skill that the average league player including myself is lacking is the ability to regain advantage in a losing situation the reason for this is partly because most league players just stop trying when they are losing but it s mainly because the surrender vote exists how can anyone gain experience playing from behind if the game just ends every time it happens to them it s not going to affect me hugely as i mostly play premade but when i refuse a surrender vote it s because i need the practice
having played other moba s without a surrender option i absolutely hate the surrender option i find it annoying and very distracting to have to press no over and over and not to mention people that die once and get crippled by the emotional damage it s a game suck it up and use the rest of the game to find out what this guy is doing that you don t understand so that next time you might have an answer other than ff
fuck yall im not surrendering
how does this align with the summoner s code x200b never feed intentionally and don t give up the fight seeking revenge on your own team by intentionally feeding and helping the opposing team does not promote fair play keep a cool head if you fall behind don t give up and always do your best i m already annoyed surrendering is even an option if you queue up for a game you have to play the game i can t quit afk if i do i get banned how is surrendering any different why bother making this why not just make it so you can surrender at any point in the game the reason is that you want to encourage players to try their best all this sort of attitude does is mean players are going to give up mentally even sooner i m sad to see this change
why are we encouraging ff culture the most exhilarating games are the most difficult and challenging ones with the most mettlesome teamfights winning a tough game is a very satisfying feeling nowadays whenever the team is down kills people want to ff it s unreal
as an avid never surrender advocate remember that the lossrate is not because all games where want to surr is lost it s because people assume it s lost and stop trying
why we have surrender opt in the first place dota doesnt need that
never surrender
people talking about being that one person who votes no because they are trying to win meanwhile times in my games it s that one guy who s voting no out of spite of people on their team that s the hostage takers if you are being called that you are probably it the few times i see people genuinely try to play the game doesn t get nearly as flamed if at all as those who just do it to piss others off
fun facts when i was initially pulling the data i was really confused how some games were going from surrender failed to victory within a few minutes after inspecting the games it was from teams meme surrendering lol after correcting for this the data made a lot more sense sweatsmile this was indeed a fun fact
add on to that that a significant portion of our playerbase is paying by the hour to play i now realize you re talking about players at pc cafes i originally assumed you were talking about your player base not being able to juggle full time work with league of legends
i can t watch the video currently so phreak may have already answered this but is there any historic data that this can be compared to since through the seasons there have been strategic decisions made to first decrease average game time significantly and intentionally by riot and then more recently an accepted approach to slightly increase average game time as a potential result from the durability patch it would be interesting to see if this behavioural pattern is consistent or dependent on the current circumstanslces of the game
is there differences between that number by rank
we used to meme surrender a lot moments before destroying the enemy nexus while playing normals haha
get this to the top for the love of almighty god also nice to know that my meme surrenders not only lead to stressing out teammates but also mess with rioters
out of curiosity do you have stats for what of total games played are games that are stomped like that and how this number compares to previous season i sometimes kill time by watching league streamers and meet the gg lost in champ select due to comps ff15 games pretty often and hear streamers complaining about the fact that you can lose in champ select while they sound believable since they re the dia challenger guys i can t help but think that if it was really so easy to lose in champ select you guys at riot would ve seen acted on the data hence why i m curious if there is any increase in one sided games compared to previous years to back up their complaints or just collective streamer ego acting up
question why dont make the surrender vote private if you want to ff you tick checkmark a box that you can untick removemark whenever you want and if out of are still ticked by or mins then its automatical ff no need for ff vote cooldown no stress over reachibg threshold maybe no need for it to be private but it only requires ticked boxes and its instant
just out of curiosity what is the lose rate if you vote or what percentage of games even have votes at min is this change supposed to be addressing a big problem or a small outlier
always remember that game when both me and jg was and we ffed cause it was their mid laner s birthday
hobby data analyst currently studying to make it a career i appreciate the insight
serious question i am one of the never surrender at people but to me this data indicates a flaw in the game i have been playing league since beta and i m an old man now but the game used to be different in one very critical way in the early days of league there was no hostage holding because if the enemy team was so far ahead that the game seemed unwinnable they were capable of just ending the game now we have this very weird limbo where games can feel unwinnable for straight minutes while the winning team still isn t capable of safely ending the game does riot consider it a problem that it s so incredibly hard to end games even with an absurd lead if a game is a loss it should be naturally ending within the next minutes regardless of ff in the old days minute wins were not terribly uncommon now i probably haven t had a true minute win not ff in like years imo this is a big issue that needs to be addressed
it is so nice to read that after years of reddit hivemind saying that never ff you can always comeback the reality shows that most of the time you just lose time
what do the stats look like by elo i d expect in masters tier everyone is good enough to know when they ve lost and the opponents won t be making many mistakes to capitalize on anyway but in bronze people will just randomly get giga tilted off the smallest things and try to surrender and opponents will constantly int and give over leads
how are you accounting for the effect that ff votes have towards discouraging players from continuing to play to win shouldn t we be concerned that earlier easier ff votes will encourage players to give up more often aren t these statistics at least partially self fulfilling isn t surrendering at odds with the added comeback mechanics such as bounties my opinion is that surrender votes shouldn t even exist in ranked queues at least not until some definitive gameplay trigger such as losing an inhibitor if you queue up for ranked you committed to playing with the intention of winning handling edge cases such as griefers can and should happen separately outside of the match ff mentality is a huge source of toxicity in this game and these changes further enable that toxicity not to mention other issues like the whole point of scaling champs it s obvious that a high percentage of games with votes would end up lost but you are injecting your bias into the data by not considering all possible causes that perspective and these changes run the risk of making the game less enjoyable overall
do you have any breakdowns by who the holdout on the vote tends to be i d assume it s generally the top laner or the jungle who holds out on account of bot lane usually would end up voting the same way and midlaners are closer to the action across the map also do the win rates after the votes tend to be the same across divisions or does it vary based on rank
held hostage trapped in a suboptimal experience this is a bit odd language to use here imho isn t part of playing a competitive game that you might get a suboptimal experience isn t that what losing is sometimes you lose lane sometimes you lose game sometimes you lose surrender vote there s clearly a player behavior portion what about a mindset portion do you have any data on the availability of early ffs influencing the willingness of people to play from behind into a comeback
i don t think this data gives a complete picture i d really like to know what various game states have these failed surrender at votes what percentage of games have 2k gold leads 2k 5k 5k what have equal dragons what are down one two dragons perhaps people are holding hostage in unwinnable games but some portion of the only wr is the self fulfilling prophecy of it the question becomes what percentage of the games are feasibly winnable and why do people feel so strongly they can t come back i don t have a problem with the change especially knowing that it s to the benefit of netcafe players but i do wish games like this didn t occur so often
not really upset at nrg just upset the team i ve been rooting for since no longer exists it makes me much less interested in the lcs as a whole without a team to cheer for i really don t have any interest in being a fan of any of the teams in the league now maybe 100t i guess but i don t know if tsm leaves too hopefully a team i might be interested in joins it s gonna be so weird not to have a team to cheer for this just fucking sucks all the way around
lmao reading the comment section makes me understand why the lcs is dying actual boomers xd tbh nrg should have saved themselves the money and trouble and not have invested in a sinking ship clg is probably thankful af someone was even willing to save them
they bought the slot they don t get the history clgfighting
no clg fan is going to root for these assholes why do they even bother to mention us
oh fuck off keeping blue jackets while changing the whole brand is supposed to be keeping the team s legacy i m still waiting to see a single excited nrg fan from their supposed huge fan base what does no nrg fan play or watch league this whole thing just seems like bullshit trying to make a business decision seem like more palatable move
genuine question why not just root for nrg it sounds like they re going to keep the lcs team intact at least for summer split
yeah what a buzzkill at least someone snagged the spot instead of leaving it to die
love clg as an org how they always challenge c9 but damn the clg fanbase just sucks a lot of the time consistently bitter and angry people
yet for some reason casters and fans love giving gen g the samsung history as if they are a worlds winning org
they really think they can just buy our trophies lmao fuck off clgfighting
clg sold nrg never forced them out stop acting like clg didn t sell out
nrg didn t force clg out the lcs clg chose to abandon the lcs and cash out stop hating nrg because they have more desire to run a league org than clg stop reading so deep into the jerseys they re just paying respect for the historic org they had to replace to get in
is t1 not skt then
samsung won worlds clg went to worlds that one time years ago then went afk xd bottom org for the last years gah dayum thank u for saving us mr nrg
no they just took your spot stop taking it personally
cut nrg some slack if nrg didn t buy the slot someone else would ve end of the day clg was looking to sell and for someone to replace them clg did this not nrg edit correction msg did this not clg
i m never acted like anything i m just saying that they shouldn t worry about catering to us if they re not going to keep the brand
skt t1 was never bought for their slot so don t really know why you brought them up
their promo video shows them using our trophy as a prop for a skit god damn right i take it personally lol they re also dropping the clg logo brand asap financially it makes sense of course but nrg seems to show no interest in the legacy clg fans or clg fans in general it s not just that they are buying the spot they bought the brand and aren t using it in any capacity and the entire team staff of clg was let go i was giving them the benefit of the doubt with this aqcuisition i was curious to see how they would talk to clg fans or treat us but they don t give a shit clearly
clg didn t do this msg did if anything i can mutually dislike both nrg and msg and considering msg has a non controlling stake in nrg why wouldn t i hate nrg by proxy i like the people that were in clg and i like the staff that ran clg i liked the brand of clg if none of that is left then i really don t care anymore msg took the brand of clg ran it gradually into the ground and then sold it off nrg could have done well during the transitional phase but nothing has shown to me a legacy fan that respect they immediately took over the clg twitter the whole thing just feels pretty terrible it wasn t done with any tact or respect to the fans of the team or the members that were on it it s a complete corporate take over and nrg isn t entitled to my respect nrg didn t do right by clg fans so no fuck em
i ve heard clg fans say the opposite too interestingly that nrg isn t doing enough to appeal to clg fans can t really fault you though for not liking the nrg brand it seems very antithetical to what clg was i just think they re getting too much shit for trying to renter the lcs and clg was going to sell to someone regardless of nrg also i d like to make a correction and say clg didn t sell out msg did sorry clg
no but they essentially rebranded when comcast sort of took control
i mean they re getting somebody from clg to make a tribute video keeping the clg yt channels untouched selling clg merch for charity doing blue legacy jerseys what more could they do besides keep the name the same when even you know that wouldn t make financcal sense msg let all the staff go nrg had no part of that
ye i need to make that correction your right sorry clg this is msgs fault and ye those are all valid reasons for not rooting for nrg i just disagree on the fundamentals of hating them because they bought the slot clg was selling to them i don t think they re the bad guys as much as msg are as shitty as it is nrg isn t required to respect clg i m honestly surprised they re even paying any respect through the jerseys i m not saying you should root for nrg because honestly they re close to the antithesis of what clg was but i don t think it inherently makes them villains because they have more interest in running an lcs org than msg did
i m not mad with nrg for buying our spot i m mad with them for buying our brand just to kill it
idrk what they would do with it though it makes sense they want nrg in the lcs and in doing that you essentially have to kill clg
i m not saying that it doesn t make sense for them to do it i m only saying that they shouldn t bother catering to us if they re gonna just pay some lip service in twitter and keeping some of our colors
i feel like ovilee is always at but sometimes i d prefer if she took it down to like
i can t wait for officially branded gg f you hats after they win the split
ovilee just taking over the entire interview instead of just a small portion is hilariously on brand
i was pretty shocked when it turned out that ovilee was the one doing the interview it seemed so much like travis
goated interview honestly
you sound like my mom
honestly part of me wants to see her go even further beyond the other part remembers the lil nas x parody with raz twerking and realizes she already has
one does not simply tell robin williams to take it down
ok sweet
was that before or after the megan thee stallion parody https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpcluf2zmky)?
https://youtu.be/oxttrffguk0 before with the tl horse twerking and ovilee humping the ground
is she following impact with these videos lol i can t see her not making one for flyquest this year
you mean like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo_e_6dx434

yea good split id call this season return of the veterans wildturtle stixxay doublelift all were fun to watch cant wait for next split just hope that teams arent afraid to drop underperformers
i wish dash was still in the lcs tho i like katt and the whole broadcast but dash would make a big positive difference overall things were better than i expected
im going to be honest the casting in the lcs has gone down in my opinion in the last couple years but again im not trying to speak for everyone
i m a c9 fan and about an hour from raleigh i still haven t bought tickets i m gonna hate myself if i don t go
i also enjoy the lcs a lot and it s good to see other people feel the same
mostly agree but i m still not sure how i feel about the change to weekdays would be interesting to see their viewer statistics
i agree this has been the best the lcs has ever been the broadcast has been amazing and gamplay wise there has been more aggression in gameplay than what i remember from previous years various teams have made unexpected runs we got some really engaging imports like emenes and prince who are also really good i as a fan feel more connected to the lcs and the players than ever before it s just more fun to watch and follow than it has ever been
great take mate echo the sentiment clearly with all the drama surrounding some teams great success have gone unnoticed this split
someone is actually giving praise to the lcs on reddit holy moly fr tho i ve loved this season probably my favourite i can recall
i really liked the standing shake ups with ggs doing a great job as well as clg and even tsm holding their own always nice when games could really go either way and it s not so predictable lec also had a great split in this way
best split in awhile for sure lcs content and presentation has been much better for awhile and still improving don t believe the bs narrative barring a few things i wont feed into msi will be interesting though i am pseudo optimistic
i don t care if he s the best player in the league running it down on a great team or terrible team i m just glad i got to watch doublelift again this year i m old
i am from eu and i had a lot of fun watching lcs this split many interesting names as usual several teams with vastly different philosophies regarding how the team is set up multiple underdog storylines and of course also disappointments from big teams i also enjoy the normal league phase even though it is probably too long one bo3 single round robin would probably be optimal a lot more than that crazy thing lec has going on right now with like four different stages i am sad that dash is not really a proper part of the lcs anymore because not that much has changed that it was really necessary to cut his position and the caster situation well i don t have to talk about this everyone knows what i mean i am really sorry for that person to get so much flak but there is a very high standard for casting in a major region and that person just isn t there yet
nice to see some of the old players back
definitely feels like anyone except maybe the bottom teams can win or at least end up in finals prior to 100t winning a few splits ago the only teams to ever win an lcs split were c9 tl clg and tsm way more interesting to not have to think only 4ish teams are competitive
dude i love the positivity and i couldn t agree more i also never really watched anything in between games sometimes the intro min and sometimes the cooldown but it was so stale i am loving it this year even though i miss dash i m also loving the broadcasts willingness to go for things even if a segment doesn t land for me and most have landed i m just so proud and happy that they are doing stuff and on that point markz has been killing it with the content and the league has been pretty great too lots of ups and downs that make you think most of the league is competitive with each other c9 kind of got away from the pack in the last couple weeks but didn t look that much better all split loving the storylines and the competition and the content we just gotta keep the toxicity out of it ppl want to whine and cry that s all right we just continue the parade
thank you for posting this while eu is sleeping obviously i love this split as cloud9 fan but i ve watched almost every game it s been fun to watch
i never really stopped enjoying it that being said this split has been one of the most entertaining from content and narrative perspectives
this split had hype and story lines but for the actual gameplay less good because eg and fly felt like they never got it together c9 legit look like a good lcs team but eg and fly did not feel like they were running on all cylinders and they were storylines were good though gg surprising everyone with a bunch of lcs has beens tl being terrible return of the goats if eg fly and tl actually played well as teams and peaked going into playoffs this would have been an amazing split
i am hoping gg beats fly
just needed dash magic to be there as well for broadcast and i would be willing to watch it this season
i m just here to say thank you for posting many times we get all doom and gloom because the only comments we hear are negative not trying to cover the sun with a finger there are issues that need fixing but i wholeheartedly agree that this split has been a great showing and a improvement on many aspects
my prediction is gg over fly then gg win over c9
no you re right this has been one of the best splits yet and shows cause viewership on thursday friday is actually pretty decent and we ll see how the final does this weekend
from what i ve seen i can t watch it live due to the scheduling change it seems like the best split in a while i was worried about the loss of a dedicated host but the broadcast segments i have watched have been great
totally agree i think the broadcast overall is improving a lot and i personally really like the snl style skits even if some of them are cringe i think the lcs really learned from its mistakes of the covid era and is making much better effort to connect fans to players and the broadcast team i personally never felt a disconnect over the past few years but that s because i started watching the dive and felt like i was hanging out with kobe markz and azael every week and their broadcasts felt a lot more personable to me because of that i also think quality of gameplay is going up on average and we re getting a bit of a resurgence in western talent it s not as easy as buy x veteran import and coast to the top as it used to be sure you have your flyquests but you also have your gg s the playing field feels more level overall it s frustrating that such a large portion of the community thinks lcs is dying so i m not going to watch because that s a self fulfilling prophecy i think now is one of the best times to watch lcs and interface with content my buds and i tried playing fantasy for the first time this split and we had a blast
gg has been so fun to watch on their current run i hope they re able to sneak past fq
i do think this might be the most parity the league has had in forever obviously biased but this dig roster is easily the most talented 10th place roster we ve ever had in the lcs
the games were pretty fun overall not super high quality but mostly entertaining and not super low quality the play by play has been noticeably bad this split and this is not me just knocking gabby some of the newer people from amateur also struggled watching older players is fun it can be fun to watch them lose as well one subtle positive of this split has been more emergent storylines and fewer forced ones in past splits it s like at the start the analysts decide what the storyline will be and refuse to budge bjerg jensen rivalry pobelter is saving clg the major stories seem more organic and real gg surprisingly doing well and stixxay playing great the ups and downs of clg 100t struggling new players like emenes stepping up i think in the past the analysts wanted to create interesting angles but they ended up feeling forced and contrived only loosely related to what was happening in the games this split it felt more like the commentary was based on actual in game results so i agree with the exception that play by play is really hurting i don t care about the skits and the dive and that stuff all that much the on field product was good fun players fun organic storylines etc
i agree as well the only thing about the lcs this split i can t stand is letigress being on the caster roster
since the lcs got a lot of crap in the covid era everyone doing skype calls from their bedrooms they ve actually improved their game massively nbsp the greatest strength though was always the casters the big of phreak flowers kobe and azael pretty much guarenteed a quality cast in whatever permutation they were setup in but in the end phreak is an adc main and decided he would sacrifice his casting career to fulfil the dreams of adc s and make them absurdly op and have the entire game revolve around them it s your fault adc s everything has always been your fault nbsp and even though i m an eu fan i think it s such a positive thing that there s a drive to get more homegrown na talent in teams they feel like proper na teams the connection you have when the players are from your region is much stronger rip clg nbsp they murdered the whole thing with the change to week nights though rito pls
wouldn t know the scheduling changes mean i dont watch it anymore
i think it s been a fun and competitive split with good parity in the league but all the intangibles i feel are not there still there s good things like the segments of the game show they ve done as content but again i feel absolutely no connection to the players as well as i feel like the casting has gotten worse but that s not on the casters that s on riot for who they paired with who and how many times they used certain people give me more raafas and bring on kangas i loved the games themselves and the competition but with viewership dropping off a cliff and not much improvement elsewhere it s rough
i don t see how this season stands out from others except with dig bombing and gg not being bad a million bo1s where a couple teams dominate a couple flounder and everyone else competes to be as unimpressive as possible my hype for a good international showing isn t high c9 won by just smashing every lane which won t likely translate at msi personally i liked the new times as i work 2nd shift and would just turn on the games at work the players joining the lounge and casting desk is cool too
yeah this split is awesome that doesn t make the complaints invalid though the format is dogwater the hours are atrocious the days are meh at best there s way too much time between games and casting quality hovers between acceptable and holy fuck my ears the players and games though are some of the best performance in history it s like dl s return showed them you can be a pro without being a faceless nobody and you can show some personality to the fans
at the start of the split i was only planning on watching flyq games because i was a prince simp from lsb but i got pleasantly surprised by how competetive and unpredictable the region was that being said still lcs is still severely behind on an international level i genuinely see no hope for this region at msi or worlds this year
riot is gonna sign letigress for another year because of this post thanks op
removed
the time table change meant i watched the least of this split than any since season my side of the world its just much easier to be an lck lpl enjoyer
how some of the worst casting lcs has ever had and no competition some of the stronger teams last year are now not good and fly who looked really good at the start with winsome now don t even look like a team anymore zero synergy
removed
tell me you never watched another league without saying you never watched another league lcs good
i m a 100t fan stopped reading here
never been less interested in the lcs than this split just not enough eu players
me too death to tsm
i haven t watched in a few years it was some time pre pandemic when i last watched i only recognize like of those names everyone i used to watch is gone except dl and bjerg crazy
the time has been rough for me honestly weekday morning times like the lec had would be better than afternoons afternoons i am required to be with family after work
games wise yes however casting sucks outside of kobe azael and cptflowers production is fine i feels the breaker are smaller
i ve really enjoyed this split but i will say there was a disappointing number of games where the quality dropped because of the casting and were less fun to watch i think kangas rafaa and cubby all did fantastically though and i liked how many guest casters they experimented with it s fun to get a pro player perspective live
i liked the players the matchups were hype it s the format i only got to see matches between 100t and c9 same with all the other hype matches you watch best of 1series and then maybe playoffs but best of is so anticlimactic and often so sided it would be much better to see the hype teams play in best of too bad too expensive for la
this is the most enjoyable i ve found lcs in years the casting changes are cringe at times but way fewer pauses and parity is nice the meta is a little stale for too long in top and bot lane but there s decent diversity in mid and jungle i do wish side landing was stronger there are a lot of tun narratives on this season too it s just a shame that riot has done their best to kill off viewership
i think if the times weren t unwatchable for me maybe i would too
honestly i don t think this is an unpopular opinion at all i think it ll take some time for it to be affected in the viewership statistics but lcs has been really engaging this split and i haven t watched this much of the league since and i ve been actively following lolesports the whole time
it was fully carried by the sneaky dl aphro costream crew for me
sad that aphro didn t play i definitely missed him this split
well he is coming back for the finals
i spent so long trying to figure out who tf katt was
i really like the route they went with the lounge this year i feel we get to see player personalities a lot more and it s a good pace between games but i will never understand dash not being there
losing phreak hurt a ton now there s only tier play by play caster instead of so it got rough hence why they re having flowers cast both series this weekend
i agree but that was mostly letigress i liked the new people they had on i think academy casters they should give them a lot more opportunities they just need more knowledgeable play by play casters flowers is awesome but letigress has no idea what s going on
lcs has the best and worst casters of all regions
does anyone know when phreak decided to leave because iirc they let pastry know they weren t bringing him back prior to last worlds i wonder if they did that and then were caught off guard by losing phreak as well
we lost phreak pastrytime and riv all in the same year without any permanent replacements apart from the cameo appearances from the nacl casters and letigress it s basically been a captainflowers carry job
what a hot take
i really hope courage sticks around the scene and does more games outside 100t
casting in general hasn t been my bag since papasmithy quit lck most of them are fine in the four major regions but it s not an integral element anymore atlus is the best of the bunch probably
having decerux spotlight for one week was a delight not too big on anyone else besides the og still though
it s just because we slowly lost people zirene riv phreak pastry we ve had a lot of our lineup leave the scene and while you may dislike any number of the ones that left you can t deny the burden them leaving puts on the rest of the casters captain flowers and kobe are still god tier but they re being spread pretty thin
what are you talking about our casters have been amazing for a lot of years especially the last few only recently has it gone down this year cuz of newbies
if there was ever a time to go as a c9 fan this would be it
do it
update thanks for the motivation guys got my sunday ticket ready
i went to worlds last year when it was close with a group of friends super fun time you should definitely go if it is close to you especially since you get to see a team you follow
20k drop in avg viewers when compared to spring but spring was a 50k drop from spring
even for someone like me who has the luxury to work from home i normally don t end up watching the broadcast because i am still working i still have meetings and obligations i am not going to go out of my way to not schedule things during those time frames and once you start missing it a couple of times it just gradually fades away from your consciousness
i can t even watch it anymore i used to really enjoy watching it on weekends too
i just cant watch it anymore because of that change and i dont want to watch the vods as i ll have to avoid twitter reddit to avoid spoilers yea the finals are on the weekend but im not invested at all because i was only able to watch a handful of playoff games
i enjoy weekdays more but i am bias i watch from eu at 11pm
yeah the split was really well played especially by c9 imo i m really disappointed though since i was supporting eg which well was nothing short of a trainwreck against gg also kinda dissatisfied with jojos performance compared to last year when he was way more aggressive and better and could be noticed and could more back up his claims of being the best which he definitely isn t
god smiles upon this man na lcss last true fan
the broadcast has been amazing you lost me with this one if it s not flowers kobe or azael the broadcast is pretty bad
damn wish i could watch live if only i didn t have professional responsibilities during a majority of the matches
is this satire the best lcs split of all time the most you ve been connected with the players the broadcast has been amazing when there is one caster who runs it down every time have you been watching for lcs for like years i disagree with every single sentence you ve typed coming from someone who s watched na league since season
completely agree you put it more concisely than i could lol the battle for playoffs was complete insanity as well felt like anybody could ve made it and yes i totally feel more connected to the players which is what really makes it more fun to be a fan
yeah i was so confused by all of the hate threads earlier about the lcs like last year dogshit trashcan poopoo doodoo this year really good and fun to watch all around
you were glad you got to see him auto attack again you need a better hobby man
amen
thank you for posting this while eu is sleeping man what s that dread for anyway i ll admit that mainly due to schedule change it s certainly the first time i don t watch a single game from lcs this split
amen honestly it makes me glad to see such a positive response it seems like there s a lot of positivity out there that doesn t ever make it to reddit normally
completely agree the self fulfilling prophecy is real for sure
what will translate to winning msi in your opinion scaling and doing nothing what else would give them a better shot honestly i would love to know
i mean do you consider people like impact who has been in na for years and has a green card and thus no longer considered an import to be not from na because i guess then maybe but as far as i m concerned flyquest has imports not also i think that s part of what made this split so good is that the players are given many many more opportunities to show their personality coming on broadcast more involved post game interviews etc
wait flyquest has spica who s american and c9 has blabber who s also american gg has stixxay and licorice eg has jojo and vulcan are both na clg has na players and 100t have in what world do the best teams have no na players half the new players this split are just drowning in personality almost like there are gamers who aren t antisocial
they have shown more personality this year then ever before i can t believe you say that after all the banger ass interviews and shows zven has been on you clearly aren t paying attention at all and it shows
blaber is an na player
you can just say you don t watch the lcs instead of talking about zero na players which is a lie and talking about zero personality which is a second lie no one is impressed by you trying to be the cool guy saying you dislike na by just flat out lying shrug
yes im new to watching esports and this is my first split go thieves such a fun team
oh my god let people like things
nothing has to be the highest tier of play to have fun with it
every fucking thread why do you feel the need to shit on other peoples harmless happiness
a few things about cblol loud robo in this split has been playing a lot with olaf and renekton he picked aatrox in the series against pain gaming because they were literally banned olaf and renekton from him he is really an or player he can carry a match by himself but he can also lose a match by himself although this is rarely happening swain is not a tinowns pocket pick he is a dynquedo pocket pick since loud knows that pain gaming are their main opponents then swain end up getting into tinowns pool so that they can take away from dynquedo in a series tinowns can play with any control mage the midlane pool at worlds was cruel to tinowns hahaha he sucks with akali for example annie is instaban against loud robo revealed that they are in scrims with annie pain gaming cariok is not one of the best players in pain on the contrary he is in a terrible phase the best players in pain gaming are dynquedo and bvoy los grandes yeah zay was mono pyke before he became pro so yeah that s a pocket pick veigar is also a flex pick at los grandes netuno played veigar against loud and won the match including the botlane was veigar and pyke los grandes has a chance to knock out pain gaming in the lower bracket but for that lava and hirit need to start playing well they have failed to perform in the cblol furia i agree that they hardly have any chance of reaching msi but it is worth mentioning furia s support ayu he is years old and can play literally with anything his bel veth support is insta ban he has games and wins in general you spoke well about the cblol teams just a few mistakes that are normal to happen to those who do not follow the league
golden guardians takes were shit i understand it s hard to cover this many teams in depth let alone 3rd seed lcs but damn lol
love your esports content and this was a nice follow up from the weekly power rankings videos you re one of the only people crazy enough to try and cover every major league and even if sometimes your takes seem a little off gotta respect you for trying to cover them all
loved the video especially the highlight of champs and teams x200b great overall look i did not agree with everything about lec but that s totally fine and i think overall in the realm of having a different opinion and not being factually wrong x200b lpl and lck also sounded good to me from what i saw this season
i only loosely follow the cblol but i did watch a fair batch of the games in the second half of the split and i ve just gotta disagree about cariok he smurfed it in their game win streak imo
just weird takes in general zven gets a shout out for his priority on ranged supports plays a normal amount of ranged supports especially soraka gg have as many soraka games played as c9 this split what s more unique about zven is his prio and ability on adc supports especially given his history he has games on adc supports this split and single handedly makes up of the league s ashe support picks source oracleselixir
my takes can t always be good when my sleep schedule is as screwed as it is catching all the big games
thank you
them he was absurdly gapped in the series against loud he played well in the second half of the cblol but even then i think it had much more to do with the improvement of the solo laners than cariok himself he just stopped being the worst player in the league which happened in the first part of the cblol hahaha i am brazilian and a pain gaming fan
no point mentioning zven s marksman supports since they ve basically been flushed out of the meta after and zven has played zero marksman in playoffs same thing for soraka prio c9 played both in playoffs and gg hasn t touched anything out of the ordinary in playoffs at all yet
i mean i d argue that series was mostly mid gap tinowns got shove in isolation in all early games in their wins and was able to set bot behind every time with roams because of it
anything outside of the ordinary rumble rell gwen and amumu were played in their last series blitzcrank as well
rumble gwen very standard in the meta right now
keria has only played ashe once in playoffs which was a loss and that was the only adc support picked in playoffs so far yet his champion pool includes caitlyn and kalista what were your standards for choosing these champions the rest of the lck champ pools look pretty strange too imo
i disagree with you but honestly i would have to write a text about the series to explain my point of view and i m lazy hahaha
gwen and rell are fairly decently played across regions and i never want to see licorice on rumble ever again
basically i picked their top most played across the whole split but if there was a tie then i d favor playoffs champs or champs the player is simply known for playing a lot in general and then the bottom row is specifically pocket picks that the player has brought out multiple times successfully in the past or present that i think could show up in msi it was probably a bit odd to give keria all the ranged supports but he was the one who started the wave of those in proplay so i just kinda gave him the nod
loud would skt how about that
you can easily check right now and see rell is not commonly played in the last thirty days including gg one other team has played rell in a major region and that was beryl who isnt exactly who we should check for what is a meta pick amumu and blitzcrank have about the same amount of picks in the last month discounting rumble purely because you didnt like how he played degrades your argument dunno about gwen
what exactly was wrong with his rumble he had one bad death where he facechecked krugs that he knew the enemy was at but other than that he played his role well he went up 20cs in lane against malphite and had solid ults i don t think that it should be a frequent pick but as a counterpick teamfight pick with amumu maokai ult cc it looked really good also he had the game winning play when he almost solokilled jojo bot forced ssumday s tp and then used his tp advantage to secure baron
tinowns played lissandra against veigar i think it s kind obvious that he would have pressure in the early game in game for example cariok should have covered the botlane but he insisted on trying to snowball wizer against robo and it didn t work after that perfect game i think everyone knew that loud would win the series there is a mental aspect involved in the loud vs pain rivalry despite this in game taliyah dynquedo vs lissandra tinowns i think dynquedo played that match better than tinowns but route carried loud in the team fights game taliyah vs syndra syndra has a higher win rate against taliyah but tinowns got ganks from both croc and robo and unbalanced the match up anyway the vi priority in this particular series doesn t make much sense and it was cariok s personal choice in the end croc s early games suffocated cariok who could not adapt during the series
if this guy was into checking champ stats we wouldn t be in this situation lol you can see it in the other replies to the thread just deny and double down with statements that are easily falsifiable with a google search feels bad because you can definitely see the effort that was put into the video as a whole
rell has a presence rate across all regions and every region attending msi has seen it picked at least once also if i was going to bother adding pocket picks that looked bad i might as well go ahead and say licorice can play lee sin too
i don t mind discussing which parts of my video might be wrong but labeling me as a denier and a double downer because i want to respond and explain my opinions to people who take the time to reply to my video is a bit harsh
very nice sculpts i ll definitely buy the nami files i have to ask though do you have permission from the companies to sell their character s likeness copyrights can be tricky
how did you design it for 3d printing i see a lot of printing challenges here
wow it looks very nice
they look great
thanks for the support really appreciate it if you need any help let me know and i have not and i dont know if i actually need it good tip tho might have to look into that
bros about to get a cease desist the size of kindreds scrumdidelidumptious behind
the model will be sliced up so it can be printed in parts printing this as a whole will be hard yes i have not printed it myself yet but i will have printed and tested it before it becomes available for people to download and print
the specific difficult parts i see are wolf s mouth and lamb s bow and arrow
yeah i might have to make some small changes to the model when i prepare it for printing but should be fine the arrow is the one that s gonna be the most difficult i think
i would maybe use a sharpened piece of filament for the arrow even if it is slightly bended it should look great
you re right and should say it people will say it s only hardstuck players complaining about it but i m not saying smurfs are the reason i m hardstuck plat since half the time they re on my team and i d probably be equally hardstuck without them i mean i was when smurf queue was a thing so that s a fact and i really couldn t care less what sucks is that every game coming down to who plays around their smurf better is fucking boring i mostly play ranked at this point because i want fun competitive games where everyone is roughly the same level and my messed up normals mmr is not that instead i get smurfs just warping the whole game around them also another unsung downside of smurf queue being gone is some of the smurfs are just permabanned or honor restricted players back for a second round and they always make it clear within minutes if they re one of those characters there s a reason that smurfq if you ever had the misfortune of playing in it was an unprecedented concentration of the worst of humanity and now those types are back in the wild again had some colorful level top laners lately to say the least
riot removed smurf q with the new preseason not only do you get this people from smurf queue in your ranked games again but also there is a general increase in smurfing because they dont get ock blocked by smurf queue anymore its kinda sad honestly that everyone is running around with multiple smurf acc
people are just mass buying botted accounts because the new account mmr gain is insane after few patches and can easily boost your rank way higher than your original if you manage to get an early winstreak
many streamers advertise buying fresh accs also its basically dollars for a new account on some sites
there is a lot of talk about new account mmr right now mmr uses a lot of matches to determine where you belong the more data it is given the more accurate it can be a fresh account mmr is far more changeable so can lead to some crazy gains if people get on win streaks they can climb much faster than on their regular accounts if they can peak higher is an entirely different question there is however some evidence that it might take an older account hundreds of games to climb to where it belongs but a fresh account can get there in twenty lots of streamers and players on twitter have talked about it so a lot of people desperate to blame the system rather than their own skill or lack there of are likely trying out fresh account mmr
dollar accounts botted to with tons of blue essence its just too easy to do and riot doesnt care about botted accounts
removed smurf queue prime smurf time has started most people already hit their ranked peak this split but are not yet completely bored by the game as a whole so more people will go play in lower ranks to feel that they are good and carrying the team until they get bored new split starts
i don t understand the point of smurfing how is it competition to play with people who are not on your level that s like lebron james going to play street ball he s not gaining anything
they boosted the lp gain so sure the number of smurf accounts increased
here is my take with someone with multiple accounts gm currently late night queue especially is insanely poor quality people are tired but more importantly alot of auto fills the game is decided on who has less autofills on their team which is unfun due to rng also the mmr system lp gains in league suck i currently have a winrate span for games and i m getting currently having a winrate in league doesn t net you positive lp gains over a long enough sample size so that s another reason why a lot of players change accounts because fresh accounts have insane mmr gains that s why you see a lot of streamers swap account because once your account reaches a certain amount of games it becomes dead as it won t give you positive lp gains even if it s at winrate i think tyler1 swapped accounts already this season in na matchmaking is also imbalance in high elo you can have for example a lp masters botlane vs lp challenger botlane in the same game this is my experience playing in na idk if it s the same for other regions but the mmr lp gains need to still be looked at imo
i made a second account because the regions have been locked for so long from making transfers and i get into plat after like ranked games and there s just like only winrate players or winrate players lmao no one s normal yet either plateaued people dropping or smurfs climbing
because ranked is filled with smurfs hardstuck or boosted wr kids
i know a guy who buys accounts for that have just been clearly botted to lvl and then he plays ranked on them and has never had an account banned riot doesn t ban these obvious bot accounts
riot don t care so nothing will change i mean shit second highest league streamer live right now even advertises where to buy smurf accounts from
smurfing will always be a problem unless riot does something about botted accounts as long as literally anyone can buy a fresh lvl account for less than dollars depending on where they get it from smurfs will always be a problem if smurfs had to hand lvl accounts or if botters had to switch to hand leveling there would be so many less smurfs so many accounts are clearly botted to but riot literally does not a give a singular fuck
they removed smurf q because they also changed the punishment for flamers actually people who permaban their accs and make buy new ones all the time from permaban to increasingly long chat restrictions and instead of having message every mins it s just full mute they also increased the lp gains losses so the smurfs would get to their real elo faster resulting in smaller of their games to be actually hard smurfing so in theory this should have heavily reduced the number of new smurfs and remove the need for smurf q and lower the q time
especially with lp gains being dog on everyones main accounts right now smurfung just seems like a way better option to climb if riot made it actually possible to winstreak on your main without ruining your lp gains i bet smurfs would be halved
of smurfs in gold plat are just other plat players who made another account since its just blatantly more efficient for climbing
hijacking the thread but can anyone explain to me why i m silver and facing gold even plat 4s in my games how am i suppose to climb and how the hell are those people getting lp from wins vs players below many divisions i don t get this at all it s like if i was silver playing vs bronze
smurfs were always a thing but over the years it s become an increasing amount likely because of a combo of factors like people using smurfs to reset mmr and climb faster or streamer culture growing and in turn helping normalize smurfs
its cuz so many ppl get banned toxic riot rep system is ass
riot could force two factor auth for accounts but they won t smurfs make them money
the worst part about smurfs is that they have a chance of being on your team vs a chance of being in the enemy team
honestly this season is such a disaster game is unplayable either due to cancerous meta or faulty systems and all of that on top of community being well as bad as it s always been
way fewer than in the past like fractions thereof
thanks finally someone talking about this the saddest thing though is there are still people defending smurf accounts it is not funny getting stomped by a lv zed who wants to cure his low hardstuck self steem by means of stomping others also having a toxic smurf carrying your game while you don t have to do basically anything isn t fun either there is almost no justification for creating a smurf account but for playing with lower elo players b but i want to train with my cleanest ap garen you can do it on practice mode normals and ranked using your main account if you are frightened of losing lp maybe you shouldn t be doing that i want to play with my non existent japanese girlfriend who just started playing so in the process of doing that you have to stomp and spoil the experience of genuine lv who have just started like your waifu what a egotistical simp attitude of yours just wait for her she will unlock normals in no time my eleventh account got banned due to my monke attitude so i have to smurf maybe you should reconsider your life choices my friend currently i am incapable of finding a good healthy reason for smurfing while leaving original accounts out of stompings and toxic games i have even sent tickets to riot and they simply say we are working on it even they once told me something like some people just get good games once in a while sure ma am anyway the truth is that the frustation smurfs generate is good for the business frustation means seeking for refreshment shiny good looking skins are quite refreshing and makes you forget how bad implemented the ranked system is even smurfs can buy skins in both accounts so it s fine either way sorry for my rant but i m very glad of seeing people being concerned about this
as someone with multiple smurfs i just wanna say my personal justification is that it s kind of exhausting to play this game in diamond especially on your off role i pretty much exclusively do position smurfs until they reach a rank comparable to my main where i have to switch back to my main role right now i have a gold top account and i m enjoying the game 1000x more being able to just mindlessly play olaf mundo than i do when i m sweating on adc it doesn t help that it s extremely easy for normal mmr to skyrocket to the point where i haven t had a normal game without a gm masters player in it in months even on my smurf
i ve noticed carrying is basically non existent now your far better off playing a tanky turret pusher and splitting x200b you can be kills ahead and it makes no different atm ofc early it does but it just seems to fall off makes the game a little boring where no one shines really
my account was banned for weeks for language gotta play somehow though i m not a smurf smurf just a gold pepega
i think it s a lot less smurfs than you think if someone new to the game hit and then jumped into ranked you only even have to win placements to become the average players rank of silver and you ll still be in matches with mostly all gold players i think what you really need to do to figure out the percentage is track the accounts you think are smurfs and see what rank they are in a month if it s impossibly high for a beginner then obviously you know it s a smurf
bro i m just trying to rank up my new account it s prolly as stressful for me to be in ur game as it is for you to have me in ur game
hey it was my turn to make a post about smurfs for free karma
why people want to play the game casually and in games they are favored to win above their skill level rather than be challenged to play their best and keep pushing themselves to improve
losers mentallity smurf isn t good in his elo got boosted so he relegates his account to feel better we should seriously consider to tie online gaming accounts to personal id you can t have more than league acc period
as long as riot is unwilling to change their ranked system into something that doesn t breed toxicity and hate and non rewarding rewards people will go smurf because at the end of the day whether master diamond plat gold or silver when riot effectively has a system that actively wants to prevent you from climbing it kills any sort of incentive to continue leveling and ranking up an account first off why the fuck do we still have only ranks for of the playerbase it is insane when adding the volatile shutdown system into the mix having a game in gold or silver you will have players of vastly different levels knowledge of the game they should add one rank between plat and gold and one rank between silver and gold this way it would highly benefit matchmaking in lower elos secondly while to their credit as they have recently added bigger lp gains and losses it is still insane to me how someone with a positive winrate can gain less lp than he loses when the game actively decides to hold you back as much as possible it really kills the incentives to try thirdly this ties in with the second point losers queue and winners queue they will never remove it most likely as they don t even acknowledge its existence but it is cancer lastly and this one would affect all players the most in a very positive way and i can t believe a multi million dollar number in the industry company has not yet implemented this having an lp system that is tied to ingame performance if you gained more lp when playin well and less lp when playing bad or vice versa lose less lp when playing well and lose more lp when playing badly it would actively do things incentivize all players to try to play their best so they gain more or lose less lp this system would be based on ingame performance luckily riot already has a performance rating system although it has many flaws it could be improved if you wanted to implement it towards this idea maybe through ai so it can more accurately determine good or bad play it would punish trollers more who run it down or who play troll out of position aka follow jungler around automatically more and the others less currrently the system mainly punishes afkers but not trollers this would in big parts fix the issue x200b as long as riot doesn t change the ranked system you will continue to see a very high amount of smurfers especially in low mid elo
the game is over a decade old and is free to play
i highly doubt you get smurfs every single game
in season there was an evelynn kassadin in every single game demolishing the opposite team it was awful
were
seems to have increased lately
i ve never really understood feeling the need to make a 2nd account just to shit on worse players my friends and i will use our alt accounts to help our friend that s new to the game learn how to play but even then we play an off role and don t try stomp lane
in some elos it s faster to get a new account to ranked than grinding from leagues below while playing in your real mmr you finish a season in gold you get placed in bronze or worse and have to play against golds to get back there
bot accounts being sold for cheap honestly anything below bucks is worth not spending a days leveling on bots smurf accounts get massive lp gains if you are on a winstreak just dice roll a few accounts with master yi or something and you ll eventually get wins and be placed in plat diamond elo lol then duo abuse
i look at u gg it s usually pretty clear if they have a wr they re smurfing
dunno why riot cannot just detect the number of accounts passing through the same ip address to separate pc bangs from smurfs with multiple accounts i dunno what the number would be but let s say it s league accounts weekly connect through the ip pc bang and gets a smurf exemption accounts connect through the ip smurfs who should be tied to a unified account or just have the pc bangs get an exemption tag direct from riot or something
i tried addressing this a few times while ago and the community shot it down it makes me think that a lot of the community is smurfing my fiance is having a hard time getting into the game in normals because of smurfs crushing the lobbies and flaming people riot really needs to look into outright banning them all to help the increasing toxicity in all queues
why look at their lvl they can be lvl if they re in silver they diserve to be silver
just had a level account who was gold who hard carries every game goin like tell me hes not a smurf and its his main account and to get good they just lying to themselves too thats the worst part
oh my god this is why i cant climb this season jesus fking hell
yes there where
because the game sucks near your actual rank due to forced match making so smurfs decide to ruin low elo games so they can get games that are consistently enjoyable even at the expense of other players
wasn t that bad for ne this year until recently like you said idk if there was a mass exodus of diamond plat players or what but every game past like midnight has level accounts some are 9bvious toxic bois who totally swear this is the account they ll climb on they tend to just int and type all game but a good chunk are legit smurfs who just gigastomp the lobby for team idk what would have caused the rise of so many though
i ve been playing since season and play til gold rank each time except season when i was elo and honestly this season is the hardest ever for me and i believe it s because of the much higher quantity of smurfs in silver elo fresh account elo that just ruin games it also seems to be due to bad mental but i think people give up when they realize there s a smurf in game heres my op gg https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/peach%20goddess), so i can show i m not bsing there are just so many stomp games that it s impossible to carry maybe i m just playing the wrong role
riot banning accounts for saying whore to themselves and for people having bad games going
because the game is extremely team oriented currently which makes climbing significantly more difficult than it was before but at least we gain more lp this leads people to become hardstuck or niche players to climb really quickly once they plateau they become frustrated and buy a new account for and try climbing again this is a cycle
you just gotta play around games to balance out the smurfs trolls feeders afks etc fuck this game and its bullshit gigabrain behavioral based matchmaking
because the ranked matchmaking system sucks and too many people feel chastised over their ranks they feel they should be higher so they buy into the i m good fresh account fresh mmr mentality rather than learning how to play the game differently to climb higher
it is not surprised since if you go to bot game you would see bots on your team and riot s bots on the enemy team and of course smurfs buy those accounts when they hit level
riot makes money off of smurfing so they have little incentive to actually stop it if the community made enough noise about it and riot could see metrics showing that smurfing is harming them in some way then maybe we could force them to act on it
even if it were hardstuck players complaining the main issue isnt even the skill difference but just the fact that they are incredibly toxic and dont give a fuck about the game even those that arent banned or anything just refuse to try and comeback because why would they when its not their main
it s really dumb when the entire game is just about waiting for your kill hecarim to feel sufficiently ego stroked to make any moves towards ending the game it s not enjoyable to play with or against
dude smurf queue wasn t even a bad idea they just needed to make it so that going on a win streak didn t put aged accounts in smurf queue my account is from i have zero fucking business in smurf queue no matter my elo low level accounts on win streaks are smurfs full stop give them a queue done
i hate how smurfing discussions come with hardstuck and skill issue accusations because in a game as snowbally as lol pretending to be a lower ranked account literally objectively is just cheating when you can win your lane in like seconds by the surprise factor of a giving a bronze plat player whiplash and then stat check everyone who might be able to actually compete with you it is cheating there is nothing impressive about it we re not playing csgo we re playing an rpg lol
i m leveling up a second account to practice new roles and after like games of stomps it was the actual bottom of the barrel of humanity holy shit so many n words calls for genocide etc etc i m always down for a little trash talk more than the average person but if thats what smurf queue is like yikes bro
i don t understand why league doesn t put unranked players together until there s daylight on who s better than whom if you ve got a team of new recruits you don t just throw them in with regular platoons to see if they belong the newbies all stay together until they re trained and you know what they re good at then they re placed out elsewhere
smurf queue was an unholy abomination concentrated mental illness
there was a problem with smurf queue though if you one tricked and climbed too fast it would put you in with the smurfs in smurf queue once there it was a gamble if you would ever climb out
thanks for acknowledging that the issue is the game quality and not that it makes you hardstuck fucking hate that argument
hardstuck gold players wanted smurfq removed and more lp gains because they thought those things were holding them back they got it and now they re complaining even more i just love it
i quit when the removal of smurf q happened smurf q was the best thing to ever happen to this game in my personal opinion league was almost unique in not having a smurf problem when smurf q was around it was like an enclosed area for all the trolls on their new accounts after being banned on their mains but now all those people are released into the general population and when it only takes player to ruin a game well then basically every game is now ruined because of it don t know or care why they got rid of smurf queue i just voted with my feet and haven t played since quite possible others are playing more as a result of no smurf q and if that is true and continues to be true then wp riot i am just not their target customer it probably did me a favour tbh
my thread was downvoted originally i have since linked it a few times and people have changed that lol but i am going to be proved more and more right https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zeshm5/removal_of_smurf_queue_and_the_number_of_people reddit was an echo chamber of the tiny number of people who got put into smurf queue or think they did smurf queue was a good thing for average gameplay quality and now the larger playerbase has more games lowered in quality of smurfs as opposed to a tiny number of people late to playing ranked having to calibrate more harshly
also new accounts can be bpught for
stly th riot is also allowing fresh accounts to be elo inflated by winstreaking early on enforcing that people will try over and over on a new account to get a massive lucky winstreak to outpeak their main account in 20games only
probably because smurf queue threw a bunch of players who were just having good starts to their seasons or maybe took some time off from league and came back into smurf queue it felt horrible for a bunch of innocent players
i m the only one in my friend group of people who only has one account everyone else has at least and they treat me like i m fucking weird it feels like it s just the norm now to have at least a secondary account i don t get banned i don t get chat restricted i m fine with my rank i don t need a reset and it s been that way for years if you need accounts to function you need some self reflection and i openly tell them that
yup people don t realize the real problem in league is borderline zero bot detection coop vs ai is jam packed with bots
not even that much more like for a level with 20k be and chests
there s people running big businesses selling fucking smurf accounts that s right people make a living off selling the means to ruin lol games nbsp and riot got rid of smurf queue
i m duoing with a friend on fresh accounts atm their account is years old they started somewhere in mid to high silver i ve taken accounts from below their starting rank into high plat is now outside duo range they have only just hit gold considering we ve duod every single game total with the exact same w l the fact i ve earned more than 4x the lp they have just because their account is older is a joke it s no wonder people make fresh accounts to play ranked if your account is a few years old with ranked games played it s literally torture to try rank up
they should give old accounts the option to reset their mmr lets people actually have a fair shot at climbing with an old account without playing an ungodly number of games
as someone that always likes to come around with the good ol statistically there can only be x amount of smurfs in y amount of games if your elo is z i chuckled yesterday when i had smurfs queueing alone in my master lobby that was quite special
my friend made an account in february he went on a game winstreak about a week and a half ago doing a particular cheese and now he s afraid to play because the account is way higher mmr than he has been before
you say that but the system for old accounts suck this is the first year i m actually testing a new account i have games on my main and am in gold4 my new account has games and is gold2 but playing plat people already and climbing i don t have time to play currently but i will try to see how far i can push it and then i will make a post about it
over the years as i improved and the player base at large improved i rose from bronze silver back in s3 up to plat diamond more recently i always thought that game and player quality would get better and more thoroughly competitive as i rose turned out the opposite was true this game only gets worse the higher rank you get
they don t want competition they want the dopamine hit of climbing most people that play don t care about actively improving it s only fun if their lp number goes up it s why the vast majority of players are in and never rise above silver now the smurfs are gonna run through and mow them down to make it even worse edit case in point the person that responded to me they don t want competition they don t even want to climb they just want to have fun and are fine ruining ranked and making ranks pointless so they can get that little buzz from their numbers going up
the point is not having lebron play in nfl if he ever decides to play american football league is a game with lots of champions being played in roles and you re not gonna be good at all of them hence smurfing to learn
on top of what everyone else has said climbing used to be much easier on a fresh account than an account with a set mmr riot alleviated this with the lp changes but it should still be easier
yeah but we don t know if with the removal of sq it s now incentivized people to smurf more who otherwise wouldn t have bothered because they heard of sq or existing smurfs now are increasingly more interested in running more smurf accounts than they otherwise would have
if riot made it actually possible to winstreak on your main without ruining your lp gains i bet smurfs would be halved if you watch this documentary https://youtu.be/fyor2pkvdwe on smurfs that s not the reason they buy smurf accounts they mainly buy smurf accounts so they can stomp people worse than them or int the fuck out of high level games to annoy people nbsp normal lol players might smurf for lp reasons the guys who buy smurf accounts are typically turb incels broken pathetic people who want to use lol to hurt or annoy people without any danger to themselves and riot enables these guys
source trust me bro
always been like that always been shit
displayed rank doesn t really matter match making rating is hidden and super secret the answer is those players have a very similar secret mmr to yours why can mmr and rank be so different is the real question to be asking for which you will get a pile of answers but its probably some combination of mmr etc is secret and riot makes a very strong point not to let people actually know how it works demotion shields ie when you keep losing and don t drop a rank but your well in this case the gold x you are grouped with mmr keeps going down dou queing since combining different mmrs and the mmr boost from playing in a duo can do funky stuff with mmr rank soft reset each season bumps player s rank down but doesn t chance mmr so if you and i had the same mmr rank at the start of the season i have played a bunch of games and grinded my rating back up without really moving mmr too much we might now have differate ranks but pretty similar mmrs again this is in combination with other things also there is a not small portion of the community online who believes riot uses a form of engagement based match making basically forcing wins or losses by creating imbalanced teams to keep you playing more personally i don t subscribe to that theory but its quite commonly held
the worst is if you main jungle or marksman since this matches you against duo abusing smurfs while you ll get some hardstuck top mid duo which results in a guaranteed loss
who in their right mind would start playing league in
there s always some guy running this bullshit smurfs don t exist man it s all in your mind nbsp it s bullshit they always have a pseudo mathematcial argument and then you press them for details about where they get these numbers these percentages they can t say the reason is they just pulled them from their ass because all they really have is a notion that smurfs don t exist or are so rare theymay as well not exist nbsp if you re in a game with a smurf you know it it s like standing on a street watching one guy stab another and while the stabbed guy is lying there bleeding to death crying in pain some asshole comes up and says it never happened knife crime is a fiction and it s all in your head
no need to track that if i see a level account with insane mechanics and macro in a platin lobby its obviously a smurf and not a new player
it s literally more than ever before now that riot both removed smurf queue and upped lp gains at the same time it s a noticeable spike to the point i can t argue against it when i was closer to your thought of it s less than you might think just last season in plat i even notice a spike so imagine what it s like below that
yeah been playing for a decade myself but never noticed it beeing so much tho
yep don t play adc
this is the thing people defending smurfs never even bother to address the fact that they just don t care about that account i see idc not my main at least once per day that i play usually on someone playing one of the wind bros with that person generally just feeding either through negligence i e wards up facechecking bushes or splitting with no pressure or just straight up intentionally like the yone i had today who r d into a tower then danced til the malph under it killed him if riot actually punished people and cracked down on sold botted accounts this wouldn t be an issue but since they won t people have no reason to try on their smurfs if they don t want to
that was built in pcs as well kennen eventually becomes an unkillable side lane win condition which ap kennen can t do it s something that should be explored more in some games i think
it s legit but it s mostly into these zzz lanes kennen into sion or most tanks really is an i don t kill you you don t kill me type of lane so what he is doing here is just going for a scaling build that can let him get out of lane with higher resists for later teamfights and since kennen already has to maintain relatively short range he is usually in position to oric hs think about it as something similar to how when klepto existed kennen could just use it into tank matchups to accelerate his scaling with gold gains demonic is not something i would go but i can t say i know how good the hp to ap conversion is with the hp bonus of hs
another day another aram build not on kennen tho leaks out lmao
1mil mastery kennen here trying this build in tank lane since week ish very good into sion malphite because those lane are usually zzzz you can stack a lot of hp early with grasp and have ur heartsteel fast make u stack it fast on those tank to with demonic u gain a lot of ap back people don t know how to deal with you because of how tanky you are some very high elo otp kennen are trying it to in malphite matchup and it work well
can anyone link me to the games that hs kennen was played in tried searching but no luck
sounds like that nightmare teemo build when your team has no ap and teemo decides to take grasp and buy heartsteel
demonic on ranged is always trolling
well i just saw him shot jinx in 1v so there is really potential i guuess lmao
it works on a few short ranged champs who play can play in melee range karma and graves are two others who can effectively use heartsteel and commonly opt for it in arams since kennen is short range and his e requires him to go through someone to get the stack for passive he gets within the required range for hs to proc during the time window he gets his stun off should your average soloq kennen build hs probably not but someone who is pro level and knows how to play within the short range required for hs to activate can definitely get decent value from this build
it makes me so happy when actual on air talent from major leagues comments on threads like this no armchair analysis this is the real deal p s your casting is goated keep it up
ad kennen isn t considered because it s too squishy then
i think demonic works because of the hp conversion probably a very good efficient ap item
a lot of these tanky ap ad builds work because titanic sunfire and demonic convert the hp into dmg
it gets pretty wild late game demonic titanic sunfire all scale really well with health so it makes sense to build demonic out of times if you get hs
i miss klepto
here s the pcs game with cfo v fak https://youtu.be/zhugz3mgbnc?t=14701
if you re building it for burn its trolling if you re building it because its giving you well over ap due to hp scaling then it can be fine swain is the most obvious example because he infinitely scales his hp anyway but heartsteel emulates the same idea if you re able to safely farm enough procs on the item because you re against a champ like sion with little to no kill threat then you re able to reach a point where both heartsteel and demonic become incredibly slot efficient it seems situational but not completely troll
seem like tank ekko diana level there
that s because jinx doesnt build shieldbow in competetive just the sheer idea of building it triggers pros when realistically it protects you against your main counters
i encountered an ad twisted fate top one trick doing this as well it appeared crazy powerful at two items botrk heart steel
thanks i ve not been feeling great recently so kind words go a long way right now
against something like malphite he stacks are incredibly well so this gives extended trading power whilst also stopping malphite from going full armour
yeh but i am thinking about it as a compared to other options kinda deal how much hp does he has by the time demonic appears is it better than getting something like zhonyas that sort of thing
yeh but usually there s still a damage hit to the champion and the conversion may still not be enough to compensate the tankier build which is why not everyone could build sunfire and become op e g yasuo and yone could go sunfire and people complained about it but it sucked in comparison to other items and they would be stronger just going normal crit
jinx is usually picked as a hypercarry in pro play so she needs to go full damage or else the team won t be able to kill anything similar concept to protect kog maw comps
you ve been killing it on the lpl cast
zhonyas is a purely defensive item because kennen always needs to be a back line threat he is not incentivized to build this as much as he used to be zhonyas with heartsteel is too low damage imo
protect kogmaw the one that goes shieldbow shieldbow outscales kraken on hypercarries lategame and the sooner people realise this the better
true and with proto not being in the item pool there s not many super good core items left to pick after mythic imo for a build that has an hp mythic like i said i don t know how good the build is i just understand the logic behind why it got used and how it could work
kog doesn t build a mythic till 4th 5th item usually if he builds it earlier he s going a tank mythic for survivability
ok you are being disengineous here kog maw can get absurd damage to the point he mostly needs to focus on not dying and he isn t even playing with mythic items for most of the game he builds shieldbow or just mythics in general super late in comparison to any other champ usually picking the mythics as 3rd or 4th item and basically inting himself if he picks it as 1st and okish as second there s literally games he doesn t even gets to pick a mythic because game ends and some games where you can just ignore mythics altogether him building botrk guinsoo or botrk runnan is the equivalent of going kraken galeforce offensive marksmen items on other adcs except unlike other adcs his spikes and his overall damage is not as dependant on a crit mythic he has the luxury of choosing kraken gale or shieldbow and even jaksho depending on what the player needs because his mythic slot has been open since pretty much the start other scaling adcs like kai sa jinx sivir will suffer a heavy penalty going shieldbow in the 1st or 2nd slot or not even going any mythic pre 3rd item and probably put themselves in positions where they are losing because of shieldbow so it doesn t matters how good your shieldbow scaling is which i doubt it is if you are paying the shopkeeper to grief for the first mins and set yourself back by the time he is about to get mythics 3rd or 4th item he has enough damage that he just needs to focus in not dying because he will still deal a lot of damage unlike jinx he doesn t gets some insane ms boost in the middle of fights to be able that could enable him to kite enemies if he isn t blown up like a doll if we are using kog maw as the benchmark of oh shieldbow scales better why don t other scaling adcs do it then why do other adcs not go jaksho since it s obviously op and other adcs are dummies for not picking it adcs are dummies for not following in the innate hp damage shredders like vayne or kog maw who have damage up the wazoo
i don t play adc so this may be wrong but kog maw has built in on hit damage and slightly less mobility and peel built into his kit so shieldbow becomes more necessary on him jinx needs the extra true damage from kraken slayer because of her lack of built in damage both are late game hypercarries but require different levels of protection from itemization team comp because of their kits
kraken does not help you kill tanks lategame it is a snowball item meant to be a strong one item powerspike on adcs you still struggle to kill tanks without ie ldr no matter the mythic and sometimes you need bork as well on jinx shieldbow gives same damage as kraken and trades the little spits of true damage to lifesteal and a lifeline shield the same lifeline shield that is currently meta in the mid lane on most mage picks
except kraken gives more as thereby increasing your damage
the as increase is little on your rocket launcher which is where your main scaling damage
i m too busy most weekdays to watch during the week i fully intended to watch all c9 games this split but during weekdays i just can t do it i get off work and either have too much to do or i just forget i ended up watching like two or three matches the entire weeks of the regular season split
dogshit but we all knew it would be when it was announced reality is for right now vct americas is a bigger priority for riot than lcs so they re going to get the best times since they share the space
i still prefer it i get off work and can watch some lcs games and my weekends are completely free i m much more likely to watch lcs on weekday evenings rather than actively watch games on weekends i don t want to spend 3pm to 8pm saturday and sunday on lcs games i m much more likely to be busy on weekends than a thursday night
as someone who lives on the east coast and works from home i thought it was perfect i watched more lcs this split than i have since
the time is fine for people on the east coast but is way too soon for people on the west coast
i might get to catch a couple games after work depending on if anything needs to get done when i get home which there is
i live on the east coast and i hate it im too busy during weeknights to watch sure the finals are on the weekend but i havent watched any games except for a few playoff matches so im not invested at all i ve been watching ever since season and this is the first year where i just dont give a damn any more
it s fucking terrible and i m someone who makes their own work hours they need to move it back to like est the eu viewers they intended to accommodate are obviously not showing up
i work 6am 2pm im able to watch all the games and still have my weekends free i hope they mix up the schedule tho having c9 never play last a single time kinda sucks as i miss their games if i dont rush home
it s horrible it used to give me and my wife something to look forward to on the weekends it became a ritual of sorts grab takeout couple beers or a bottle of wine and watch a few games we watched at least once a week most weeks for last two years this year we have watched like three games i love the current 100t team but the timeslot sucks it s so hard to not get spoilers especially for the playoffs and watching sports in n vid format is just fundamentally different imo sucks because it s the only spectator sport my wife has gotten into we will still probably watch but less then a quarter of what we used to
the schedule work for the no life university student better than the old one my friends aren t busy on the weekends so i won t watch lcs on the weekends but i have absolutely nothing g to do everyday from
pretty bad tbh i never watch the pre show and almost always watch vods which basically means i never watch the filler content which is actually decent this year so i m missing a bunch of content and most of the show because pure vod watching
if they had left the start time at noon like first planned lcs woulda been dead to me the move to made it semi watchable so i kinda keep up with it but i was significantly less motivated to watch the regular season when i got home and the stream is halfway done and all the teams i cared about already played i have no issues with the week day thing personally i was actually an enjoyer of monday night league when that was a thing but i just think the time causes alot of hype to be lost so its less appealing i dont know if this would work scheduleing wise for players and orgs but i would love if they pushed it back a couple more hours and did wednesday friday have games wednesday thursday and then friday cause you can go a bit later but ill admit that does have its own other slew of issues but it woulda been ideal for me haha
i dislike it i often miss the first game which is coincidently the most hype one because i m getting off work school and i can t watch them until i get home i assume it s even worse for people on the west coast who have multiple games during work hours i also miss the lcs on weekends i always had something to have in the background while doing whatever
it was much easier to set aside a few hours on a saturday sunday to watch i really don t care what time it would be on but on weekdays it s on at the only time to be inconvenient enough to not be watchable with chores errands adulting needing to be done from like if you want to sleep
as a west coast fan the games start at 2pm tbh its pretty annoying to catch the games since i m at work if they started at 5pm that would be perfect i like having my weekends back tbh if the games are gonna be on thu fri which i don t really mind i dont care if the games are at or seeing as im at work anyways
i don t like it i wish it was still on weekends at least the finals will be on weekends but i miss watching lcs on the weekend i can t catch most games live as someone in california and the vods are annoying to find because they re late or you can easily spoil the result while looking for them
i think it s telling that finals are on the weekend and not in the thursday friday slot perhaps has something to do with viewership being higher on weekends
i know it doesn t help stream numbers or anything but the subreddit loleventvods has all the games and i feel like i use that more now that watching live
absolutely hate it and i get a three day weekend so i am fortunate enough to be able to catch friday games absolutely zero reason it shouldn t on be on the weekend
i liked it because i ve been working remotely but now my company is returning to office so i ll only get to watch the last game of the day next split
i have a job i m going to end up watching streams or not at all
as someone who is in the ideal situation l i loved the time slot and days though i am on the east coast and work from home having lcs on thursday and friday was great to chill with after work and then not feeling like i am throwing saturday and sunday away watching both lec and lcs back to back but again i m in the ideal situation
has been great for south america get home from work and put some matches in the background but yeah na fans got fucked by riot and valorant
i barely tuned in to games on the weekend other than when my team played because there s a lot of other stuff i d rather be doing they re playing while i am at work now so i watch a lot more lcs than i have in a long time
it s odd that apparently this is the best time for viewership yet the semis and finals are at the old time slot
lets put it this way i don t blame clg nor tsm for leaveing riot showed this is a secondary product to them now and any time that is nt on the weekends is totally unacceptable
i miss watching it on the weekends it was my sports since i don t like real sports i miss dash and don t really understand why he had to go unless they expect valorant lol and wanted him there for that format is meh so i m hoping the rumor about copying lec format next year is true apart from that prolly the least interesting region to watch rn for me lec is exciting lck has snooze fest drafts but there have been plenty of upsets which is nice same as lpl
you could have just looked into the threads and videos about the change back when it happened it s been negatively received since it was first announced they time changed in the hopes of grabbing more eu viewers even though eu personalities and players have spent years trashing on lcs and saying it s low quality games and stream people claim viewership is down period but between this na teams drama riot desperately pulling dash back out feels pretty grim
i wish they had stuck with the originally planned earlier time
on west coast i prefer the new times on weekdays i can catch some games while i am working or need a break and almost always get to watch last games which are often past good thing with it not being on lec days makes it so much easier to pace
unpopular opinion but i like it a lot fills my time on thurs and friday which makes the work week have something to look forward to i turn on the streams while i work out after work so it has been motivating me to go to the gym and i have my weekends free now previously it was more difficult cause weekends events would fully take up my time but usually on weekdays after work i can half watch it while doing some other activity like working out
i m on the east coast and can race out of work to be home by 5pm thank god i don t hate thursday friday except really important matches being on a thursday is a little strange c9 vs fly winners finals for example i feel bad for west coasters lol
overall decent split for lcs games wise i really disliked the new direction for the desk feels unorganized and no one filled dashs shoes adequately casting is also worse i really dislie the eu bring on a random person model and hate that they tried it in na bwipo jensen revenge i honestly cant think of a guest i enjoyed thursday is absolutely garbage i dont mind friday but definitely like watching league on saturday sunday with lec being boring ive just watched a lot less pro league i wish we had lck schedule i found winter split to be unwatchable i just didnt care and when i did tune in the games were as messy as lcs i think next season i am going to just switch fully to lck and lpl the production is amazing for both being more invested in teams prior to their playoffs would make them even more insane
i m on the eastern side of the country so the new broadcast fits my schedule pretty well especially nights where c9 played around perfection however i understand i may be in the minority here
i have to work i watch the highlights and if the highlights look hype i might watch the full vod it s not the same tho
i love the new schedule i can watch more games than before
it s okay i watch less b c i m more consistently doing other stuff on weeknights and before i would at least catch like all of the sunday night games but that s mostly b c of my personal schedule i m sure for some peoples that s reversed
i honestly love it the work week goes by fairly fast because i can watch the games during the week it gives me something to look forward to when i get off work and am home during weekdays it also frees up weekends so i can do other things i don t need to watch live and i just stay off reddit to avoid spoilers
works great for me east coast finish work at 4pm chill for a bit and tune in at 5pm i ve caught basically all of the games unless i have something going on in the evening
a weird work schedule made it a bit annoying for me but we an east coaster with a 4ish work schedule even with my schedule being a bit wonky this split it worked out pretty well
works out fine for me on the east coast gave me something to look forward to on the weekdays after work so i watched every clg game this split but with my team dumped into the trash i probably just won t watch
my wife has been very annoyed that i watch league during the week i still do most of the time but it hasn t been very good for my relationship
lcs cares more about european viewership than north american fuck lcs it deserves to die
has been great for eu probably not the comment you want haha
doesn t matter i watch via vods anyways tsm slowly lost its status over the years putting together consistently weaker and weaker teams with every split to potentially disappear now i lost interest in lcs when they crossed the not a contender for the title team roster line and it s been downhill from that point on after bjerg left everything went to sht
awful
i like it a lot and viewership is up dunno why people are saying it s so bad
see that s what i thought but i ve got a friend who insists there s nothing wrong with the times and keeps telling me i m the only one who cares about it i was starting to wonder if it s all in my head
no no that simply isn t the case because riot said so
yea the time was great for work from home sucks for others though
it isn t really fine for east coast as well if i wasn t working from home i d miss at least the first game every lcs day
nah it s too late in est but they get around that by usually having the shit teams last
yeah but if they make c9 play last you d have to mute the audio during c9 matches since it would be letigress casting
right my friend went on and on about how much better the weekday slot is then said i just don t understand why it s on weekends for finals riot knows when prime time is but unless it s finals lcs doesn t get that slot
i love their funny moments videos at the end of each week
interestingly i have the opposite problem there s absolutely no way i could possibly watch while at work so now i m screwed
right it s almost like riot knows what the better timeslot is but unless it s finals lcs doesn t deserve that slot
the problem with searching through old threads is exactly that they re old i found plenty of stuff from december and early january but couldn t find much recent i figured now that spring split is about over i d ask how people are feeling
i was asking specifically for opinions on the time that the games air live it s a very different time this year and i m wondering how the community feels
i do wonder how that has worked out for them europe has spent the last decade telling everyone what a joke na is why would anyone in eu want to watch our games
if you re an lcs fan i m happy to hear your answer regardless of where you re located
unfortunately i think your friend is on some major strength copium the games start while most people are still at work or in traffic lol
does he have a job or what s his work schedule and time zone i m in the east coast i can rush home just in time to catch the first game west coast would be screwed though
the reality is that the majority of league players and viewers in na are on the eastern half of the country only cali has a significant population of league players but they are a tiny portion of the overall na population so the shift in time had much less impact on the overall population since at 5pm est most kids teens and adults are out of school work and can watch with no conflict
i really don t think missing a single game is something worth saying the entire system is flawed it s not realistic to be able to have everyone everywhere be able to watch every single game live please grow up
there are definitely european lcs fans lol including myself die hard c9 lcs fan despite being from eu for me lcs was the first league i happened to catch back in and c9 was one of the teams playing i just chose them and stuck with them there are definitely some eu fans that watch so they can troll na fans in twitch chat and shit all over na but they re probably the vocal minority
yeah lcs fan and also has helped me get into valorant as well which imo is overall great for na esports as na are actually good in that game i think if more league fans tried it they would love it
we re east coast he has a job but he can watch from work while i can t i get home in time to watch but i ve had a long day and by the time i get home i ve at least missed game
i said at least the first game meaning there are days i d miss up to possibly also i think i have a relatively short commute time plus i think i get out of work pretty early from the days i ve worked overtime there re larger amounts of traffic between hours after the time i get off work so if say those people wanted to watch lcs they d be missing games every time this is all anecdotal of course so i don t know how many people are actually affected from the east coast so yes while it is true the expectations shouldn t be that everyone should be able to catch every game i do think if a significant portion of your largest viewerbase is missing out on potentially half of the games and let s be real the first half are the anticipated games because less people care about orgs like imt dig ggs is cause for concern especially when the main goal was stated to be trying to increase viewership
i mean a sizable population misses all the game even the most optimal population the east coast generally misses at least one game potentially that s not even touching on the fact that it s in the middle of the week there s a reason the nfl doesn t have to many wednesday night football games
part of the problem is that the league administration likes to have expected hype matches to lead off the day and then shuffle the basement later there were game days this split and of them led off with at least one team from the summer finals absolutely none featured dig imt or gg c9 played eight of their eighteen games in the first slot of the day never ending the day and summer runners up 100t only did once e to clarify 100t only ended once they started six times
well there you go it s a classic example of it s not a problem if it doesn t affect me
at least for lec i d say the games normally get progressively more interesting with the first match being kinda negligible
lec puts the best matches later in the day while lcs does the opposite to allow eu viewers to tune in
ten years is long enough in any profession but ten years being at the absolute pinnacle of a game like league is another level of impressive
editing goes crazy on this one
i got tired of skt winning all the time back in the day but faker resurging after a close as hell finals last year and taking a 4th title on the 10th anniversary of his 1st would be neat
https://youtube.com/watch?v=h-h3aqd7fbw to this day my favorite worlds hype video showing faker as the goat and it was made years ago unreal what s he s done in the league scene
g o a t
god legend without hesitation
banger
it s crazy how he improved over the last years and does play one of his best seasons afterball this years
they included the faker tumble these madlads also probably one of the only times where celebrating years is actually warranted
removed
without hesitation
last year had storylines so incredible that it made choosing a team to cheer for an absolutely agonizing experience in the end i think we had the best outcome where i would have been more sad that drx lost than i was sad that skt lost it will be hard to come up with a narrative that is any better than t1 winning worlds this year
source nothing but my salt and my ever enduring envy

sometimes users make them the mods don t make post game threads though it s another group of people
id say baus is a pretty good top laner it depends on your playstyle i guess
i d say it wasn t really the item reworks as much as the durability patch mainly because it made lethality such a dogshit stat it gets outscaled extremely fast if you aren t snowballing a lot especially because you need levels for it to be any good and to have experience you need to be ahead at least even
i think they need to make a whole new item overhaul literally scrap all the core ideas from this one such as mythic and start over keep some of the good parts but scrap the main ideas
qiyana went through nerfs then durability patch happened not only was the game tempo slowed down considerably everyone has armor everyone has massive hp pools you just need to dump more mana more rotations and most importantly more time to get the same results champs like qiyana lost their threat sustained damage is needed but she s got mana issues so you need tear but you need the damage to trade and people are tankier safer so you now lose or go even on most trades and are relegated to farming through endless qs at the wave until and mayyyyybe ult to make them burn flash and back or play literally anything else that scales or atleast can build into bruisery things like riven irelia olaf not to mention they do more damage solution the damage to resource usage just isn t there the threat of scary assassin just isn t there it s nice to not be blown up right away but they could probably use a little more threat i think the scaling idea in qiyanas aspect is cool if it feels like actual scaling perhaps they could include more scaling armor pen like lethality baked into ability levels rather than items that way bruisers and tanks can t just pick up x new item and use it at a higher base damage and assassins can still keep up with the 3k hp mage sitting on a shield from seraphs they got to safe farm not saying mage itemization is in a great spot either however
kind of hard to get value out of champs that revolve around basically one shotting when it s extremely difficult to one shot in this meta almost every mage gets upwards of 3k health with a hp shield thanks to roa and seraphs so one combo ing them is impossible unless you are giga fed and ahead assassins just suck ass right now you get more value by building bruiser on them because you can stay in a fight longer and actually do some damage
i feel like my issue with assassins is that they are just such a bad map class with intended lethality builds if you draft properly they have no good targets to assassinate and they are not good at taking neutral objectives towers or controlling areas in my mind what champs like qiyana bring to the table is the root and the ult khazix value is in the invis and the massively wide slow all champs that are pure burst or pure stat check damage with nothing else going for them just don t feel valuable to me if you want pure damage pure stat checks there s lots of skirmishers and fighters who do that better what do assassins provide the composition that makes them unique
its easy to solve this issue for ad assassins give them the pyke treatment make their skills scale with lethality no more assassins going bruiser
i mean of course this is true you barely get any lethality level while the squishy gets armor per level it doesn t feel great to build post dirk and rarely post mythic when snowballing
i mean it was even worse before the durability patch because if assassins didnt build bruiser items they would get blown up just as fast so even before they could blow up anyone first
almost every mage gets upwards of 3k health with a hp shield thanks to roa and seraphs is alost every mage really building roa seraphs i only really see that on a handful of them most seem to still be going ludens liandrys
almost every mage gets upwards of 3k health with a hp shield thanks to roa and seraphs so one combo ing them is impossible unless you are giga fed and ahead mages got more survivability tools because they were getting oneshot now assassins are bad because they can t oneshot the mages honest question how do you balance this sort of thing seems like you always just have to pick one or the other
this is what happens when you redefine assassins midway through the game but don t even bother to rework or think it properly they are defined by high mobility with one shot potential if you can t then you are useless they used to be good early one shotty high mobility with insane snowball potential that transitioned into a duelist splitpusher bruiser they were meant to roam skirmish and finish the game fast but still had a purpose beyond oneshotting by pressuring sidelines they could fight most toplaners since they essentially killed snowballing current snowball is nothing compared to before and splitpushing was greatly nerfed the game essentially forces you to group every 3min they were only left with one shot
yeah but pyke also does not damage either
i d say that making the lethality level scaling a bit more forgiving could be an option although it would run the risk of affecting the snowbally side a bit too much as well other than that make more better armor pen options serylda s passive is basically just utility ldr and mortal reminder are for adc so making a new armor pen for assassin more burst oriented could be good something like the old duskblade maybe with the little execute dmg on it this way you d be able to keep the snowbally side at bay by keeping lethality the fine snowball option it currently is while adding a new avenue for ad assassins to deal with the massive scaling armor numbers
maybe that s the case but personally playing kha zix before durability felt much better mainly because it was much easier to burst people off early and snowball off of that i ve felt this with sylas as well before the durabilty patch i already felt like full glass cannon sylas was the best option but since the durability patch it just feels more risky because you can t always 1shot people with just combo which you ll generally be able to throw out before people start attacking you anyway tldr as an assassin if you can do more dmg you are satisfied doesn t matter you also take more
at least that was arguably more fun of high risk reward game play and it gave optional playstyles
basically almosr every midlane control mage builds roa into zhonya into other defensive items swain veigar asol ryze sylas anivia cassio tf obv kassadin you understand that by building roa seraph they get hp and a minimum shield of like how assassins are even supposed to kill a mage with those stats
it mostly boils down to itemization and the terrible item design they have done you make squishys choose between survivability or damage instead of inflating all damage items with hp shields or making the defensive options far too good offensively old seasons barely had offensive defensive items they were all mostly one or the other e g adc used to build banshees veil mr hp ga ar mr or randuin hp ar as defensive options you also have the option of going back to making assassins good early with great snowball potential that transition into a duelist splitpusher instead of the current game state everyone is too tanky enchanters are too op can t kill anyone near them my adc just got oneshot to zed ult and an auto everyone is too tanky
pen based on total hp i think could be a great rework for lethality makes it less impactful for targets with lower hp pools ie adcs have less pen applied and won t get one shot however tanks and champs who build tank items will have more pen applied but they have bigger hp pools any how and will still require many more rotations biggest issue would be getting ah in line for burst champs like assassins so they don t get to miss rotations and hit you with another one while there is supposed to be a window to punish them edit alternatively build scaling lethality to assassins skills will also open up build paths

fantastic video from lcs had me tearing up gl to prince and fly this weekend hopefully they find their footing
first of all fucking love the drive series i remember one of the first ones they did with akaadian was so cool glad they kept making them second of all prince dad even though he is my son i look up to him this video was too much man i didn t wanna feel today
prince s dad is too cool man i think it really can t be understated how powerful it is to have a father who can offer constructive criticism while still knowing the game i can think of many friends i grew up playing sports with and going to tournaments with parents who either give really generic advice that isn t helpful or they get so caught up in the details of the exact scenario a mistake was made he clearly has a sharp understanding of the game there s pretty heavy nuance between saying aphelious inted here vs aphelious galeforced and ulted too early and should ve known azir had stopwatch but instead of nitpicking he finds a way to frame his advice in such a constructive way you went in too early but this will be a good moment to learn from
how is riot going to curse prince like that
the bit from prince s dad about how drx was destined to win all along and sandbox was their first prey that was poetic it felt like an acknowledgement of what makes competition cool you get all of these storylines happening at the same time running parallel intertwining and crashing into each other it all happens at such a scale that you really can t get in any other form of media prince s fall was also drx s legendary rise but you can always try again
prince s dad watches all five lcs games x200b jesus christ i wonder what he thinks when he watches dig vs imt
this was freaking amazing major props to the lcs content team for putting up fanatic content this year i was already a prince fan in lck but now i am even a bigger one thanks to this the relationship between him and his father was amazing i really want to see prince and flyquest do well get this man a support pleaseeeee
while watching i was hoping to see a reaction clip from his dad to the prince meets doublelift clip i and many others felt so many emotions already without even knowing much about prince imagine seeing the reaction from the person who knows more than anyone how much that moment must have meant to prince e prince drive released on his birthday what perfect timing
supporting parents always make me emotional great video once again really happy they brought drive back
that s very cute
you can t agree to release this type of content and then not bench eyla immediately let him go to msi come on ssong
drive never fails to deliver another banger
cool to see how invested his dad is and showing his understanding of the game
congrats to golden guardians on the and making their first finals then
really proud of ggs for making msi
prince with the eyes on curse rip
this was amazing ty whovever made this
probably one of my favorite drive pieces so far love the story telling they show between prince and his dad we need more supportive parents in the esports scene and the amount of emotions he feels when prince plays melts my heart
drive literally never misses i wish there were more of them but it probably takes a long time to make them so good this was even better than the contractz one last split
i hope prince stays in lcs for a long time great player great personality and has respect for the league
it s impossible to not love prince
imagine a big showmatch with as many pro player parents as possible lol i bet there has to be a few who are pretty decent
looks like the lcs gave prince plot armor for this weekend
amazing video started tearing up at the end the relationship between prince s dad and him was so powerful and it reminded me of faker s story and how his dad supported him throughout his whole career
it s kinda cool how he does the son heung min pose thing son also has mentioned that his dad was his coach when he was younger and trained him because he said that if son wanted to be a professional footballer he should do it properly him and his dad moved to germany and had to learn a whole new language and adjust to a new culture and basically trained their asses off his dad trained with him everyday until he could finally play in the bundesliga i don t know if this is why he does it but prince and his dad reminds me of this x200b you can also tell how much it hurts for his dad to talk about prince getting knocked out last year why is my face wet
what an awesome dad not only understanding his son s passion but going the extra step and supporting it in such a way
you mother fuckers made me want to root for flyquest correction prince s dad made me want to root for flyquest
one of the best drive pieces lolesports has done
until this video i never considered that we may have reached the point where a significant percentage of today s parents enjoy video games if we re at that point then we will start to see more and more of these types of parents who not only understand the games their children are playing but are excited to see them play it and want to participate in some way i still think going pro is such a ridiculously small percentage to happen that parents need to control how many hours their children play video games but that doesn t mean parents can t use video games as a shared hobby to bond with their children and teach valuable life lessons shared hobbies between parents and children is such a powerful opportunity
still wish he could ve stayed in lsb tbh lsb would ve looked super scary and could ve broken into msi with prince if they were lucky imo and then have good momentum for summer but with lsb being broke it basically guarenteed that would never happen world class player just unfortunate that fq as a whole aren t performing well at least he ll still have a good chance into msi with fq
such a great video i really admire their relationship and resiliency flyquest fighting
best content i ve seen from the lcs in a while really felt the emotions and the build up the level of respect both prince and his dad have for each other is beautiful
nice video
i ve loved every drive video but i feel bad knowing now that prince will lose vs gg the drive curse is too strong
wait they had some shots of prince s dad watching some older games was that part live recorded which means this drive piece was planned from the beginning or was that part filmed after with acting trying to recapture those emotions
this was beautiful pls lcs make more of these tel the stories of these players
prince s dad reminds me of richard williams venus and serena williams s father this is a really cool documentary
anyone know where i can find the sweater he s wearing in this
who would you guys want on your team berserker or prince
mid player berserker is clear
i enjoyed the video but why not make it about someone whos been in lcs for more than a split
nice video but why is ssumday in the thumbnail instead of prince
fuck this made me tear up a little it s so wholesome seeing prince s dad be so supportive i am a hardcore huhi fan i wish both teams could win
princes dad is the goat
damn it now i gotta root for prince lets go kid
watching this was great will be exciting to watch if they make finals vs c9 to see what happens want him to succeed but i want the defending champions w let s go c9
god damn how can you watch this and not cheer for him to lift a trophy
oh man at first i was rooting for gg to win cause i love the underdog story but after watching this i want gg to win but i don t want prince to lose i envy the father son relationship they have the dad seems so cool to have on your side supporting you
haven t had the chance to watch yet but i m sure it s a great piece and prince is very charismatic that said he s about to get long dicked by the golden boys stixxay is going to have his way with prince and it s going to be a spectacle by monday morning all of na will be calling stixxay daddy edit just watched prince s dad s reaction to ssumday s garen had me cracking up amazing video
daddiff
sleeping on the goldenglue one it is so good
it s a terrible day for rain
the akaadian and contractz one were so good i love this series
seriously the best kind of sports dad you can have didn t force his son into it but said if you re gonna spend this much time on this let s make it worthwhile and then he put in a ton of work on his own to be a useful coach i have never seen that before in esports but i doubt he will be the last
dw flyquest has already cursed prince with his support options
wasn t the curse only for the eyes on series
riot is going for a double negative content piece curse and prince being forced to play with the anchor of a support that is eyla
it was a bit of a gut punch to see lck release a celebration video of deft years today too
he probably thinks this is what peak league of legends looks like and it comes from north america
don t hate on imt they were fun to watch this split
honestly this video gives more context to how prince respects dl because i d imagine that dl was one of the players he would watch when he only had hours to play at pc bangs
the curse going strong
hopefully c9 doesn t get one for msi
if he has actual drive then surely he ll be out of there this summer and join a korean or chinese team
bin s dad would just call his son in again when he starts losing on tryndamere
dadyrus would carry
still think he s the best adc tbh just need his team to play around him also not lose prio in drafts his performance against c9 looked like what ruler looked like in jdg vs blg where he was only able to carry when it was a champ with the most agency and not put behind hopefully fq follow and lets prince have something more aggressive like kalista lucian zeri
the fly vs eg game that was only a month ago how long do you think it takes to produce something of this quality with interviews and shots from around the world
i like it s to be the former but it s most likely the later
neither put me in
story lines with hype player that just marketing prince is hype import
bc he s got a lot of fans already
they don t even have the same facial structure lmao
big dixxay
gg one is goated
contractz one last split was elite too
ik this is the lol sub but they did a similar thing for valorant and the episode for a player called bcj was one of the best esports features ive seen especially because the material is already so good for it even if people aren t into valorant i definitely recommend they check it out edit here is the video https://youtu.be/orzvytdypiw)
so fucking gigachad telling him to make notes and not play mindlessly if you re going to play at all
it got me thinking about how much of video game skill can be taught when someone is young
totally agree his dad is the goat as far as being supportive and not smothering there s tons of room to grow and respect for his son s decisions not to mention inspired smurfed that moment too
no winsome no worlds
if eyla runs it down on prince one more time i m convinced his dad will teleport across the world to punch him in the face and play support for prince himself
people have to understand that winsome having better results a month and a half ago doesn t mean he s better now most teams in the league were still finding their footing back when he was playing fly included if he was clearly better for the team you think the coaches and the players wouldn t know that before we reddit analysts eyla is sus vicla is too more than anything fly needs a plan in game besides just hands diff if they want to make it to finals
drive contractz was released august and they lost to c9 on august drive prince was released april and they play on april call me a conspiracy theorist but i think fly gg
you re right but i want to believe that drive curses you too
bolulu about to go nuts on the velkoz next split
if i smash my enemy laner and he just starts subbing in his fucking pro player son i wouldnt even be mad and just take the lp loss because that shit is hilarious
beef good pork good chicken good beefporkchicken goooooooood https://youtu.be/ky3kiiuk_d0&t=4m34s)
i agree but for some reason he looks a lot like ssumday to me here might be the hands blocking some of the face and the angle making his face look rounder
don t quote me because i can t be sure but i m extremely confident the team that produces drive also produced this series both are bangers as it turns out
lot of aau dads could learn from this tbh
my year old nephew was mind blown when i taught him the concept of having tempo in any game xd
i m so confused as to why they are not playing winsome with prince flyquest looks a hell of a lot better with winsome than with eyla
well look at the players that were on drive most of them aren t even playing anymore see it does curse you s
haha guys tryndamere went afk oh wait he s back oh no
i can definitely see that
yeah i assumed they did it would make sense to have a dedicated team for specialized filming and long form content like this or someone they go to even if it s contractor work though this stuff feels in house
imo possibilities eyla is playing better in scrims prince would rather play with eyla papasmithy flyquest promised eyla the starting lcs spot at the beginning of spring and doesn t want to go back on his word
to be honest we don t really know that didn t flyquest lose their last game with winsome i think other teams were figuring them out already
people were worried it was going to be another grig akaadian situation but it ended up being the opposite guess they should have left winsome in but hindsight is
they stated they missed the covenant missions and they would be coming later so they re here now
what are the rewards for the missions so far the first one gives be i want to know if they are worthy
be an emote and hextech chest key
thanks i would have prefered some kind of orb instead of the chest i m tired of getting champ shards or emotes i want skind shards
please say syke rn
that was hard to watch the dude never even tried to dodge
gets hit by xerath ult all times mans a walking magnet
dude stepping into xerath ult like it s some buff
oh that s why lucian has damage buffs in aram players like that i get it now
he could have actually won that if he tried dodging even a single bullet
in a way it s harder to get hit by all of them than to dodge them all
the literal definition of tunnel vision
he couldn t dodge just one jesus is he blind
lucian eating xerath ult shots like it is a soup kitchen
he could have autod the minions and probably lived too this was painful to watch
lucian didnt do a single thing correct lol
title should be a lucian with brain activity tried to backdoor vs a xerath and a caitlyn
ammmm why the turret is not attacking lucian
xerath and jhin in aram is so fun as long as you have a frontline they can wreck so much face
my man can t dodge for the sake of his life wtf
if you dont let minions end the game in aram then you arent playing for fun
gj cait
peak na moment lucian sniped by police officer caitlyn for trespassing
didn t doge a single bullet what else to expect from someone hitting nexus in aram
sad things backdooring in aram not even bothering to try dodging one spell
deserved
xerath is so easy to dodge even without a dash
we care about your low elo
as soon as i saw the flash before lucian s dash finished i knew how this would end
this was painful he even has snowball which he could use to lazy mans dodge with on the minions
smartest aram backdoorer
how does such a random shitty clip get upvotes tells you all you need to know about the reddit community
he was planning on face tanking the whole thing cos he didnt take cait ult into account
xerath would have missed that third shot too if homeboy didn t walk straight into it
dude didn t even use passive after e lmao
charge up
aren t you supposed to catch them
i think it s more like because vayne players changed to lucian step e into teamfight step die
cait ult can t be dodged s
he is one of those people who get tunnel visioned and rushed when they are doing something stressful like backdooring probably didnt want to even stop hitting nexus for even half a second
must be a spectator bug both nexus turrets are destroyed since lucian can attack the nexus itself
he might be a draven player
flash e they ll never expect it easy penta
oddly enough vayne has no changes in aram but unless the adc is called kalista they shouldn t get buffs to begin with imo kindred has buffs that make akali jealous when i get kindred i get happy means i get at least a penta or per game every single adc except kalista is broken on aram
okay then how about other shots of xerath s ult insert woman showing papers to grey cat here
ohhhh okay riot spaghettie s
defo not my impression in my pov all of adc s are turbouseless in comparison to basicly every other role in aram _  _ x200b have you ever had tanks bruisers in the enemy team you destroy them until and then they just steamroll you over and over and over and over again und you basicly cant do anything about it
enter ashe adc
vayne doesn t need changes because she sucks ass while still dealing decent damage a vayne with items can do something but before that she s worse than kayle playing lategame champs feels bad in aram
woosh
they re not bullets
i was nasus with a braum milio and renata swain they let me stack had stacks when game ended and a penta was just not killable funny game
rush botrk armor pen runaan always in aram when playing as an adc
i d say twitch and kog are real good in aram but the rest of the marksmen kinda suck
don t even need tanks just need shen not even a good shen pretty sure my shen winrate in aram is around and aram is all i play the moment he gets heartseeker it is over for the enemy team
twitch kog and kaisa are like the only b tier ones but only since you can flex them on ap ad the rest ist flat trash tier
definitely not my experience the adcs need a good team to go with them but when they have that they can absolutely demolish whereas bruisers tanks can slot into any comp basically
kindred is good if you re already good with the champ
riot wrote the lore in a way that they cannot resolve the lore without leaving the mains of half the player base salty or it might be too different from the actual game too many champion in league are written as the big bad
yeah an end end would probably never work i don t see a point in time when one bad could not rise up after the success defeat of another bad all they have to do is twinkle with timelines and they could produce a never ending story
your job is mainly to press e on people and save your stun for someone diving on your backline
i never do the flash backline tibbers because the damage is too low for shurelyas support annie in lane i e max and just shield and if our jungler comes i stun late game team fights shield spam and use ult if enemy team dives us or if we have a good engage on them
awesome i can t wait to watch my favourite na team participate in this cool format
good change but they need to start earlier in the year i dont like that lec finishes only 10days before msi
sounds fantastic to me honestly felt that lcs playoffs format were weird af same team playoffs like lck but the higher seeds have to play while the lowest seeds get to sit at home and watch the games and prepare drafts sounds like a disadvantage to me for the top seeds at least
now both the lec and lcs need to bring back game blind pick wtf shens
good change but still don t like how the second seed for msi is determined championship points based on both splits
really surprised they will switch to days a week spending more money on the lcs after switching days and letting lots of talent leave seems counter productive and the lcs would really really need to find more casters import as they are currently struggling with a day a week schedule format change would be a good thing though
people are commenting as if this is a knee jerk reaction but it isn t lcs wanted to implement this format for but got push back from enough orgs to postpone this isn t happening because lec made them look bad or showed the format was good it was just pushed a year because unfortunately org owners that won t be around this time next year pushed against it
good opportunity to bring back dash
lec format change is great but i wish they d go back to two splits tbh extend spring and summer a bit and leave the bo1 bo3 bo5 format
to answer ur question why we ve had dogs hit format for years riot didn t want to go with the mainstream format and bo1s were easy to sell to traditional sports folks like nba teams etc lol was massively popular years ago and even with shit format people still watched it was only until last year when lcs took a massive hit in viewership they started to think differently lol esports higher ups didn t want to admit their ideas are bad until rise of lec proved them otherwise
wow this one move actually made me so excited for next year it s going to be hype congratulations to lcs for listening to the fans better late than never
timestamped youtube link if anyone prefers that https://youtu.be/7l2wcpxzc5q?t=7983
if this is true it speaks to how much of a resounding success the new lec format is na is already adopting this new format after splits played the numbers must be really promising behind wonder if the orgs will have anything to say about this though
everyone complaining about bo1s being not representative yet a mere weeks of bo1 completely decides who moves on the rest of the split while the bad teams have to sit and wait for the next split to start not a fan
the question is who will participate in the lcs next year i could easily see a world where teams leave already rumored
wish that they had changed to lpl lck format instead it s a lot better but still an improvement over the current format
still not a fan of the winter split as much would prefer a week regular season rather than would go like weeks bo1s weeks superweek bo1s week break weeks bo3s playoffs i just think weeks instead of is better for the players mental
good to hear maybe the bottom orgs in lcs might have a resurgence like lec teams did
maybe controversial take but i m not a fan of this wish they switched to bo3 over days instead of cramming splits into one year also getting rid of live events for this format feels so much less hype and takes away from winning a split
the simple reason we had bad formats so long riot s ego they ve had every example in the world to prove to them their format was garbage but because it was people they don t like telling showing them its terrible pretty much any other esports dev out there they did the old head in the sand trick for a solid years there was this short period we had bo2s in eu and bo3 s in na but they still setup the format in a way it was boring and dragged out then blamed the bo series as the issue
after seeing lec play out i m not super hot on this format we still got meaningless games volatile mid year roster shuffling bad teams still getting rewarded for early year wins etc etc i think lpl still has the best format this format gives consistent teams an advantage but also leaves room for teams to go on hot streaks
weeks of bo1 single round robin bottom teams are eliminated so bo1s are more important than ever great team play offs suck too not looking forward to this shit
not a fan of these potential changes
wow i hecking enjoyed watching spawn and armut try to take the blow for the team and not let the other one be the scapegoat very sportsmanlike
sounds really great also getting the advantage of seeing any potential issues with the format during lec s first year with it and adjusting based on that is a good option for example not having a random ass break in spring split so there s a week of break before msi lol
sounds good i ve enjoyed watching the lec this year unfortunately games will still be on at pm on a weekday between two firesold teams playing whatever academy guys who d accept hotdogs in leu of money and the caster will spend the whole game doing a borat impression and talking in first person as cho gath but it s a start
there s always one or two na teams that struggle with visas at the start of the year rip those guys
i m excited for the bo3s but only having three weeks for the regular season seems pretty bad considering how bad visa issues tend to be had we done this this year gg wouldn t have made it out of the first round
only riot likes the current dog shit format
literally anything is better than the current lcs format but i honestly am not a crazy fan of the lec format i dont like an msi representative being picked so early such a shortened period of time for teams to build synergy before the first playoffs which determines an msi spot months away lol feel like it s certainly a positive but there are much better formats that could be created still excited to be going in a positive direction though
lec format is not better it s much higher variance which means bad teams can make it to the top just by being hot at the right moment bds and ast are top of the lec table rn if the season was played out like lcs they d be middle of the pack
while i really like the new lec format overall i hope the lcs doesn t just blindly copy it it s pretty clear that this is the first year of this format there are still a lot of small problems that shouldn t be all that hard to iron out over time i hope they address them because this format has the potential to be great
if riot was really serious about growing lcs they would adopt an lck type lpl format imo i see other leagues from all over the world i watch cblol pcs oce and almost all the others to some extent and playing multiple days during the week and weekend only seems to be an issue for na considering that lcs challengers has better times days it is no wonder lcs is struggling while the attitude remains the same with the lcs leadership changing to lec s format won t help start using the supply of good talent for broadcasts that is available instead of whatever you label the current selection process make content that doesn t feel like hs drama class projects between games and make a format that actually has some stakes to it yeah some matches of bo3 won t get much of an audience happens in any sport but it really isn t that hard to do better than they are bo1 s just feel like all involved are too lazy to make a real effort and i include the players in that as appropriate if they support that
i ll believe it when it happens
which days of the week would they even play wednesday friday doesn t change the fact that due to scheduling lcs is now bleeding view count with some games struggling to muster 40k viewers this will only get worse once clg and potentially tsm leave lcs
i don t know how i feel about this format in cblol the favourite teams to win the playoffs are loud and pain they were both in 8th and 9th during half of the regular season because they were having trouble with the roster changes both changed only the adc for a kr import if cblol had this lec lcs format both of these teams wouldn t be in playoffs at all not to mention that up untill the penultimate week every team still had a chance at playoffs even keyd who spent the entire regular season as the last place could ve qualified with some luck and out of all of these teams arguably only one team by the end of the regular season was considered a free win in my opinion this format is a side grade to the current format lcs will remain a joke with or without it
love the format in lec and while i think its obvious its stronger from the top down and has been for some time compared to lcs this is still the right move by the lcs the week b01 format into playoffs is just awful and not hype past the first week or two lec also had weak teams astralis bds sk and this format actually helped them
glad monte has returned to the league space he s always been by far the most intelligent caster analyst in terms of game knowledge and the last time he was ostracized from the community was really unfortunate he never deserved the bad press imo
please don t i really dislike the new format it sucks when you re a fan of the 9th 10th placed team you basically only have one week of bo5 s for me there s no playoffs hype cause of that the point system to decide who goes to msi if one team wins both splits is bad teams can t build synergy cause the splits are too short for me everything just feels way too rushed but i understand when people think differently
just go lck style
i just want to remind all of you of something ahem we could have had these formats all this time that also goes for the new msi and worlds formats that were finally changed just imagine how many amazing years we could have had league esports was still fun to follow but it could have been so much better i don t get why people aren t more pissed off about that
an hour in and not a single comment about monte is evil or monte is just trying to grasp anything for relevancy this is not my lol subredddit
lck format is much better in my opinion
also this year really makes you wonder why lol esports had to have such utter dogshit formats for years better late than never i guess cause riot only hires egolords for any positions that make decisions if you can name one time riot made a correct decision or one they didn t need to step back on i d love to hear it the company is actually so incompetent when it comes to league it makes one think its all intentional and someone at the company is praying it collapses or something
won t change the main issues before with lcs too many washed up imports and not enough home talent
best format we have in league imo
the ten years thing is so annoying yeah hindsight is but you think league was really thinking if bo3 for weeks was what a fledgling audience wanted
bold to assume there will be a lcs next year
now we just need one more international event or atleast a western tournament between na and eu two events a year feels real bad
wish that was good news any format that still involves bo1s is completely worthless
wonder what lec will change to that lcs will copy in
anything is better than the lcs cringe fest
surely they haven t made a decision about it yet waiting until the end of the year and seeing how the format plays out first is the logical move if you re looking to copy lec s format
thank goodness lec format is far superior to current lcs format single elim can stay for worlds but losers bracket and bo3 is so much more exciting for regionals
with the ever growing champ pool i still want to see in any series the winning team champs can not be picked or banned in remaining games of the series maybe even throw in all champs played regardless
can someone please else start leaking this info so i don t have to see thorin s stupid fucking face anymore
how unpopular is it hate this format i rlly don t like teams getting kicked out after rr
as usual lcs copying lec not really surprising
yeah this format is ass and will be the final push off the cliff and will kill lcs for sure bo3 sounds good on paper but the three splits where two feel like filler ain t it lec s viewership hasn t grown at all which is incredibly concerning considering the hype for a new format shouldn ve been able to carry it
the fact that this format is successful in viewership is so upsetting considering how bad it is but i guess league fans like it when they get the opportunity to watch less league next riot will have to start streaming subway surfers next to the live feed to keep zoomers attention
in terms of viewers the current lec format isn t doing too well compared to the old one that being said that could also be due to other factors
it s just too late and it s not like lec is seeing insane viewership numbers either stakes need be higher they also need to be clearer the focus has to be brought back to highlight the merit of teams and the holistic competitive environment riot once stated that they had the long term goal of achieving football like success https://www.gamesindustry.biz/riot-games-before-we-take-on-football-we-have-to-be-humble), but recently there have been many missteps i think it boils down to one thing success breeding complacency riot had a head start and a great vision going forward to reaching that goal but w after w just instilled complacency within the company and we are now seeing the effects of that neglect you can t tell me you want to compete with the biggest sport in the world when you can t get basic sports marketing activities right i e clarity of schedules venue announcements etc after years of trial error
might be too little too late at this point imagine having sole control of the biggest most popular esport for over a decade and wasting that potential on formats that are universally agreed to be trash we could have had more international tournaments double elim given teams more global exposure and appealed to a bigger audience etc instead we re in the time line where the status quo has been kept for so long that the original viewer base has aged out and nobody is replacing them lcs should just die already and it s best players teams should be consolidated into a bigger lec
removed
now do lck and lpl
incoming 20k viewers
lcs continues to desperately try to appeal to europe instead of catering to its own region
it s too late competitive league in na is dead
i thought no one liked double elimination because sports and upsets what changed
bo3 is hype but this is only one of the many holes sinking the na lol ship i haven t watched at all this year but it s been hard to be excited for na lol with all its issues hope this is the start of more exciting stuff to happen bring back relegation pls lol
so under this format the bottom teams just don t play for like months between splits
i understand that everyone loves this format but holy shit it s so bad i just hate the lec format so much it literally gives no team time to develop i can promise you that in no way shape or form this format is this going to be a good format for either region when it comes to worlds or msi you learn less over this period of time as a team because in the b01 time you can literally only play one style to win those games it s lots of cheese and it s just so rushed
i hope they do change a bit the format since i think it has a couple of issue obviously right now the scheduling is not ideal for the lec so i hope they make some change there for the lcs also after msi the gap till worlds is gonna feel so empty with only one short split which take about weeks compared to weeks so either put a fourth split or go with and extend the format
i just hope they don t have the useless breaks lec has and also sort out patch scheduling
hopefully this changes tsm minds about pulling out
tsm clg probably is giving riot a wake up call because i can promise you that if that wasn t happening the lcs wouldn t of done shit
removed
lcs ain t gonna be around next year
that s nice
i wonder how this will effect the fantasy lol market seems impossible to run a fantasy league with a week regular season
awesome now switch back to weekend evenings instead of during the week and i m back watching lcs
cant wait tsm vs clg
big w
better late than never hopefully there are lcs teams left to play by next year
yea please i love the lec format and i can t wait for the lcs to adopt it
thank god
too short imo
good for na
they should omit groups for summer split and have weeks of the non msi teams play a gsl bracket the msi teams can get a bye the next stage will be the usual team double slim bracket
so does this mean we are getting a winter split as well
they need to find the best format possible and stick with it lcs might need consistency more than anything right now feels like we ve been experimenting for half of the lcs s life span
teams could probably restructure contracts to only pay for length of season teams are active so if some 9th place org drops mil on an import that fails to get them to the 2nd stage team can off down the money tap manage expenses and incentivize these lazy pros
lol half the teams in na get stuck between 4th and 8th lol and only later on they then get better top teams are miles ahead majority of the splits
maybe a little late could have done it for summer but at least they are doing it i hope summer views aren t at an all time low cause man this spring is not doing too well it obviously doesn t help that there aren t enough good teams this year and that they are not putting in any effort to make the cast sound better no issue for me as i tend to listen muted anyways but for people who care about lol pro casting the lcs is difficult to listen to
na lcs can t figure shit out takes lightyears to find their format
very good very naisu
this is a good change if we weren t getting the lec format i was hoping riot would buy out clg tsms spots and just go back to an team league
changing the format for the 100th time is not going to make up for the horrible time slot on a weekday
sooo we gotta wait a whole nother year
i m not sure i like this for na considering how often things like visa issues happen not having your starter for the first two weeks is handicapping your team for almost half of the split
well thanks to reddit the image is so compressed that you can barely tell the difference look at the grass blades on bottom most images
im not sure but i think they also slightly changed the color of the status text in the client friend list
riot definitely did something to the bushes this patch you no longer get the old static bushes with very low environmental quality which is sad
i thought i was crazy
yeah i noticed them looking different but i thought it was my imagination
nice catch
damn so i wasnt going crazy i have everything on low and the top tribush doesnt even show up anymore like it has the bush effects but you dont see the grass and stuff maybe i need to check it with medium environment setting or sth
i m experiencing lower fps around bushes hope they revert it or make low environment setting work for them too
riot outsourcing artists isn t been working out lately definately regressing what s uncanny is some of the blades of grass repeating or being extremely parallel to each other
this is so boring my game drops from fps when i get close to the brushes i can only play in aram and tft now
never paid attention to the brushes besides acknowledging them existing so to me both versions look the same besides the middle pic with the different colour obviously
i knew it wqas differenmt
corporate needs you to find the difference between
they look different but i think they look better
deleted
yeah look like a plastic plant
immediately noticed this the green is lighter
they changed the ui for when you hover over your friends too it displays their rank in a different way i think and the amount of challenge points they have under it
yeah they did it looks kinda ugly ngl
yeah it s driving mad i like to have everything except the characters in very low so there s more contrast between champions and the environment also because too much effects distract me from the fight i find the bushes obnoxious
why are they outsourcing artists
are you saying they forgot ward indicators they have been in the game for a few patches now
riot got so cheap that they don t bother to hire anyone to trim the bush
and the red is redder
think i will get used to it and like it first i thought my screen brightness was off though
i kinda like it tbh the light green is definitely less relaxed than the old one but it s still more pleasing to the eye imo
well last time they started talking about trimming some bush they got slapped with a sexual harassment suit
kingstix on youtube or derfiddler on twitch are some good fiddle players imho
there was a bug recently on eu servers so it might be happening on na now
alot of missing information queue time all depend on your rank gamemode the higher elo you are the longer queue times are because there are less players if you ever see streamers live they can wait min for a game in challenger sometimes even a whole hour
did you try restarting the queue
everyone in na is challenger riot client has no bugs whatsoever
no one plays the game in na anymore not a lot riot can do at this point
in the most recent patch they removed auto fill so queues should be a bit longer could be a bug like the one in eu tho
ded gam
whenever this happens always try restarting your client there will sometimes be micro patches that prevent part of the player base from playing with the people who have completed the micro patch
gold its usually minutes
the way fiddle q passive is coded is that if the skill is cast while he is unseen it will trigger the fear he can buffer e while his ult is channeling and then it will fear everyone it hits
it probably is more of a time window for the passive programming as for the silence it only silences people but at the center of his e
reading on the fiddlesticks q passive its next damaging ability will additionally flee icon png fear targets hit for a duration his r is the damaging ability that only fears k sante how can his e also fear and not silence if the r has already feared thus procing q passive
ya this is a normal fiddlesticks mechanic
fiddle tech where you buffer e while unseen the fear still applies since it was buffered while unseen
its not only you kindred fizz aswell the only explanation i have would be that fiddle out of sight fear has a similiar grace period as rengar leap after leaving a bush could that be the cause
idk man it s pretty scary watching the replay can t imagine what the characters felt like
it s a thing with fiddle you can extend his fear range by buffering his e w only if you re in a brush and you can already use it on a minion for example iirc you can flash towards an enemy champions and instantly w for aoe fear even if you weren t originally in range of them with e if you use it while you re jumping in the ult it you can fear people hit with the e as well as your ult there s like a super small grace period to trigger his fear effect
riot wants you quit it s a sign
mmr and i don t know it s sincerely bullshit to raise your mmr and makes no sense i ve been at wr for a long long time and i still get laners in my game that are four divisions or more below me struggle to carry them if i fail i lose many points it is frustrating but there is no god so we re simply meant to suffer
i don t know but thank you so much for spelling lose right so awesome
just learn jungle it s easy
i can play any role but sometimes people don t want to play othwr roles you know
its your challenge points from tokens and shit its worthless so you can ignore it
they can finally triple ashe w cd and buff her q damage
any other unique buffs nerfs for champions technically yes like some infinite stacking champs like nasus and thresh get double stacks on this map ornn has a minute passive cd akshan revive technically has a cooldown shyvanna gets passive stacks from canons and enemy health relics qiyana can get water element from health relics and corki package is on a shorter cd off my head but those are more systematic changes ig
the nerfs or buffs were fun but yeah it s gotten too much when you re a nerfed champ vs a buffed champ it s worse than a permanent exhaust it makes no sense
give ashe w a long cd and remove her percent debuffs so she can actually play as an adc
thank the fucking lord i ve always maintained that aram with the modifiers is better than before with no modifiers but the system certainly has its flaws the new specific changes have some flaws in the sense that champions will feel more different from sr but considering this is a mode where you literally can t even pick your champion i think prioritizing the fun and balance of the mode is more important than keeping it slightly more consistent to sr
with the shaco only having boxes they need to limit teemo shrooms imo
they did these kinds of balance changes for dominion then claimed it was too hard to maintain so they completely stopped updating dominion at all then declared no one wanted to play the mode anymore so it s getting removed
these balance is great and all but some seem to affect the core of the champion though they change the duration of karthus passive but didn t change the indicator for ult in passive form so now if you ult too late you will just flat out lost your ult instead of having the skill being locked from casting
ashe w cd seconds
maybe they should mention that you can t wait until last second to ult in karthus passive now i thought my game had bugged
it s nice that they are finally doing this so many champions need more specific changes on aram i think that while this is a change they still should look at their other aram balancing a lot of aram problems are systematic rather than something that s easily fixed with balance changes they should look into letting champions have more passive health regen to mitigate poke a little and maybe making the lane wider or adding alcoves to allow players to spread themselves out a bit more they also really should just switch the percent damage dealt taken and flat stat changes to precent stat changes as it would be a strict improvement
ashe w cd kai sa w cd or just rework the goddamn cd refund mechanic teemo r damage to minion or can only triggered by champion add more terrain that are not blocking half the map like the turret thing but give more outplay potential for thing like zoe bubble zoe lost so much long range bubble spot after riot fix the bridge into a straight line x200b thank you
i cant wait for some bug at worlds to give a champion their aram cds instead of sr
we used to have these changes years ago but they stopped by saying they had to split the code from sr or something and it was too much work now that they are back to it it will indeed be better
we intend to do more of these as we get a better understanding of the effects they have on the mode
instructions unclear gave qiyana another damage so timmy in iron can have winrate on her too
riot karthus passive lasts too long also riot assassins should deal more damage while taking less damage imo they should fix their current aram balance buffs before they move on to specific skills
hope they nerf fizz don t know who mains him in the balance team but his buffs on aram are absurd and not needed
bring back sweeper or revert the nerfs to glaive and gut katarina playing vs teemo shrooms can be downright impossible sometimes and kat if played correct or if vs no easy hard cc is pants on head stupid i don t care that much about op champs so long as you can itemize vs them
i do still somewhat dislike the increase in differences between sr and ha but i do not see a better solution either it will just be annoying to have to play two different games where you have to adjust to part of a champions kit between the different game modes getting a feel for champions damage and cooldowns is simply such a big part of the game
if they re going to start putting effort i to balancing aram like this i d like to see them start developing an actual brawler gamemode like bloodline champions and battlerite
goes further towards alienating the champions than any aram balancing as of yet it s crazy that we had the perfect solution aram bans years ago and then riot removed it because people were mad their mains could get banned evne though they enlisted to play a random gamemode
still no nerfs to pyke i can t get around the fact that he is buffed in aram like i haven t seen a pyke do less than kills per game
thank the lord they re approaching nerfs through this now though it stings a bit that they tried it with tt but quickly abandoned the map
i wish they would scale back the balance changes a little bit anything having numbers that are too far from sr numbers makes limit testing in aram useless for applying the knowledge back to sr assassins shouldn t be as strong in a mode that s all about front to back teamfighting that s ok give people more rerolls if they don t want to play those champs or make changes to the map to make flanking easier
can we stop with the balance change in aram it make the mode worse than it was
bard is more than fine in aram in you go with an ad onhit build because of his massive buffs and range
talon mains on suicide watch
if they get rid of the nerfs and buffs then it s ok although i personally prefer not having aram specific balance changes
best way to balance aram is to make everything same as summoners rift
remove fiddle passive
wish they would just leave aram alone instead of balancing for the most casual of casual players
fuck aram balance team brainless and spineless used to be my favorite game mode the balance changes are atrocious asol and xayah are perfectly balanced meanwhile champs like ashe take more damage while doing less try playing ashe vs either of these perfectly balanced or buffed champs and you will see
i wonder how it would change balancing if more champs were allowed in aram currently less than of champions are playable in aram at any given time if they just opened the floodgates and allowed all i wonder how it would shake balancing
hot take but if riot is compelled to adjust some champs to such insane rates ashe veigar etc and willing to adjust them in aram alone while not giving us bans then just delete the damn champions from the mode they ve done it with urf in the past it s not unreasonable imo
the most important thing for riot to do in all of this by far make champion balance adjustments visible in champion select it was already bizarre that a casual aram player could pick a champion they are bad at think they ll probably be good in aram though right and then be stuck with a damage nerf with no way to tell beforehand now that they are adding more specific modifications it really really needs to be visible in client i m probably too late to this thread but hopefully they are working on it
way too much work the point of the changes on aram is so it auto updates itself with sr balance changes if you make an fixed change in aram what happens when a future patch adjusts veigar e in sr eventually it s going to double the balance team s work
what about banning heartsteel from aram tanks with this item become a bigger problem even with a adc building full anti tank bc theres other people there or just buff by a lot anti tanks items im tired of shens sions tanking tower shots and killing people with aa s
what i ve been saying for years but people always complain with riot doesn t want you to learn a new champion or change a champion yes this is the way and it obviously was since the start surprised it took this long for riot to figure it out why is nidalee buffed in aram because he winrate is bad even tough she has of the most annoying mechanics for aram traps and long range high damage abilities why isn t her q nerfed and she gets compensations elsewhere for aram list goes on ashe is probably the biggest example of this the champion is so nerfed because of her w spam build that any other build is useless why aren t the nerfs to w only increase cooldown reduce range reduce damage make her require an aa on enemy champion to be able to cast w so many possible changes on that note as well can something finally be done about aurelion sol e being the most broken ability in aram or how talon and bard e are a joke can we get a replacement ability for those maybe give bard e a skillshot that pushes back ally champions or enemy champions no damage and talon e a grapple hook or something maybe let him jump off the bridge https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n1uaz/now_that_talon_e_is_back_to_being_useless_in_aram/) at least now they are changing it this way it s something i guess
i just wish there was an alternate queue where champions had their real numbers and you just accepted sona had a win rate in the casual queue i never play aram because i don t feel like guessing how much damage is done
now remove akshan revive pyke r reset and fix hitboxes we gucci
hope they do something for ashe and mf so they can actually be playable as adc
they should stop with this crap aram is a fun mode since they started trying to making it competitive they are ruining the game we dont need a perfectly balanced aram
gut teemo shrooms they feel awful to play against in aram even with sweeper cannon
i just need bans
master yi can no longer buy duskblade
they better gut asol when these adjustments end up being well received
they broke karthus on aram he can t cast his r they are so fucking incompetent
the problem isn t that the damage dealt taken is the correct way to balance aram the problem is that it s the cheap way there s a reason those nerfs aren t on summoners rift because they have more manpower on that team
i disagree a champion should feel roughly the same in rift vs abyss aram is a for fun mode and the balance should suffer for the benefit of having balance on the rift the amount of people who are dedicated aram players who would benefit from champions being directly changed to better balance aram is miniscule compared to the number of players who go into aram to try out random new champs and enjoy themselves in a more casual mode when you create two different balances for the same champion you make them not feel like the same champion
sivir is still at damage for something that was a abuseable before her gameplay update the aram team either does not give a fuck or is literally just one person
ivern needs to have an actual passive for aram they reworked shyvana s passive with the enemy s healing relics but ivern doesn t have a jungle for his passive in a similar vein ornn s passive is still bugged in that it randomly goes on cooldown even after not having built anything or automatically upgrading your own item
i feel like an easy and elegant solution would be to have a shortened ban period have no per champion adjustments and to enable all champions seconds max as to not lengthen queue times as riot fears the hitch being nobody can see who you re submitting to ban and the ban only goes through if both teams vote to ban the same champion still chaotic still a chance the ban won t go through but ultimately i can still vote to ban veigar every game in the hopes i never have to see him on aram again regardless of any circumstance the second nerf is nice but it doesn t address that it s easy to hit massive and the stun duration is the same regardless of when you touch the walls it feels like an ultimate
is this really where we want development time spent this above all the bugs systems updates content updates balancing etc i don t think you understand the massive undertaking you are suggesting this would have to be a living cycle of buffing nerfing every ability for every champ and then adjusting constantly to keep up with champ balance item balance and any other changes they have general buffs nerfs that are champion specific in aram and that s probably already too much time spent on a casual game mode
finally i have champions in mind that need a nerf shaco there needs to be a limit on the boxes currently on the map say we can make this invisible to the vision provided by the minions to give him some agency but right now its extremely hard to play against a good ap shaco as engage teemo same as shaco limit the shrooms currently on the map to the gameplay warps to shroom busting if you fall behind even a little bit and can never push back to get an advantage now both of these can be avoided we got a newish oracles lens that behaves like umbral glaive s blackout ability lissandra passive this needs a cooldown like ornn s passive the passive is too strong in straight up fights which is all we have in arams maokai e ap maokai remove the sapling splitting ability from it completely currently when the saplings in a bush run to the wave they don t split but when it hits champions it splits dealing a lot of damage to multiple people the sapling in itself makes most bush plays hard but we can atleast keep this in check if it only affects one champion aurelion sol currently his two item power spike with rylai s crystal scepter makes it really hard to do any front back team fights with his e singularity this works with anivia ult because any cc cancel that zone but it does not with sol s e i have more but these are off the top of my head
frankly it just pushes me away from aram more as someone who would only casually play aram with friends in the first place the actual balance of the mode wasnt important to me making it significantly different from league makes it too difficult to keep track of and i d rather not start making mistakes in normal league games because there was a significant difference between norms and aram champ kits
no as long as they dont show on champ select these are not the way
aram was best before they started with the nerfing buffing many champions are also really situational depending on your team and enemy team just leave the mode be as it was remove snowball too it was way more fun to play before poro king mode first was released
revert all ashe changes and make her unable to even see mandate in the store make changes for her from there
when can we expect the map to be enlarged a bit take note from wildrift aram way better tbh
nerfed the middle finger of all ashe players so they can t press w more than times in seconds
they should also nerf a freaking lot lux cds yesterday the enemy lux was using her ult every freaking seconds with her sec stun what felt like every seconds the biggest pain in the ass i have ever experienced in my life we still won but delete lux from aram pls
while we re at it put the turret rubble back in i missed when there was actually dynamic teamcomps with clear frontlines and backlines now we re back to tanks and everyone playing poke healers nothing random about that
akshan kinda busted in aram ngl his passive was massively buffed when death timers got extended there are a lot of hidden advantages it gives as well if his teammates have more uptime they ll have more experience and gold gives you less time to push it s for sure one of my least favorite champs to play against
riven gets shield strength dmg bonus she has a hit q wtf and damage reduction i get that this is supposed to encourage bad riven players to unga bunga but any plat player abusing these buffs in aram look like a fucking god and it s obnoxious to deal with once they get items meanwhile ashe is getting hefty penalties that don t even solve the underlying issue of her kit in aram
for qiyana just lower her cds she sucks because by the time she has enough ah to actually play role in tfs other than qweqdie the game is already finished and the buffs she has are absolutely stupid you can go full lethality be almost as tanky as a bruiser and deal so much damage that even full armor mundo melts when you touch him and on top of that you get tenacity she could also get some stun infusion outside of heal shrines she really sucks at nexus defense
love that they re willing to do this veigar nerf doesn t exactly solve the problem though he s most oppressive when laying down cage after enemies engaged higher cd just encourages him to save it more and not make any sort of aggressive play stun duration would be a more effective nerf
nerf morgana q
any other unique buffs nerfs for champions i don t care how much they have to buff akshan to just remove his w completely it s so annoying to play against
i d like a nerf to ap kaisa because it s just obnoxious other poke champs like xerath and velcoz nidalee spears are fine like you expect to in a poke battle but kaisa is just annoying you can dodge w but oops hit one of your teammates time to dodge again
i m sick of katarina with bonus tenacity and haste she literally can build almost anything and pop off chain cc is the only way to play against her but with free tenacity she s so hard to lock down
all i want is for riot to put the r back in aram i m so sick and tired of people rolling and picking the same poke champs in every single game either remove rerolls swap pools or just let people ban and pick what to play at this point
asol and senna are so fucking broken in aram it isn t even funny i played a meme aram with a couple buddies last night and i had stacks at 19minutes my e covered of the lane our senna had stacks just from q auto trades and creep souls
i feel like even though karthus does dmg i ve never won an aram with one on my team
i once had nasus for aram and got balamce buff damage dealt and damage taken i got so nerfed i wasnt even a cannon minion had to go liandrys mythic and just full tank the other items i didnt even take boots because it was useless if i already take more damage so i went straight with garg stoneplate i was still able to tank people for minutds before they all built penetration xd
sion damage dealt damage recieved shielding done reduced by tenacity reduced by ability haste reduced by life steal reduced to maybe it isn t the champion huh
qiyana has no business having dmg dealt and dmg taken been like this for way too long
nerf udyr please i did 81k damage some days ago with tank build
unique nerf akshan s revive doesnt work on aram
they did this way back ago initially together with dominion once dominion was removed they abandoned aram specific buffs and nerfs
give all long range poke mages less damage on targets over units away you can still poke still deal a lot of damage but you wouldnt just win the game by poking from three screens away without any counterplay
all fun and games until some aram nerfs buffs spill over to summoner s rift for whatever reason and people have no idea why xyz champion feels bad or too good to play only to find out that this champ got these specific nerfs buffs accidentally in sr
still think the correct way to change sion would be to make heartsteel not proc while he s in his passive in aram that shit is so stupid so unbelievably stupid also yeah everyone else is asking for it too but please make ashe an adc again but let s get more radical here and i m going to head off criticism of adc favoritism by saying that my preferred champs on aram are full tanks leona my beloved and mages i d also like to see some poke comps lose out on their power or at least require more skill expression in doing so shift some of ezreal s power from his q to landing wq combos and do something similar to nidalee spears with her mark make liandry s and demonic durations not refresh off dots against champions sorry not sorry teemo brand malzahar etc double jayce s hexgate cool down at level and make it scale down to current base with levels make xerath s q hitbox narrower give ziggs his damage back and nerf the effects of ability haste on him not negative ah reduced scaling and do similar for other mages like him such as lux make morgana q snare for less time based on distance make first strike not get procced and put on cooldown if ability damage is taken from beyond a certain range so on and so forth and lest that make tanks spiral out of control i d like to see warmog s get a cap on how much hp it heals per second i d up the effects of grievous wounds by and if we really wanna get crazy i d like to see a scalar applied to pen and giant slayer effects of some kind based on total maxhp and resists on the enemy team over a certain threshold to make full tank comps less terrifying to play into if you didn t happen to roll a vayne while not meaningfully impacting single tank or tank plus bruiser lineups oh and please for the love of god unnerf locket aura please i beg you
while unique buffs and nerfs are the way to go saddly that veigar nerf does almost no shit they need to reduce it s stun duration x200b x200b x200b x200b limiting caitlyn traps increasing kha zix passive range by a lot reducing ashe slow these are smart ways to balance aram
bro wtf its just aram i m like wtf its huge nerfs
my vote would be to make it so qiyana can t chain use her invisibility so much i don t know how that champion works so not sure what the change would be also pls nerf ashe w in some interesting way so we can play her adc again this is an interesting approach to aram tuning though that i much prefer to the number adjustments
aram should not have specific buffs or nurfs it should be what it is intended to be all random all mid
can we just get normal sett on aram please i m cool with the shield and healing nerf but uhhh can we not make him have damage taken ability haste and damage like you re trolling if you pick that champ but he s too fun to pass up
please do something to braum passive
kinda unrelated but does anyone know if there are more more aram players than summoner rift
you say but in the same post there s a a nerf
any other unique buffs nerfs for champions wukong is disabled edit but really give the stupid monkey some higher cds aoe and cc is too strong with lower area of aram and the ah he can get makes him a very strong champ since he can be tanky enough to resist combat while being a massive pressence in teamfights assuming the wukong isn t playing building like a monke
and the free win champion continues to go untouched and over buffed akali being as strong as she is in aram cause some rioter s so is a liability level player that makes the free win champion look bad
i am glad they are giving up on their formally lazy approach it just all round sucked to do less damage and the cdr nerfs were painful i am a bit confused at who they focus on so far though leblanc is just so imbalanced and they are just completely ignoring it
it s good on paper but seem to lack the actual implementation in a proper way just found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsxi0xsplam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsxi0xsplam) the veigar e change not being implemented at all karthus not being able to ult properly in his passive now seems halfhearted x200b it s definitely the way aram should be balanced but i feel like sometimes they simply forget to rebuff champions sivir for example feels absolutely horrendous to play playing her with of the actual damage dealt sucks ass imagine she gets dmg nerfs now for actual summoners rift leaving her with the nerfs aram nerfs as well the ability haste on ashe w are a joke too you stack so much cdr with all the items she can build and you ll still be annoying with the w spam
it feels god awful playing a non tank champion that takes dmg
does this mean they can finally nerf heartsteal in aram i swear every game that goes to minutes is decided by how many heartsteel each team has whoever has more wins plus the disgusting thing that is heartsteel on diana akali etc just absolutely broken that they can be a tanky bruiser and still deal assassin damage
hot take it s a waste of resources aram was more fun before they started to balance it obviously some champs were god mode but that s fine it s a perma 5v5 brawl champs whose kits excel in 1v1s have to be adjusted into atrocities to function on the map playing against these atrocities is basically as bad as low rolling a bad team comp in old aram i would much much rather have the time and effort put into an aram balance pipeline be invested in new game modes
i think aram doesn t need any buffs or nerfs on it if people are bad on certain champs well too bad now is your time to get practice all these changes just make aram feel terrible where you may be on a champ you like but they are an empty husk of their rift self i would much rather prefer we embrace the random nature of aram and just roll with the punches the only exceptions would be stealth and having a reasonable way to deal with it and stacking champs where i feel it s justified to get extra stacks in a mode where you are immediately competing with your team for resources
any champ with resets except maybe tristana viego pyke kata akshan e and resetting his teammates drakthar not a champion but still and tbh too many too count but those are the biggest offenders need some kind of nerf to their reset mechanic
consuming a champion s essence with essence theft ahri passive while active extends the ability s recast duration by and up to seconds and grants an additional recast storing up to recasts and sylas steals only r not p so no consuming with essence theft and no recasts ps however as i remember sylas can stack tk passive when stealing his r so it doesn t seem very consistent
because riot said fuck you that s why on a serious note the other guy explained it well enough it s ahri s passive proc that refunds her dash not the ult itself
you dont get that on sylas its just how it works
us sylas and viego mains must learn to just deal with the bugs
the short and very unspecific ability description in her preview page just reads that she gets recasts for takedowns i played her in the past just not before that small rework so i had no idea that the recasts are directly tied to the essence theft thank you for filling that gap for me edit i think that stealing tk s ultimate and stacking his passive makes sense because you can t use it against enemies without stacking the passive on them so it forces sylas to steal acquired taste as well just for that purpose meanwhile ahri s passive is only a plus that gives more dashes for takedowns but it s not required for her to get a takedown to begin with to get her first dashes therefore it s not necessary for the passive to be stolen as well i d say it makes sense but it does appear a bit confusing at first when you think about the consistency
then explain to me brand s ultimate on sylas
sylas steal ulti the recast ia from ahri passive
sylas ult is inconsistent across a lot of champions in order for him to be able to use every ult on a basic level kai sa is similar for what it s worth kai sa s ultimate requires stacks of her passive on the target to be able to ult but somehow sylas is able to use her ultimate also please do not ever ever trust what information is available in the client riot is incredibly lazy when it comes to knowledge within the client certain champions don t even have updated tooltips or videos in the client which means you are quite literally getting incorrect information you either have to load into game or go to the wiki even when loading into game you have to make sure you read the extended tooltips otherwise you are likely just getting similar information to the client the wiki or a website like u gg are your best options for reading champions kits i d personally recommend the wiki just because the people that update those are incredibly skilled and comprehensive when documenting interactions under the details section of each ability granted i doubt sylas ult interactions are documented there but i doubt anyone has documented every sylas ult interaction
sylas s ult is just special cased for a lot of champions there isn t really a rhyme or reason for why x passive works but y doesn t other than it d feel bad if it didn t or it d be unusable
not sure about brand i m only certain on ahri cause she s my main
i swear i use the wiki almost all the time to learn everything i need to know about champions items and interactions it s just that this one time i decided to take a quick look at the preview page in client because i was hoping that something as stupidly simple as knowing what exactly allows her to gain more recasts on spirit rush wouldn t be riddled with misleading information i also think that sylas forces kai sa s ultimate to interact with him the same way it does with her because i was able to use killer instinct on people that got hit with hard cc by my teammates due to them getting tagged with a stack of plasma it looks like he can only put one stack of plasma on enemies through allies hard cc or his own attacks but i m not sure if his spells hitting enemies count for stacking plasma like her void seeker
this happened last finals weekend in chicago as well and they ended up opening doors early and moving the fan fest to inside it was smaller but you stayed dry not sure if that s what they will do but it s probably an option
probs won t cancel since there s sponsorship activation obligations hope that some rain holds off but it ll probably be setup in the concourses of the stadium
they are played in different countries
they are played in different regions usually based on the game servers lck korean league lpl chinese league lec european league lcs north american these are some of the more well known leagues but there are also leagues for latin america brazil huge viewership turkey vietnam taiwan france and a million other sub leagues for each larger region as to which league is best it varies lck has the majority of top placements at the world championships so it s fairly safe to say they have some of the best teams talent but imo i prefer to watch lpl because the games can be hilariously violent and half the players are former lck stars anyways brazil has some of the hypest production value and lec has some great personalities lcs has uh cloud is a fun team to watch sometimes berserker is fun as hell to watch
lck and lpl they win worlds and are successful lec and lcs they lose to everyone and can only beat each other
lck macro oriented lpl teamfight oriented
lpl is the only one really worth watching because it s the only region where being up 5k gold doesn t mean much other regions almost never throw leads and don t play as risky so after lanephase you get bored to death it happens a bit in lck when some shitter team is up gold but doesnt know how to play macro at all but those situations always feel fucking bad cuz once they throw the lead it felt like they never had a chance
lck is a one team region lpl
i mean to be fair lck and lpl fight for 1st 2nd while lcs and lec fight for 3rd 4th and once and while they come second more so lec in grand scheme of things lck and lpl are always dueling between 1st 2nd and it varies year to year while lec is the locked 3rd place and lcs is 4th then there s a cliff and then other regions
lol you guys are so rent free
just like the last years world s semifinals right
fraud esport fans overdosing on copium again
just dodge not the ability the entire match
i agree needs a change needs to be aoe so you can e an entire team then ult
i wish they would take most of the power out of e and put it elsewhere in her kit i don t enjoy playing against her and never have since release because e is one of the most frustrating abilities in the game i can beat her but i don t enjoy it and i don t play her because i despise playing against her so much
as much as i hate illaoi i d much rather play against her than a yorick any day in low elo illaoi is super strong but if you leave lane against yorick in low elo at all he ll be at your inhib by the time you get back
also make test of spirit go away if i kill illaoi cuz if i strait up kill her ass i think i passed the test edit should clarify i just mean the ghost you can beat up for damage its annopying af when illaoi dies and you walk away but that triggers the ghost to die and spawn tentacles
she s master yi tier for me in terms of champions i hate playing against in low elo not because there is no counter but it s just simply unfun to play against
i wouldn t mind it if the hit box was so awful riot really needs to go look at lux q and illaoi e animation vs hit box i m sure others but those two come to mind first and foremost
i haven t lost to illaoi in what feels like years she is so reliant on landing her e that you can all in her the second she misses on most champs and force her flash or at minimum chunk her to yorick is unplayable for illaoi gwen and fiora are in the same camp morde is pretty hard too and any ranged top ruins her day but i ve beaten her up with pantheon darius olaf kled camille even shit like rengar and aatrox do alright into her also early her e is pretty useless without tentacles so you can just run up and fight her
yes illaoi e is an insanely bullshit ability but i hard disagree on that it takes half of ur hp it does that before it s maxed while illaoi has no ad once she maxes it and finishes black cleaver it does much more than half ur hp thats how rewarded she gets for hitting a single skillshot
illaoi main here while i agree heavily that way too much power is put on her e it s also a double edged sword if she misses it she becomes useless until it comes back up again also doesn t help that her e really isn t the easiest ability to hit from its telegraphed animation minion blocking slow projectile speed self root etc also i heavily encourage people who complain about x champion to play that same champion themselves actually playing x champion allows players to know that champion s strengths and weaknesses in the right circumstances illaoi feels incredible in the wrong circumstances she feels horrible to play learn what makes her unstoppable learn what makes her frustrated and use that when you fight her yourself
problem is wheter illaoi players would want that happening it s like blitz q the spell is too punishing for the enemies and consumes a lot of their power budget but if you rework that to be not toxic then its likely to not even feel like the same champion
it s lose not loose
my problem with illaoi is that she misses her e cool smart illaois will back the fuck up and not put themselves in position for trades so they ll sit there chillin throwing q s at you and hitting the random w tentacle smackdown at you until it s back up the aggressive ones will do all that but in your face and outtrade you anyways idk i ve been playing league since season and i feel like i have a good idea of of cd s in the game and i think ilaoi s e is the i don t know for sure i feel like it s probably around seconds tooltip but in practice that shit feels like it s up every seconds it s unreal
every juggernaut is quite matchup dependent
honestly i find her very easy to handle she s my perma ban
i d say add back reducing cooldown if she grabs it and you fight back her whole personality is built on testing your spirit so actually trying to fight for your spirit fits so much better when cooldown is reduced
i agree they should also remove all hooks and everything other ability i dislike please and thank riot
illaoi is really strong when she gets her tentacles set up her e helps set up more tentacles without this she would not really be an area denial champ and would turn her more into a worse aatrox with just focus on her q s and w s
try laning against a blitz and then tell me about one skill shit hit in ten taking half your hp i wish it was half they can miss hooks all game long and hit a lucky one over a wall during a baron setup or something and the rest of the game didn t matter
her e has insane pressure farming under turret against illaoi is an absolute nightmare
yeah there is way too much power in an ability where she isn t actually hitting you she can hit e and take of your health easily it s unfair
champ just needs the asol treatment her thematic and character honestly not that bad maybe will never be a popular champ but she s got a solid story and character that is cohesive champ just needs a completely kit her kit basically is god tier if you have to play into her and useless otherwise her biggest counter is players having a brain and choosing to walk away from her
i ve been saying it for years illaoi is a ping based reaction time matchup
ah illaoi the champion who gets free wins in low elo because people are morons and her kit is just stupid
illaoi is one of those champions that needs to be reworked badly she s incredibly unfun to play against because her kit warps the entire lane around her and ganking her especially with multiple melee often turns into a complete disaster even when you re ahead very few champions can fight her 1v1 if she s smart with her e if they took power out of e and put it somewhere else it wouldn t really change how cancerous she is she already has very strong push due to q and heavily buffing w would just make her damage far more reliable illaoi along with darius and jax made me leave top lane throw in gp being utterly obnoxious for bonus points
gimme gold every tentacle i kill only way i will play against illaoi
her e is the most unfun skill to play against if it wasn t for e i wouldn t mind laning against her but with her e it just feels so frustrating to play against especially since she has strong wave clear which opens to constantly have to dodge more e s
i d like her tentacles to work more like zed shurikens w all tentacles smash towards the cursor and the next autoattack makes her leap to an enemy which reduces this ability s cooldown leap range increased on vessel and spirit e doesn t transfer damage anymore instead it increases the damage they take for a duration if the spirit is killed and slows for longer but less r doesn t hide hitboxes anymore
she is underpowered and not really viable and has clear counterplay really straight forward on how to play vs her
sometimes i feel it backs way too fast whne you get out of her e seconds later she already has another to trow at you the cd should be higher but about minion block honestly why we dont always have that effect that dont let us hit minions when walking into them minion block brings a lot of problems and i dont see a single good thing to why we have them
my main doesn t do well against illaoi
just walk out of the circle it s designed like that for a reason sure you may have to back off for a while but maybe you were being a little aggressive anyway she also doesn t have any cc besides her e and her tentacles are unmoving skill shots anyone with half a brain will keep distance and do not 1v1 her that is exactly what she wants e r q auto w auto just wait for her to engage you or catch her split pushing because with no cc she can kinda be ignored in team fights while you focus on the carries illaoi wants you to all in her so she can lifesteal with her tentacles you just have to keep your distance while her ability is up and once it s not you can farm
dont agree at all and im not gonna elaborate on
i really would appreciate if people make a dedicated effort to learn matchups they struggle with than ask for changes on champions that are dogshit anyway
i would really appreciate if riot would change darius don t get me wrong i don t think she s overpowered but his e is one of the most frustrating abilities in the game my biggest pain points with her e it s one e and you loose half your hp minionblock lets him hit some e s that would be easily avoided after they removed the fight mechanic of it it just became a punching bag abillity i ve got no idea how to change it especially as his passive has around of his power budget but at this point i d rather lane against garens with ignite instead of darius
ban her or dodge the lobby if it s not something you enjoy her e is the slowest skill shot in the game with a long cd and the hitbox depends on the champ she s aiming at on top of this she has no mobility no hard cc and no range in her current state in an even matchup she either has to hit the e to win or miss and lose there is no middle ground see my earlier points to dodge e counter pick w tryndamere or a ranged champ git gud tbh
the problem with illaoi is the weird hitboxes and how her tentacles behave in unpreditable ways sometime i m not even sure if it s bugs or actual mechanics only illaoi mains know she is also extremely statcheck y even by juggernaut standards it takes a lot of inting for her to actually fall behind and become a non threat compared to other champions of the same class
lmao riot making good changes in your dreams
i really like illaoi but honestly her e is what makes me not play her if i miss it i basically just play back and cry until it s off cooldown if i hit it then i get to feel useful for a moment before going back to doing nothing sure it means i get a kill later in the game but fuck is it boring
delete asol thanks
oh no a champion that can punish pussies who want to pve under their own tower with wholesome tanks
get good i lose to illaoi sometimes too skill issue she s a simple champ everything is baked into her e if she hits she wins if she misses she s vulnerable
there is extremely little counter play to her if your match up is bad also sure you can beat her easy enough in brain damaged gold elo but once you start vs otp masters illaoi shit is unplayable
played a game where she pulled an e on my jhin while he was retreating and he instantly lost hp i thought this was capped but he almost got oneshot from only people hitting his soul also she was so i guess it s fair
i dont mind illaoi but i do mind the dancing with the stars mini game i have to play until i get out of lane phase
it s super frustrating to dodge e times in a row punish illaoi as much as you can for it then she lands one e and you are now on your back foot
illaoi isn t a champion its a minute torture and skillshot dodging session for the top laner
i think her tentacles should get more hp instead of being immune when she ults
just walk away ok but now im lower on health she gets an even greater cs advantage and my tower is fucked when she eventually forces me out of lane i think shes balanced in the sense that there are a couple picks that do very well against her but god damn if you don t get to counter pick her it feels unplayable sometimes
did you know that a few years ago you had counterplay against her her e duration was reduced for every hit she got while she had you soul but for some reason riot didn t liked it and removed it
i wish they made the rest of her abilities better i don t enjoy playing her because all of her power is loaded into her e and r
just reduce the amount of power in e make it transmit less damage instead of of the targets health when maxed then put some more damage in her q or increase her base stats or just buff her in anyway besides the amount of damage e does
her passive is also an issue if you re playing with her imoit s not a skill issue it s an annoyance that s there from early to late
well her e is rather easy to dodge and once you dodge it she becomes completely useless i agree that they need to change her but imo her kit is overall very badly designed and pretty much unfixable without at least a midscope
its my permaban no joke i main renekton and jax and there is counterplay against her
yeah it s pretty annoying that in solo q the counter play is basically don t fight her with less than because you can t really trust ur teammates to dodge the e like i know she s not super strong but idk how that as the counterplay is allowed to exist in solo q it seems so blatantly unhealthy
i still don t understand this stupid champ last time i played against her i killed her but the stupid tentacles of her ult hit me two more times after she died even after i used stopwatch for the first hit this is so frustrating cause you are not able to see how many times these shitty tentacles are going to hit you even though she s already seconds dead
shes honestly terrible design if more power was in her slamming me with tentacles and her q then fine but one skillshot especially in aram where the whole enemy team joins resulting in a third of my health from hitting other abilities on something that isnt me is so unbelievably uninteractive and unfun
she needs power removed from her e and her ult for a low mobility sustaining juggernaut she should at least have to fight the champion to kill them instead of fighting them without the actual champion there
i think if a champion depends on a one single ability that s a bad design
it s so easy to fix illaoi just make it so that her w spawns the spirit behind them like she s punching their spirit out of their body with the idol and make her new e spawn a tentacle anywhere which knocks up nearby enemies after a brief delay now she has some much needed cc more tentacle control and had to actually commit to a fight if she wants to whale on someone s spirit new w combos with her q as enemy and spirit are lined up new e combos with her ultimate as another tentacle removes her fight from a distance playstyle that everyone hates and is more in line of her character as someone who tests strength
honestly it s getting minion blocked whilst trying to dodge tentacles that s the most bs part of playing against illaoi
i think the thing that sucks about her e is in order to end it you have to back up a lot this just throws off the tempo of the lane since she gets to push for free that and her aoe push makes it really easy for her to shove lanes and once she s pushing you under tower there s nothing you can do it s harder to dodge under tower so she gets to poke you out for free and you can t get a gang from your jungler because she can 2v1 with her r tldr landing an e just completely swings the lane tempo in her favor and many melee champs just can t match her aoe push with ganks being useless against her there s not much to do but stay under tower
wait sorry for the question but they removed the mechanic to damage her to get your soul back from the e quicker
same problem old nidalee had doesn t matter how many miss all it takes is for one to land to be forced to recall illaoi e is the same she lands it once there goes all your health potions lands another and it s time to recall then there s the fact that you re forced to deal with her tentacles for a few seconds before you even get the chance to recall bonus points for making you miss minion exp and gold trying to deal with the tentacles she needs a rework her tentacle theme is rather underwhelming
her e just needs to be adjusted as soul duration decreased from 7s at all ranks to 7s based on rank damage transfer changed from based on rank to at all ranks to compensate her e nerfs her passive should be changed to the following such changes alleviate her loss in power while also fixing the worst part about her kit illaoi stores charge of her passive every 5s per level up to a maximum of charges each time after illaoi damages a target with harsh lesson or hits an enemy champion with an ability she consumes charge of her passive and spawns a tentacle nearby
there s like abilities that do just as much or more damage that your only option is to dodge kinda how this game works
lol the e hit me because of minion block
there is a reason why dodge the e or dodge the game was coined by xpetu illaoi is a terrible champion design as you said it has nothing to do with being overpowered either it s just a disgusting champion that forces you to play a completely different game that isn t lol
tbh i feel illaoi is a free matchup i just ignore her after lvl and perma proxy lol
got e d go away the ghost vanishes and it s on cd now you can trade
rush boots her entire kit is easily avoidable by if you just move she s a teacher for a reason and if can t move you ll learn a harsh lesson
her e is probably both the worst part of her kit and one of her most annoying abilities i ve given a lot of thought about how to rework that skill specifically because otherwise i think she s pretty decent my best idea looks something like this test of spirit is the same skillshot ghost making it has now but instead of being a fully statted clone of a champion it works more like one of gp s barrels the clone has x bars that only illaoi and her tentacles and her direct opponent can attack each tick of the spirit s health deals y damage to the opponent if the enemy gets the last hit on the spirit they pass the test and go as normal if illaoi gets the last hit the opponent gets the current debuff and is dealt z additional damage for failing the test when illaoi hits the initial pull she slows her opponent for n probably something low like this gives her some badly needed front loaded ultility that shouldn t be too oppressive test of spirit is no longer broken by running out of range might not be a good idea but i don t like incentivizing noninteraction this addersses most of the issues with the skill i think while still retaining its current place in illaoi s kit test no longer facilitates the boring and aggravating counterplay of dodge or run out of lane asap it s a lot more interactive in a way that avoids the earlier noodtrap problems of the skill because the enemy only needs to land one hit to pass the test rather than kill the spirit before illaoi does more damage to it it gives illaoi some frontloaded power she needs to land more followup damage in a way that shouldn t be too oppressive if illaoi hits the e she can hit you to take advantage of the slow or your spirit to proc the test debuff which creates some interesting decisions and it should be easier to balance because illaoi gets a flat rate of reward for whaling on the spirit which gives her a bit more leeway in hard matchups than i think test currently offers i doubt this is a perfect redesign but i think something like this would be better than illaoi s current e
it s odd that she s considered op cuz of her e but for some reason i get the shittiest illaoi players on my team who ints every time lol
wow i never knew people struggled this much with illaoi just bait out the e dodge it and you win every time
aah yes illaoi the only champ where the more she hits you the less damage she deals who cares just dodge the second cast time slams and claim your free win what is she gonna do about it e you again to deal so that she can then e you again to deal yeah great champ uses a second cd skillshot to deal damage
i find it annoying how much of her power is in her e in lane ut turns her into a physical poke mage more than a bruiser and removing the fight or flight mechanic directly contradicts her lore where it s a fight or die mechanic balsncing champs around one mechanic always sucks that the ability is biggest damage and healing tool makes the issue quite obvious
they buffed how much damage gets transferred from the clone they reduced her mana costs they made it so that occasionally tentacles can spawn after killing a clone i ve had many games where illaoi green fog goes away and a 3rd tentacle spawns while i m recalling while most of the time it s and they made it so her tentacles spawn more often and take longer to dissappear i occasionally bard top for fun i ulted myself under tower while getting dove by a jg diana and having tentacles spawn on me the tentacle was able to dmg and kill me while i was ulted i still have the video
i was pantheon level around armor and she decided to take hp out of my 1600hp with a single e while she was levels down and didn t buy any ad except a caulfield hammer i made a clip of it too because i couldn t believe that it was only e damage
i don t understand where all the sudden hate comes from i ve pretty much played her exclusively since her release and not much has changed about her all of a sudden though people are complaining about her she s slow only strong in her ult and if she misses e she s out for a while people now complain in game that it s an instant win for me because i picked her but whenever someone on the other team picks her and i have to counter i absolutely slaughter her she s not hard to counter it s just no one plays her or understands how she works get out and actually play the champions before complaining about them also if e is landed just run no point to try and fight mord is also the devil to her
and i would really appreciate it if riot removed master yi from the game but we don t live in a utopia
illaoi is one of the weakest champions in the game unless in the absolute perfect scenario my only guesses is that you can t dodge for shit or you re low elo
if you play around minion save her e can t hit you illaoi is about zone control and that s exactly what she does i call bullshit on your garen comment as well i think you re hyperbolizing illaoi is mana dependent and pushes lane easily yes you have to kind of play weak side into her but that s what i think you should be focusing on it s not the champ it s how you have to play into the champ
she hardly ever runs out of mana she can spam q to clear waves and then e you under tower once that happens it s over you spend time killing the tentacles and walking away and she has already cleared another wave and is ready to e you again it feels like getting hit with e is a death sentence just dodge e okay the entire lane is based around ability it is the least fun matchup top
i see her top i just go ziggs and win
one idea to balance it make it deal less damage in two ways normal damage for ranged less damage for melee and second make it deal less damage on melee ofc unless she is on her ult basically lets say at all times against any champs that attacks melee once she ults this goes away and it becomes normal and anyone takes the normal damage from the skill like that the matchup vs ranged champions dont change at all and she continues getting whooped like always but for melee who have to walk up the wave and cs they can choose to just back away if she catches them on her e instead of taking of their health bar sitting under turret because you tried to last hit cannon
if i play toplane i ban illaoi easy
i love how redditors always preface by saying i don t think she s broken with regards to illaoi but the rest of the post text implies otherwise
if she hits an e clear the tenticals and fight back lol
i ll disagree with you i d much rather fight an illaoi than a garen with ignite and ult like at least you can dodge illaoi s attacks garen just presses ult on you at half hp and ignite and ur just dead
the problem with illaoi e for all those saying just dodge it is if you don t dodge it it s brutal and if i m trying to farm or something as a melee champ i don t know how you farm easily and dodge a good player will totally punish you
it s one e and you lose half your hp could be worse could be darius s e which makes you lose of your hp instead
illaoi e is pretty frustrating riot has a tendency to let too much power sit in a single ability on some champions to the point in some cases where in lower elos you see people barely utilizing half their kits gp was horrible about this when running grasp klepto was the meta you d see people in low elo getting by just spamming q thankfully this resulted in a nerf in illaois case her e isn t too bad it does feel pretty bad to have a dshield t1 boots illaoi take of your health because you stepped outside your wave it s infinitely better than having a irelia that s levels behind you shit on you with nothing but bork
ima assume that you blind pick and if you blind pick and they play illaoi it s just a stay safe lane which is hard under turret against a good illaoi but as long as you don t feed most champs can win w team fighting where she has to win through snowballing if i don t win by like mins on illaoi game has just become significantly harder and probably have to move off original build to start team fighting which costs an extra 1k gold usually
she s just good against noobs don t think she s that good overall
her e is like the slowest shit in the game even if she lands one as long as you back away your good you should never be in a situation against her where she can even land her e just punish her immediately after she misses it i know you said not to say just dodge it but like there is a reason she s got a dog shit win rate in high elo
it s even worse if you decide to try and fight her with her e the cd is so short that by the time the first e ends its back up maybe have her e go on cd after the ability ends
illaoi exists to counter low mobility tanks and bruisers who need to be in melee where the reaction time for her e is low she excels at long drawn out fights in general like darius and short trades when she can land her e and the enemy doesn t disengage this is her strength against champions with high mobility she should pretty much never land her e ranged similarly have an easy time because when they space it gives more time to sidestep her e they can poke her down pretty well and destroy her tentacles furthermore unlike many ranged champions and other melees she is quite mana hungry so she cannot early game infinitely spam her abilities i don t really see any reason to change her other than her being oppressive for tanks she has clear strengths and weaknesses which is nice if the issue is that she counters tanks too hard then she would need more counterplay into ranged or mobile champs to make her pickable outside of extremely niche spots she already is niche but i don t think it s fair to make her entirely unplayable the issue is that simply walking away from illaoi something ranged and mobile champs or those with cc can easily do is the biggest counterplay when she has e up a few ideas cut down her max hp damage to offset this make her more durable more resists not hp since so many tanks have max hp damage so that she wins long drawn out fights but doesn t just chunk you to in one trade this makes it so she still wins vs tanks but requires more all in add cooldown to e i don t think this is a good response it just makes the mini game boring and adds even more downtime to one of the few legit skillshots on a bruiser like irelia e would probably need to add a little more ms or cc to her if you appreciably increased this increase flat damage on q reduce w damage and reduce e damage illaoi becomes worse at killing tanks better at other stuff i think her w in particular would be a decent place to add in power since it gives her a bit of mobility if her damage and cc is heavily nerfed make illaoi s tentacles require autos for ranged for melee while nerfing e makes her more pickable into other matchups while making her less oppressive to melee overall i think having champions that are really good at something and bad at other stuff is great for the game the issue for me is that she is good at killing tanks at every point in the game and i dislike there not really being a moment where she can lose to tanks in lane of course the answer is to gank her since she naturally will want to shove in and dive the enemy but her current kit allows her to 2v1 very easily if even or ahead of course if she can t 2v1 then she becomes almost unpickable her tentacles can easily be cleared in the river by ranged and without them she is useless around objectives in teamfights
the minion block comment is bizarre since surely for every time you get minion blocked she also gets minion blocked in the long run
play mordekaiser and fk her over ez
have any games that have peaked and declined been able to reclaim their peak probably the best is to hope you have a large enough persistent player base
thank you mark for tackling probably the most frustrating thing i see on this sub about franchising that relegations we re so much more exciting because it brought in new talent of any friends lmfao that happened like once and all the other times it was the same semi veterans making it just to sell the slot off c9a made it to lcs like times that s not exciting that s literally just nuking teams for a different faceless org
one of mark s comments about pro players reminds me of a super early thread about how iirc corki vs caitlyn was supposed to play out nintendudex asked the question after he lost and doublelift replied and said what should have happened and how he won that match i doubt anything like that would ever happen on reddit or any site globally now as the proplayer would be completely roasted by the world for that
for me i have a few reasons why we got here orgs inflated salaries and investments when esports seemed to be the next big thing everyone expected lpl type growth teams and broadcast for awhile became more about a global tournament narrative throughout the year it wasnt about lcs success but international success so when lcs didnt succeed something that should be expected for a variety of reasons we basically spent all year telling fans our product sucks dont value it lcs and riot games moved away from heavily being at or involved in gamer events across the us no dreamhacks no conventions and only finals for lcs a year this turned lcs into an online only type product with no real anchor in keeping and or building up communities across na as time goes on people lose interest because core anchors needed to keep them engaged were never put in place or were gone lcs viewership continues to trend down that there isnt a real profitable future for orgs soon the sponsors will pull out and even a barebones team cost would be breaking even let alone broadcast team production costs teams like clg tsm and previous flyquest owners are selling now when there is at least some value left before its gone expect more to sell before the end of too i think more orgs are going to sell spots and are in talks to do so currently
as a clg fan since the beginning i no longer have the desire to consume lcs or really anything that isn t worlds play offs shame
i think lcs riot should try to do things unwind franchising somehow at least in the way it s setup for lol i m not sure what that looks like but franchising failed for ow and now is failing league there s a reason riot didn t make teams pay million for spots in valo also like valorant i think all of americas should be joined into one big league combine lcs cblol lla etc into big league with more teams and separate it into tiers the way valo does
i miss uol
that subtle pause and smile when mentioning broadcast decisions was gold well played
people are making this way too complicated money was cheap due to low interest rates so vcs invested in esports interest rates went up a ton so vcs aren t investing esports and twitch streams have and still will see insane growth the investment opportunity is still there
riot s rules on imports definitely hurts na far more than it helps one of my favourite things about lec is how few imports we have and how our best team usually has none vit trying to be an exception but yet to enter that echelon lcs sends like na players to worlds each year from the starters on their teams why tf would a na fan care about which washed korean or european is going to go in groups for them may we well be homegrown players going than that and if there s never a na team making these events then how will the na talent pool improve there s lots of ways riot could have fixed the import rules to stop teams ending up like this but short term greed ruled the day sign big names now for the instant boost of hype and ignore the fact that every one of these players goes feet up mode as soon as they land in la and by the time msi and worlds roll around they get rungs run around them just as badly as the local players do
lcs is finally good and now we just have to gdt folks back into it
how long do we have before riot decides to partner with the likes of content gambling and onlyfans
removed
i don t know what happened this year but i haven t watched lec or been up date to date with it this year someone knows what happened
i think that somewhere along the line tsm just became about money for reginald it s sad but tsm doesn t care about its roots having started as a league of legends organization what can you do fuck em let s all move on we can still remember the past but we don t need to linger on it anymore there are plenty of good orgs and players out there today to focus on
i usually like these blame games but this one was kinda boring to me i clicked off after minutes i didn t hear any info i didn t already know or anything interesting idk
remember this clown couldn t blame the higher ups in eg for how danny wound up gave it the systematic issue wash away of the problem let s stop listening to this loser
super smash bros melee for the nintendo gamecube
league is kinda a problem for a spectator sport because if you don t play league it is near impossible to understand so we re already limiting the population as people move on from league that shrinks the population who can watch
deleted
counterstrike might be the only example of being a successful esport over like years
that part of the video caught my attention too while melee is obviously the big one for fgc that hits quite a wave of prosper and falter due to nintendo i immediately thought of marvel vs capcom and the journey it has had to now coming back as a main game for this year s evo the fgc is a unique case when it comes to esports as no game ever really dies as long as there are even a few players or a community driven to pioneer the scene that s what s bring mvc3 back atm
melee a few times
aoe2 but that s a very different game
runescape did but only because they rereleased a build of the game
only path i see forward is a literal sequel to the game which is antithesis to what the company was founded on lol i think if riot made a sequel with significant enough changes to gameplay shrunk the roster back down to a more manageable level re introduced relegation and made the game a more grassroots effort again i think they would have a chance but i don t think they ll do that league is really only dying in na and smaller regions in china and korea it is still incredibly popular even if it s not at the peak it was
it already happened with league a few years back the odyssey event was made to recruit new players because of a declining userbase that helped out quite a bit but now it s back and this time the game might see a sharp decline
csgo was in the hard decline till they announced source and they broke their peak in the first week
time for riot to hit the league of legends button

minecraft fortnite when they added no build and maybe csgo is what comes to my mind tho minecraft is kinda on the downtrend again after covid
not an esport so there are massive differences but mls almost died in the early 2000s

pre franchising hit a point where it was more valuable for an org to stack an academy team to take a lcs spot that can be sold for millions than the actual lcs team ever could
yea i meant to say it in the video but clearly franchising is a failure given riot modified their approach for val but i think pre franchising is looked at too often with rose tinted glasses and there were legit problems that in theory a franchise model could fix
steve buying dl to save his team is burned in my mind if we kept having relegations what was going to stop teams from overspending to buy the best available talent just to save their spot
it happened plenty of times in eu lcs lemon dogs mym copenhagen wolves roccat unicorns of love h2k g2 and misfits all qualified through relegations and this brought in players like nukeduck tabzz bjergsen sven deficio jankos vander vizicsacsi gilius power of evil hylissang odoamne febiven hjarnen kikis perkz alphari ignar and hans sama
iirc riot also wanted franchising as well because they were losing money off esports right franchising was a perfect way for riot to cash out on esports and give the leagues to the owners even though i always felt franchising would never work in esports because it is just no where near as established in traditional sports where teams are tied to cities and there is also a draft system that allows weaker teams to obtain better players that would never be the case in esports even then franchising in traditional sports has its flaws as well
i didn t like relegations because it occasionally had good storylines i liked it because it gave weight to the bottom of the table matches
globally it happened more than once and franchising na was a domino that meant eu and kr had no choice but to follow to compete with player salaries and more importantly it meant bottom feeder teams were removed which doesn t happen now imt are free to roll around in the mud for as long as they like with uncompetitive teams and no investment or effort in scouting talent franchising moved from a state of vc money farming spots to sell to orgs to vc money holding spots hostage i d trade the chance for a c9 style team coming up over the current corporate team shuffling of the same players every split
the current state of the dota scene is a possible example of what lol could be like had they not changed to franchised leagues the game continues to be super top heavy since ti is the majority of the prize money in dota the prize pools for majors have gone down in recent years and it s to the point that only the top in majors get prize money and the other teams go home with and dpc points which determine which teams will qualify for ti as for the dota pro circuit dpc regional leagues themselves they have auto relegation where the bottom teams in division are demoted to division and are replaced with the top teams in division the bottom teams in division are eliminated from the dpc go home with and have to re qualify for d2 via the dpc d2 qualifiers as for ti the money there has also gone down going from a million prize pool in to only million in to put that in comparison the ti winner team spirit won million while the ti winner tundra esports won only million and one of the members of tundra sneyking said that he got less than million after taxes and fees https://clips.twitch.tv/smellythankfulmomelegiggle-zfnw3rgrg3z7np73) and as for the last place teams one of the last place teams thunder predator won 100k while one of the last place teams tsm who also do airport speed runs in dota only won 47k the severe top heavy nature of the dota pro scene means that someplayers in the lower parts of division and players in division and below resort to match fixing just to make money to survive the match fixing has gotten more and more commonplace in dota with the move to regional leagues that over players and teams were banned from dpc china for match fixing and a few of those players were even banned for cheating https://escorenews.com/en/dota-2/news/44713-valve-bans-knights-ehome-over-40-pro-dota-players-in-total-for-foul-play) also today a russian blogger released massive accusations of numerous players in dpc eeu and a few dpc na teams match fixing https://escorenews.com/en/dota-2/news/45645-blogger-accuses-multiple-dpc-teams-of-322-including-wildcard-gaming-and-thiuth-after-infiltrating-match-fixing-discord-server) then again given that valve prefers to do the absolute bare minimum had riot not gone with franchised leagues they probably still wouldn t have ended up as bad as the dota scene is today
me when i lie
jankos team the team kerp was part of alternate lemondogs should i go on
yes but you re talking about people taking advantage of a broken system i think the obvious response to that would be that over time they could ve refined relegations so it can t be taken advantage of even at the time i was against franchising the only positive i saw out of it was the fact that there wouldn t be so much team turnover in the league which would lead to more rivalries and interesting matchups stories which the opposite actually happened because everything because corporatized rivalries became worthless when the players stopped being invested in them at the end of the day of western league viewers care about players not teams it s always been about the players rock solid to tsm quantic and c9 no one cared about the team name they cared about the personalities on the teams franchising gives teams all the power and players none which is pretty much the worst case scenario for the longevity of the league none of this is fact btw just my own personal take i guess
c9a made it to lcs like times that s not exciting that s literally just nuking teams for a different faceless org i mean you got halfway there without quite saying it c9 isn t allowed to have teams in the lcs so they shouldn t have been allowed to have a second team fighting in the promotional tournament for the lcs either
because core anchors needed to keep them engaged were never put in place or were gone i think this is also a huge thing that s on the players the league grew off the personalities of the game and the next generation just took that for granted and cashed paychecks as much as he is hated regi and early tsm were huge and brash personalities that attracted massive audiences hotshotgg and his two huge dicks saintvicious and his arrogant attitude doubelift and his trophy case you had ancillary guys like crubzz zion bigfatlp chauster robertxlee etc they eventually lead into guys who seemed to blow up and carry the new wave when lcs came about with sneaky and qtpie you had another wave of second level guys like keithmcbrief snoopeh krepo and lautemortis who had a following for a time but then all these dude s retired and no new personalities popped up it was just quiet shy kids who were really good at the game and wanted to get paid a lot of money like i get being a professional is insanely hard but it s an absolute travesty someone like jojo isn t both streaming and promoting the game basically this game grew like it or not on dudes no lifeing the game on stream basically all day and night it wasn t just the first esport it was the first streaming boom no one stepped up to take the mantle and it s become insanely hard to invest in anyone since as an aside i think a guy like aphro is a huge and the quintessential example of this anyone who watched his streams back when he was on v8 eg or even tsm evo basically while he was an adc his streams were wild and he was just this great amazing personality to watch but as soon as he got to being a support it seemed to just dry up barely streams no more big personality just a quiet dude showing up and doing his job and then bouncing like fuck it s hard to tell someone they need to do more but like what else can you do
lol esports exists as a giant marketing platform for lol just as much as it exists as an independent product i wouldn t be surprised if riot enters a too big to fail mode to try and support the lcs with larger revenue shares to keep things afloat while they try to fix things
those are all large trends affecting the entire lcs but imo it does not really explain why clg in particular failed clg has always been a poorly run company going all the way back to when hotshotgg was running the company they struggled as an org to bring in sponsors investors despite being the second most popular org next to tsm steve and hotshotgg had totally opposite focuses on how to run their orgs and you see how those focuses affected the long term trajectory of the orgs hotshot was all about focusing on making the players in the org happy steve was all about focusing on bringing in sponsors and investors hotshot cared about making the org a place players wanted to play and steve cared about growing the lcs team s budget all of this is pretty well documented in old interviews with hotshotgg and kelby may kelby used to talk about how he was the guy in the company trying to get sponsors but he was also the general manager of the team basically their maid as he described himself kelby had too many responsibilities clg had too few staff and their trajectory got fucked from that combine that with the poor decision to select madison square garden as their investors owners of the new york knicks and you have a failing company msg is notorious for being a shitty and stingy owner of the knicks and that carried on to their relationship with clg in short the story of clg is one where the second most popular org early on in lcs failed to capitalize on their position they should have become as big budget as tsm and tl became at peak lcs but they failed to do that due to poor management low budgets meant bad rosters and that means not accruing fans and that means trouble attracting sponsors investors and it just snowballs it turns out being extremely good at a video game doesn t necessarily make you good at running a business
teams and broadcast for awhile became more about a global tournament narrative throughout the year yeah and that s how it should be we are usa and every sport we play we play to be internationally competitive the tsm chant is practically a chant of usa we have some of the most talented athletes in the world in just about every sport there is we don t shoot for second best ever it s literally just not our culture this narrative that we were somehow too hard on our local talents or whatever is a total misreading of american sports culture when i ve told people about this game i like watching americans play which is international called league of legends the first question is always never heard of it america s one of the best then huh when i tell them no not at all whatever little interest they might have had in a competitive video game is all gone in this article about soccer https://mastersoccermind.com/6-reasons-why-soccer-is-not-popular-in-the-united-states/) here s why it lists soccer isn t watched by americans americans are not in soccer americans like winning we like winning so much we ll watch just about anything if an american is winning it hell even if we re an underdog with a strong chance we ll watch the hell out of it but league is not the only sport that americans aren t the best at and it hampers the sport s popularity nationally however if lcs is going to continue and thrive without americans being the best internationally i d legitimately wish they d go the route of wrestling have the players take a persona as their username and have storylines and sketches done with those players acting out the personas going at it if we re not gonna be the best we should be the most theatrical
it was a bubble all built around desperately hoping for success at worlds lcs failing to make a consistent run at worlds year after year was the death knell no one wants to watch a bunch of overpaid losers
i m a clg fan since last split and i was really enjoying lcs this split and after last split they announced the roster would remain the same so this news was a shock to me f to dirty dhokes and the boys
you can t really combine the leagues like in valo without it being a long long term decision for example brazil is world class at fps games but relatively weak in lol it would just end up with lcs teams stomping the other regions until they caught up which could take years a year or two ago corejj did a gauntlet for lla pros to play against amateur academy and lcs pros but they struggled against amateur and got stomped by academy
valorant has its own issues right now the vct is heavily reliant on personalities like tarik i am pretty sure he had twice as many viewers on his co stream than the official stream cs2 is also gonna draw a lot of eyes away when it comes out officially
valorants america s region works because the game has unprecedented regional parity it would screw over brazilian and latin american fans because former lcs teams would win everything and they would never see their countries represented internationally anymore see pcs for an example of this in lol
prob have to add more than slots cause yeah that is an issue when you have regions into lots of orgs will be missing if it was
want to make league esports revive copy from rocket league esports have multiple regional tournaments leading up to majors get rid of typical league play let teams costream their games rather than force every game to be on the main channel regional tournament results are what qualify you for the majors and eventually worlds for example a regional tournament could be teams and do a swiss format b01 in order to qualify team bo3 playoffs this would be max games in a day which is very possible just might need more days of league can be done over weeks that is how you make every damn game matter and with team costreaming you can gain attachment to your org you support
you can t combine the leagues the same way valorant because na teams would leech off of brazilian teams
this game just needs a global league with about teams the rest can f off in their own weird farm leagues you centralize the league in one place and you have two conferences that meet up later like a stanley cup or super bowl at worlds the game is spread too thin with regional play and regional play stunts competitive growth just look an na and eu over the year span g2 s run was nice but it was a perfect storm of all star team and meta changes that korea didn t bother adapt to until riot relaxed the game rules back into a slower game outside of that eu wasn t anything special the ig fnc finals was a joke so what do we have with the west some cute history but nothing of threat when you don t have threats to win people get bored especially casuals who know they are watching dead men walking the only way to fix that is to get teams into environments that allow them to sharpen against the strongest it s just like lifting weights if you only have pounds of plates you re never going beyond that you need in weights in order to lift it eu and na are trapped in the pound kids gym asia has been lifting pounds for ages now and it s why they always win msi i ll give it to g2 but that tournament and format until this year is an absolute joke no real sport would ever run a tournament that bad and no one even really cares about that tournament because of the low volume of quality competition riot is running an exhibition advertisement sport for their game they won t change it they ll run it into the ground as the games population withers because no young kids are racing to learn this shit
golden era of eu lcs no cap
of the issues facing the lcs i think the role of imports is hugely overrated as much as lcs fans say they care about na talent the reality is they like winning bjergsen was one of the most popular players in na for a long time and he was a big reason tsm became such a hugely popular org on the flipside there was absolutely zero hype in summer for the ggs lineup despite featuring full na players and rookie talent niles and iconic i think things like na s lack of international success likey had a bigger impact than imports a team like flyquest doing well internationally would have a much bigger impact than full na teams getting d for years in a row and anecdotally impact is my favorite player in the lcs despite being imported
i think you re misunderstanding americans we really like winning more than anything else and don t really care where people come from anybody can become an american and most of our cities have very large numbers of people of asian descent anyways there are parts of la where the signs are written more in korean than in english the problem is that they aren t winning if a na team is able to win an international event then the popularity of the league would improve
i don t think it s an import issue necessarily i think it s that players essentially come across as having personality or presence they have zero showmanship either for the most part this is exacerbated for imports because new environment and new language it can be scary so they re just there to collect paycheck and play game but look at someone like c9 emenes who is garning a decent following for himself by streaming often and being interesting he s an import who gives viewers a reason to watch and care look at broadcast using his salad clips at least that s what i think na cares way more about personalities than where the player originated from even for eu imo it explains jankos s cult following dude oozes personality charisma on top of being good but as of right now i think almost all player interaction basically takes place with direct lcs content

if you watched dota2 ti some top teams are sponsored by gambling sites but then again valve gets away with gambling connections due to being held in high regard by the pc gaming community
how are we not over this dumb as shit take
omg the jackzilla
on the flip side i think top down games like mobas and rts are a a lot better for viewers jumping between multiple fps views sucks
this sub is filled with people who no longer play but still watch the pro scene almost all the popular threads are about proplay now compared to a few years ago when it was much more common to see balance threads all over the front page
it s less of a problem with a better ui my wife watches with me and in most all reminds she still has to asked about the state of the game and advantage except for lec this is because they have so many ui elements up like individual gold lead the exp bars are in now amongst others also the casters talk about those metrics on the screen she can easily look around and say so if player is kept alive in the fight they will win cause of his lead
if you don t play league it is near impossible to understand eh it definitely has a higher burden of knowledge for viewing it than an rts or a fighting game but there are enough things which are clearly visible as hype moments even without understanding too much big aoe ultimates hitting a flank solokills someone narrowly escaping a 1v2 by dodging skillshots
my spouse goes to watch games with me and can follow even without playing and when i was at worlds this year there were some newbies who had never played or seen a game who picked up what was happening clearly meanwhile i literally play valorant and i cannot follow what happens on broadcast easily at all
idk i feel like in term of game state its way easier to get whats happening like towers destroyed etc people often say fps are great spectator games cuz its easier to understand whats happening on the screen which might be true but i never have any idea whats happening outside of that players view always confuses me
i always see this but it makes no sense to me but i m also weird and don t understand how people actually enjoy shooter esports like csgo fps is just an awful way to view an esport for anything more than short clips
i mean yeah but melee viewership has been trending down for some years now this happens everytime newest smash game is dying down one of the biggest contributing factors to melee viewership is the release of a new smash game not to mention that melee viewership peaks were very reliant on evo during that time which included factors that were fgc related as a whole i dont really think its the same
as a small clarification nintendo is hostile towards ultimate e sports as well they just pulled the rug out from under the swt and caused panda to implode in the process
counter strike s esports scene has completely died in na rose up from the ashes and became 20x more successful and profitable and now is on the verge of death again i think this is a winter lol esports will survive in na but not without riot making steps to fix things and riot probably opening up their pockets to increase revenue share with the teams and help keep them afloat

during covid league hit peak numbers
that s not an esport
yeah that s what i m getting from reading the responses
relegation was so insanely hype teams fucking scrambling in order to keep from falling apart it felt like there were real stakes that a viewer could get invested in each spilt
a really interesting piece of content would be explaining the differences between lol franchising and val franchising what riot learned and why they made certain changes if you agree with the changes they made to val and if those changes actually address the issues from lol franchising and your opinion on whether lol franchising is actually a failure i ve heard you talk about franchising a lot but i think clearly franchising is a failure is the strongest take i ve seen you make about it i d be really interested to see you make a video about essentially your whole comment here
franchising was good on paper it was heavily mishandled by teams as a way for bottom teams to keep their spot while doing minimal efforts when they realized they didn t build up the right structure from the bottom pre franchising had and would always have been a way worse system both for the existing teams in lcs and the ones being promoted bottom tier lcs teams would never attract sponsors or players in the fear of being demoted so there would be a never ending gap between the winners and the losers promoted orgs were realistically just an aggregate of good players propping them up they never had a proper foundation structure to be stable within a tier league within a year or two while pre franchising may have prevented from discovering good talent that would not find a spot in a franchising era or to miss out on a new narrative hype renaissance in reality the frequency of that happening was super rare and not replicable especially since it was handled as a boosting strategy and rosters blew up once the org got into lcs it was and would have been a permanent recycling of tier orgs going up and down between lcs and challenger even if franchising is far from perfect pre franchising had way more unsolvable downsides it s the way teams used franchising that made it worse than it should have been
franchising was a band aid fix to a maintain the league structure tournament circuits with opens will always be better for competitive integrity and no names getting a chance to succeed somehow making rules surrounding selling lcs spots was more difficult than franchising i think it is disingenuous to compare the system at the infancy of the esport to the system now on a to basis
i mean they dont have infinite money to do that constantly
bad teams wanting to have better records is exactly why relegations was good
origen too
this eu is much different then na in that aspect i think the sporting culture is just to different to compare na and eu plus even when orgs like c9a try to sell their spots it is nice to see these teams fail they did not get the payout but had to pay players just much higher stakes which is cool in any sport
riot didn t care yes esports lost money but riot held the position that the leagues was pretty much advertisement and they made thier money back by adding players to the game they weren t really worried about the league being profitable until the owners pushed franchising
in turn the lec system does the same without nuking a whole teams livelihoods relegation works in the football world because x team still has hometown fans interesting what if if franchising and the lec system comes in at the same time does lcs have the same downturn
but those are european in eu franchising kinda works because they have a way more expanded and more defined structure for the lower leagues and yet it also has its issues
quite long lasting impact this lemondogs team had lasting one split lmao
the thing is you want people to be fans of the team and not the players look at all major sports in the world fans usually say there are a fan of a team first and not a player sports have longevity because it gives you something to anchor to despite generations of players aging out sports like tennis and golf have this problem where viewership fluctuates heavily depending on who is the star at the moment and that is not an easy problem to fix if everyone was only a fan of players than the lcs would have died when bjerg and dl retired no one else in the lcs had even close to the same number of fans
pls dont call it west call it na i personally am a fnatic fan from back in the days in cs iam a fan of the org not the players if they leave i dont follow them to where ever they go
t was just quiet shy kids who were really good at the game and wanted to get paid a lot of money this is on the orgs cheaping out or putting money in the wrong spots at least in pro sports players are put through media training and even things like public speaking can be part of the onboarding orientation process the more media coverage interviews all that is good stuff and they re happy to have their players do things in front of a camera lcs players seem to not even want to be on camera half the time the orgs take on new players and we only really hear from in brief select post game interviews or if broadcast wants to do a brief behind the scenes video on them these players should be streaming with the org brand and sponsors at regular intervals and teams should be visiting gaming events as a whole just to meet and greet they should be doing school events where they meet the coding team or the esport team or just hosting a sponsored event for fair day or something next the orgs should be having little exhibition days just playing the game as a whole publicly but everyone s so afraid of showing their players playing like they ll give away top secret strats that nobody does this kinda thing but this is how rivalries storylines develop not between orgs but the people within them great example is the broadcast doing the 1v1s with players why tf do we not have intra or inter org matches like that they could play freaking aram together and it would be hilarious
riot has mentioned that they will implement this feature in the coming future on their end of year season last time so yes you can delight yourself with korean lisandra

as far as gameplay goes vel koz is and will always be my boy he doesn t feel like playing any other champion but sadly riot forgets he exists lorewise it has to be kindred or renata glasc though fiddle is cool as hell too
leblanc i feel like whatever the situation may be there is always a way to outplay it with leblanc if played to her fullest potential that s what motivates me to play her
gameplay aphelios lore and character design azir cause shurima will once again stretch to the horizon
rylai the crystal maiden
kindred or aatrox
jhin and poppy they have such style in their kit and don t know exactly how to explain it but feel like two sides of the same coin both are extremely steadfast in their approach one from ocd and the other from determination and loyalty jhin deals tons of damage from afar and speeds away poppy negates incoming damage and slows the approach and their core mechanic feels so satisfying the forth shot on jhin stuffing an enemy dash engage with poppy i cant say enough cause i ll start to gush at the character design and emotions these two bring
idk i don t have a favorite bel veth because i like to farm i tried samira very recently and she might become my new auto lock adc because goddamn is she ever a blast to play in terms of voice acting its renata glasc because debra wilson is the god of voice acting
shen i like how low key he is protective bodyguard who doesn t need to be the center of attention can just go to work and protect your pals i also like his kit how simple yet strong it is when you have items a great duelist as well as frontline with engages that require skill to pull off he s very unique although i wish there were more faceless chad s like him in game
tryn he s mad like me playing this shit game
zed cause of the laughter on r yasuo cause of sound effect on r in nightbringer skin
akali and udyr were my first mains back in the day really miss the pre rework akali because current akali makes me confused as hell
riven badass warrior sword lady with cool combos and no fanservice bs lorewise still badass but also tragic and conflicted with a deep personality trying to make amends for her mistakes when she belived the wrong things
sona got mana press all the buttons
karma i love her gameplay versatility and almost everyone over of her skins she s something cool with her design and lore wise i ve always liked ionia so it was a toss up between her and irelia and karma just edges her out cause i play karna and i don t play irelia
i don t even know the backstories to the champions any more they keep changing i swear some have changed like times fucking rito
jhin was the first champion i was truly hyped for the release of and the concept of the champion and how it feeds through to gameplay just felt so nice
lore wise kennen despite the limited amount we know gameplay wise ashe has my ideal fantasy
if it wasn t obvious samira she s really fun to play and also hot
my main is nami her kit is so well rounded she first everywhere it s insanly good and high skill cap that s for gameplay mechanics for the aesthetics i would probably go with kindred for the attitude vex depression is top notch lorewise i m not that much into it jinx because of arcane is probably my first guess
vayne because she embodies everything that i like in one character whether it be her lore or kit i m just absolutely in love with everything she has to offer and if i could only play one champ forever it s definitely vayne
asol his rework awakened something inside me
i like yasuo yone storyline since its more relatable and humane compared to others
akshan his personality and gameplay are
pyke because he s hot
eve
zed and gragas because of skill setup
samira because life is short aurelion saul because i m not the property of the targon yone because i m alive
azir renekton and nasus for lore gameplay wise whoever is meta and fun to play i guess tahm kench will always have a special place in my heart tho
aurelion sol the real one not the fake one we currently have
sylas because i want to make lux my bitch like he did
zed
rumble burn
shaco because its shaco he has no lore
syndra the unlimited potential her kits is fun and feels powerful and she s some pretty interesting lore though her vo is sorely lacking zeri just feels fun af like zooming around and arching lightening everywhere is crazy irelia between her lore and her gameplay it s all cohesive and well done dashing around the battlefield and weaving in aa s feels like dancing and took swain s arm and almost his life she s just
aurelion sol watch his teaser and he will be your favourite character too
aesthetic kindred gameplay azir and yasuo
vladimir and kassawin
fizz because fish
shaco got the greatest backstory cho gath got the greatest model zac is a blob and kai sa s suit can come off all of them are equally great
personally i m a huge identity crisis enjoyer so i used rng to choose my main and it gave me zac so it must be zac just zac
bel veth because of her gameplay
the boss
fiddlesticks cuz he s ridiculous and says funny stuff
twitch because he can pissglide on turbolows
ziggs each of his abilities has a twist that makes it fun to use while still being fair and exploding turrets is the also the most satisfying thing ever
seraphine she is so relatable
lore wise its kayn and rhaast darkin lore will always be my favorite
pool party graves because he s hot af
nunu and willump heroes don t need hugs willump noises okay they re not looking now bring it in you big fursnarggle
something never gets old about wall jumping i guess
kled his voicelines are great he s a little angry furball who knows he s the greatest also ornn man just want to grill forge but braum stole his fucking door and now people keep bothering him
viego gameplay wise and sylas story wise there s nothing quite like a certified viego moment
lore and voicelines pantheon gameplay azir
gameplay and lore yorick great backstory and solves his problems with a shovel purely for the voicelines and looks corporate mundo one of the best skins in any game i ve played edit formatting
twisted fate he s chill as fuck and burning tides is the best league story ever written x200b that or gangplank because burning tides is the best league story ever written
teemo he helps me count up to
kha zix is by far my most favorite since he was announced i love his lore his gameplay his voicelines his skills the whole aspects of adaption is awesome also i always loved the hints on him and rengar being a homage of the alien vs predator universe as someone who loves the alien movies this fits even better other honorable mentions i really like are fiddle sinne his rework as i like the spooky aspects they game him and how well they integrated it into his lore voice and design i also like azir and the whole lore of the shiruma story they are very nice
lux is my favorite for a multitude of reasons she s very positive in game and her voice lines help me not tilt she s willing to challenge the current structures of society on behalf of doing what s right by those around her her skills allow for flexible itemization from game to game and different playstyle options she s beautiful and i love her these are the main reasons but the list goes on
i would say kindred loved it since came out everything fits well the art design the lore the quotes the representation of death through a lamb and a wolf the eternal hunters love it then i go and play all my games as a minion like ninja thats basically that a ninja xd
ornn
sylas for both
jayce best gameplay ranged melee
lore pantheon and kindred gameplay xayah overall thresh
the old hunchback talon who supposedly be ish but sounds like yrs old dude
aurelion sol he s a literal god breathed being formless taking the form of a dragon in place of he who must not be named because the beings of creation perceive him as so or maybe i m just thinking too much into it and he s just a magical dragon that can create stars
jhin for the theme kindred for the quotes and fiddlesticks for the execution
lore wise obviously it is his highness the high major commodore of the first legion third multiplication double admiral artillery vanguard company or simply known as kled
nasus his lore and gameplay fit together so perfect the lore of a patient strategic general a gameplay that rewards you for playing patient and defensive in order to farm and take over the game
nocturne and kassadin
aesthetic wise for me rengar new pantheon lucian fizz ziggs braum and gnar are top tier and i think nail the vibe league has going for it and set it apart from most games to me gameplay wise zoning control mages like ziggs velkoz veigar and ori have been my favorite since i started way back in season
i love irelia my q button hates her tho
twisted fate first time i saw him back in i said to myself yeah throwing card in my opponents faces is kinda rad
qiyana
shaco i hate the game
pyke i love bilgewater i like his character he looks cool i main support and his playstyle is fun
i have too many some i play more than others xayah s my most played and probably favorite champ in the game love the feathers mechanic and killing somebody offscreen with e when they don t pay attention to feather placement ornn he s my go to champ whenever i play top lane loved his teaser and his stories are really neat his ult sound is amazing too very fun kit for a tank i don t play him nearly enough but jhin his theme fits him perfectly i love his classic splash a lot just cause it s so interesting to look at the va did a fantastic job his kit is neat and his fourth shot is incredibly satisfying especially when ahead i started watching taco recently and his jhin is incredible and lots of fun to watch i like how chill he is usually and he s pretty funny also the cowboy frog is adorable
character and gameplay both viego i think he has a cool design i like his back story and his tragic but entitled personality but mostly i have straight up never had more fun in the game that getting a penta by stealing all souls and using their abilities to secure the next one that gives me a rush like no other pure dopamine

the blg team immediately went to the dressing room after getting knocked out of the upper bracket tabe behind long faces shaking heads on cheers up the dejected elk and bin yells through the dressing room what a load of sh t man edit elk thanks truzon
knight vs yagao always delivers
what a disgusting throw by blg and i dont mean xun running it down in game i meant not banning zeri in game
wtf happened blg were so close but they gave zeri twice rough series from jdg all things considered hopefully they bounce back blg were so close but they threw it by giving zeri and not team fighting properly in game but they definitely proved they are a strong team and hopefully can bounce back
bin really smurfed every game just to throw the entire series at the end
elk making that play without ie was stupid as hell
that bin teleport to the ward in the jungle and failed hookshot over the wall lost them the game lol
xun solo list game in mid they were in good position
jdg still winning from behind nothing really changed
daylight robbery this pissed me off so fucking much
i was enjoying game until one of the casters started talking about how they don t find archer funny but think rick and morty is a fantastic show i think i actually recoiled more after hearing such a bad take than did after getting camped top
a certain butthole remains to be not penetraited by a dildo
jdgwin
what a fucking nailbiter needs to int a bit less though
felt like blg were the best team in of games tough on them
why did they give ruler zeri man
xun doing raptors after soloing drake 30mins into the game is pretty wild also insanely depressing the game just insta ends like that
trolling didn t matter i guess
if you told me this game was matchfixing i would believe you wtf just happened
jdg got away with murder overall they looked pretty damn bad unfortunate that blg couldn t close
no way it ends like this lmao
bin seriously got every single advantage he could ve gotten but then his alipay was updated the last minute
hmm blg what
why contest the baron wtf man
go watch bin s last minutes bro was paid
win soul to immediately lose the game after getting wiped at baron what a roller coaster
binnnn wtffffff
both xun and bin inting hard at the end lmao
highway fuxking robbery if zeri is banned all games this is a
better donate his salary to the other
xun with the biggest choke of his career jesus christ wtf was that
what an anticlimactic ending blg s objective takes looks so sus
most fraudulent win i ve ever seen
people will focus on the zeri when in reality it s the wukong pick that decided it all when will people realize he s the most op jungler in this meta it was the only champ that was actually a good meta champ in game for jdg and oh surprise he carried them hard well it s actually kind of surprise because oh boy did that draft seem terrible
ggwp to blg but jdg s resiliency seriously just showed off why they re considered the best
thank u brother xun
bruh jdg one of those need zeri to win kind of team not impressed
really made up for the entire series with that single empowered w on bin at the baron fight blg still showed lots of promise today shoulda banned zeri tho hope they can bounce back from losers bracket by cleaning up their gameplay and make it to msi
was getting gapped and camped in lane but man he was in every teamfight
blg played objectively better this entire series they just mega choked in both game and game sad that they won t be advancing instead of these jdg frauds
top gap
what the fuck did you do that for blg whatever we go lower bracket run xun go london
really should have just gave the baron game state wasn t that bad
hopefully teams will stop giving ruler zeri
someone needs to tell blg that baron is a really powerful buff lmao
nice throw blg jdg were looking like frauds for the whole series but blg came in clutch by throwing at the last minute lmao
even though jdg won the series i don t think they actually came out looking like the better team here games and were completely gifted to them by blg through baron throws after blg ran circles around them leading up to that and we saw again that ruler is still super reliant on zeri to be impactful and that missing is just not on good form was also extremely poor in lane and kanavi just wasn t good for most the series
i had pretty much lost hope for jdg in that game seemed so hard to get close to blg with yagaos galio ult threatning and luckily xun had some horrible positions knights syndra is the best in the world and props to for zoning away elk in the last couple of fights
even though was just picking for team fights in most of the games bin still kinda dominated the lanes given that was the ultimate weak side top last season one thing i do appreciate about though is that it literally doesn t matter how bad he performs in lane he pretty much dominated team fights comparing to what bin did in those fights in the games that they lost bin was legit doing nothing in team fights despite going into those engagements with big leads in lane gwen got one shot by annie his second jax game was meh compared to game and in game he kept going in alone or too early and just cost the series for blg as a whole it feels like blg just seems more coordinated with their map movements every time someone engages in sidelanes you just know the rest of the team is coming can t say that for jdg because for some reasons ruler is always late to fights omg unironically has a more realistic shot to get to msi now if jdg blg plays like this
if zeri is banned that s a quick
game is a banger
omg easy win
can t believe it ended like this
every day at tsm lpl is a banger
we might ve lost but top gap and my molecule predictions are saved so gg
bgl was legit lpl bds this series they won early game but have catastrophic event happening every mid game
what a throw by xun when elk flash ult and he went straight to renekton stun and bin they have this in the bag
yagao vs knight will always be a fucking banger
huge engages from kanavi in game also forgot everything except teamfighting i think he played the last few fights really well despite his start knight ruler did their jobs as carries towards the end that was the jdg i loved from worlds even when down in gold at a disadvantage their teamfighting was so good they could just win
jdg wins msi
if this is what the best team from lpl can offer then you might as well just give the worlds trophy to t1 already lck can play coordinated way better i suggest jdg to stop going to international tournaments just to embarrass themselves first it s dwg then suning and t1 and disappoint their fans again and again what a waste of everyone s time lmao s
knight is easily the best syndra in the world right now
no blg my heart
top diff
blg were winning until they weren t
now that was a close match
good lord what a throw blg played like they were the aggressors and it came back to bite them
brother bin is back
what kind of bint was that wtf
he binned it lads
every game blg got early lead but throw in mid game because of poor vision setup jdg shouldn t be happy because they look weaker compare to last year summer jdg
rolled in the end
what a banger no way jdg should have won that final game but they clutched it and blg kinda choked it
no lead is safe when you have xun on your team just ask rookie about it
i really thought that game was doomed for jdg but somehow they made it on one side they looked very shaky for a supposed team but on other side they managed to win even with having a horrible series
check bin s paypal
damn blg how dumb can you be at that baron river fight i thought this was a semi final not a ultra prime game
when was the last time knight plays yagao without going to games i m convinced they planned this just to play more games against one another
casters on this series so ass
if zeri was banned every game it would have been a for blg at most considering they would throw a game in the blg fashion like i m not even mad at xun and bin mega ints in game i m genuinely more frustrated at how they let zeri through in game jdg without zeri is significantly worse
idk how blg lose the last game but they did they looked strong until they weren t
man jdg looked rough but that s what happens when you don t play for weeks plus they aren t really that much better than the other teams remaining it s a new squad they need time to develop
man this lpl playoffs are so hype can t wait to see omg beat these noobs from jdg and edg
fraud win
xun lost this game they really lost the game cause of prioritising the clown soul over baron
bin and xun you two donkeys god dammit
xun and elk played so well all series only to make two of the biggest game throwing griefs in back to back fights in game
jdg deserved to lose purely for that r5 renekton
jdg wins despite the awful performance from but at least he is useful during teamfight unlike bin on the other hand
jdg were terrible they definitely didn t deserve to win but oh well
so anti climactic casting series ends like that is so sad when blg were the better team today by far
i refuse to believe this isn t matchfixing
one more series
holy throwly
what a monumental throw with that last call you had the soul blg just reset and defend the baron waves my god
yes
free69 at least he showed up massively in teamfights
wtf was elk doing going melee on a team that has abundance of cc lel truly 0head
blg can still qualify right
a perfect example of if it ain t broke don t fix it
they must fire the designer who chose the red one
the away red is so fucking bright now
the away color is so aggressive now tho
was it a needed change not really that said i really like it lol
the away has been changed too much better now
oh i dislike it it s so bright now i liked the old one better
the away text is straight up menacing now it s like my friends list is angry at me
fr i had to restart my client cause i had no idea if something was bugged or not
also a lot of native sounding names might not sound unique to you a westerner but i d say of lec has ign that is somehow related to the player s name right now
deokdam nuguri mata kuro malrang gumayusi though gumayusi from what i understand is just random gibberish name though still not english from what i heard their esport naming convention started with starcraft where certain popular players just use random english word as ig then the trend started to grew popularity
lpl players are in china which is a relatively isolated country culturally speaking and korea is heavily influenced by western nations
a lot of lpl players igs is just their names or random things they like like xlb steamed buns same way it is in eu in korea they translate words or their names to english as well
kaiser perkz patrik larssen kobbe adam finn jankos oscarinin are just some of them i don t dislike all of them but using your first name as your pro name never seemed cool
wow i was expecting someone to give a number name example but not a a major region player playing this season i don t watch the lec but that s a pretty strange name yeah but i do see players from all major regions at worlds and i have noticed a trend that lpl players often stand out
its most of the well known sc1 players you have flash rain queen zero barracks firebathero etc
kuro and mata are inspired from other people kuro is the most interesting one because it is the combination of mokuza and froggen
also bo trymbi jeonghoon markoon and mersa i actually really like using your own name for the ign but only if it gets tweaked somehow adam going by adam is still the funniest thing to me
i don t dislike all of them but using your first name as your pro name never seemed cool there s a smite pro whose tag is just paul which i love but also i think part of that is that he s a super flashy midlaner and the name is just so bland
awful take that s his ability passives are supposed to be good things not downsides
pretty sure other champs can get farm and kills after dying with any passive burns or active items like redemption
yeah i mean i get the frustration but that s just how his champion works it s what makes him unique
i d rather rito reworks this disgusting gimmick
it shouldn t give full life steal hitting creeps either sion can effectively never be punished because you can t zone him off the wave after fighting him since you lifely have no cool downs definitely busted resource and tempo wise but not so much outside of that adding to this early death timers are way too low killing someone in the first levels doesn t set them behind as much as it should and just drains resources
from my experience on oce it looked like the queue wasn t even working it would never go into champ select and if you tried to remove yourself from the queue the x button wouldn t work and i had to restart the client
fixes are now live in eun and deploying to oc and ru there were three pretty impactful issues that would affect queue times as well as causing people to get stuck in infinite queues will see how it s going after a few hours of the fixes being out
maybe this will lead to them finally looking at the root of the problem which is the normal draft matchmaking mmr being too tight even on na if i soloq normal draft i have minute queues without fail just because my norms mmr is too high reason for there to be such a high priority on mmr in norms as long as i m not going against a fresh new player or bronze silver players it should not matter
if you re having coding issues in regards to the oce client trying putting the code in upside down
deleted
sometimes i dont understand league players they want good matchmaking but they also dont want to wait longer smh meanwhile las server could be merged with br and have magnificent queue time and matchmaking but riot doesnt want cos diferent language and cos might get some las staff fired smh no wonder las queue times are everyday longer since most ppl xfering to br
reason i almost don t play league anymore long ass queue times i barely have 2hrs in a given a day to play games i can t be sitting for mins queueing up for a damn unranked blind pick game even then it tends to have a smurf or two or completely unbalanced teams just let me play quickly an extra 18mins of queue counting dodged and people missing the ok button and remakes cause of the typical first minute afk guy champ select and loading per game is just too much of a time hog then waiting all that to get a troll purposefully afking to not give the enemies anymore kills cause i rather lose than give those idiots kills is just soul crushing i really like lol as a game but the whole matchmaking experience is dreadful and every time i try to come back to the game it feels worse playing on lan is just awful normal games should be near instant queue times when there are millions of players put high elo players on each side that s it it s not ranked we all don t have hours free time a day to sit and wait for a damn queue get your shit together no other online game i play has this issue whatsoever lol is too popular for this shit
thank goodness oce here and queuing on avg 30mins for a single norms is ridiculous i m legit in queue for longer than i m playing hopefully this is fixed before the pass ends so i can continue grinding for tokens because it s impossible to rn
the thing that pisses me off the most is the new role changes i can no longer queue support top which is incredibly frustrating since i don t enjoy playing adc at all i play the game casually and being shoved into a role which just isn t fun has been making me want to play the game way less
so thats why we got so many mentals on euw suddenly
please leave it as it is really hate being autofilled several times in a row
why is there even a russian server at this point russia is at a self proclaimed war against the whole western world why does riot tencent china offer their services to russia
what about na i waited min in soloq then canceled to play blind min and counting now
on eune i had a minute queue yesterday had to quit and restart got a minute qurue right after
the client has been even worse than normal in oce every minutes it will go into trying to reconnect and this will happen in champ select sometimes forcing a dodge as well as this being in a party is buggy as hell most of the times the displayed roles aren t accurate and often one member of the party will not join the queue resulting in no possible way to accept a match it s just so ridiculously buggy right now
yep this is part of what we re fixing
maybe a long shot but is there anyway you can look into normal mmr for oce my friends and i are plat gold and we consistently have 10min queues before this patch and queue into high diamonds and masters and get stomped why is gold plat consistently matched with d instead of bronze silver gold
please stop matching man premades against solo players on oce there is no situation where this is fair and all players involved would rather wait in queue i understand that because it is a small playerbase it is hard to create balanced games in normals it has become whoever has a man premade wins even if the enemy team has a duo or a trio
even with the fixes queue times have seemed awful still which is understandable with autofill being removed but it doesn t feel good to have your servers normal draft mode absolutely butchered for a patch or more for a test it just makes me not want to queue up until the test is finished removed
are you guys aware of what s going on with a massive amount of players crashing randomly in game i ve sent a ticket to the support but it seems they don t know what s going on and i ve still not see a message from riot about it
fix the game randomly crashing a lot of people is complaining about it including myself
any chance you guys would look at fixing queue times in high mmr norms like shown below https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12ctbsv/riotauberaun_on_long_queue_times_in_oce_eune_and/jf48jty/)
thats weird usually my normal draft queues are minutes and i quite often end up playing against master players my peak is plat i know normals mmr is separate from ranked mmr but normals matchmkaing doesnt seem that strict to me
nah it s a technical bug not a matchmaking issue
what s your mmr my friend group s normals mmr averages out to silver gold sometimes with some platinums thrown in whenever matchmaking throws a diamond alkali yasuo etc onetrick into the mix it instantly becomes a miserable game you may think it doesn t matter because it s just normals but the majority of the playerbase has no fun playing against people like that
i have similar problems both in blind and draft normals my queue is always at least 7min long usually 10min and i end up with multiple d4 players and often masters myself being unranked plat player since i don t have time to grind rankeds anymore
euw used to have huge stability issues due to being too large euw is already the biggest western server adding more population would definitely cause trouble again
i mean even riot admits that minutes ques in silver even without autofill are not due to the change but some other issues
if you queue normal games you shouldn t expect games to be equally matchmade i gave up on playing normal games because each takes minutes of queue because of the mmr i d rather play the game and lose every game in minutes than not play at all it s so depressing you have to either play aram or ranked if you don t want to wait for minutes
that is literally impossible with the normal system unless for some reason you believe getting your second role is autofill which it is not
huge playerbase different language same reasons they made the turkish servers too
what a stupid question to ask about a chinese owned company
the queue changes weren t shipped to na so this issue is not affecting na
on oce the client seems to go into attempting to reconnect a lot since the last patch weirdly when grouped it will cycle between a few of us one at a time preventing us from queueing for a few mins
why don t you change it so that when i que for flex in na with two of my friends we don t have a minute que just to be placed against platinum players as a group silvers
oce is one of the servers with the smallest playerbase unfortunately that just means less pool of players available and less likely to find similarly skilled opponents
bruh i m in silver in oce got queued into rank on the server days ago lmao
silver oce i have a game recently vs a diamond fizz and also a challenger fizz main op gg here https://www.op.gg/summoners/oce/i%2bnever%2broam/matches/eq3kyfixtgvic6fs3dupce8qfmhv-htu/1677833932000)
normals mmr is disconnected from ranked mmr after initial ranked placement so those master s players you have been matched against may not play normals very often while they are masters in ranked they might have much lower normals mmr
decided to queue up norms for the first time in months in order to prove it got off work and got my first pop minutes and seconds https://imgur.com/a/bbbczzp) in luckily no dodges i m used to having at least one i queued support to try out milio but they first picked it i m about wins over losses https://imgur.com/a/ldwvhqw) in normals i ve been playing on this account for or so years i just want to be able to progress champion mastery and challenges like everyone else and also not int first timing champs in ranked i ve never tryharded in normals i just try to win and play wacky builds for fun usually i have a folder for high queue times actually but i stopped adding to it because it was too bothersome to do every single queue and also they got me to stop playing league because of the queues so good job riot here are some more screens with dates and times https://imgur.com/a/tswfdpj) https://imgur.com/a/efm1bjw)
my experience used to be the same as his when i played norms on euw in at least at certain times of day just to mostly face plat diamonds anyway
it really just depends on your game spread i play essentially only with friends and we win a lot more than we lose we very rarely play ranked our normal mmr has gotten wildly out of control we re queuing for minutes just to get matched against diamond grandmaster players when the highest any of us has peaked is plat
deleted
oh yea i mean secondary role i was actually really happy that playing duo now actually guarantees that you get to play your role i guess people didn t really like that because of longer queues
turkey is not waging war against europe and usa according to their state sponsored tv channels
yeah idk i m with that guy my q times today are minutes for norms even arams are taking longer like min avg
this happened to me a couple times last night opening up cmd and going ipconfig release ipconfig renew either did nothing and i got lucky for a queue to pop before the client crapped itself or it fixed it only played game so didn t get to test properly
me too but i thought it was just my internet but it could be that too
big problem for me too
what works for me and my friend is that we just kinda leave it for a minute and it resolves itself for the rest of the session really weird and annoying
agreed
play more games and your flex mmr will be somewhat more accurate man queues are hard to fill groups with so the mmr disparities will be worse or you d have minute queues
min queue times are still really weird just like the comment you re replying to i m on oce roughly similar elo mostly play normal draft solo and with friends and for me queue times rarely go over a few minutes even outside of peak hours
hes not a fizz main i verse him plenty of times i literally cant queue into him because im a zed main and he s oce s best lissandra i literally op gg until he s in a game literally impossible to play against him sometimes i get into game vs him and i win but i have like a winrate vs him literally impossible man
trust me u dont want shorter q times riot will matchmake the most bullshit games with unfair premade parity
well hey faker only started playing ranked because his norms queue times were getting too long so yall are walking in his steps
time of day probably makes a huge difference i mostly play after like 7ish est because i m a worker
me when i forget that different games have different playerbases and amounts of players
and russia and china are allies china owns all of riot games
is games a day for the past years not enough
extended queue times tend to be down to stuff like smurf queue or a new acc im also in the same position where it never takes more than a few mins for a game to pop
every game is literally already unbalanced and over in minutes in normals anyway it makes no difference lol
yes i know still it s an ethical aspect riot employees from western countries should consider same as people who work for gazprom
most companies have some ties with china theres no way to avoid it youd be hard pressed to find a good job that pays well for a company that has relations to china
i mean i never feel like it s the team but on my alt that i use to practice top i just can t win with camille no idea why i have like a wr on her while every other top champ i can atleast pull a when i use her i m basically guaranteed to lose
janna no questions asked
i m just here to make fun of that comma like come on
mordekaiser for some reason i can t play him any better these days i always suck playing him
i started shyvana with a game losing streak haven t won with lilia yet because she can t hard carry and relies on teammates

it s simply the skill of multitasking and doing a lot of stuff at once in lane you need to move your character cs space pay attention to your opponent think about the wave and then also pay attention to what happens on the map and where junglers are it isn t an easy skill to learn all you can do is remind yourself of those things again and again until it happens automatically most league players will never be able to do everything at once support for example is easier in that regard because you remove some tasks and can focus on the ones you have like map movement or effective laning
so i play jungle reached master in solo q last season and this season and played competitive in prime league most of the concepts you use in the game you create outside of playing ok for me at least so if i learn something new lets say when to give drakes i learn that in yt videos or in a review with the team or with a coach i know that some people without a team or coach just review their games on their own when you rewatch you can look at every decision you made and you can access if it was correct because now you have more time to think about it when it comes to playing in champ select and loading screen i have to do the most important work i set myself rules like i dont gank mordekaiser after he hits or that i want to try to play agressive lvl because the enemy vi is not a champ at lvl i look at every lane match up see who wins on their own who has prio who offeres set up and which enemies are ungankable like janna ezreal all this helps me to make smarter decisions in the game quicker i wont auto path bot and gank janna and so on and there is one more big thing informatoin gathering so if someone breaks down a situation for you then you understnad it and it becomes obvious sometimes like that shyvanna cant gank ahri these conclusions you can also take if you confront yourself with the information more often in the game how do you do that create a list of questions that you want to answer for your self before every game starts grow a habit of checking on what your teammates and enemies are doing in league and in tft on your enemies its called scouting you can use f keys or rebind them to keys that are easier to reach use them at least once every seconds every min you can look at your teams icons to see who has ult up you press tab and see your teams sums you see the enemies items and your teams items and who is strong right now and who is not so strong and you check the chat if enemy sums got pinged and every time you check on information try to draw a conclusion like ok my jungler is fed and has ult when he is around i can bait play agressive enemy mid has no flash for mins still i ping that and i ping my vis ult so that she comes i forgot one thing besides setting desision making rules you should also have an idea what to play for like is it to shove the wave to recall or is it baron right now how do you win the game this helps not to get lost and to fall for stupid random fights its true in every game in tft you also ask yourself for which place you are playing for top4 a first i hope i gave you some insights np
i label it gamestate tracking knowledge application and being able to have multiple concurrent plans in your head and track the development of them based on all other player s general moves you can get better by just being aware you lacked this and actively asking things eventually it becomes internal like do you know what every other player s champion wants to do roughly in this draft what matchups lanes are expected to win what does that mean for your team for post laning what does this mean for itemization what are the defeat and win conditions what does the enemy want to do right now is taking that fight worth it or better to force something else
hey my answer will be a little different because i m a beginner lol player but i have an interesting example from another game that might be useful and forgive me for my bad english it s not my native language i was an active overwatch player some time ago after a year of playing i decided to try streaming because i found it interesting i ve always been a pretty average player and i knew about a lot of things that need to be remembered controlled because i saw it on streams of high ranking players but i forgot it in my games and played on autopilot concentrating on my gameplay but when i started streaming i had to say something all the time you have too few viewers to maintain a dialogue on abstract topics but at any moment someone can come to the stream and you should interest a potential viewer so i decided to just analyze and comment on everything that happens in the game i almost didn t concentrate on describing my actions but rather focused on the general situation around me and my skill instantly grew something similar applies to any game you don t have to start streaming just start commenting on all the actions i strongly advise you to do it out loud it really increases your concentration several times i hope i was able to help you
hey thanks for taking the time and for the detailed response it does help yeah so it s a matter of constantly forcing yourself to pay attention and just learning through experience i kind of got stuck in the fact that well i always knew ahri s and shyvanna s kit but the final conclusiom never ocurred to me and i kept wondering why so these are developed from asking yourself questions and learning outside of the game i feel like it might also be an issue with attention span too which i also hope is something that can be developed i feel like this kinda thing is important not only for league and games in general but also everyday life as a whole any more tips on how to get better at doing it
but how do i even start answering these questions am i supposed to know the answer from experience by deducing it by myself or looking up somewhere and for other games how do you figure out which questions to even ask in the first place
i m not native either friend you re all good and i appreciate your comment it s kinde weird that focusing and talking about the game itself helps you get better but that makes sense i see a lot of streamers do it and i don t know how they manage to play and talk explain and think at the same time i m not sure i can do it maybe with practice i guess focusing on talking about the game helps you pay attention to the macro i dunno but either way thank you
post game analysis with replay go through and try to identify what that player was trying to do did it match your thinking or post about it on r summonerschool to get advice second opinions or ask better friends you eventually build up your knowledge base which you will use as experience to draw from eventually you ll pick up enough to make your own conclusions in other matches given how many matchups there are in the game for other games in general smash bros shooting games the general first question is to ask what you need to win then you just keep breaking it down a lot of it is imo pattern recognition after you encounter the same broad kind of archetypes enough times
haha i understand that this may sound a little strange and i can t explain it properly even for myself but i think there are main reasons why it works if you play on autopilot then you already have a comfortable micro for you you no longer need to concentrate so much on your gameplay and play your game most likely you get a lot of information about what is happening in the game but do not analyze it therefore from the position of a player who is in the chaos of what is happening around him it is useful to take the position of an observer you may notice that streamers and commentators usually watch all the events in dynamics if a player performs some action then there is a reason why he does it and there is an end goal that he wants to achieve this is a huge amount of information and of course you cannot predict everything that is happening but even a small part of what you have analyzed can have a big impact on your game and the best way for this type of thinking is to constantly ask yourself questions for example what does my teammate want to do why is he moving there what is my opponent s style of play what can i expect from him in a fight who has what items what impact can this have on the game in order for this to be effective it is worth spending some time watching streamers who comment on their game because they pay attention to things that you haven t even thought about so it should become a habit imagine yourself as a commentator who needs to tell the audience about what is happening in the game now you just farm on the line and nothing happens so it s time to look at the minimap and find out who is doing what think about matchups characters items player psychology be confident in yourself imagine yourself as a professional player or commentator who watches and analyzes the game remember that even a bad game of your teammates is information for you for example someone plays too aggressive and someone gets skillshots badly how can you adjust your gameplay to their game the amount of information you can get and an understanding of how you can apply it will come with the experience of such gameplay
interesting point about vc backed teams vs traditional sports backed teams
people can shit on tsm all they want but the most popular org leaving lcs is gonna be the death of this league just look at other teams subs pretty much no activity aside from c9 this is just the beginning of a massive shit storm
why does everyone talk about esports as a monolith the talk about esports being profitable in years is irrelevant will league be profitable in years is the real question that s like investing in a spikeball league because traditional sports do well
interesting they hinting the spot is worth more now than in i have no idea of how to evaluate this but this split makes it obvious of it s loss of value compared to previous iterations it seems it s possible msg left without losing much money if any
very valid points about tsm s shambolic running of league of legends including reginald s barefaced lie about selling all he owns to be better than clg then proceeding to sell the team glad we can see what a fraud that guy is
awesome episode
thorin is annoying but monte has so much knowledge that s why i listen to this podcast
gross
commenting to note that we now have bong advertisements in esports
which time stamp that sound really interesting
i thought you were exaggerating but wow they really all do have borderline dead subreddits clgs was incredibly active in comparison to most of them
not a big fan of tsm but tsm and league are deeply rooted together i m just worried regi trying to leave lcs will be faced with much worse repercussions
subreddit are only one of the multiple metrics not every team like to engage on reddit lmfao some prefers twitter discord youtube etc
regi had no intention of losing his own money better jump the ship
brand recognition is transferable between titles which sponsors care about
league isn t gonna exist in years lol by that point we ll either be playing league or playing the mmo
everybody is hoping for a hit like padel
i am pretty sure regi decided to leave lol because his relationship with riot is terrible i highly doubt tsm is so badly managed that they can t afford to pay for a team in the esport that they made their brand off of between the whole ftx sponsorship and his year ban i wouldn t be surprised that regi is leaving both lol and valorant out of spite why else would tsm pivot out of lol now and enter csgo tsm hasn t even had a cs team in years not to mention a cs team s salary would be comparable to a low tier lcs team budget
i think it s safe to say at this point that thorin and monte won the holy war after all
i m glad we have people like them willing to cover any story criticize anyone and burn any bridge i just wish they were less insufferable because their sniveling and condescension turns alot of people away from what are generally good points or important stories
thorin is just goofy but the constant shouting masks it lol at some point you get used to it and if you don t take him seriously it actually provides entertainment value the only annoying thing is that sometimes he overchews on some of his takes for many episodes at a time so you basically hear the same take for weeks lol
tbf they don t even need to pretend to be family friendly which thank christ because all the silent bleeps that are becoming super prevalent for swear drive me up the wall
perfect target audience
tldw for anyone who doesn t wanna watch the thought is that traditional sports owners who are in it now can afford to take losses because they have so much money that gaining knowledge of brand space for next years will be well worth it when esports is bigger msg probably bought in after seeing clg win at msg and went seems good but didn t really put in any effort into the relationship
started pretty early in like minutes or minutes in
it s like the whole first section
yeah it s no exaggeration anytime i d try to lurk on another teams sub if they make a roster move or win a close game etc there s just nothing sort by new and the newest post is days old
because others teams don t care that much about subreddit
i ve been a big fan of tsm since season so i am obviously biased but imagine being the ceo of tsm trying to land the ftx deal and riot trying to pull the rug out from you and essentially steal the deal then when that fails gimp that team to not be allowed to use the ftx branding resulting in none of that money being allocated to the lcs team i would leave lcs as quickly as possibly fuck that granted their is some irony in all this because ftx turned out to be a fraud but nonetheless it doesn t change what riot s intentions were toward tsm
clg has views on average on yt
i don t think this is as powerful as the current esports industry would like to be honest people want to watch the best no matter whose shirt they re wearing
this doesn t make sense but please explain how buying into the lcs will generate revenue from sponsorships for a team in other titles enough revenue to counter act losing money in the lcs
it is really up the korean and chinese population to be honest if lol is gonna still be around
tsm didn t get a real val spot so i m sure that soured the relationship even more
most of the upper management left in so yes it is now even more badly managed its the same story as elon musk and twitter
the fuck did they actually do though
ah yes two toxic awful individuals are heroes for their holy war against another toxic individual reddit is weird
the holy war was against doublelift and leena and they lost that war by burning the bridge against who could ve been their greatest ally vs tsm so doublelift got to make videos and streams gossiping and they were left dry
they are adults in a community of children and it shows it s a hour podcast but for some reason their personalities is more important to some
yea your take is on point
another thing that s annoying about him is that he creates a narrative that has nothing to do with what people are generally thinking like after the second week this split when vitality lost some games people were memeing and shit but the majority of people didn t really think vitality was bad at least not on this sub he went on a tangent about how people are overreacting by calling vitality bad and how everyone is flaming upset which makes no sense because he was their best player but no one flamed upset people generally flamed bo and perkz somewhat so that gets annoying
true i just thought it was funny
anybody who paid attention and listened to former employees and players knows that msg was a cancer they went out in the most pathetic way possible by panic selling as soon as they saw tsm pull out it s sad about the clg brand and history but at least they take msg with them
i have watched pretty much every lec game for the past few years and been watching lol longer then that its basically replaced football for me because i cba to setup pay sky sports an exorbitant amount to watch my team times a month don t think i have visited an lec teams subreddit during that time maybe fnc s once or twice due to iwilldominate but basically i come here and i think most league fans are the same there isn t much reason to go to a teams subreddit the drama information all gets posted here anyway
not sure if this is that true to an extent yes performance matters but then you have teams like tsm who fell off in recent years but still had a really strong fanbase sentinels in valorant who still broke viewership records while performing like clowns etc then you have teams like flyquest who made top for multiple splits or eg who have won a lot and i wouldn t say either of those teams have strong fanbases
he s talking about fans of an org in one esport following that same org in another esport they might gain interest in there s not really a parallel to that in traditional sports i guess maybe for americans there is who watch say basketball and american football and follow teams from their cities but most of the world not really
i became a kt fan after flash joined their starcraft brood war team i followed them into league of legends even though at the time my favorite lol team was azubu blaze i know people that were counter strike fnc fans and started to follow their league team from that and now follow fnc into any esport same with g2 tsm etc i even know people that started as lcs c9 fans and then started to follow them in c9 in ow london spitfire etc brand recognition is transferable it s just not easy when somebody doesn t know or likes a different game
amazon was founded in was the first year it was profitable in the following 12ish years they were marginally profitable relative to their revenue in their net income was billion usd teams have a fan base and a team that is huge in one esport buying a squad or a spot in another esport makes big news parts of their fan base and part of everyone else who gets the news starts following watching the new esport it has more viewers now i literally had no fkin clue about the smash fcg community then i read on reddit that leffen is basically a tsm fan with hands who plays smash and looked him up watched some of his vids and decided that he for real was a tsm fan with hands and lingerd around the smash scene for a while i literally started watching playing tekken after about a decade cuz i saw a random post on twtter that jdcr and decided that he is the man cuz he was sponsored by ef and mains heihachi as well as seeing fkin qudans return was kinda surreal whenever a big team or brand enters a new esport there is a splash generated by the shere size of the team this allows them to sign more lucrative sponsoring deals cuz they have often more range and a bigger following then smaller teams in that nice as long as the evaluation of the brands increases investors will continue pouring money into it early investors are mostly not looking for a long term profitable and sustainable business model but for a payday when they cash out their shares
why advertise at all your wasting money everyone knows what bud light is lol there is insane value in building a brand in the next generation of big spectacle media
a team which is involved in lcs will have an existing fanbase which transfers over to other games
inserting skinneroutoftouchmeme
they left after the other things though the upper management left after ftx was exposed it was clear at the end of last year tsm mailed it in for lol there were lots of rumors of tsm leaving lcs afterwards too
they stole tsm s patented strategy of doing nothing until the other team shits their pants and throws
as always just lived long enough to see the sheer incompetence of tsm get the best of themselves
step go into a thread specifically created to discuss content made by two guys you don t like step scan for anyone saying anything that isn t absolutely negative step find somebody making a fairly neutral observation about the outcome of a thing those two guys were involved in step hit the reply button and show everyone how those guys live rent free in your head you re right u pervylegendz reddit is weird
they burned the bridge with dl personally or was it by proxy due to leena drama just wondering if i missed some si vs dl drama
the holy war was against doublelift and leena no it wasn t lol it was against tsm leena happened to be an accessory to tsm in those proceedings but don t try to misrepresent what it was
you say that like leena is a good person in that story
i read a comment on here that was highly upvoted in that week that bo is a bottom jungler in the lec and they defended it but i agree most didn t say that vit was that bad
b01 results suddenly don t matter they don t when vitality loses a few but both dom thorin were incredibly hype on vitality amazing winter split b01 performance even though if you actually watched the games their performance was far weaker then mad g2 who finished and vitality went life and death vs bds excel fnc in like 40min games and the narrative for the past few shows now has been oh i don t care about placings in the b01 which is actually the correct view too take but its funny how it changed from split to split they clearly love perkz bo upset and have a bias towards them also if they act like people were flaming upset certainly wasn t the majority and make that the center argument narrative it deflects from the real complaint issue i e perkz was fucking awful in more then a few games this split
not on this sub but twitter is different
oh i agree it is you just got hit
even just by looking at the results immediately after franchising you can see that msg was just awful for the org they legit went from making playoffs every split since lcs started to missing out of playoffs since franchising
funny how clg only got into franchising because of msg s funding riot would probably be banned from using msg if they didn t let clg in which would had changed worlds
fnatic tsm c9 tl and clg are the most popular even g2 isn t as big
i think if this subreddit had allowed more kinds of posts it would give extra lol related subs more of a reason to exist but as it is now this sub is insanely slow for how big it is tf2 a much smaller game has way more active subs because the main one is such a clusterfuck i personally prefer that model but i get why you d want this one
i think some games do have strong overlap but only if the viewers are likely to play the game lol valorant for example has strong overlap thanks to riot so a lot of lol players moved to valo and makes it easier for the tsm name to capture fans but not many lol viewers will switch to dota and most dota players would switch to cs instead of valo the tsm name means nothing in dota and cs so there is no brand recognition going on at all in valo fans are younger and very new to e sports so a team like sen that was top in the world for years with the best player in the game captured most of the fans who started early and built a ride or die fanbase similar to early tsm t1 fnc g2 that s why they re still the na team above c9 eg 100t even when they re not top anymore and eg fq have no fans because top means nothing winning domestic does matter because it shows you can be top in domestic and go to events like msi worlds where you get more eyeballs most new fans will gravitate towards the team when they start watching most existing fans won t change teams so the longer you stay dominant consistent in the domestic scene the better the chances you gain new fans top really isn t good enough
tsm s fanbase was essentially just bjerg dl fans built off success and two personalities which is why the decline is even happening there are some baylifers still around they re the minority though and tsm were one of the best in the world when it was their brand too cross game competitive interest isn t that common for starters and the most popular teams to follow are usually just the strongest monte framing it as acquiring industry expertise knowledge relationships etc for future esport opportunities being bigger or at least lucrative makes more sense imo
college sports is like that
that doesn t really happen though if it did lcs viewership wouldn t be declining people watch the games they like not the orgs for the most part mif it did riot would just give the same exact teams valorant spots as it would benefit both of the leagues also a sponsorship example that disproves this notion is team liquid is not called team liquid honda for csgo honda only paid for the lcs viewers
guilty i was a cs fnatic fan that decided to check out fnatic s lol team one day i didn t have anything going on around the cyanide xpeke era i ve been following league esports as a whole ever since
tl flair from starcraft vitality because they picked up my favourite parts of the envyus cs go team
similar happened to me with wow rtwf with liquid taking over complexity
i mean i hate regi and tsm and i will say that was just vindictiveness on riots part tsm has a fan base and would have brought eyes to the project
removed
well you can t leave me hanging like that how was she not a good person
u have never watched more than minutes of the content right
realistically clg could have gotten a variety of investors as a very popular league team at the time with ventures in other esports i d wager they specifically chose msg as their investors bc of the significance of their victory clg were stubborn in not selling to vc for a while holding out until they absolutely had to and when they did they did it to one of the worst options they could have in hindsight
wouldn t say there is no brand recognition in other online games since tsm spread out to more than just league and valorant apex legends pubg fortnite
tsm has had a strong fanbase since when clg went to korea
that s just not true if you start getting into another game fans still tend to start watching the team they re familiar with or you start watching other games because your team is doing well there i ve turned on some dota games just because tsm was doing well in it and i was curious having never watched it before same with apex where tsm is good or when they had hikaru i heard about him more and would sometimes catch a stream where i wouldn t have if he hadn t popped up in the tsm sub back then so yeah it def does translate not every fan but it s no different than sponsorship marketing where you ll favor a brand because you ve heard the name before which is proven to work also most sponsors aren t game specific that s not usually the norm even though it has happened ftx for example which couldn t be league but that s kinda the opposite
when league first came out wasn t like all of korea s brands infrastructure and coaches all from starcraft
i mean i literally did that very thing so i disagree i came over to league from other games having been a c9 fan so i started watching lcs as a c9 fan i stopped reduced watching lcs because it quickly became apparent that the region is well garbage team liquid is not called team liquid honda for csgo honda only paid for the lcs viewers that can have to do with multiple factors not really much of an argument
the idea that reddit generally approves of thorin and monte is pretty laughably untrue they are both very unpopular here but if you re choosing to enter the comment section for their own content you re going to find more people who consume it seems like if that bothers you you re capable of doing the one thing you need to do to get back to the part of r leagueoflegends that mostly dislikes them just click the x button on that browser tab friend nobody s holding you hostage
she was the president of tsm for years while her employees were being harrased and abused and there is no reason to think she ever did anything about it until she could benifit from it after leaving
when tsm were one of the best teams in the world and streaming every day yeah
basically this i ve shifted my esports viewing heavily to apex over the last year or so because of the success of tsm over there as well as i just enjoy that product more currently command center during the majors is pretty top tier viewing experience
that has nothing to do with the holy war though she was never accused by them for letting the employees be harassed and abused and funny enough they avoided that like the plague because if monte said anything then it would be like your co partner literally got a player killed and both of you got banned from the league why are you even talking
do you have an exciting match you would recommend watching i have never seen competitive apex but have played it your comment got me interested
you are honestly just gross for bringing that second part up you have no idea what you are talking about
the last map from the most recent lan is pretty exciting there s really good streamer reaction compilations out there the match point format teams get to a certain point threshold and then have to win a map to claim first while arguably not the greatest from a competitive standpoint is phenomenal from an entertainment standpoint you can get situations like map where you have teams in match point essentially 1v1ing for the tournament edit if you re interested there are usually scrims for pro matches throughout the day depending on which region and nicewigg normally watch parties them this is the closest you ll get to command center not at a lan i think there is supposed to be na scrims tonight at edt
i mean if we are talking about people being quiet or oblivious of the abuse the ceo did then surely monte fits the same shoes or was the abuse too real for you and now its gross so we should just turn an eye away
you are taking the tragic death of someone who died in circomstanses that aren t public information and using that talk shit about someone you don t like that is disgusting behavoir
it ll be the skinline for msi so it should come out around msi since it s the 2nd biggest comp event i m sure it ll have a pass event
msi will probably have it s event and inkshadow seems to be the msi skinline
ah that s good i hope it does thank you
heartseeker skins are physically painful to look at
i will probably get downvoted to oblivion is i say k da jk i don t mind them as much just don t like them skinline uhh heartseeker probably kinda too cringe for me a specific skin though maybe not a skin because overall it s not bad but fire form of elementalist lux it makes it so hard for me to see the skillshots ngl especially q it feels tiny
warden marauder the worst skins for great fun characters
cats v dogs i m all for fun silly skins like draven draven or def not velkoz but this shit s just color barf
space groove hate it to oblivion
all of the legendary skins actually most of them makes my toaster pc skip frames so much it s fun to play
nah only buy them if you have a specific purpose for what you buy them for for example you have good pick champs and want to set up an aggressive bush trap or enemies have lots of poke and you want to hard force a dragon braon fight and need to deny vision in pit if you don t have a specific use in mind when buying it don t buy it
there is a direct correlation is of control wards purchased ranking irons avg under per game while challengers avg in a very linear line bottom line it costs melee minions of gold or jungle camp to pay for the ward just buy the ward do people buy a health pot to start to the game to help to live for 50g same concept for 75g on the ward except it is even better because it extends that pseudo insurance to your whole team
warding gets the girls trust
well the supports job is to ward if the top laner wants to to he needs the support to have warded buying a ward every back i disagree with in that it s using gold because he can not with the idea of placing useful wards i wouldn t worry too much about vision yes it s important but there are so many other things to worry about to an extent wards are a crutch they are a crutch for you not thinking about where the jungle is and tracking him and instead relying on wards depending on the placement let s say you are past half way in top lane the ward can even give you a false sense of security the ward could be giving me seconds of warning when i need seconds to get out in time tldr buy red wards a game as a non support
it s a middle ground really a destroyed control ward gives the enemy gold advantage you lose they gain so you should not waste them because are a kill but at the same time the vision can be worth a lot more than a kill for example if it secures you an objective enables or prevents a fatal gank or allows you to catch someone out of position it was worth it so should you buy control wards yes but not excessively
they are good in unorganized environments if you just put them in a safe bush inside your jungle they can help prevent invades and track the enemy or at the very back of objectives i wouldn t buy them early on unless you re in a pro environment
there is a direct correlation is of control wards purchased ranking irons avg under per game while challengers avg in a very linear line that doesn t make any argument though if it is correct or not
as a girl i can confirm you are instantly more attractive to us if you place good ward but don t be the ward
the ward can even give you a false sense of security the ward could be giving me seconds of warning when i need seconds to get out in time just place it better your argument basically is the ball i threw didn t land where i needed it to so i m not going to throw balls anymore
but don t be the ward standing near jungle entrances at the start of the game to watch for an invade is you being a ward
but don t be the ward but thats literally teemo s job to be a ward
no i would need to go too far out of my way for wards that would be more useful when i am winning lane by pressuring the enemy under their tower im saying why learn to throw the ball better when their are more beneficial skills to focus on improving such as understanding where the enemy jungler is
i would need to go too far out of my way for wards that would be more useful when i am winning lane by pressuring the enemy under their tower but this is literally prime timing to go for a deep ward that is when you go for a deep ward when you ve pushed the enemy under their tower you can pressure them under tower when you have vision otherwise you re just begging for a gank it goes like this push enemy under tower leave go for a deep ward return to lane resume exerting your prio over the lane pressure enemy under tower if you want or go gank some other lane just because you pushed them under tower doesn t mean you must stay there and pressure them further
you can pressure them under tower when you have vision otherwise you re just begging for a gank but i want to get ganked i am begging for a gank just because you pushed them under tower doesn t mean you must stay there and pressure them further my advice might have unintentionally been illaoi specific
you won t get banned unless you type so just don t type back or if you literally run it down
just do chat and ping ignore on players who are toxic to you i swear it s the best way to improve in this game league while being a team game doesn t have anything useful coming out of the team chat
do what i do and practice willful ignorance of their petulance and make practical use of the mute button works especially well if you warn them with retail politeness that you re muting them due their behavior also it tends to level out past level most of these really toxic are stuck in a loop of being banned from ranked matches and thus creating new accounts and having to grind back to where they can play ranked again
the mute function is there for a reason
play against bots until you get comfortable with the movement and csing and controlling your champion comfortably as far as toxic behaviour goes remember that game isn t real life that people that insult you don t know you and that what they say doesn t matter also grow thicker skin
play custom game mode vs intermediate bots is much more easy because if there is of ur friends with you he can teach you and there is no one to flame you to be toxic there is also a practice mode where you can learns combos and test champions
just play another game and let the toxic league of legends game with its toxic community fade away your own mental health will thank you
what d you mean by run it down
thank you i will definitely do that
thank you i didn t know i could mute so i ll definitely just be doing that and continuing to learn thank you
i played against a few bots and whatnot was quite fun tbh i have a fairly thick skin just don t appreciate being told to k ll myself cause i m not the best at a game like it s a bit much
ooo i didn t know there was a practice mode i ll have a go at that thank you
lol i ve definitely played bot games to try a new champ and gotten people flaming
i mean running into the enemy dying then doing that again more times not even new bad players can do that not on purpose so basically i m saying unless you very obviously purposly lose the game you won t get banned no matter how bad you may be playing as a new player riot knows that there are many new players that are bad and there is nothing wrong with learning the game tdlr don t worry about it if someone is toxic mute them instantly and report after game don t respond to them and enjoy the game
pressing tab default control in game will bring up the scoreboard there s little icons next to each player to mute chat pings and emotes individually
i don t know what to tell you i am realist in heart so when i started playing online when i was a kid i never took the stuff that people say seriously realistically and logically what they say has no effect on me unless we are talking about gameplay for me personally there isn t a thing that you can say to me that will surprise me people are selfish evil aholes except everything
you re wellcome
custom game you and bots vs bots no one is going to flame there and you can do whatever you want
thank you i didn t know i could mute people to be honest so i think i ll just to that
all the games i ve played in the past i ve ever dealt with stuff like it so i guess it s more of a shock than anything doesn t upset me just not used to it or know how to mute people or anything like that
press tab and on the right side you have three little icons next to each player they mute chat emotes and pings you also can go to options while you are in the game in the interface section under communication or something you have an option to choose what chat you see default is all team party you wanna choose just party
you can make it bigger in the interface section
i ve always just chocked this up to getting older years ago i never had an issue keeping track of the cursor but now in big flashy team fights i sometumes just click and hope i m in the right area
i switched back to legacy cursor because i found it easier to see
can you i wasn t able to find anything except general interface size which is already at nothing cursor specific
that is definitely part of it
i went outside of the game and set it to
ah i will try that
i google changing cursor size outside of league game or something found a youtube tutorial for it pretty simple
i mostly play fiddlestick and pantheon my average grade on both of them is a for the whole season just a side note what champions you play and what rating you get have effect on mmr rank only wins losses matter as it stands now your rank is higher than your mmr which is to be expected after win streak as rank fluctuates more quickly than mmr does you can dodge games which lowers lp ie rank but not mmr but that probably isn t the answer you are looking for and really it shouldn t be necessary ultimately all you can do is keep winning and wait for the system to recognize it isn t just a lucky streak if your account is significantly old that is you have a very large game history i wouldn t expect it to happen in a reasonable amount of time it feels like it is much easier for an accounts mmr to get broken than it is to fix it i kind of understand why the created this system but imo it doesn t work very well anymore
make a new account try to get good cs vision score and k da and finish as fast as u can the game on a new account on your placement you get lp playing like this and after that lp and lose lp you can reach plat easy by doing that don t play random champions try to play good champions that can split push waveclear and take towers that can also 1v5 if you know what i mean i think the best champion for that is illaoi for that but first u need to master her before you go to rank shes broken if you know how to play her but you need to know her weakness and counter them and prevent losing because of them
make a new account people will down vote this answer but it s the truth after so many games in the same rank your account s gains become trash even if your skills improve so it s literally far faster to just buy level a new account and start over
now account or endure the torture last year i climbed for silver to platinum with and it s doable with win rate
it will likely take hundreds of games to fix consider making a new account it will be quicker but of course it s also perfectly understandable to want to stay on your main account another option is to dodge a lot of games to reduce your visual rank
riot support https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/) and submit a ticket no joke take screenshots of end game screens with the lp screenshot your op gg explain what you said here i was having similar issues and the more that people send in tickets the more they may actually look into it it was fine for me the first day or two of the lp gain change but a single loss streak tanked the ratio for a win for loss and even after an equal streak a week or so later the ratio has yet to balance out and its been a few weeks total since then i think it tanks mmr too fast and the recovery isn t anywhere near as forgiving as it should be
yeah don t listen to this guy
this is just straight up wrong with the lp gain changes people have inflated ranks not mmr making smurfs will get you stuck in the same position if your mmr actual skill isn t high enough
why tho what i said wrong
because kda vision score have no effect on mmr also even if he gets platinum he is an inflated platinum account also illaoi sucks strong champion but with a very specific playstyle dude is a fiddle panth otp it will take him months to play illaoi correctly
in that time he can make his new account and learn illaoi and another champion how cs kda vision score doesn t have effect on mmr when the games registers what you do during the game and it compare the data with other players from higher elo do you think it doesn t work like that i have friends that play this game and they are bad they get to play vs very bad players and they still lose they have bad cs vision score kda dmg but when i try to play more than or games on the same account i get to play vs good players after or wins and most of the games i have over 10cs min highest vision score and high dmg the game knows when there is a different player at the keyboard i have seen that way to many times at first i didn t belive it but now after hundred of games on different division i know is real
ok buddy
major tip look on yt for some warding guids to find the high elo warding spots dont think in wards to prevent a gank rather think in spotting the jungler all the time deep wards in enemy jungle and practise to look on the map all seconds if you see the jungler on the map just ping him times just help to reveal the enemy jungler it will help you by helping teammates to spot him and die less and it really costs no effort just the right warding spots and some map looking routine
learn another role and come back to support after if you still want to i would suggest mid or adc when i started the game i was also a bronze support main mained thresh i felt similar to how you feel and i remember making posts about it and even finding adcs on reddit to duo with because i couldn t believe the problem was me the things you are mentioning to qualify you as a good support show why you aren t as good as you think good vision score is good for a support but it needs to be useful vision instead of i get vision score per minute you should be thinking about getting vision around the appropriate objectives if dragon is coming up in a minute then you should already have lit up the river if you re able to i usually deal more damage than the enemy support this doesn t matter as much as you think if you re playing seraphine and enemy is playing for example leona then you will of course deal more damage think about it if your top lane is shen and enemy top lane is quinn would you be very surprised if your shen dealt less damage probably not right he easily could ve been more useful while dealing less damage i finish my support item earlier this is generally pretty good but it s also easier on champs like seraphine compared to melee supports none of the things you mentioned are bad but they also aren t the priority what if in the process of dealing your damage you eat a bunch of minions from your adc so after laning phase your adc lost cs that they otherwise could ve potentially gotten not saying they would have gotten every single one but what if they got half of that what if in the process of dealing your damage you accidentally push the wave is that good or is that bad do you know what if you go to get vision and since it s too far up you get picked and die or what if you re scared of dying so you get safe vision that isn t as useful for your team for example if you see enemy jungle top and you have the push in bot lane you can get a deep ward in the enemy jungle do you take advantage of that i m trying to show that there are a variety of priorities things to think about that go far beyond i have good vision score or i do more damage than the enemy support that s why i recommend learning another role at least for now because playing mid top adc will teach you about laning and wave manipulation playing adc you will see more mistakes in your support human nature and you can gain a different perspective once you come back to support
theres a lot of text here ill try to keep it simple one trick janna perfect support for your elo shields heals peels fast doesnt give ur adc anxiety little hard counters ban draven avoid having aphileos kalista as your adc there s obv a billion different variables but janna is that soloque supp you re looking for if you just want elo also try to get your toplaner a lower pick order
one thing that my masters support friend taught me was to barely ever walk straight back to bot lane after you back instead walk into the jungle between mid and bot whilst you are walking there you can assess whether or not you can go to mid to apply some pressure there or go back to bot lane it s a simple thing that really leads to more map awareness and impact of course as seraphine you aren t always going to be able to attack mid and get a kill but maybe you can counter a gank help push out a lane or even drop a ward to help the wider map track the enemy jungler in general though unless you know your adc is very good i think applying smart pressure to the wider map is a great way to climb as a bronze support
mastery knowing matchups and how to abuse good matchups while being able to win normally bad ones is key to being ahead early game objectives especially in bronze silver people dont know how to keep track of objectives and if you ping your jungler enough you can very often be first at drake baron to set up vision and use that to pick off the enemies or even get them for free track the enemy jungler and ping your opponents think about where he will start and where he will be at for a beginning and ping your teammates accordingly to back off if theyre overextended or vulnerable warding warding especially for mid lane after a base really helps your teammates out a ton and warding the bush at if youre pushing in lane if you have prio then try to deep ward the enemy jungle turn off chat explains itself putting in the games i often see people complaining that they cant climb but they give up after one loss streak or have like games total in the season putting in consistent games keeps ur mechanics up and if you play more accurately and confidently then youll climb
a supports job is to create opportunities for their team and stop plays from the enemy team i d double check your laning skills as that s your job to handle make sure your team has a strong adc to work with and if you can t manage that then identify who on your team has damage and work around them vision score isn t important so i wouldn t really pay attention to that just make sure you put wards in relevant places you re playing seraphine a mage so you ll likely be dealing higher damage than average your job isn t to deal damage though so i wouldn t worry too much about that though it is nice worry more abour your adcs farm in lane and where your team needs to be outside of lane
i like playing seraphine as a carry either mid or apc feel like there are better champions to fit the support role but she is a really good carry
seraphine isn t a good support she s really good as the bot carry she needs gold and scales pretty hard
hey i hope you are finding good advice and learning new strategies for support i found support years ago when i was high bronze low silver before iron was a thing and climbed to gold using nami now i recently hit masters and love playing karma while nami is on the bench as she is more support enchanter and i used to enjoy her dmg enchanter before she got adjusted a bunch what i used in bronze is roaming once i started roaming i quickly ranked up to gold i saw someone mention that when you recall walk through jg between mid and bot so you can rotate mid and counter gank or whatever the more teammates you impact the more games you win this is just the start as roaming is a complex skill that drastically varies game to game and the only way to learn it is to be punished and be focused on improving over flaming teammates whenever my mid dies i always think could i the support have changed that sometimes you are in lane fighting and you didn t have time to roam and you can conclude that you didn t have an opportunity to notice mid getting ganked and couldn t roam but could you have placed a deep ward to spot the jg early and give yourself more time to roam mid or warn you teammates this type of thinking is crucial because this is what the support role is about fuck the adcs that want a pocket support as that won t be a consistent way to win games sometimes it is and it s up to you to identify how you can be impactful sometimes you are outclassed and pocket the adc is your best bet roaming top is also huge as most top laners especially in low elo don t expect the support and often are out of position and lose the 2v1 impacting the map will significantly improve all of your ganes rather than putting your eggs in the basket of your adc who will be blown up by a zed because the adc stepped a meter too far now if your convinced about the roam playstyle you will need to learn where the weaknesses are and that mostly will be trial and error but i can give some advice to help you understand what issues can arise when you roam you lose xp so you need your roams to be as efficient as possible because of this i roam mid more than top usually as it is closer to bot which is supports xp going top and failing a gank puts you behind and you ll feel it minutes later when your lvl and the mid is lvl and their ult will one shot you as you dont have the resistances from levels to survive it but i would rather be level in that scenario if i got my mid lane kassadin kills early and basically get a free win furthermore try and move from place to place with purpose i spend most the game looking at my minimap to see how the game is being played out top laner getting pushed hard their opponent is probably overextending and a roam top probably is worth your time you have a mid kassadin and they have a scary mid lane you might want to focus less on roaming into lane as neither kass or you have the ability to kill early but roaming into the jg to put a ward by gromp blue buff might save them from a gank seconds before it even happens and you should always be pinging the enemy jg whenever they are spotted unless they are in a lane as you ll probably tilt your teammates who already see them deep wards are huge for safety and you will be punished for placing them at the wrong time as a rule of thumb if you crash a wave bot and enemy jg is top side go get deep wards down a good jg can still kill you if you ward in river so if you spot them early you can just ditch lane and waste the jg time without a chance of them even being on your screen wards sometimes are dependant on champions eve post if you can ward her camps she will unstealth as she clears them and you can spot her shaco zac jump walls so ward where they jump from hec is so fast that even if you spot him in river he will catch you before you can get away safely i disagree with the stance of enchanters being bad because your adc is low elo even with milio i can roam and impact non adc champions that can t utilize his kit amazingly play whats fun and find what you like even though most of us like what wins games i really appreciate the dmg and speed from karma and nami so i can roam fast and hit hard but i also play seraphine so i can have huge team fight presense with her r at the cost of dmg in her roams sorry for the long comment i just love support and i m on vacation atm so can t play and this is nice in the meantime if you have any questions i d love to hear them because i feel the learning process is very much so trial and error but i found huge success impacting teammates rather than playing dependant on my glass cannon adc especially if they are low elo tldr roam more and if you have any questions i d love to answer them
turn your monitor on
almost all of the advice in this thread is dogshit just play seraphine but adc so you get farm and watch how much easier the game gets if you re deadset on support just play sona she can solo carry games with her scaling and is braindead easy to play x200b anyone telling you to roam or ditch the adc has no idea what they are talking about in bronze this will either make your adc disconnect or run it down on purpose you re better off learning to bury the other botlane in lane than learning how to roam
you gotta be more selfish if you feel the adc wont win you the game then ditch him he might not like it but being likeable isnt what you are going for most important thing is to identify winning condition and then play towards that when top is hard winning the match up but gets chain ganked thats your que to help jungle kindred mark is on opposite side of map you go there etc playing by the book wont do you any favors especially as support
the answer is always jungle you have the most agency in the game playing real supports in bronze is probably the hardest possible thing in league to do because your supporting people with no hands no macro and just sprint it down lane perma fast pushing absolutely awful experience i would imagine
don t play support till you re minimum diamond imo adcs are not worth playing towards below a solid minimum such as dia as they throw their leads you can play heavy roamers but ppl throw their leads in lower elo so support gap is less impactful
stop playing support start playing support
don t play seraphine she s cringe play sth simple to play with like tanks or morgana lux etc where one ability hit guarantees heavy damage or a kill or play carries like twitch
tbh if you play more aggressive poke supports you could probably just carry the game yourself although you need to play them well enough to carry
other people in this thread have some solid advice but what did it for me last season was expanding my champion pool specifically to include engage supports while mage and enchanter supports are sometimes the right call given a comp there are lots of times where playing an engage support can give you more agency and allow you to create and snowball an early lead yourself
yes all you said helped me a lot i was looking for an answer like this in early game i ward bot lane and if the drake is coming i ward him too i also ward in the enemy jungle bot side but only if they are good and my team wants to take drake so that we can see them coming i try to track the jungler but wasn t taking this as an advantage to place wards in the enemy jungle and also i only pinged him when he was bot side also i play support since i got the game which was years ago i only played with my real life friends from a higher elo and they taught me a lot but none of them was an adc or a support player so their advices were not very detailed but the last month i wanted to improve and actually get better and i started playing ranked for the first time kinda a mistake xd i was bronze and then droped to bronze i guess i don t remember well all i want to say is i always played league for fun but i wanted to get challenged and that s why i want to climb up bronze but need more knowledge to do so i now how to poke the enemy bot lane without hitting the minions or at least without killing minions i do place wards in useful places because i researched where to put wards but i m pretty sure that i m far from good i think it s time to play more adc and learn from other supports and also watch more support guides thank you for helping me realize that i m probably still doing a lot of mistakes
i actually like playing janna a lot but i feel like she s not perfect at all for my elo but i m the one asking for advice i will play her more often in ranked if i have the impression that janna fits good into the team thank you for suggesting me another support
that s what someone else just said i will consider that and stop playing sera as support from experience and everything people said i am glad i know better now
thank you so much for your long comment this helps a lot
i really don t believe that this could help in any way
alright of course a whole other point of view this could work too i will try that playing sera as apc will surely help too she has insane wave clear
that was my mindset but some of my platinum friends told me that even if my adc is inting or nit that good i should stuck with him so i stopped ditching them maybe is there anymore else who can approve to be more selfish
what should i play instead
xd hhaha
i like sera as i said because she kinda has everything she can heal she can root she can stun she slows for me she s like a perfect support i think she s cringe too believe me when i say but i really like her abilities but i will try to play more tanks or lux
should i start playing mid then or stay support and get kills on bot lane
i m only gold so please take what i say with a grain of salt imo playing adc will help you understand what you could be doing better as a support for example as adc you might think ah i wish my support would ward or get bush prio or help me poke etc most of what you learn from an adc perspective primarily applies to 2v2 laning and matchups when to push wave control overall macro etc understanding when you have prio and then as support mostly leaving lane to ward and calling for drags bc you have lane prio or vision setup it s great playing other roles to understand how they each fit together in the early mid late game and what their priorities are for each stage
this is terrible advice if you want to get out of low elo playing support you need to play supports that can kill shit like senna xerath lux etc playing an enchanter for people who don t even know how to play the game is a waste of time
insane clear the other bot lane can t even play the game most of the time your jg gets easy drakes its easy wins
ditching your bot lane during laning phase is legit just throwing your lane don t do that even if they re losing being in lane and holding that tower stems the bleeding now if they re literally inting that s another story i ve had too many supports ditch lane because they thought we were gonna lose lane it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and hurts the team even more
mid is best adc is second play sera mid imo you need to still learn the basics of the game and once you do you ll climb out of gold plat such as wave states matchups your role in your team stabilizing lanes etc
if you can learn how to play pyke you will more than likely be able to win a lot more games he s honestly pretty easy when you can land hooks he does really good damage early game and just snowballs personally i can t really recommend mid partially because i suck at seraphine myself but mid might be a but too much of a shift from your current playstyle especially if you plan on going back to support
thank you for telling me this
i mained janna for years but i would have lost my mind playing janna in bronze keep it simple the easiest way to climb is to win lane win game since in bronze nobody knows how to lane pick a support that can 1vs2 the lane such as brand or senna i don t even think you need to ward most certainly never buy pink wards just learn the mechanics of one champion anticipate ganks by learning jungler timings position properly in team fights basically let others die first and your hands alone should take you to silver gold
thank you for your opinion i will continue not to ditch my adc
hes an adc player so he might be bias i feel in the end these kind of issues are never a this or that kinda deal but more nuanced it depends on which champ adc plays it depends on which champs opponent plays it depends on game state etc playing adc myself also really helped to identify bad adc im not saying ditch your adc immediately when not winning lane i say ditch your adc when hes bad
the mmr of premades needs to be shot waaay up a man premade should be playing against million mastery lee sin s and yasuo s not 20k mastery players
you re absolutely justified in feeling this way premades have been a problem for the solo player experience for a long time almost all the negative experiences i ve had in my years of league have been due to premades sadly i don t think riot has any interest in creating solo only queues they did play with the idea of removing duos from ranked but it seems they ve tossed that now a real shame
there was a point where i reached around winrate over games for non ranked summoner s rift then i kept facing premade after premade and i dropped down to winrate lol
if you ask me i d remove duo from ranked as well you want to duo fine there is flex ranked should be solo only then the same for normals you could just leave modes as they are and make so matchmaking pair duo with duo so it evens out
mastery doesn t correlate with skill in the slightest
im sure as a diamond player you would have better insight into when to play malphite than the average bronze to not playing the game at all redditor
malph is basically a counter to ad tops with low ap damage teams and works well with champs that really want the guaranteed engage like yasuo samira orianna ornn is pretty flexible and probably one of the safest tanks with good waveclear and ranged abilities to farm and break freezes idk much about his matchups but i think he does very well against other tanks since he deals hp magic damage and outscales basically all of them by masterworking his team s items also has really good engage just not as broken as malph s
all i play is chogath so idk lol
honor level not locked
good guess i think its that ty
kind of a shame that the gll teams will have to play each other you d think they d try to avoid this like it s done in other sports
man those group draws are rough i really liked the arabian league teams but also found myself cheering for verdant from the nlc since it s the erl i watch the most of course they are playing each other for the master s main stage spot nbsp aegis having to play partizan will be a fun watch i was assuming they would both finish and not have to face each other as seeds but geekay had other plans with their wins today nbsp my personal favorites from each series are supermassive anorthosos geekay aegis excited to see who makes it out
gk s supp playing thresh on ms https://clips.twitch.tv/observantsucculentiguanapupper--zags3hybmyahbmv) x200b surprised that gk was able to stop aegis after aegis were like and then topple them from the first seed of the group by winning the tiebreaker hyped for gk ra ad with the cho gath jungle tho
i thought this was difficult to watch there was like different games going on different streams oh well guess they don t really consider play ins that important
man this is so unlucky for partizan
lplol teams were disappointing though as a portuguese person i can tell you it s not even disappointing anymore it s just business as usual
aegis vs partizan will be banger whoever gets better draft wins series especially hyped for jopa and their jungler is cracked aegis is really good team as lfl are favorites to take it all
can t be let down by dutch teams if they don t make it to the main event iq moves from our boys
my prayers have been answered krc genk _finally_ has a logo from this century
i was not super hyped about verdant going into this https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/129hsei/the_2023_emea_masters_playin_group_draw/jernih4/?context=3) yet i was still expecting a better
agreed flawed draw
ra ad man i ve been pulling for them all season since they have edward as their coach and he s been active on social media about the teams performance but i swear sometimes they do stuff just to try and be inventive with it
other teams just started banning chogath and udyr vs raad lol
i feel bad for partizan their group and then draw aegis that sucks
it s a shame because euniverse puts on a good production with a great talent pool of actual erl casters and def deserves better
wait until you find about the new main stage format games simultaneously even for quarters
what was the expectation anyway gtz the portuguese first seed was matched in the group with aegis arguably the strongest team in this stage geekay were a surprise and they were able to finish in the first place even beating aegis twice so it s not shocking that gtz lost twice to them as well the only bad result for gtz is losing once to 7am if they went i wouldn t say they went below expectations in the other hand wd went against gtz in the playoffs this year they were nowhere as competitive as gtz their best shot was to upset someone and take a win here or there so i m not surprised they weren t able to do it like you said it s business as usual lplol teams don t typically do too well ever since this play in format got introduced in no portuguese team reached the main stage
at least they still have a chance to disappoint us again later today i hope they ll have a good showing though can t say i expect them to win but i ll be rooting for the boys maybe they ll surprise
tried to watch one of partizan game dont remember with whom needed to mute cause casters were literally putting me to sleep i think that game of chess would be more lively than those guys
no way that sucks
the removal of smurf q contributes to how shitty ranked feels this season theres a smurf in every other game who just coinflips the game especially betweem d4 d3
no way ur wr drops when you start playing new role what
same thing for me this season i ve never had a sub wr always been a high plat low diamond player this season i have a wr in about games and i m stuggling to get out of p4 i think i m probably just washed tbh i don t really read patch notes and i m struggling to keep up with the meta i m just playing for fun since my season is pretty much done even on my main thresh i m getting destroyed game after game shit happens i guess
smurf queue is still there i found myself in it after a big win streak
no i experienced the same thing in my main role don t be rude and read the first line
it s not it just feels like it because the game is infested with smurfs
if your winrate dropped that means everyone else s winrate went up if you think this is some global phenomena then sorry to break it to you it s impossible for everyone s winrate to go down at once maybe you re playing poorly maybe just a string of bad luck the only solution is to play good and eventually you ll average to a positive winrate games is a pretty sizeable sample size so it s more than likely the problem is you
https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-13-6-notes/#patch-competitive clarified the lobby tooltip for ranked duo queue restriction when one player s mmr is at master tier or above the restriction is for master mmr not just master
i think xdx gg will show last months
riot api
someone made a google spreadsheet that uses the api to track every game in the season i ll try and find it again
