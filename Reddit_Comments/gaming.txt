i started with days gone on pc i kinda start to like that evade those freakers to preserve my ammunition scavenge unlock outposts camps so that it becomes a safe harbor for me an my bike that needs refuelling from time to time there s difference between day and night you even see freakers reacting on sunrise sundown i ve lots of things to explore there
rocket league it s great because you decide how good you are it sucks because you decide how good you are
this week i have picked up on a game i started some while ago but had not finished solasta crown of the magisters i like that for a small studio they tried to add customizable characters with a personality that changes the dialogues i absolutely love that their maps show where npc are i can be pretty distracted and it s a nightmare for me to remember that they also have an interesting system you don t have to loot absolutely all you can find to sell it and get some money instead a faction will retrieve them all for you afterwards and you will get a share they have also introduced an interesting combat mechanism involving light however as it is an indie game i feel like the story is pretty straightforward with little surprises but a lot of combat encounters in each map to make it last longer this made me lose interest for a while as i love story heavy games with plot twists and all but overall that s a nice rpg that i enjoy playing
bg3 probably best rpg coming out this year
today is the first time i ve ever played vr i was impressed the moment i saw the battery symbol when i first turned the display on then i saw the steam vr home for the first time and had the first experience of looking around in my chair saying woah and feeling like i was actually there now i m downloading free vr games to try and am re installing some of my older games to play in vr not necessarily as vr but to experience playing them on a screen the size of a building later on i will install all the stuff for unreal engine to start making some vr projects life is good at the moment
i m playing destiny mostly could very well be playing horizon forbidden west
the indy smash dredge it s a ight nice art style good management sim mechanics lot of the time is just sailing your little boat around which can be chill and or boring so while i like the game i m not itching to go back to it more like something to do when i got nothing better going on for now
dredge and detroit become human
i ve been staying up late playing terraria every night i m making my whole world hollow in easy mode and it s taking forever i go to my material world buy blue solution then come back to my main world and slowly turn everything hollow it s taking me weeks but it s slowly coming together it doesn t help that a few days ago my world map got completely unexplored file error or smth idk
medieval total war it is an absolute gem and in my opinion still the best total war game it also has fantastic mods
just started playing valheim a couple days ago running around picking up sticks getting chased by angry boars and spending way too long building a tiny ass shack fun times
been playing horizon forbidden west and a bunch of random stuff on the psvr2
last of us pc besides the technical problems its great
bioshock infinite i now play it once every years
grime colors of rot edition just a really wierd metroidvania where your head is basically an all consuming blackhole that you use to parry with combat is on the brutal side but you only lose what is more or less just a percent boost for your gained currency so not overly punishing environments are varied well and the design is consistently eerie to gross good pacing on abilties so far think i m coming up on the halfway point
infamous i tried it once in ps3 but didn t like it for some reason now i do the city looks great combat is fun and the story is interesting bayonetta the most fun combat system ever
pretty hooked on dome keeper at the moment also playing silent hill will move on to silent hill and afterwards
mass effect andromeda it s way better than its reputation would suggest but it s also way too long and stuffed with shitty filler quests with some judicious editing and pruning it could have been a really excellent offshoot from the main franchise
botw and wow this game is amazing i dislike fragility of weapons controls the rest is amazing
pokemon sword i recently picked up violet and scarlett i haven t been able to play a pokemon game since black and white and was very excited about the open world aspect at first i liked it then my bil gave me pokemon sword wow what a beautiful game i ve almost beaten sword it s a little hard to get back into scarlett i like the wild area being separate from the linear style story line i m biased on this though as i love that formula specifically in pokemon i leveled up way too fast in scarlett which made it very unchallenging i love both games i guess i m just super impressed with sword
i m trying to play wild hearts but tecmo koei is such a piece of shit developer that it s turning out to be impossible with all the performance issues that they keep making worse with their patches and fixes so i ve actually decided to clear my backlog a bit and i m currently playing the atelier ryza series i ve pirated all of them fuck you tecmo koei
resident evil after beating the re4 remake i wanted to revisit re7 for some reason
i tried the games i pulled from limited run s blind boxes this year astro aqua kitty blaster master zero and castlevania collection and after an hour or so i put stardew back in my switch
still playing pokemon violet shiny pokemon hunting is a hell of a drug
nier automata finished the first ending yesterday when it is done i suppose i ll try the previous game
i m still replaying through pokmon legends arceus i can t actually play today but when i get back on i should be able to finish up i just need to complete the entries for most of the legendary and mythical pokmon and then take on arceus
aoe4 and re4
i m totally engrossed with snowrunner i played it on a whim from the gamepass and it completely caught me by surprise i thought it was going to be a shitty iceroad truckers cash in i m finding it really therapeutic
pokemon infinite fusions it s free it captures some of that wonderment of the originals and i can literally spend hours just fusing stuff together
pathfinder wotr hoping to finish it before aug and halo infinite to not build gamers fatigue in wotr
i started playing fortnite on pc recently and i can t seem to put it down since the recent update it s been fun cons there be try hards and players who will follow you just to get a kill and i can t forget the snipers overall good game lol but on the side iv been playing horizon zero dawn and marvel spider man trying to finish both of those games also on pc
replaying arkham asylum not played it since it came out playing it again now on my steam deck works flawlessly looks great it s as good as i remember also played a bit of watch dogs legion via amazon luna this week but my ubisoft account keeps being weird and not letting me play
i dipped my toes in vr with the ps vr2 last month and have been having a blast lately been playing unplugged and drum rock this week and go to bed usually feeling like a rockstar
resident evil and prepping for the new path of exile launch
nothing because i m at my ex missus house spending time with my kids while she is away it would have been re4 though
been playing through final fantasy s story largely as a solo player just finished heavensward proper now finishing the extra story content proper for that expansion before taking a break aside from that i dipped my toes into ea s pga tour hour trial really enjoyed what i played so far just not sure i can justify a full purchase when it releases
rdr and loving every minute of it as always
still over here wishing the rest of onimusha games could get a remake
ghostrunner about 3s of the way through and this game is sick easily one of my favorites of all time i just beat the second boss hel and that was probably one of the coolest bosses i have ever fought i love the very fast paced and trial and error style of the combat
just beat the original resident evil for the first time question how do i get the chicago typewriter
i ve been playing ghostbusters spirits unleashed and fortnite has anyone else been having issues with bots in spirits unleashed
i got back into eternal return it is basically a moba battle royale very difficult but fun and has much depth as a multiplayer game
since fallout can t be modded without crashes consistently i jumped back into the ascent i didn t play too much before but i m glad it s my main game right now
kingdom come deliverance actually it s pretty good
deep rock galactic rock and stone to the bone
watch dogs legion on permadeath mode lost so many assassins
i ve been playing littlebigplanet and resistance with a little bit of skate reliving the halcyon days of the ps3 on my pc some great games just a shame the multiplayer is down
after not gaming for a good while due to health issues and lack of energy related to health issues i finally got myself to start up a new game dragon quest v hand of the heavenly bride ds version i m trying to go through the mainline dq games in order since i just got into the series last fall i really loved dqiii played the super famicom version and enjoyed iv a lot as well i m very early into dqv just finished the haunted mansion and joined up with the fairy to see what s going on with the weather i m liking the game so far that s the thing with dq i was told that even though they do try different things with gameplay and plot structure overall it s a very familiar series you generally know what to expect and the aesthetic is cute and cozy i was torn between this and finally starting up my introduction to shin megami tensei and persona was gonna do this via the first persona game but that can wait a bit longer
person royal on pc been playing it for a few months now long game but enjoying it very much and taking my time with it
well i played a game of league of legends and instantly regretted it i know winning isn t everything but it sucks when you are preforming extremely well and still left to just 1v5 late game cause your team is literally all trolling i know i am in their elo for a reason but holy what a complete waste of 30minutes
playing guardians of the galaxy on ps5 right now don t sleep on it lots of fun if you re a marvel fan
party hard deck mg rising revengeance deck gigawing 353v
https://www.torn.com/1798311 come play torn city and join my faction
mass effect
black desert mobile
i am at the point of my life where i rarely play games when they release for instance i am still to finish rdr2 and wifi rush and dungeon of nahelbeuk and forza horizon on my pc and fire emblem engage on switch
tf2 cs go welcome to the game welcome to the game scrutinized phasmophobia ghost exile last of us part pc
been getting back into destiny again the activity s are always fun but the grind is slow enjoyable if your someone like me all though it can be hard to progress if you don t have the dlc s for the game if you have the spare cash destiny is a great game
finally getting into jedi fallen order hoping to time the finish well with the sequel s release at the end of this month
i m trying to find a game that my girlfriend and i can play together we only have a switch and macbooks lol is there an adventure game such as botw that is suited for players or any other recommendations would be appreciated
phantom brigade rollerdrome ps5 magic the gathering deathverse let it die
a little bit of neverwinter running a bard for a quick fix after greatly enjoying the d d movie
horizon forbidden west the game looks so good and i m preparing for the burning shores dlc only downside is the amount of dialogue too much
i ve been playing pokmon x a lot this week the reason it s really fun is because it s pokmon and i like pokmon one of the reasons it was annoying because spoiler when you have to go all the way through the map just to define discuss secret base but overall it s a really fun game so far and i can t wait to finish it
marvel s midnight suns i m so addicted to this game it s crazy it s all i want to do
i gave ea pga tour a crack and it blows no graphics options and just dull the only good thing is the official courses and players but man pga 2k23 blows this away
i really enjoyed that game mostly for what you say and keep learning how to optimise the horde kills have fun
this comment hits me to my champ core
they also have a dlc and there are some user made dungeons you can try on nexus mods or steam workshop
i ve seen it on xbox gamepass it s something i ve had my eye on but haven t had the time to play
i m new to d2 and it s funny to see how dysfunctional the relationship is between players bungie
cavalry archer spam was one of my favorite things i ever tried in a total war game
is it your first playthrough
nice i liked infamous but i regret blitzing through it it was a rental i find it a huge improvement over the greys of infamous
i will be starting this for the first time soon
honestly while i don t care for the durability system and the lack of enemy variety i enjoy the hell out of the rest exploring hyrule and combing through the different regions is such a fun experience i got every korok seed and every named spot that doesn t show up on the map until you go there in person which practically takes you all over the place and there s still areas i know i haven t checked out yet
but my ubisoft account keeps being weird and not letting me play what is happening
now beat the game on professional difficulty in under seven hours
yep i am on pc so yep
it says i need a luna subscription all of a sudden even though i was playing it fine on monday
awesome i am envious i wish i could play it for the first time again
strange i hope i will not run into this issue and that you get it resolved
it s a bit annoying wife there s some known issues but i like the story
i never had any bugs on ps3 what are the issues on pc
shader things super long loading crashes
been a while since i played but wasnt the price for of them coins when they first came
pokmon gone
apparently a bunch of people don t understand that it is hard for rural players to do raids and they have research tasks that demand it
this really bums me out i have several older family members who love playing pokego like daily with their own friend groups corporate greed trying to ruin another thing that brought people together is extremely frustrating
what killed pokemon go for me was when they stopped giving legendaries for getting stamps that feature was the saving grace because i did not want to do raids anymore then they nerfed it into the ground so eventually i quit
only issue i have with this is that it punishes rural players when pogo came out i lived in a rural area with no gyms within a mile radius and i only ever got one type of pokemon to spawn around me rural players can at least use these to enjoy a feature that they might otherwise be geographically screwed out of other than that i mean this is just mobile gaming business as usual
pokemon go fuck yourself
ok so for context since some people in here are just saying free game charges fees and water is wet which isn t inaccurate for years it was raid passes for coins with no limit to how many you could use per day now niantic parent company has doubled the price as well as limiting players use of these to per day this really punishes players that do not live near any stops or gyms to those saying but you re supposed to go outside it s a big country and a big planet there are many places where you would have to drive to your nearest pokestop or gym so it stopped being about that a long time ago this isn t diablo immortal levels of predatory pay to win but it s a pretty big slap in the face to a shrinking community also you re not guaranteed to catch the pokemon after the raid which just adds insult to injury
this is what happens when we allow companies to mindlessly micro transact the absolute balls tits off us they pull the little cable scene from south park
it s a trap game the players are the product
as a person who lives in a rural area it was dead to me years ago unfortunately
i was an avid player until the first remote raid increase as a player who lives min away from a poke stop it s not even possible to have a good time anymore
said bye to this a few years ago it was something to do through the worst of the pandemic but i finally just got tired of how bad it really is tap to fight crappy battles i hate i spent even on this game throughout or so years of playing it
you didnt mention that they doubled the price for no reason now the comments are dumb
lol they almost doubled the individual price and more than doubled the pack price i was a day one player who played every day until some point last fall when i just got tired of the money grubbing i get that niantic is a business and pogo is a product but come on
i don t know what i m looking at
i never played pokemon go but was always amused by the stories my friends would tell about their crazy drunken pokemon hunts they would go on through their trips from the pub on their walk home imagine telling someone years ago that some people routinely stumbles through strangers gardens in the night and early morning on a drunken stupor chasing pokemon on their phone people would shit their pants laughing
whoever approves predatory microtransactions prices the likes of coins i want to take their face and shove it inside of a wasp s nest for a solid minute at least i haven t touched pogo in at least years but you know damn well they re not selling coins exactly and you ll have a bit leftover prompting you to buy more this is scummy of the highest degree and i have no respect for companies who do this
they had a good concept and then greed ruined it this seems to be the problem pretty often
this is usually what happens when the player base dwindles and corporate have to squeeze some more money from the remaining players to keep their profits up sure it ll earn them some more money in the short term but it s going to push the casual players out and hurt niantics pocket in the long term i see this happen with microtransactions with most online games near the end of their life
why do they pay no attention to the community of the game they created how are they capable of being so infuriatingly out of touch
this is one of those elusive double dips they not only want to squeeze more money out of people that have little choice but to raid remotely like people living in rural areas and people with disabilities but they also want to collect more data by disincentivizing people from remote raiding people underestimate how much money they make from the data you re collecting for them
i was absolutely done with them when they shitted on anyone who s in a rural area or who s handicapped by limiting the amount of remote raids you can do in a day you pay money to be gated to a day i think dumbest shit ever
haha good thing i uninstalled like a year ago what the fuck is this shit
moved from taipei city to maui hi i was already in a very densely populated area of maui but the difference was still night and day the devs of this game probably only live in large cities or something because the quality and entertainment of the game took a steep decline leaving the city to the point i didn t want to even play it anymore i moved to the countryside over here and now it would actually be unplayable it feels stupid because you look at my scenery and you know there would be pokmon everywhere why would they swarm the train stations in a city i get that trying to use irl logic on video games is an exercise in futility and that s really not even the point the point is that i d be astounded if a single dev on that project has as much as opened the app outside of new york or san francisco and if they have they clearly just don t give a shit about anyone outside of a globally relevant city my realistic guess is that the project is well into maintenance mode and they want to see how aggressively they can milk the remaining players like how a new game will sell early access to the most dedicated addicted players if anyone doesn t like this direction immediately stop giving them any money and better yet stop playing at all at least for now the literal only thing that works in these situations is to make it not financially viable for them if people buy it anyway but complain that purchase is infinitely louder than their words unfortunately
stopped playing in general cause the pay wall has honestly ruined the game for me
they ve gotten really fucking greedy and stupid the past few years i m getting close to packing up myself
i dropped this game years ago best decision i was addicted to this shit
i stopped playing as much when they took the weekly remote raid out and i ll def not play now won t matter since they re still megarich doe
decrease in players money grab from dedicated players to even it out they ll be fine from whales unfortunately
to be honest the game was fun for weeks after release
this plus the limit on them is straight bullshit
i can t say that i m surprised this has happened i stopped playing regularly about years ago and pretty much all together about year ago i would like to say it s because of covid and leave the blame there but niantic is just another shit company with shit ideals and shit goals they put their users into consideration last and never first unless of course their performing a pr stunt in which case it s we hear you and we care besides a mobile based pokemon game like this can be done so much better and by a better company imo the whole walk around and catch pokemon in real life shtick should be a secondary feature and not the premise of the whole game pokemon games have a very well established and recognized style of game play that got completely ignored in pokemon go they should have focused on making a mobile game that respected and honored that tradition while integrating the alternate reality stuff as an additional feature again just my opinion others may think differently edited for spelling
it doesn t make sense why they increase the cost the only answer is real obvious they re still greedy cunts
is this shrinkflation of a digital fucking product i m actually astonished
haven t played go for years glad to see i missed the garbage fest
yep deleted
if people don t buy the bullshit at a higher price then they will lower it simple don t buy it don t buy anything don t give into their predatory monetization
micro transaction the absolute cancer to having fun
i ll say it niantic and even nintendo don t get enough criticism for pokemon go and their other mobile games as other companies
what was the justification of them raising the prices
in a long enough time span late stage capitalism ruins everything
game was done like six years ago
i don t see this going well for them
it s time for me to transfer my pokmon into pokmon home and delete pokmon gone disaster
and they wonder why people spoof
i forgot those digital items that are so hard to create
i was pretty much done with go once niantic shut down the third party radar services walking around catching the same common pokmon for hours with no rare pokmon got old fast the radar map services at least let me know what was the best places to find rares
i stopped when they wanted my browsing data fuck all that noise sorry they re just pricing you guys out now it was fun to play
and then you have a free player like me going _  _
i ve gone ahead and just stopped playing remote raiding became a huge part of how i played since i m disabled
ide rather kick a cats asshole than pay real money to play a game whose only fighting mechanic is tap tap tap tap tap tap until you win or lose
i can t believe that people have actually been playing this dull and pointless game for years
good riddance raids are a plague in pokemon games they re never well structured it s literally always the worst inclusion since their initial inclusion
quit few years ago besides the initial nostalgia of a few months it got stale and boring pretty fast
they ve made pokmon go so much extra work lately it s a mobile app designed around being out it s not as simple to just play it casually while running errands anymore for me it s no longer worth planning going out for either hasn t been for awhile but especially now
is this a regional thing i just looked at my shop and it shows for and for
damn inflation hitting pokmon go too
poke genie is good for remote raids for legendaries i feel like this is punishing that going to cost alot more and much more frequently to use
did they announce this edit must ve done so pretty quietly hoping no one would notice
buy goodbye
deleted bye pogo
inflation is hitting everyone it seems
yeps they got too greedy just like hearthstone it s pretty sad tbh
i would have stopped playing when there was any level of microtransactions like this
i bailed when they first raised the prices and then made some raids not able to be done with a remote pass
what would i do if i m in rural area there just ain t any gym nearby
it s been dead to me since they gave up and let spoofers be a feature
won t change a thing because the whales will continue to dump money into the game regardless my mother in law has spent thousands and thousands of dollars on the game and she won t stop
fuck niantic
id already been slowing down only the raiding remotely was keeping me engaged daily now i m done
how many coins do you have to buy i highly doubt they ll sell you so you probably have to buy something like or to even use the larger option which obviously makes you want to buy more so you don t waste coins
part of the problem is selling raid encounters on ebay
i just deleted it who knows when i ll be back
stop giving niantic money it s not worth the broken game they offer
as someone who lives in the middle of no where closest pokestop is about miles away and gym further than that fuck this game during beta i had a lot of spawns here that was a great time moved away and then back no spawns even with incense it s dry as hell and i can t walk as much due to spinal issues so fuck pokemon go also you know what fuck scarlet too game crashes like crazy friend lost his data last month and now doesn t play that game is dry as hell too
i delivered regularly to the creators of this game when they were located in mid city bellevue washington they hassled me for the prices on my deliveries not surprising they scrape every avenue
capitalism just ruines everything
can you play win whatever without paying for this shit
niantic games aren t really about providing a service they were created to crowd source location data and to get photographs of community gathering points once they had traction it made sense to lean in a bit and sell power ups as well for additional revenue they do not care about your game experience
wooo just uninstalled it for good as well
honest props to them for making it past with the insane hype and the fallout from that i fully expected go to be a fad that wouldn t see let alone really speaks to how devoted it s fanbase was
tbh to me the game was never my vibe i personally hate the idea of inferior pokmon they are supposed to be tour friends so i hated the idea of having to catcha shit load to make the good one better plus the no battling aspect from the start was something that was not vibing with me i think now it s evident that it s always been a cash grab
they could have made this game the real pokemon where you battle wild pokemon with your captured pets could only carry pokemon battled at gyms to become more powerful i quit a long time ago because the game being fun enough could have easily been the real pokemon we all love niantic can diaf
pokmon go and clash royale devs fighting to see who can tank their game the fastest
proud pokemongofuckyourself member since
do you not get a bunch of coins for defending a gym
i miss old school pokemongo i wasn t knocking people outta gyms just joining raids on discord and enjoying myself when i couldn t go outside
pokemon go is now in the same tier of garbage the main series games are in rip pokemon glory days
r outoftheloop
first time dealing with niantic you poor soul s
this is a case of inflation with the pokemon currency look up pokemon inflation to find out more
haven t played in a while and just wanting to drop by to say that niantic is a trash compagny imagine making a system where you need to go in person to a gym location everyday put your pokemon and hope they stay for 8h but not longer so you don t have to boot them out yourself than you get 50coin for of a freaking distance pass fuck niantic
didn t remote raid passes only become a thing during the pandemic why is it such a big deal that they re being phased out again
friggin inflation
deleting app now lol
quit quit quit i quit years ago when they removed free daily remote raid passes this app sucks and the developers owners don t care about you they don t care that most players don t have convenient places to spin pokestops or gyms or raid quit quit quit
yeah it s way too pay to win now
the shadow of greed has been cast upon the world of pokemon dark days indeed
was always a horrible game imo
sims can no longer woohoo in the elevator with ankther sim who is on a different floor
my favorite patch notes was the first patch after the release of crusader kings there were some changes to certain units but by far the best one was the pope can no longer be openly cannibalistic lmao
this is from sons of the forest was reading the notes and i had to chuckle at this
i love patch notes with a sense of humor my recent fav being this gem rarely some villagers can end up congregating in one spot get stuck and inevitable starve to death we do not support nor condone death cults cults are not part of the base game experience we are investigating a fix for this issue for now if this occurs you can work around it by walling off the afflicted area or starting a new map sorry
congratulations it s a buoy
uh oh hope this doesn t retroactively affect my dead baby dumping river i was relying on those physics
my personal favorite patchnote was from ark fixed poop not going into player hotbars when handcuffed
nintendo announces surprising new gameplay features upcoming in zelda tears of the kingdom
thank god the sinking dead babies were really breaking my immersion
excuse me wtf
i m guessing this is from sons of the forest
this is some crusader kings shit right here
they all float
wow we now have a third answer to how do you make a dead baby float take your foot of its head a scoop of dead baby and a scoop of your favorite soda and now update to the latest release
improvements
looks straight out of classic dwarf fortress
what game is this the hell
improvements
yes yes yes yes thank you finally i can float dead babies yipee
finally this bug ruined the game for me
ah the reactions to this in the comments makes me chuckle wait until they play a game like rimworld or kenshi haha
now i can finally enjoy drowning babies and seeing their corpse float up in the water
finally
i instantly knew this was from sons of the forest lmao
this is amazing bc it s in the improvments section
csgo gonna be wild
thank goodness i was about to give up this whole game because of this baby sinking issue
usually i make a dead baby float with a w root beer and two scoops of dead baby but patch notes are fine too
shouldn t they use root beer if they want to make a dead baby float
developers players have found a way to clip through the wall of the 3rd mission and jump directly to the 9th mission should we patch that our boss where are your priorities johnson can t you see the dead babies keep sinking in our river that breaks immersion for the players because obviously dead babies float
i m trying not to read too much patch notes for sons of the forest but i saw that and cackled madly
i mean it s just science
gamers now have a reason to live
jesus christ reddit
o good the qol i needed
fixed a bug that caused size fish to not be catchable x200b if you know you know
it s also funny to imagine what it was like before this was implemented did they just sink lmao
well there goes my dead baby water exploit
well it s about time
good good
baby boat
but do they have buoyancy in other liquids
rather dashing knows how to handle this throw baby
i also took this screenshot

sons of the forest
infanticide is back on the menu
titanic simulator
that s a dead kid
ah sweet life update
easier to bob for babies now
your sims can now recognize the bodies in the water
i m assuming this is the sims
wait this isn t dwarf fortress
game is now playable
about time
black and white
i shared this in my discord hahahahah
one of my most favorite areas on this planet
that is an improvement
my first thought was rimworld but then i remembered it doesn t have a buoyancy mechanic
my cinder block budget is going to go through the roof
r brandnewsentence
im reading them too and almost spit water at my monitor
ngl am buying this game now
is this dwarf fortress it feels very dwarfy
bless developers
someone has been watching gavin or google
lmao what
lol that caught me off guard too
finnaly waiting for so long man
r thestrangelog
the option become enemies with child will no longer appear
rimworld moment
as they should
you can no longer try for a baby with the grim reaper
just secretly from now on i see
not that dark but this ck3 patch note hits hard you cannot confide in friends you do not have
you can no longer mistake your infant child for a serial killer
openly
ck2 had a great bug where the devs couldn t figure out why the late game was slowing down so much until they narrowed it down to greek byzantine cultures turns out about of ai demand in the late game was every greek character looking at every other character in their realm and deciding if they wanted to blind or castrate them and repeating that decision every single day whoops
mine is for assassin s creed valhalla where they patched in the ability to pet cats
i mean if you follow catholic doctrine the eucharist is the literal flesh of jesus just changed to be more palatable according to catholic doctrine believed by approximately of catholics worldwide the pope consumes human flesh probably daily
this patch note kinda ruins the fun of crusader kings tho imo the point is to make inbread monster babies that are best friends with eachother because of their gruesome traits so you don t need to do defensive espionage while you convert everyone to you tree fucking cult
knew it was gonna be the forest lol
those things scared the s out of me my gf when they spawned out of nowhere whilst we were just chopping down trees trying to build a house together worse was when we finally met their mother
hahah i was looking for context on this so thanks
haha i had a feeling love this game haha
yeah it was definitely chuckle worthy
i was waiting to see if anyone else knew where it was from i saw it and snickered a little too hard
immediately knew this was sons lol it couldn t be anything else i wish to believe
my first thought was sons of the forest then i started seeing sims mentioned
i was gonna guess dwarf fortress
what game was this i need it
funny patch notes d
wehadababyit sabouy
hahaha you made my day even better
so underrated
if i had awards to give this would get it
you load in and the game over corrects suddenly dead baby geyser
driving around with riders on the storm in the background perfection
riders on the storm
i saw a car with underglow the other day that means it s time for another nfs underground that was the deal
this one midnight club and most wanted we need them remastered pronto
imagine if that happened
so there is this remake currently happening in ue5 https://youtu.be/lo2nneunvoe i dont know if there is the intention to actually release it but at minimum its a great showcase of what is possible there is also the underground map as a mod for assetto corsa https://youtu.be/6ihdrosuhsi they are cleaing up the whole map so you can enjoy it while driving a realistic car handling model assetto corsa is also highly modable so there are a lot of cars that you can drive that were never in nfsu2 if ea isnt doing it maybe its for the best tbh there is a lot of communities that keep the nostalgia alive
from the windoooows to the wall
nfsu2 is one of the many games from this moment in time that were fantastic as a kid it set the standard and really set me up for disappointment in my adult gaming life
i hear music
the year old in me needs this so badly
what a game dude there was a spot on the freeway that was just right for crashing and making your car go flying it became my goal to make people crash horribly in that exact spot in every race that took place on the freeway
mmm brooke burke
dude all i want is to drive into a garage and my hispanic car guy is there and i ll spend hours pimping my clown vomit mobile to challenge the street kings of detroit to a drag race
facts i d love to have that game back
underground underground most wanted osts i trully miss those days nfs reboot was ok ish but from payback onwards good lord we are left with broken promises
liked midnight club dub edition more but this is acceptable
if they re mastered it i would fucking play it non stop for at least week
with this ea in charge i prefer that they dont touch this game i prefer this game stays in the past and not a half assed bug ridden microtransaction full only online dlc tucked remaster from this company
i work in video game licensing and the thought of the logistics for underground remasters gives me a headache
riders on the storm
do ya thang
would love it but you know they d add micro transactions a purchasable season pass and loot boxes
i was a midnight club man myself
underground introduced me to my absolute favorite band of all time i ve been a fan since i heard their track on there rise against is fucking amazing and pretty much any time i hear tim s voice i involuntarily think good lord the lungs on that boy

tried to emulate this and it runs slower then a dead grandma with one leg
for the love of god yes
i fucking love that game i mistakenly bought underground and it s nowhere near as good is a freakin masterpiece
now thats a game i would pay aaa prices for
i m sure some women also want this i miss rachel s 350z _

riders on the storm
definitely a goat nfs carbon was the only once that came close to its perfection to me definitely miss those drag races but the drifting in carbon was perfection
hell i m a girl and used to love playing that game the nissan 350z was like my dream car also i thought junkie xl s song action radius was the coolest thing ever
morons it s nfs mw remastered
carbon was best
theres a remastered my weekend is now full
close the correct answer was burnout was a really good year for gaming
male friend
not even close to being the goat
i haven t seen this format before it s pretty refreshing
fax
thats what men think about
sex
midnight club tho
i want that so bad i still have no idea how underground never got a sequel
that s much better than sexual activity
if done right it could be such an incredible game
sequels over re releases
is there a way to play this on the series x or do i need to go buy a
agreed
i would appreciate a remaster of need for speed most wanted for ps5 xbox series x
i don t just want speed that s childish i need speed it s a responsibility
to the windooooooooooow to the wall to the wall to the sweat drop down my
please tell me this is real edit i would forgive ea if they took this game updated it just to work on newer systems and just left it riders of the storm sun dun dum dunn
hyundai tiburon with the wide body kit son
is this real nfsu made me think get low was a family friendly song and we all like to see ____ and _____ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojqfzxu9r8)
i want a test drive unlimited remaster instead
to do it justice they would have to do a total remake of the game from the ground up just a graphics revamp and a controls port is absolutely not enough
facts
remember when racing games were fun now everything has to be like forza racing that holds your hand and lets you rewind if you error
bring it back yes
personal favorite was always carbon
i think about art
good this would be good i bought a used ps2 partly for this game alone
her
a selling point for the arcade i ordered for sure
and girls i ve been making sure to google that for years in the hopes that they ll see the searches and then give it to us

wait there s a remaster
one better i ll die on that hill
oh man i remember when nutrigrain gave out free games with each box of cereal if memory serves correct it was this tony hawk matt hoffman s bmx and kelly slater pro surfer now they won t even give us a god damn tazo with a packet of chips
i am more into burnout takedown
where is it i must buy and re enjoy
give it to me
nfs heat s soundtrack did nothing for me this tho pump it directly into my veins
riders on the storm
maybe the only race car game i miss from my childhood the remaster will be available for what platform
i kept playing the first one
midnight club that s what we need
i think this is the only game my younger brother and i both enjoyed
underground was such a gem i loved every minute of it
this meme was probably the best way l learned there was a remake coming of this game l loved back in the day i hope they don t replace the music with modern shit
this isn t burnout
riders on the storm

yes but pls don t ruin it lol
i need to get this now
for me is midnight club
i d take a remaster of this gem over unbound
the dolphin emulator version works really well
halo infinite does this fucking rocks
allow me to introduce you to deep rock galactic funny space dwarf mining game with a lovely community amazing devs and an amazing monetization system to match the only in game putchases are cosmetic packs which give you a huge load of cool cosmetics for not too much money but all the free cosmetics are equally cool and you never feel outglamoured by paying players the battlepass is free and while it does take a while to earn at the end of each season all the items are put into the regular item loot pool meaning you can still get season cosmetics and thus no fomo plus the game is really good chaotic and funny and nice and casual i really recommend it
stares directly at destiny
rare halo infinite w
you re so right i can t tell you how many games i stopped playing because of some stupid event i bought into it suddenly becomes like work you have to login and do this and that and the other after i finish with those i don t have the time and energy to play for fun it sours the entire experience and i don t want to play anymore
halo does this and it s awesome
the concept of a battle pass being something you need to purchase anyways is an absolute scam it s a skins for with a fucking labor requirement to unlock them all fuck that the only people who get a pass are like apex legends where the game is otherwise free if i pay for a game i do not want to be forced to pay more money for anything besides major content updates dlc and games as a service has gone too far and is effecting game development negatively the issue is that so many people never played video games back when it was the two expansions model and instead just think this slop they shovel at us is fine pay up piggy is such a braindead profit model i hope the games industry crashes and we can free ourselves of some of this bullshit
i think it s going to blow back in developers faces when they realize gamers just don t have the time or patience to focus on multiple battle passes seasons like you better have an amazing game for me to consider your battle pass or season because most of these freaken things feel like a second job
this is precisely what drives me away from overwatch hey it launched i blink a month passes and oh hey it s season and you ve missed characters outfits you can t get anymore etc etc it starts feeling like you simply can t keep up unless it s the only game you play and you play it obsessively i loved overwatch but i can t do that to myself for overwatch instead i ve just stopped playing entirely
battle pass discourage me hitting the end takes an ungodly amount of hours frankly anyone that grinds that much must have an unhealthy addiction to gaming
try halo infinite their battle passes are buy now unlock whenever the only fomo is their little events they do sparingly
this is the reason i don t play online fps anymore the landscape has changed so much
i stopped overwatch because of that i would like to earn the new skin but i won t pay to have the right to ear them if i play a lot as i just can t and won t play a lot anyway
halo let s you do this can just switch back and forth between seasons
man i m out of touch you people play that kind of shit that s just so transparently exploitative
i can t do battle passes because i simply can t play those games enough multiplayer isn t something i want to play day in day out it s something i want to hop on for an hour or two on a saturday or smash out a few rounds in minutes before bed months or whatever it is for a whole season will leave me short levels and i ve tried some call of duty phone game halo infinite and splatoon i m at like level on season of halo splatoon 3s battle pass is free too and i ve never reached the end and that s the mp game i ve been playing for the last months or so so at this point i don t even bother with them battle passes are dumb
industry standard battlepass fucking disgusting
plus making a non time limited battle pass system allows you to buy an old battle pass available for purchase meaning you can further monetize a newer to your game player if they so choose maybe make some minor aspects of a pass time locked like in a cod game make a specific camo pattern the i beat the battle pass during its season bow before me thing but anyone can access the item
i have outright quit games because of battle pass nonsense that makes the game feel like work at this point i don t know that i could ever actually make myself play another game with a battle pass mechanic
i agree i paid for the game and the pass let me get the content
it s the only type of dlc or microtransaction i can think of that you pay for something and are on a clock for unlocking what you paid for it s crazy for games like apex legends i think it s okay because if you complete the bp you get enough credits to unlock the next bp for free too but i would much rather just get unlimited time to clear the bp i m not playing an always online game day after day for months straight i just refuse to do so which means i m not paying for your bp
but then how do the game companies get to do a real life infinite money glitch don t you love when they make you pay to get free rewards every six weeks don t you love being forced to play games in a specific way that is unnatural to its design just to accomplish objectives and progress along to justify the money you spent you don t like getting a new version of the identical game every year with only minor changes aren t you having fun
this is an interesting read i m only part way through the comments my 14yo has been playing fortnite since he was and gets the battle pass each quarter i refuse to pay for additional skins but the bp looked to have some value in that it unlocks x weapons and skins and allows a level increase has that changed he doesn t game for hours on end in fact during school he only plays on the weekend and then during the holidays he will get some time in we re talking probably hours total on a weekend and then during holidays probably hours mon fri plus the weekend i have always resisted letting him spend or me spend any more than the bp telling him it didn t even give anything meaningful skins was just designed to take his time and in some cases was similar to gambling whilst he initially railed against it citing the usual friends do this it was when i worked with a guy who was a gamer himself who was so anti additional purchase loot boxes that when he told me to stay firm and i relayed this to my son he stopped complaining i guess he saw it valid from a guy who was a gamer rather than his dad there is no doubt in my mind exploitation at work here and am glad to read it in such a well delivered message that i couldn t have composed myself as i m not a gamer
it feels like a lot of younger gamers these days have just one game that they play and identify with it s typically fortnite but apex warzone and a few others occupy that space as well they don t ever branch out because these games condition them with dailies passes and the like to only play their game to gain interest in something else is to miss out on something in their game this is really gonna damage the industry down the road
it s an addiction like drugs alcohol gambling etc they know that and exploit it this is big business and i only foresee it becoming worse considering the age we re going into it could be a very useful tool to corrupt corporations and governments who want more control ready player one
there seems to be a distinct lack of gatekeepers in this thread usually any mention of this being a thing brings out the people who only care about exclusivity they want everything to be exclusive
solution move away from battle passes instead introduce paid quarterly content drops once you buy it you have as much time as you want to complete it no pressure to play within a certain time frame before the season is over note this will only work for pve content
this should be really be a more common thing i ve literally paid for it if they re going to take it away from me then refund me the of the battle pass that i had left
i d love a combination of halo infinite for the unlimited time and fortnite for the fun challenges
yeah but us gamers are all lemmings who just flock to the newest game crying about it the whole time if we actually stood up to this kind of stuff and didn t play those games they would be forced to change but we don t change so they don t have to
it all started getting iffy when companies began hiring psychologists to look at how players played a game and identify how they could monetise certain gameplay loops
for real i m the type of player that plays lots of games i can t keep up if anything it pushes me away from the game like those adverts of games that say most addictive game yeh i won t be touching that business model these days seems to be making money after people have bought the game it s why single player games are my faves
yes my daughter got super into fortnite around season and pretty soon my husband and i started playing just so we had some family time together on the weekends it wasn t too bad at first because if you got the battle pass you could work on most of the unlocks after the season ended and it was a lot easier to complete the pass it seemed like it crept and crept until we had to log in at least once a day if we were hoping to get the basic unlocks never mind the super fancy ones i remember telling my husband at one point i already have a job i don t need a video game to be my second one but our solution was to just quit the game i hope more people start pulling back from games with battle passes but it s also hard to steer your kids away when it s what all of their friends at school play or even as an adult when it s what all of your friends are playing
unfortunately we are in a capitalist society so profit is all that matters if you want real change people need to stop paying for the product until is reasonable making them lose money is the only way to get their attention
more games need to follow the ol rock and stone method of battle pass and content releases deep rock galactic should be the poster child people point to when talking about what they want from micro transactions there is paid cosmetics the game rarely points them out to you tons of free cosmetics are released into the game regardless and there is a battle pass built in you can work towards if you don t finish it oh well all those cosmetics roll over into the unlock pool that you passively work towards while just in missions the battle pass also lets you focus on certain unlocks first as it s more of a tree then a line allowing you to pick the wanted options first
i was gonna say halo infinite does this but then i remembered about the weekly ultimate rewards dammit
just stop buying it and while you re at it think really hard about why you re playing that specific game are you actually having fun or are you just running on a virtual treadmill to get the next shiny
thats why ive gotten to a point i just wait it out if im playing a game enough to make it the way through the free pass and i can make my money back when i purchase the pass ill absolutely buy into it at that point it shows i played enough to warrant the purchase vs having the feeling like man i bought it so i really need to geind this out to get my moneys worth so much better in the long run keeps me having fun with the game and causes less burn out if everyone switched to playing like that i feel the industry would change really quick but to each their own its your money do what you want if its not hurting yourself or others
literally the best part about halo infinite
this is why now a days i only play games on gamepass and avoid free and mobile games altogether it s not you playing the game it s the game playing you
halo infinite for all its flaws nailed this it s inconceivable to me that you can charge me for a bp and then lock me out of the content because i didn t have time to finish it like sorry i have a life outside of this and i enjoy playing other games as well
i have to agree they really shouldn t expire fomo is not cool for something i literally paid for let me grind for it ffs
you say all this and players say they care they might but truly they don t they don t truly care because they can t give up that stuff
i strongly agree the current model is literally built around making the product more addictive and at this point i feel that gaming needs to be regulated when it comes to business practices
personally i think if you buy a season pass then at the end of that season everything should unlock for you regardless as you most certainly have already paid for it and for the people that complete their season passes besides having access to using whatever is unlocked earlier they could have some other kind of reward like xp or in game currency or something idk
agreed this is why i mostly just play small studio releases from steam nowadays the aaa titles are getting more disappointing while managing to cost more to play the magic of playing classic titles like bf or cod is just gone for me i blame fortnite
the industry standard should be just not having battlepasses when and why did we start accepting this as a standard
i was actually really sad when i realized i could no longer complete the upgrade path on a fortnite battlepass skin because the season had ended
assuming if they allowed buying previous battle passes you don t have i d even accept not being able to get the premium currency and only cosmetics
i also think you should be able to buy previous battle passes so there s no fomo at all on a certain level battle passes are not a bad thing at all they re generally a great value for the content you get players get cool new stuff devs get continued funding and it s usually only bucks once every months if you really love fortnite and you re going to be playing anyways it s fantastic value proposition
season pass or battle pass are evil these games just keep getting more psychologically addictive bullshit crammed into them they also shoot them selves in the foot with them for short term money then burn us out on their own game we can only vote with our wallet and don t get them buy and play games that don t use them
you are spot on i think there should also be some further investigation into these companies actually hiring psychologists definitely not the place for it should be reviewed and regulated specifically if these positions are held at the company the product should be closer scrutinised before release to the public
this is why i stopped playing magic arena kept rolling over my battle pass playing religiously until i got burned out towards the beginning of a battle pass now whenever i think of the game i think of the wasted battle pass from when i took my break and thinking about it only extends my break indefinitely
yeah i too have been hating this i feel exactly the same thing why is the game forcing me to play when i don t even want to i just want a good game without this shit built in
hard agree preach
preach brother preach hallelujah
so halo infinite did something right x200b how the turntables
yes please super animal royale has non time gated battle passes and i love that the only difference between new and old passes other than the cosmetics is that the new pass is at a discounted price and old passes are at full price if we re going to get battle passes i think that should be the norm
battle passes suck stop buying them
if they tell you up front that you have only a limited time to unlock things on it and you do not like that then dont buy the battle pass
except the entire purpose of a battle pass is to encourage daily play also the reason they have a free section in addition to paid if you had unlimited time it would just be dlc
damaging to players but great for short term profits for execs therefore
forcing people to maintain a daily presence on your game nobody is forcing anything while actively pushing players into obligatory playtime again people force themselves it s just cosmetics for the most part i want to hear people s thoughts seems more like you want people to tell you you re right life is already full of addiction patterns this isn t anything new kids better learn about it early but parents don t want to do their job they want businesses to do it for them also forget about any free to play games without these types of mechanics a game isn t free to make and it also costs a shit ton of money to maintain over the years i ll take an optional battle pass over a game i might like
imo trash take i love the battle pass system i hardly ever buy them if i do its because i was grinding the game already it s always cosmetic anyway why do you care you think the people who are creating cosmetic content are the people who are doing the balance patches games are huge and compplicated and take alot of time to make them good and they need a steadier stream of income to afford it cause aaa games should cost like dollars by now but people won t buy stuff at they can t afford to i know i cant i only ever buy games on sale no one made you buy anything take some personal responsibility for your spending don t give your children access to your credit card
sounds like you are complaining that dedicated players are rewarded more than casual players if you play all day every day it makes sense that you unlock more collectables or cosmetics as long as you can play the entirety of the game content such as story mode or multiplayer gametypes i am fine with not unlocking everything if i play only a few hours people need to manage thier own goals and expectations
i don t disagree with the premise but also why are people buying battlepasses for games they don t play a lot
or here s a novel idea only buy battle passes for games that you ll invest time in the industry doesn t care for the superfluous standards you want to impose they care about money i only buy rocket league battle passes because every one of them i hit around tier or i m not sure there s an end to them to be honest even if at that stage all you re getting is recolors of stuff
there is nothing fucking predatory about this shit nothing at all buy it or don t read the fucking terms
if you stop buying these things they will go away on their own vote with your wallet
deleted
needs by law dude just don t play games that operate like that vote with your wallet daddy government doesn t give a fuck if you don t get your unicorn mount
sorry this is a really bad take not because i don t want the ability to go back and work on battlepasses that would be sweet but your argument is predicated on the idea that companies making money off of addiction is illegal it s not cigarettes weed alcohol porn gambling sugar all addictive in nature and legal plenty of companies making money off of people actively destroying their lives so unless we get rid of all of those things why should gaming companies not be allowed to do the same especially if it doesn t actually net you anything other than skins your argument also basically states that fomo feels bad and because of that the feds should step in and do something i m sorry what what type of warlord dictatorship are you describing under this warlord literally nothing would be allowed to be limited edition lol you also imply that because some kids parents let s them roam free on the internet the internet should be modified to accommodate for that no parents should be aware of what their kids are doing and playing online making that everyone else s problem except the parents is insane kids can t open bank accounts online spending in games is always enabled by a parent
the industry standard needs to be that when you pay for a battle pass you should have an unlimited amount of time to unlock every tier fomo and fabricated obligations to play games are predatory damaging to players and the industry as a whole absolutely correct unfortunately then they can t provide a pay to skip or pay to complete the days you missed option so they won t
yeah i have no self control and i need someone to blame how dare they force me to play video games everyday
fully agree but fomo is a pillar of fugi a popular and common list of psychological triggers salesmen use to manipulate consumers which brings us to the next problem business video games are a business and especially in this day and age they are run by bean counting execs who don t give shits about the quality or subject matter of a game they view the game as a checklist of focus group tested features designed to bring in the most but yeah i agree with the sentiment of being against battle passes and fomo seasonal content i always cringe when i see people children addicts praising the addition of cash shops and battle passes like with temtem s launch it s what keeps me from playing games i otherwise would want to play like pso2 ngs or diablo afaik deep rock galactic is the only one game with a seasonal content model that doesn t punish the player s schedule with fomo all cosmetic content from a season just gets added to the general loot pool when a season ends which is excellent and respectful design
i ve purchased exactly one battlepass for a game ever and it wasn t really worth it battlepasses are very appealing i think most gamers are aware of gotcha games shitty mobile games and pay to win games but battlepasses have hit this middle ground of being highly compelling and compeitivly irrelevant which is why they have been working so well our only recourse is to not buy them and not even play the games that use them unfortunately
i am very glad to see people are finally talking about fomo but there are a few that are exploited to make us spend more money temporary price drops and artificial scarcity on digital only goods all the time we see memes about games going on sale on steam yet we don t bat an eyelash at the fact they are exploiting fomo manipulate us into making impulse purchases it s different than when a store does it because these are not physical goods they re not trying to cut losses they re just trying to get more money for less effort similarly whenever there s a holiday themed skin if it s only available then of course they are trying to get you to pay more because you may not get this again
yes i agree with you that s why i play only single player games now i used to play wot pubg rl and with battle seasonpasses it was like i would love to have that looks amazing but it s on very end maybe i can make it but with my limited free time i get up to of the pass and it s over all i got was just angry sad feeling if passes were longer or unlimited i would be still playing some of those games but all i can say is thanks to those games that made me realize i was wasting my money and time to have nice pixels now i just buy a game i like and enjoy my time and have even nicer pixels
ahh theres the anti fortnite comment even though its literally one of the top played games still and has the best battlepass model out of all of them comparing the rewards and the ability to keep getting every future battlepass completely free with zero p2w and then proceeds to defend halo infinite of all games lmfao
i can t believe these companies have roped people into getting battle passes in the first place
nothing turns me off a game like permanently time locked content where if i start late i am just permanently behind the psychology of that is incredibly bad i know they staff psychologists so i have no idea why they let that through it makes it so your player base can only ever go down
this is absolutely true hadn t heard the term process addiction until now but you can guarantee these free to play games have absolutely nailed addiction algorithms at this point some of the tactics are downright exploitative
at the end of the day it s the consumer s own fault not the salesman if people stopped falling for these tactics then they wouldn t exist but people buy into them so why would they stop it s the gaming community s responsibility as a whole to end shallow mtx tactics but gamers are just too weak uneducated and impatient to resist
the industry standard needs to be absolutely no microtransactions in a full priced game there is no defending microtransactions in games costing over 30usd in a market that is earning billions every year
i ve always disagreed with the set date to date range for buying a subscription i d much rather it be game time that only counts down as it s used
as a parent who grew up playing games on consoles and pcs the state of video games now is abhorrent and my kids mental health has suffered greatly they are hard to control when they are in full junkie mode
it s annoying to see arguments like well you should have been there when it was available or i worked hard for this you don t deserve it an item in a video game seriously or you re getting a lot of stuff for the price anyway even if you don t finish it the items in some games have massively inflated prices the game company can say an item typically goes for but that doesn t make it a better value just because there s eg of them in a pass if players are going to be supportive of this and get roped into defending a company that is bleeding them dry of money and time using psychologically addictive tactics then someone needs to step in and protect them from themselves after all stuff like gambling has age restrictions i m not saying video games should only be for adults or all require id verification or that games can t be fun but it needs to be toned down when the impulse to play isn t wow i had a great time playing but oh snap i ve got to sink another hours today or i will miss out forever on that thing i wanted
this is not a problem any government needs to address you are free to play any of the thousands of games that do not implement a pricing scheme you consider predatory the government is not and need not be your parent take responsibility for yourself and make better decisions
don t buy battle passes it s a pretty simple concept
sorry fam were about capitalism so no one cares about your life
if fomo is all a company has to do to get your money you sir deserve to be parted from it i was just talking about concert fomo duping stupid people i think it s incredibly hilarious that stupid people are that sensitive to herd movements it s definitely a sign they are smack dab in the middle of the iq bell curve they have to stay as close with the herd as possible to survive
industry standard should be that every single piece of planned dlc be listed before purchase so you know exactly what you re buying and what you re missing when you choose not to get season passes and collectors edition
gwent does it like that
by law spending money on games should guarantee the user all the shiny toys being advertised to them especially with how many of these games are advertised and marketed to children it s bullshit and infuriating to anyone who understands what s happening what law lol and do you realise that laws differ from country to country please don t bring law into your argument when you aren t going to provide a source for your by law statement with that said i ve found in most games i play the battle passes to have reasonable rewards be reasonably priced and have a reasonable timeframe for completion i don t play fortnite but i have bought the gwent cycle frontier dota2 overwatch2 and a few other battle passes and never really felt rushed to complete them were priced anywhere from so reasonable and the rewards from the battlepass often outweighed the dollar value in terms of virtual value sometimes returning or more of the dollar value of in game currency of all the things to dislike in the gaming sector i don t think battlepasses are the one
i m still confused about people willingly buying things that they seemingly don t agree with don t like the terms of we re talking about fluff content in video games people aren t getting conned if people stop buying this shit companies will change their approach the companies aren t going to change anything when people whine on the internet but keep paying anyways
i refuse to use battle passes i don t want to play that way
battle passes are predatory by nature don t buy them and uninstall the games that run on them if you disagree with the practice i ve had to abandon destiny and overwatch because of their battle passes and the slew of game changes that came with them they know what they are doing they know that these practices take advantage of players and worsen the gameplay experience for the average person they won t care until you change your spending and playing habits i haven t touched destiny in well over a year and do not miss it at all anymore i uninstalled overwatch before season began pretty sure i had become addicted to it i don t miss it anymore now either
i disagree there should be exclusive rewards for the most dedicated players
until it stops making money or we have some sort of government intervention it isn t going to change i don t play a single game with a battle pass i played overwatch since the beta days and quit after overwatch went with the battle pass format if you don t like it don t support it it will never change if people keep paying and then complaining about it they don t give a fuck about your complaints they give a fuck that you gave them money i m sure i m going to hear about a bunch of games that so the battle pass the right way i don t care i think it s a shitty practice from the ground up and i won t be a part of it you do what you want though
the industry standard shouldn t have battle passes to begin with just make all the stuff unlockable by just playing the game
imagine chilling walking with your bike and finding a literal space snake nice art btw

this is so cool and nostalgic i was given a used emerald for my old gameboy but it s in japanese it didn t matter though i spent so much time exploring and battling without understanding anything i had to memorize the attacks depending on the japanese letters characters i was even able to beat my cousins playing ruby english thanks for the reminder
rayquaza looking c h o n k
using this as my phone and desktop wallpaper as we speak such an awesome artwork love looking at it every day
oh my god man you cooking hard ngl
that s a gut punch right in the nostalgia
that girl is fuuuucked
really cool if you made a youtube channel to show the process of making these im sure you would get a lot of views nice job
this hit me hard in the nostalgia good job
dope art mate
i want another sprite based pokemon game i m sick and tired of the charmless bland 3d bullshit
this is what pokemon graphics should look like nice job
i m not sure if this is inspired by the big dragon thing from dbz but it reminds me of the big dragon thing from dbz i was never huge into dbz so i don t know the name regardless this is awesome
i can smell a nintendo lawsuit right here
i d shit my pants if rayquaza keeps staring down at me like that great art

gigantamax rayquaza
payback
nostalgia at it s finest and this coming from someone who never owned this game to boot
shenron vibes
i can hear this gif
what a great game
amazing
shenron i summon you
emerald being not only my favorite pokmon game but one of my favorite games this is amazing
love your work on the steam workshop for wallpaper engine
emerald is my favourite pokmon game of all time i learned how to read by playing pokmon blue i loved gen ii but emerald it had such a good postgame the battle frontier has never been the same since emerald i was extremely disappointed by the shitty battle frontier in the gen iii remakes i always played through the games with the one pokmon strategy i d beat the main story with just the starter and nothing else most people finished the games much quicker than i did with emerald i told myself i was going to finish it in hours i m not a speed runner by any means but the prior games had taken me like hours to get through somehow when i beat the elite four my play time captured on beating them at the pc clocked in at and something seconds
i ve collected all the dragon ball s and am here for my wish
this is so good great job
that s a lot of well placed pixels
i wonder why gamefreak and nintendo wont do something like that isnt this like ez money they dont even have to come up with new ideas
is beautiful
very calming indeed
i am the eternal dragon state your wish
our boy came back tick
this feels nostalgic i love it
thanks
as goh form pokemon journey would say pokeball go

damn i remember the ngage coming out when i was a teen anyone else remember it being slated in decline of video gaming you mean you actually bought an n gage
i loved the n gage playing worms with mates via bluetooth during school lessons good old times
n gage original taco owner here thps2 kicked ass that was all i needed
i don t understand why people don t like game boy sure it s nothing compared to the n gage but it has its place in gaming history
i had the n gage w tony hawk my first year of college it was great i don t remember much about its capabilities as a phone
man that gameboy is in excellent condition
i mean i have a neogeo pocket color somewhere with only one game
wtf the n gage was great especially the qd version first time i played a pokemon game was on a gameboy emulator for the n gage
yeah the dmg was terrible that n gage fucked super hard though
n gage wasn t so bad tony hawk was awesome
which is it which sarcasm
why would you say the gameboy was the worst
i remember spending way too much time playing lemonade tycoon the sims on ngage back then lol
man i wish nokia would have hold back the release and jump straight to n cage qd
i remember all the boys in my class who fortunate enough to have phone have that n gage looking at ngage in a table was a sight to behold
damn always makes me smile when i randomly hear about the n gage it always seemed bad so i never got it but the thing keeps clutching to the fabric of history fiercely determined to not be forgotten
the n gage qd zune and the sidekick were the ones i missed out on in my teens that would have been the dream for me back then
i wanted that nokia so bad as a first phone settled for a samsung r225 with an annoying flashing aftermarket antenna
gaming on a phone who does that
lmao the first game i ever worked on was for the ngage i was a tester on system rush still have that game in shrink wrap
hey man the n gage is cool so long as you always say it like jean luc picard
didn t the ngage have a pretty good game boy emulator meboy i think it was called my cousin had one and i was so jealous of course he didn t had any games other than tony hawk but it was an early homebrew scene and i love those kinds of things
i loved pathway to glory ashen mile high pinball and one sega rpg game that i can t remember the name at all it was the screen what made the ngage so bad small and portrait
want to sell me the n gage lol
every time i see or hear about the n gage i just remember that french canadian guy from those x play reviews i don t know why and i wish i didn t
loading all the ngage games on one sd card was amazing
if grey game boys could talk i clocked s of hours on mine as a kid
hey at least you can emulate gameboy to snes gameboy advance runs horrible in that bad boy
the n gage is probably worth more than the gameboy now
that s ngage qd and it was cool as a console and phone however original ngage was the one you had to hold sideways to talk d
that s it that s the goddam item i mashed together to make my name i thought it was a fever dream
i wanted the n gage so bad for no reason
hey gameboy wasn t that bad
god i wanted an n gage so badly as a kid
i had the qd in college for two years before i got an iphone 3g mostly just played tony hawk on it but i remember splinter cell being pretty good too
i have a friend that had one and played an elder scrolls game on it and let me try it was bad but i thought it was pretty cool and groundbreaking as a 13yo
of us in a class bought ngages and played the hell out of all the multiplayer games i liked it
n cage truly a legend what is that game boy thing
my n gage was a beast handheld and phone built into one still raging it was stolen off me
i had an n gage qd too i miss when phones had personality
i own a green ngage actually pretty cool device
that n gage movie starting the kingsman actor that s coming out this month is going to be awesome
that n gage qd was basically all of my childhood playing worms pandemonium rayman pathway to glory and kof fifa and asphalt lol me playing it non stop after my school exams good times it basically a phone that you can play legit games in it what s not to love
i remember the n gage being being bigger honestly still looks like a taco
my old boss was apparently the former head of marketing for the n gage let s just say he wasn t great at his job he also couldn t stand me so i don t feel bad blasting him if he s reading this guy got fired after being condescending to the ceo s wife at an event among like other things
speaking of worst purchases must be the shape but that n gage made me think of a tamagotchi lol x d
part of an absolute confluence of digital culture https://myngage.ytmnd.com/)
ah yes the supreme mobile gaming experience tomb raider and call of duty were meant to played in portrait mode at fps and you can call people too by looking like you listen to a taco also the nokia doesn t eat aa s like nikocade eats ramen s
i actually fucking loved my n gage as a teen i had music games and video on it let me carry around just one device instead of multiple like everyone else iphone changed that of course but it was woefully out of date by then anyway kids would mock me for the taco phone but then beg to have a go at tony hawk s on the bus
i had gameboy color one that had a shape of psp i lived in a third world country back then so when my family returned from us they brought me this i was i think the only kid in the entire country other then my cousin that had these many memories i probably still have all my ps1 games somewhere i had probably over hundreds of games
haven t had either of those but this picture does do a rather good job of showing how much tech can change within years game boy dwarves the n gage
that phone looks well weapon
i will not have you slander the gameboy like that it wasn t the best model but it was perfect eventually
pretty much all the games for ngage series were pirated
i remember begging and begging for an ngage as a teen and being so chuffed when i finally got it
dude the taco was awesome i had three of them
stylish form factor though
i kinda want a handheld with gameboy orientation again having your hands so far apart never felt right to me but i must admit wide screens are nice and they don t have any synergy with that design unless of course it looks like a t which would be weird
come on gameboy wasnt that bad
some of the ring tunes on n gage were really good
we taco talkin dawg
tell me you never bought a stadia without telling me you never bought a stadia
holy fuck i wanted a ngage so badly when i was we went to multiple stores and nobody had them so i had to settle for a siemens brick
now i really want an n gage
i immediately heard jean luc picard saying engage ah old internets
cmon the gameboy wasn t that bad
i too hate the gameboy
i loved my ngage great emulator worms and glimmerati were excellent tomb raider and sims bustin out we re gems as well
which is the good one
all i can remember about the n gage are the skits x play used to do about it with a guy dressed up acting like patrick stewart
cmon man the game boy wasn t that bad
i had both but much later the ngage and bought just to see how it actually was i never suceeded to get it back then due when tried to order it from gamestop they had some extra discount to get it for and sending it international it just didn t work however i would probably enjoy it as a phone and a decent gaming portable console
i m calling rolf that his n gage has been found
ugh i wanted an n gage so badly i just wanted to play lara croft on the bus to school alas they didnt last long
damn i completely forgot about the ngage
up yours op ngage was good for the time just because it wasn t the best game machine ever doesn t mean it was the worst
that whole generation of nokia was wild i miss the days of phones being unique of having a usp rather than today s bland phablets which all look the same
nah the n gage was incredible remember while it competed with the gba who was bit it was a full on smartphone it had internet apps cool 3d games like ghost recon or tomb raider it paved the way for the psp or modern smartphones
damn i wish i got to keep my childhood dresser for years with everything still in it
oh damn i also had an n gage i used to play the shit out of ssx on that fucker as a kid
i don t know the game boy wasn t that bad
before i even opened the pic my brain went straight to you bought an n gage didn t you
won on of those are a convention once guy had a 25ft putt setup had to sink three balls he had ngage with some driving game as a prize begged me to let him keep it on display for the day and he d send it to me later never did thought he was a fool for thinking a 25ft putt on a flat floor was a challenge his boss sent me dollar gift card to spencers that was nice bought a lava lamp that spelled curse words occasionally
my ngage qd had a lit screen decent battery and tony hawk pro skater is all that mattered at the time my game boy colour was see through and purple i had it pretty good at the time the original ngage as the taco to the head that everyone made fun of the qd was actually great at gaming
perfectly balanced as all things should be
look you had me with half of this but come on it s not fair to call the gameboy the worst
i had an n gage i played so much tony hawk on that thing despite it running at like fps
ah yes that god awful gameboy and the neogeo gods gift that was too early for this despicable world
you re right the n gage was the best
does it have a cartridge inside and what is it
i never understood how sony made both phones and the psp didn t put it together
the gameboy was the stuff of legend as for the stuff of nightmares has anyone ever heard of the game com
that gameboys going for rn if you looking to make a quick sale
didn t the ngage require you to open the back and take out the battery in order to swap games
i had cool boarders for the ngage i knew immediately after turning it on i d made a big mistake
classic gameboy really was something special my kids are six and eight and there s nothing like it the 2ds is close but gone are the days of a handheld with simple fun games a battery life that will go for weeks and the ability to accidentally drop it off the top of a playground slide and still work fine that durability factor matters a lot when your kid opens the box on christmas and runs around bouncing off furniture in pure joy
ah the n gage because who doesn t want to take out the battery on their device to change out games
i remember being a kid and seeing that n gage advertised all over my game informers and at game stop i wanted one so bad glad i didn t get one i guess lmfao
i remember going to a store to buy a gameboy advance with my parents at like years old and the dude at the counter was talking to them about how the n gage was basically the same thing if they wanted to get that instead i gave that mother fucker the dirtiest look i honestly thing that s the day i learned to hate
i wanted an n gage so bad i m so thankful i couldn t afford to put gas in my car in the era it was out
they re on the console as well
of those symbols in total one i always forget is the color of the controller adapts to your game as you play color of your clan banner or car you re driving or beating red when you re near death in a game you have to remember to look down in certain moments
oh man can t wait to see this post again in a few weeks
i m shocked playstion fans still don t know about it i literally see an article about it every day
how old are you thursday april 6th
all the better to charge you over a controller
thursday years old idiot
damn i wonder for how long they ve done this
i ve never owned a playstation probably never will so that s a cool detail i ve never known about either
i had no idea
same
holy cow
yooo
holy crap that s actually really cool
what an unnecessary and probably expensive detail
on xbox sx you get nothing like this no controller features and you need to use your own batteries cheap quality feeling like something you buy from china
yeah one of the major new feats of the dualsense
you must have not had access to the internet or reddit since
damn people still learning about this i swear they were talking all about it when the ps5 got announced
now i instantly looked at my xbox controller and got disappointed
but are those exes or crosses
wait until you find out what the analog sticks are made from
at least you have a ps5
whatever i get a new controller i always like to compare them
the joy sticks are also made out of dogs nose skin
your eyesight is insane
beat that x box
u didn t know that even i without a ps5 know this
millennial discover textures
very cool but lots of synthetic materials have dimpling to provide extra grip just think about steering wheel covers
this was pointed out literally when the first ones made it to influencers years ago
queue a company making caps for them with xbox and nintendo shapes on them
i bet people would prefer a normal texture and better battery life
i immediately grabbed my ps4 controller and was like aw
no way
mine isn t
i m too old and my eyesight is too poor to notice
ps5 ragnarok bundle comes with lame ass non grip controller

nice
someone from a younger generation in the future gets their hands on one of these be like
they were making articles about this before the console even launched
oh yeah i remember reading about that a long time ago
check your butthole
well r damnthatsinteresting
this was supposed to be a quick scroll through of posts before bed first thing this year that s bothered me enough to literally jump out of bed and immediately check my controller exclaiming naww repeatedly then i read someone say it s also on the console which restarted the reaction with a lot more naww ing
da heck things you should know before your s
finally they do something creative with the controllers
i always liked sony for their sexy factor this proves it
it took only years for me
bruh my buddy told me this day one with my console i woulda never known if it weren t for that glorious soul
thats what they splurged their money on instead of ya know decent battery life
marketing skill
what the actual hell please say me its not a lie
so cool really good detail to add
mine isn t o
that s what we call unesesary but incredibly great detail
they are on the buttons as well
wut
they sure are alot of companies do cool thinks like this jeep is famous for it
the lights on the dualshock and dualsense never made any sense to me why would i be looking at my controller when the game is happening on my t v i love my playstation but those lights are dumb af
why do you know how many there are lol
i was today years old
way it s been going you ll see it tomorrow
mrwhosetheboss just dropped a video talking about it today too
i didn t read articles about ps5
that drifts after months i m on my second and it s just started drifting
i hate these titles with a passion
you seem fun to be around
shows dedication and love for the craft and even though i don t use ps i admire this level of love
so user replaceable batteries that can be swapped out whenever without fully opening up the controller and no degrading battery health over time
you better load that shotgun
i believe playstation uses cross officially though a lot of companies call it the exes button
i have no complaints about the battery on these controllers
no way
oh fuck til
whaaaaaatttttt
r angryupvote
they re on the console as well
my head is exploding i ve made a mess
check the inner sides of the white plates near the led lights
they re on all the accessories too like headset and controller dock
they may not have much of a functional reason but i do think it s cool when i played gta they changed colour green franklin orange trevor blue michael they flashed red and blue when being chased by cops and im pretty sure they went white when changing character in the clouds but i could easily be mistaken on that
they re good for showing player number beyond that yeah who looks at them lol
it always annoyed me that you couldn t turn off disable the led come on let me save some battery life
no more or less than adding tiny symbols as grip lol
i often play with minimal hud and many games use the lights as a health indicator i like it it s also extra effort on smaller details that s nice
if you re playing in a dark room you ll see the lights reflected off of your wall terrible for your eyes to do that though
the lightbar on the ps4 controller was to track the controller in vr with psvr they designed it ahead of time
google man i didn t count em lol just look up easter eggs of the ps5 theres all sorts of cool info on it those symbols werent added after they literally forge together the controller even the process is a trip
he counted
i don t read them either the headlines are all over the place though especially in this sub
you got the death grip time to stop watching porn
i was using a ds4 as my controller for most games on pc for about years and as of a year ago ish am on a ds5 i ve never had drift or any issues with either i used a ds3 before that and still didn t have any problems you might just be fighting your controller
times out of people who have stick drift usually mishandle their controller
i have had mine for about months and haven t had any drift i have started wearing out the membrane for the x button though it s getting squishy
all rechargeable batteries go bad after a while
lol a xbox controller with the rechargeable battery is like to dollars
i m sure you don t it s part of the sunk cost fallacy
are they for real on the buttons
ah shadows of the empire first game i played on the that god damn game gets absolutely fucking impossible
sarge s heroes is such an underrated game i loved it when i was a kid
no zelda
star fox is the french kiss of n64 games
hi this is ken griffey jr lets play major league baseball
probably all of the classics minus goldeneye great collection ken griffey jr slugfest was my game bro
ahh shit is that rogue squadron i spot
pokmon stadium mini games were the peak of my childhood lol
no turok games i still have turok memorized loved those games so much
i miss pokmon stadium
great collection literally the best of the best here glover missing lol
rogue squadron
also i feel old now lol
after watching the mario movie i love seeing everyone s collections i ve been reinspired to play the games on every console we have nes n64 2ds switch and maybe even expand our console ownership
my older brother kept all the boxes in mint condition too then sold them all a few years back on ebay unforgivable especially as body harvest my favourite n64 game and a few others were actually mine
love the smash bros my favorite of the series
great bundle of games stars wars games that don t include the podracing one is a shock
mario party the duel mode was peak series for me
it s never about quantity always about quality and this certainly is some quality
you missing a classic wwf no mercy hands down my favorite one
nice collection i have about half of the ones you do
and i played all of these thanks blockbuster as an aside we rented diddy kong racing so often we might as well have bought it
well it s not that crazy when you figure that that released years ago
my wife recently got my an n64 since i missed out on it during my childhood unfortunately it didn t come with the memory card needed in order to play majora s mask i still love it though your collection looks fantastic
the n64 was an amazing console indeed but somewhat expensive to me great collection btw
did turok come out on n64
sigh fkkkkkk we getting old man this shit scary ahahaha
i was so close to having smash sadly it was at an antique store that i just didn t get to quick enough
rubbish can not be more than can it
no copy of super mario nice to see you got pokemon stadium though
shadows of the empire is such a gem
tell me zelda is in the console
solid lineup little of everything
you need some wave race in there but an otherwise fantastic collection
you don t have it here but i have so many memories of the yellow donkey kong game my parents used to have a gas fireplace in their basement that was not well ventilated to this day the smell of a gas fireplace brings back so many snes and n64 memories thanks for the post
this sub has been so bad for nostalgia baiting lately like much worse than normal i say this as a 90s kid
should be ashamed you re lacking goldeneye
man i miss the army men games the sarge s heroes ones especially it was so much fun on split screen with friends plus the parents didn t have a problem with the relatively violent nature of it because we were blowing eachother into chunks of colored plastic instead of bloody gibs lol i also miss the original isometric shooter rts hybrid games on pc someone tried making a spiritual successor to the third person shooter entries called the mean greens a while back but it never caught on
hmmm missing nightmare creatures
some games that really stood out to me for the n64 in no order zelda oot and majoras mask rogue squadron ogre battle and star wars pod racer there s probably others but it seems so long ago i can t remember them all
where is goldeneye
oooooh pokmon snap so many hours on that game
so far and so close at the same time s
try cleaning off all of their stickers and mix them up then every time you play it will be a mystery which game you ll get
you ve got right here lol
smash bros was my first ever n64 game sarges heroes was amazing and not listed but so good perfect dark was absolutely wild to me as a kid my favorite games for n64
where is banjo no collection is a collection without banjo and kazooie
almost a thousand dollars in this picture thanks to the pandemic
so you mean to tell me games made years ago are years old whaaaaa
i would ve loved to see turok here
army men was so good
i m willing to start a fire to burn your mario party carts in if you want everyone else is welcome to attend and contribute to the mario party cartridge burning festival we ll make an event out of it it ll be the next woodstock
battery still ok in smash
pokmon snap is my shit
sarge s heroes
i ll give you american dollars for mario party
what no goldeneye
omg so jealous every single one of these are a must have for me one day
from your list i still own star wars rogue squadron i had somehow accumulated copies of this and starfox not on this list i still own conker s bfd
yoshis story that s what it was called thank you for reminding me i love that game
now that s what i call dedication
rogue squadron was the tits
mario party you re a real one
very good games and wait is that shadow of the empire damn you are so lucky
sarge s heroes was underrated good to go
no super mario
back when smash bros was good
was it really an n64 collection without golden eye turok blast corps and star fox
no wrestlemania you re collection while impressive is incomplete
where goldeneye
make sure to change out the batteries in the cartridges that have them
army men was legit
you selling
i hate to tell you this but baseball things made it into your video game collection and for some reason mario is not on them
sorry no goldeneye so need to downvote
pokemon stadium i would game for weeks on end wish they added all the classics to nintendo switch diddy kong racing mario party games omg the best
sarge s heroes miss the army men franchise a lot
where s tony hawk
the army men game was alot of fun
how are your batteries saves holding up my super smash bros cart won t save anymore i went in and replaced the battery twice with two different battery brands and tested both with a multimeter but it still doesn t manage to hold a save it s quite a bummer for me because ness is my main character and he doesn t stay unlocked after i turn off the console
mario party and pokmon stadium are such sweet sweet memorys i was really young and i had the time of my life
where s hey you pikachu
save for the mlb games damn i am beyond envious
that s a bunch of n64 games but i m not seeing any zelda
ah the nostalgia
rare to not see any loz carts lol but i respect it
when a man cleans sometimes he finds a thousand dollars
sarges heroes was amazing i played that for hours
where the fuck is goldeneye
no goldeneye come on now
ahh back when finding a bug was cool games were complete at launch and you couldn t pay to win unless it was single player and you called nintendo power for tips and cheats
i ll never truly forgive my mother for throwing away my nes cartridges had a collection of forty or so games at the time i ve promised my wife a divorce if she ever lays hands on my ps and ps2 collection
as the baked idiot i am first thought you put them on ice
great collection but no conker that s a bummer
you had quite the amazing childhood braddah pokmon snap stadium mario party mini game heaven they don t make em like they used to anymore huh my man
no one knows how good sarges heroes is
rogue squadron was my favorite n64 game
literal treasure
no mario party
your oldest game its oldet than me the memories i had a n64 too and it was the best console i ever have
it s going to reticulate those splines so good
for that price you could have bought nearly three sims expansion packs
if you didn t see this coming that s on you
you coulda have just got her a 12gb rtx then used the leftover for all the sims dlc with the rtx being msrp after you buy all the dlc you should have enough money left over for a gumball jesus fuck ea why is it usd for all the dlc
it can probably almost run sims now with two expansions at once crazy
runs a stable 40fps now lol
why the heck would you install a to play on that monitor you just brought a v8 to sit in traffic all day
sims will be more expensive than the soon with a few more expansion packs
i mean lucky wife
lol i have a bad habit of doing that spent on a 1080ti spent months playing stardew valley spent 2k on a spent a month playing freelancer which was released years before
i waited years to get a new pc mine crapped out shortly after getting married and there were more essential places for the money finally get a great deal on a rig with a oh shit they made an enhanced edition of baldurs gate
i mean the game has dlc you need the graphical power to load them all
if she s happy then hell yes max performance sims
i see no problem here
gigachad wife don t see any problems
sims in fps is a different game good for your wife
play whatever makes you happy
you go op s wife i asked for a gaming laptop for our anniversary and almost exclusively play sims4
i m kinda the same way tbh playing old games on high end parts i just upgraded to a 3060ti back in november arguably the biggest upgrade in my pc gaming life and what games have i played with it so far skyrim and gta lmao
nothing wrong with putting a ferrari engine in a toyota corolla
fantastic tbh that would probably be me to
maybe you ve forgotten but gaming is about playing what you enjoy maybe be like your wife and play more of the games you enjoy instead of obsessing over your setup
op gets her bigger monitor too she is clearly leaning forward and it s bad posture in long run source i lean forward a lot while playing cities skylines and my back does not like it one bit i didn t get bigger monitor but desk mount arm so now it s closer to my face instead
fake ai generated image the swimming pool in game is over her hair and her hairline intersects with the monitor there is no mouse and she is pretending to hold one
let her play what she wants
wrong sub i think you want r notinteresting
i still play runescape on mine
this is making me wanna play the sims now
don t be a shitty husband let her enjoy her game we all know she wasn t begging you for the
obvious photoshop bait is obvious https://imgur.com/a/lsvwict)
why did you edit the image https://imgur.com/mgbcjpw
well looks like i m reinstalling sim fps has to be so buttery smooth that you could never go back to the old way
why does her hair vanish behind the picture did you photoshop the sims image
on today s episode of you re full of shit
professionals have standards
i mean that s on you lol
should ve gotten her a big screen so she wouldn t slouch
sims the first game that i played after getting rtx3060 was chess
on ultra setting tho
happy wife happy life
yeah i think you could have bought her a nicer monitor or higher quality desk instead of a
honestly worth it i have made every single one of my laptop purchase decisions based on whether it will run the sims along with the various expansion packs
hey there s that classic lian li brand pc case that me and all my friends have small world
priorities
on ultra though
if youve got the cash why not
just between us my wife said your wife s build is basic and not using cc i have no idea what that means
i bought a 3080ti last year and the first thing i played was emulated super mario world for snes
worth
sounds about right to me
if you really want to impress people you don t mention the rtx pc you mention the most expensive thing in the picture does your wife own all the sims dlc
that wife looks pretty realistic good advert for the
this is reasonable similar to minecraft the sims is a demon in disguise when it comes to cpu usage
i wish my husband can do this we can t afford it i m still working with gtx and the sims struggle on my pc especially other games like cod but i also like to do sims recolors and my husband encourages that why upgrade the gpu and whine about what she plays she seems happy and i m sure she appreciates it
it seems silly to some but i m sure she ll always love this my wife didn t realize the sims could look so pretty
my wife isn t a gamer bought her a gaming laptop to get her into it you ve never seen stardew valley run so smooth
what a waste
there be simpery happening
we use to call this having more money than sense
can i become your wife i will do double the blowjobs
this is the way
i upgraded my son s computer too and he plays robloxs and tf2 exclusively on a machine
oh yeah here s the weekly flex thread i ve been looking for
that s on you you didn t gauge the expectations vs what needs to be delivered i d worry about the electricity bills with the so much wasted power
i still play modded minecraft on the lowest graphical settings possible even with an rtx capable card i could enable shaders right now and i don t care
here all i play is factorio lol
what a waste it clearly should be used for minecraft
let her play
the idea is that if she wants to play demanding games she can don t need to worry about can i run it just because you get a beefy card doesn t mean you re limited to beefy games
my gaming laptop was exclusively a runescape machine for the first year so i get it
i bet her render distance and shadows and all those fun settings make it look so awesome
dude sims actually requires gb and a graphics higher than a otherwise you re going to be sluggy with cheats let her know you can hit the esc key if she finds things sluggish and this will work as a refresher
good for her there are so many bad games out there she picking one that is good
those shadows though the opulence
yeah but those frames
don t act like you don t know this is going to happen now at least get her a ultrawide monitor to visualize the improvements
gotta see them wicked whims in ray traced glory right don t lie
that s your fault idiot
so
with enough mods even that might not be enough
husband of the year she appreciates you
i have a and play hd poker like of the time i m a fool
will one up you all with a 6800xt and ultima online
it s just future proofing for the sims project rene s
i own alienware laptops and gaming desktop and the game i play the most is openra https://www.openra.net
damn creating a ideal family which she couldn t get with you jk
good for her
at least you have someone to do stuff like this with enjoy it
needs a bigger mouse pad
wish i was your wife
something tells me the wife never even asked for an rtx
i m sobbing and jealous
does she have ww installed
my brother has a similar set up and he plays hollow knight the most lol it s a running gag amongst pc players to build these really good rigs and then just play basic looking games lol as long as everyone is having fun
well she is gaming so yay
my daughter has an awesome gaming system plays sims4 and roblox
and playing on a 19inch screen lmao get the poor woman a decent screen ffs
leave her alone
lol i gave my wife my old and she absolutely loves playing sims now at fps in max settings
switch it out for a and she won t notice
first i m hearing about a movie regarding these two games jason momoa as steve is interesting though dude can punch down trees i would expect steve to be ripped
is jason momoa confirmed to be steve i know he s in the movie but if that s true it s kind of crazy
shaggy as william afton is crazy
won t believe it until i see trailers
source
matthew lilard as william afton is such a fucking w
momoa as steve is something i didn t know i needed until now
when i started reading this i thought i saw fafhrd and said yes finally a fafhrd and grey mouser movie these two must do this
why hello there old sport
i need matthew to do the purple guy dance no i need the purple guy dance
i just wanna see matthew lillard as shaggy again
i know right momoa should ve gotten to play as purple guy
can t wait for these
shut up and take my money
the perfect movie doesn t exis
april fool s still going strong
i thought momoa had a pokball necklace for sec
i don t give a damn about these two franchises in all honesty but wasn t there supposed to be a live action minecraft movie which would ve been released around whatever happened to that
bro my ass already in a seat for the mc movie jason as steve bro yall already know it s gonna suck but i gotta see it
there s a minecraft movie these guys do really fit the look though jason momoa emanating that absolute chad energy and mathew liliard looking just like an intelligent mastermind behind animatronics and murders
matt lillard has a storied history of being cast in shitty movies and then carrying them on his back if he s in it i m seeing it
is there really a fucking minecraft movie coming
nah steve is just blocks
momoa should be a creeper
kind of works oddly too
he was confirmed to be gabriel from minecraft story mode a while ago
i m like gonna kill some kids today scoob
afton would have had to seem very nice and easygoing to get away with everything i think he fits the role so long as he can actually pull off the psycho aspect of the character
now i really see you dont give a damn basically minecraft movies got reseted several times
what did you say about me n wah
i agree only because of that meme where he s sneaking up on henry cavill
raggy those children were inoccent zoinks scoob i like don t care
to be fair he had practice with those teens in scream
like i just started snapping necks like scooby snacks
and the fact that said practice was directed by the horror man himself wes craven
welcome to r patientgamers
i m not quite that far behind but i love being able to buy games a year or after they come out cheap and with all dlcs included way better than paying for a new game that often is full of bugs and not properly optimised
resident evil remakes are great currently my favourites
tbh this is true even within the same gen if there s a single player game coming out just wait six months or so and you ll save tons of money
that makes sense the games are cheaper and they are curated before they get to you
here i am playing baldurs gate made around on my tablet
relevant xkcd https://xkcd.com/606/)
i m and have been gaming for over years i m currently doing another play through of one of my favourite games which came out over years ago skyrim
only downside is trying to avoid spoilers for a long time that said it does make a lot of sense to continue with that games are cheaper and are usually complete compared to the state they launch in these days
im playing horizon zero dawn too as well as nier automata two bangers i just work through my steam library based on what i feel like playing at that time lol
i ve been taking this in the reverse i ve been going through nintendo and ps1 games i don t know what it is but these older games are the best mobile games before bed games whatever you want to call it i have been having fun playing these games compared to most modern age triple aaa games i miss when games where truly games and not what it is now a science structure of dopamine and business practice is built into all our games nowadays but back then it was the wild west where gaming stereotypes are being used for the first time rather than fleshed out for optimum time sinkage and cash grab i may be the only one who feels like that
i mean i can play all the ps4 games on my ps5 and with boosted framerates etc a lot of them i got for free with ps plus so for me a ps5 was a good investment and i can play both generations
i did the same with ps3 loved how they sold greatest hits games for
i totally understand you i have been doing this for a while and i have long list of ps4 games still to go i have been playing much older games recently such as baldur s gate and neverwinter nights i have no interest of buying ps5 for many years or even paying a full price for any game
the only trade off is not being able to engage in discussions as the game come out and not being able to discover anything unless you avoid spoilers for a full generation if you don t care about community or spoilers it sounds like the best option
i m over here still trying to ascend in nethack
i had the same computer from up to so i missed out two or three generations now i m playing prey for example zero complains plus i don t need hardware upgrades soo often since i don t play the newest game as often as most people
does anyone see advance wars taking a steep discount like sparks did or will it hang onto
i m not a whole generation behind or anything but unless it s something i really love like resident evil i ll just put games on my steam wishlist and buy them whenever they have steep discounts i got doom eternal for like off because i waited a bit you also get the bonus of playing games that are already patched and see what the general user opinion is
steam sales will backlog you like a bag of dried apricots i m playing fallout
in after all the bugs and patches smart
i m playing skyrim rn for the first time and it s amazing
patient gaming is great of you wait a lot of really popular games rerelease as goty with all of the dlc bundled with the main game sometimes they ll remaster a good game or remake it for a new console release you basically get a fresh updated and complete version of what everyone else paid for to be real world bug testers i m also a fan of being this style of gamer and spoilers don t phase me because it doesn t matter what people tell me about the story it matters how i experience it so good on you
yup i ve been preaching it to the winds current industry business models and practices make the day one buyers well chumps unfinished games predatory business models vaporware road maps i m at least years behind and i ve yet to play a suck game or pay exorbitant prices every game i ve played has been finished has all caveats exposed and has usually come at a very affordable price
eventually you ll hit a wall cause every new release will be a remaster of an old game
ok but the ps5 can play ps4 games aswell so i don t see the point in being limited to an inferior product with a worse experience
really happy you ve got a way of engaging with games that works for you and saves you money but i just love participating in the community aspect of new games learning and talking about the game its story and its secrets in real time with others just love it
that s pretty smart but these current consoles play every single xbox one and ps4 game on their respective consoles so you can find cheap last gen games and still play them on current hardware
so many gems that are or will be stuck in the past is always a waste to only play current games and not look at the past once in a while
if this is your method pc would be great too a basic low mid range system right now will crush games from the last gen plus all the mods that have had years to accumulate now even the steam deck becomes appealing
the problem is spoilers
can confirm this is the way to go waited years to get a refurbished ps4 and just got a switch last month i also have a very high tolerance for sub par graphics which doesn t hurt in this situation
gotta admit as time goes on the number of new titles that appeal to me goes down
living in the past good times
i ve been doing this with the ps3 started playing it regularly around got my ps4 in october just before ps5 launched it was great snapping up loads of great games for a fraction of what they cost at launch really enjoyed the witcher persona royal i ve got plenty of other games i m still playing the only pet peeve is that switch which i bought in games are still full price even though they are pretty much in between generations at best
i can t bring myself to play a whole generation behind but i almost never buy brand new games anymore and i have no problem going back a generation to play a title i missed but always wanted to play too this happens a lot with rpgs for example i m currently playing through the first xenoblade chronicles for the first time i m generally about a year or so behind when it comes to new stuff and that s just fine with me once a game has been out that long you can easily find it on ebay for cheap i rarely pay more than for any game now and it s usually much less thing is there are so many games released each year these days that it s basically impossible to stay up to speed unless you literally have no life and play hours a week or something once you factor in other hobbies and things you want to do outside of gaming you find you re always operating at least a year behind the curve at least for me and i have no problem with that at all
i do this but with phones each phone is new to me but bought outright at most it s great i d do this with games but i m a pc gamer who loves multiplayer so not as feasible
yeah being poor is rad
it s really the smartest move considering how sleazy gaming publishers have become it allows you to play the game stable state rather than the broken one it is on release you get special editions with all the post release content the biggest hurdle is not be swayed by ads and hype i m sorry to say that while having this philosophy i was still duped by cyberpunk and ac valhalla gotta stay strong
and here i am preordering here and there and ending up disappointed but still doing it
this is a good strategy but it isn t without its hangups for sure ps3 was arguably the last console generation in the traditional sense from here its crossgen all the way down so a ps5 would likely serve you better since it ll play ps4 and probably ps6 titles too
this is the first time since the ps2 i ve been up to date so to speak on the consoles got my ps3 ps4 and xbox near the end of their time and now i ve had a ps5 for some time i find i ve been playing mostly ps4 titles and even some ps1 ps2 games i ve bought off the ps store i think at i just like the older stuff more new games are amazing but i don t get the same enjoyment out of them even with ps4 games it was very hit and miss the only exceptions i ve had have been cyberpunk and star ocean love those games but to each their own i say i m just glad i can play wild arms and and legend of dragoon on my ps5
i just got an xbox a few months ago and it s xbox one games with the newest being doom eternal just because i really wanted it it s just more feasible to do so imo for instance i got games for euro a few days ago
this is the best most economical way to game i bought spiderman on ps4 a year or two after it launched for either or and i was so blown away by the value i got at that price that game is awesome shortly thereafter i bought hzd for the same price again a great game with tons of content at an absolute steal of a price after this i realized that if i could wait mos after a game was released i could save a ton of cash by getting it just a little later he ll i m playing nioh for free right now thanks to playstation plus now only two conditions warrant me paying full price for a new game it s an absolute must play and or a franchise near and dear to my heart for instance i pre ordered metroid dread elden ring and legend of zelda tears of the kingdom i also splurged on pre ordering the zelda themed oled switch it s a game from an indie developer that i want to support such as super mega baseball by metalhead bought out recently by ea fingers crossed they don t ruin that amazing baseball franchise or hyper light drifter and soon hyper light breaker by heartmachine
laughs in pc
i m getting there still on my xbone that i bought in and i play it more now than i did then thought about upgrading a bunch but i just don t care
i ve been playing og everquest the game never gets old
blind guy here sometimes it s better to wait i ve noticed that the older games have more accessible mods
i like to blend both past and present and go back and forth simultaneously the best of both worlds
thanks for making me realize i m also playing last gen games but at full price on the nintendo switch i actually think it s fantastic though the large game selection probably the best non handheld situation for nintendo since the snes nintendo s first party stuff is a huge draw i just have to be judicious with sales and money saving tricks in principle i think getting a ps4 now is a fantastic situation i just have some kind of mental block that prevents me from buying stuff that s being obsoleted another admittedly huge factor is that i can buy almost any of these last gen titles on pc
same boat old games are new to me they re cheap all the bugs have been cleaned up the hype and expectations aren t impacting my enjoyment of it i m a pretty casual gamer anyway but knowing i m spending like on a game that s patched actually completed when people were paying for a bug ridden version of the same thing is hilarious also fallout haters you are wrong i ll fucking fight you about it
i bought the top tier of playstationplus and i haven t purchased a game since i just use their free collection and i love it
yes also avoid paying more than for any game and for the love of god do not preorder anything
i find i tend to really enjoy older games over newer ones and because of that i really notice just how sharply quality has decayed over the last years compared to games made before that it helps that when playing older gamses other people have already treaded the path before us any scummy publisher developer decisions made after you purchased the game have already been made expansion content and refinements have already been applied and sequels might already be out or right around the corner patient gaming sounds like dumpster diving to some but i d rather compare it to wine sampling truly great games age really well and sometimes games that were mediocre at the time of their release become much more palatable over time either because their unique quirkiness appeals to the person you ve grown into because they were overshadowed by other releases of their generation or because so many modern releases are such crap shows that a genre becomes starved for quality
me when i waited for persona royal to come out on the pc was well worth the long wait
yup this is the way
i love being behind on current games gives me a vast catalog of games i can stream i love it most streamers have to jump onto the newest game to maintain relevant
same here i bought series x couple months ago and been playing old gems a lot than new games backwards compatibility 4k upscale and fps boost helps me a lot
yeah at this point i ll play whatever looks fun that i never got to yet new games so frequently come out buggy and unfinished anyway these days recently i was playing heroes of might and magic from and had a great time lol
i ve been doing pretty much the same for the last few years on the ps4 focused on playing single player games i missed out on but i recently caught up so i m playing god of war ragnarok now
this is exactly what i do two years ago i was playing skyrim and forza all year this past year i have been playing mostly ac odyssey they all seem amazing to me i only had an n64 growing up and then i bought an xbox after college
i can relate to this we live in a day and time where gaming is well established and a lot of good games exist in each gaming generation i treat games like other media like books or movies if people speak highly of them and the when awards i want to experience personally what makes them a good game
honestly i don t understand why more people don t do this but it helps being a casual
just being constantly behind the curve can t really be all that fun but whatever you tell yourself

what are amazing games that have come out in the last years i need something to play i think mh world was the last great game i ve played that wasn t a remake
if you game a whole generation behind what do i say about myself at least generations behind on my t420
i m more or less the same or at least wait until i can get all the dlc and everything for a game included at a good price being a day one gamer looks like a drag you get all the bugs less content and you pay the most money trailing a bit behind is the way to go
this is literally the bulk of my gaming these days i m currently switching between dragon age inquisition and persona original version
basically what i do i don t really have an interest in being the best at anything i want to enjoy what i can when i want to i still have my ps3 haven t gotten a ps4 or i built a gaming computer during the pandemic though not to play the latest game cause i didn t want to spend 2k on parts i spent under by using a af and an rx580 and decent enough stuff to be able to upgrade but even any upgrade is still going to be a gen or two behind the bleeding edge and i don t care hell i m pining for a ps2 game and trying to figure out if i want to buy yet another ps2 the big one died like years ago the slim i have barely worked last i played it years ago maybe an early ps3 with the backwards compatibility but i think those have gotten kind of pricey
i play old school runescape i m years behind
it s definitely great to have the cheaper games out of curiosity more for the community not op is on a ps4 a good price it s been a while since i looked at prices i guess but last i knew xss was is there a huge difference in price between the sony microsoft platforms this generation if so what could be the cause of such a difference supply chain
it s a good way to game no rush just go at your own pace and get good discounts i just started playing d2r a year ago and have about years of catching up to do xd
ps4 has some great exclusives honestly some of the best games i ve ever played horizon zero dawn was a good choice i also recommend the uncharted series both the uncharted collection uncharted and uncharted the lost legacy marvels spiderman god of war the last of us remastered ghost of tsushima and some non exclusives like red dead redemption star wars jedi fallen order and monster hunter world iceborne majority of those are single player games
i m on ps5 and every game i buy is never more than even newly released titles that s mostly thanks to target s of or more coupons when you open a new red card which i just cancel and open again whenever a new game is released so i keep getting the coupon
same but with emulators yar botw runs pretty well on pc actually
it s also nice that all the patches to fix all the bugs are in so you re getting a better product for much cheaper
only really works for single player games that are risky buys especially this generation it s good to wait out anything that might be horrible because of that price tag but when it comes to multiplayer games i feel they are the absolute most fun in their infancy before the meta muppets settle in and the game becomes a god vs noob vs mediocre game and then when it s a long time and there s still a dedicated player base jesus fuck it s hard it s usually ultra mega god vs you vs helen keller vs shaggy from scooby doo dab hits deep into losing their reaction time or worse there s no players left and you wait minutes and sometimes still have zero games found
i do this for pc games mainly because epic has given away so many free games over the past few years i have no need to buy anything recent even though ive been tempted a few times the biggest draw back ive found is when an older game lets say from just dont feel as modern in terms of gameplay yet reviews from the past openly praise it that feeling of well it was good when it was released should still hold up if it is indeed a factually good game most of the time though its games ive understood to have a bad rap that i enjoy most
or you can buy a pc once and play any game for free and it can last over a decade
horizon forbidden west is on and it s sooo gooood just fyi
i am in a very similar spot played nothing but online pvp games for the good part of a decade and when i got burnt out on pvp i started going back to all the single player games i had missed out on funnily enough i also just finished gow and before that metal gear rising revengance which i also loved now i am doing re3 and who knows what next best thing is that even older games like metal gear rising don t feel that outdated even after a few years of being out unlike in the ps1 ps2 and ps3 era where the jump in quality between generations was so big it made everything feel outdated once a new generation was out
that s gotta be a no from me bro
i agree i just want to play my star ocean second story and smt nocturne that s complete for me
my ps3 finally decided to give up last year broke my heart i got a ps5 and i m having more fun playing ps3 games now than i did as a late teen early something just started ratchet and clank up and it s like i m playing it again for the first time the streaming server isn t great at peak hours but i finish work relatively early most days so i can play until or 5pm uninterrupted
i ve been playing pretty much exclusively on the switch and retro games on my wii for the past few years and i plan on moving onto the ps4 after totk my graphics standards are very low so most ps4 games are very impressive to me so playing these games as if they re new for a very low price will be such a fun experience
oh my god i ve been re playing dragons dogma on hard mode and it has been such a blast it s such an incredibly fun game that honestly never ends i have my character and pawn at level and the enemies just keep getting harder and harder with the addition of new enemy types and it honestly blows my mind how much progress is still left
same here op just picked up a ps4 and games tor the grand total of getting stuck into god of war is blowing my mind after years of ps3 and xbox360 gaming
great now i just need to find some time to play them
i ve often joked about that when a new game launches hey starfield finally has a launch date this year i m really looking forward to playing that in
i m right there with you funny how time has a way of sussing out the garbage
been playing fallout after buying all the dlc for bucks i m enjoying the shit out of it can t believe i ve been anti fallout for so long
i m not a big gamer at all i ve owned nothing but a gaming laptop for wow which i play on and off here and there and pretty much a ps2 i like to revisit the games from my childhood and get the nostalgia and then i do it all again in a few years i m a dork
i only play the previous seasons madden because they release it on game pass after the season ends not paying for the new rookies latest ratings and marginal changes
yup i ve been doing this since about when i got my first nes bought my ps1 when ps2 launched bought my ps3 when ps4 launched maybe i ll own a ps5 in like years idk
i m still playing skyrim as my main aaa title
same here i save a ton of money because of it and get a huge amount of content because they make it free on sale
i think you ll sunset your life on the ps4 i m almost up to discs in the collection and i only buy stuff i think i ll play no sports titles no call of duty i don t think i ll get another gaming system until vr becomes good enough that i can t resist
i m still looking forward to picking up a ps3 someday haven t even touched that catalog yet
due to how little time i have for gaming compared to my highschool days i always play games that are older and patched and the best part is that my pc can handle all of them without issues even if it s an older machine
ff ii and iii lufia and chrono trigger breath of fire and super mario rpg earthbound all classics
original snes version of ffvi is still in my top of all time
i played chrono trigger for the first time this year what an amazing game the music to the corridors of time is so beautiful cant wait to dive into another one of these
lufia is probably my favorite 2d rpg as far as game play goes
where my seiken densetsu bros at
secret of mana
i find the lack of secret of mana on your image post most disturbing
terranigma was really great too
showing lufia here instead of lufia is a crime
super mario rpg always slept on what makes it particularly great is how concise and charming it is and it doesn t feel like it has aged at all
i would love a chrono trigger remake
i would love to see another non mobile game entry for breath of fire
chrono trigger is the best game of all time
why won t switch online put the greats on
don t forget illusion of gaia and secret of mana
chrono trigger and ff are still two of the best games ever made
ffiv is still one of my favorites
and you even left out earthbound super mario rpg secret of mana and ffvi
it sure did i was there when history was made also all those japan only rpg games that didn t make it to the us i wonder how many gems we missed out on i know of some but damn
breath of fire is fantastic
no love for robotrek was one of my first introductions to jrpgs it has a fun mechanic where you use up to three robots to battle with and you can customize them with different weapons and abilities snes really was the golden age for rpgs
there was this sweet spot in between the and bit era where so many good jrpg s had gotten published and put on systems of all kind of ports and generations of consoles so many of them are amazing fun antique finds of today ones like lunar were obscure legends amongst us jrpg gamers and many never got translations until much later this created a whole generation of retro gamers that always sought the new obscure find the talent behind these games is legendary today and these were bricks in the foundations for many of the modern rpgs we know
need to see some love for terranigma here
breath of fire will always have a special place in my heart i only had a handful of games as a kid and i would look at the map and the booklet that came with the game all the time gaming was different in the 90s and the early 2000s and i doubt we will ever experience that magic again due to the internet
much better games than the ones we have now
yea as an rpg fan i chose wrong that generation don t get me wrong sega had some gems phantasy star shadowrun shining force but still
some of no the best
no need for that j qualifier
where the fuck is earthbound
what s the appeal to these games is it the story never got into them because the combat wasn t fun for me probably just not for me but i feel like i m missing out
switch chrono trigger for final fantasy mystic quest and i agree
final fantasy and and was great never played breath of fire nor lufia chrono trigger i don t like that much and i think people have nostalgia goggles for it
indeed
you re thinking of beyonc
lufia and chrono trigger had completely different covers for me
i want a modern bof game so bad or even just a spiritual successor like we re seeing with suikoden
playing chrono trigger for the first time now it s really good
chrono trigger is timeless no pun intended
i know chrono trigger gets a lot of hype but for good reasons great gameplay storyline with multiple endings characters and the music was top notch the only game i could think of that was just as good is phantasy star on sega genesis both part of my childhood
snes is probably one of the best systems so many hours of enthralling story and fantasy
would love to have all the breath of fires remake and the super mario rpg
super mario rpg is so much better than people give it credit for
that s my childhood right there i just bought ff6 pixel remaster and chrono trigger on steam due to nostalgia
for me ps1 will always be the king of the jrpg
how dare you leave off secret of mana
why haven t i seen the game that started the tales of series the best jrpg i ve played in my life tales of phantasia
live a live was pretty interesting concept
couldn t agree more it s my all time favorite system tons of nostalgia as well with memories of playing just about everything with my year older brother who od d in also because legend of zelda a link to the past
i dunno yeah the snes had all this and more but the n64 had hybrid heaven
chrono trigger and the final fantasy games for sure but having recently tried to play through breath of fire it s one of the most tedious games i ve tried to play you don t even get rewarded for the copious amounts of random encounters with a good story like final fantasy
fucking lufia
sir you forgot terranigma
check out chained echoes came out last year it s in the same style and if you liked those you will like it
yeah snes and ps1 are the peak for jrpgs imo
i ve played zero of these but i love the genre
omfg i though i was the only one who remembered playing lufia
breath of fire is one of my all time favorite games love to see the series get a nod here
sad that dragon quest isn t discussed at all it s an amazing series and ff vs dq in japan was like coke vs pepsi staff from dq including the manga artist akira toriyama and ff came together to create chrono trigger
pound for pound was the best system ever imo
holy shit lufia was my favourite game of all time i ve never seen anyone else post it online before i thought i was crazy loving this game damn might need to get a snes emulator to replay it now
i would love to have a new lufia and a lufa remake
if there s one thing i can t stand its a jrpg
and where is mario rpg
of all time idk about that
some more like all
i m glad you included mario rpg yeah the story isn t as deep as the others but it s definitely deserving it s got top tier music by yoko shimomura fun battle mechanics and the invention of timed hits fun maps to explore it s just an all around great game imo
it is one of the greatest tragedies known to mankind that mario rpg didn t get a true sequel
final fantasy mystic quest there was also some great action rpgs secret of evermore secret of mana seiken densetsu iii aka trials of mana on the switch ps4 tales of phantasia star ocean soul blazer terranigma illusion of gaia
god ff3 best jrpg ever imo lufia ii also amazing secret of mana also top tactics ogre
banger of a list
i would love it if they could get the rights to super mario rpg sorted so they could rerelease it still one of my favorite games i ve all time i d also love to see geno and mallow again too earthbound is also amazing though luckily we have that on switch now and even mother after like years
no love for inindo loved that game
top ff of all time
the snes rom hack of the t edition makes it even better imo everyone should play the original game of course but the t edition is really worth playing especially if it s been a while since you ve played the game it s much harder but more balanced and honestly just feels better if you haven t play it i d actually recommend going in blind and not looking up all the changes
probably my favourite all time game
for me any time someone is making a top list of super nes era rpgs chrono trigger and final fantasy are going to be and you can put them in whatever order you d like but they re going to be the top
maybe an unpopular opinion but i kinda liked the optional dungeons the gba port had the second chance to learn mog s water dance was also useful kinda bummed this isn t in the pixel remaster since i had never completed the second dungeon
if you haven t played chrono cross holy mother of ost s you are in for a freaking treat my friend yasunori mitsuda is just a complete masterclass and his work on the chrono series is nothing short of legendary
man that floor bonus dungeon could be a game in itself
played lufia when i was like or this was back before the n64 and playstation i remember thinking how hard the game hit me in the feels at the end ffvi and chrono trigger had some sad moments too that got me but i think the ending of lufia just hit different probably one of the coolest moments though in the snes days of rpg gaming was frog splitting the mountain in half in chrono trigger the music and everything leading up to that scene was crazy
same here definitely the goat by a long shot for me
player emulator mod gang rise up
so good
thank you to the fan translators that worked on that mod it became one of my favorite games of all time
yeah how is this not the top of the list i play this game once every two years
showing ff4 instead of ff6 for me even as a kid i hated being attacked every steps and the story was pretty nonsensical in ff4 ff6 was easier but it had better characters an opera and there wasn t a person being hypnotized every seconds
you can t really give it the ff7 remake treatment though ff7 remake works because the original had a great story a great setting and was held back by the technical limitations of graphics back in its day chrono trigger has the same except i don t feel like the graphics held it back but rather the art style just worked in a way that a ff7r style remake wouldn t work
i m playing bof3 again right now
we all would man we all would
taito is now owned by square so of that picture is square enix in and we all know how they ve been acting in the last few years also neverland the actual devs of lufia went bankrupt recently but rune factory is still releasing so who knows what the rights are and square would rather sell you another copy but they don t market their less popular stuff properly
bahamut lagoon i think was the best of those that i played
not all rpgs are jrpgs so earthbound would be on a different list of great games edit aw shit i was mixing up earthbound with secret of evermore my bad
the story is the driving force for sure exploration and strategy also come into play the combat isn t for everyone i ll admit
combat was a different character than today s games when turn based combat was done right it was when you had to strategize to save resources for big fights this is because your last save point was either outside the dungeon or at a single mid way point you couldn t just dodge and avoid hits and had occasional party wipe mechanics if the fight took too long but the games themselves were different because the world was different you couldn t just look up everything online at best you had one kid in your class to talk to about games who would occasionally lie so there was this sense of actually exploring these games at a point in your life that the tropes were not familiar the closest you can get these days is happening across some obscure indie project that comes recommended by a friend but has little to no mention otherwise
they re charming
i play chrono trigger annually the graphics still hold up the music is some of the best video game music out there and it s just a tightly told story not a deep story or anything but with the time travel hijinks and snappy pace you re never in a place for too long and the settings are constantly changing i think a modern re telling would help it more character exploration and stuff to flesh it out but as a video game it s still my just a 30hr fun adventure to save the world
the lufia in the picture is lufia lufia was subtitled rise of the sinistrals the first is the fortress of doom
this isn t lufia this is lufia the first who s in the post s picture was named the fortress of doom while the second was named rise of the sinistrals chrono trigger like many games at that time most probably had different covers because games needed to be released independently in japan the eu and the us i don t know from which version the one in the picture is from but your was most probably from another region
mario rpg is highly revered in jrpg circles
emulator
it s single player right i m not too bothered by large single player games i am likely to uninstall after beating
well they said there s supposed to be multiple worlds worlds a lot bigger than what was in fallen order so i guess large file size makes sense i just hope it doesn t stutter like crazy like fallen order does
just please tell me the game has a better map than the first one that was my only real gripe 155gb is a lot though
rip 300gb data cap
i wonder what the vram requirements will be too games releasing this year have been wild you need s to max everything
insert disk general failure reading drive a abort retry ignore fail
hope i can play it xcloud
only 155gb every ark survival evolved player
good good
ark that s cute
rdr2 on pc was 100gb or more with all the high res textures and such and sound music and more high quality voices games will keep getting bigger fallout for example was i think 30gb or so 45gb with the dlcs then the 4k texture pack took that to 85gb i think crazy to imagine going from floppy disks to 100gb or more for games crazy
oh you want to have other things on your drive fuck you we can t be bothered to compress media properly too busy designing polygon lightsaber pieces that serve no gameplay purpose nor visible during of the gameplay
they could maybe start pre installing these onto ssd drives just to save the downloads
why are people surprised about games being over 100gb it s the same like when games started being over 1gb when they were usually less than 500mb on pc it isn t a problem since storage is always expandable but consoles should really start to make a leap to 5tb default games will only get bigger and bigger
will be taking up 0gb on my pc
when is pc gonna get direct storage as standard so we don t have to have bloated games
also requires you to read once again how killing everything you see for their drops isn t very light side
the first game was and still is buggy as shit thank you to those who pre ordered and are buying this day one i appreciate your sacrifice to make the game better for me when i eventually play it in like years
this is gonna offend some people but star wars legitimately is trash dare i say most overrated franchise in existence those first movies were good but they were never great and literally the rest of the movies are just ok to literal dogshit
do they even attempt compression anymore
that s fine i have space
i ve been wondering what the first 1tb game will be
ark is like 450gb
jfc that s huge remember when max payne was almost a gig i was like bro how much bigger could they make games
laughs in baldurs gate full release
as a indie developer i don t feel bad my games take up gigs
how much without the 4k textures
probably 80gb once you delete the unneeded foreign language data
ark survival evolved pathetic
stares at ark yeah sure we ll call that a lot
ya i only typically have one large game downloaded at once then a mix of causal games that take effectively zero space the only thing the 155gb space requirement affects is the initial download and i guess maybe loading if that s done poorly and i can just start that like an hour or whatever before i want to play for the first time
i guess but elden ring was only 50gb and that game was quite huge
i played fallen order on pc with no stutter through the entire game might be your pc
lol there were like worlds in fallen order and a very strict path you had to follow through each
that s why i ll play it on ps5 fallen order runs perfect on it without any stutters
but is it open worlds or another hallway
have the mentioned anything about the maps i hope to god it s a better setup than fallen order
provided those worlds are actually inhabited i ll he happy i enjoyed the previous game but the worlds were just so bloody empty most of the time
yeah i know what they were trying to do with the map but it s confusing as hell to use dathomir was a nightmare to navigate through
8gb vram for both minimum and recommended
brand new games max settings are never going to run smoothly on anything but absolutely top tier systems by design
why sounds like shit optimization none of these games look all that much better than games from years ago that a could run on max settings
the released in for and 8gb of vram the games are not at fault nvidia s greedy fucking vram hoarding is
ate up a whole gb ssd
hell even gta weighs over 100gb and that game is more than years old now
reminder that cyberpunk at launch was barely more than 70gb say what you will about the last gen console versions but squeezing that amount of detail and quality down to 70gb is incredibly impressive
if it has 4k textures than i m fine with it but will it most new games still don t
because these gb games are probably optimized like shit and that s why they re so big modern game devs don t know how to optimize games nowadays pcs and consoles have become powerful enough that game devs no longer need to optimize all that much as they used to back in earlier generations
directstorage is supposed to speed up storage access not reduce sizes hell it ll probably encourage less aggressive compression in the interest of gpu friendliness
you re entitled to your opinion doesn t change the fact that many enjoy it you don t have to like everything that everyone else likes
this is gonna offend some people but who fucking cares what you think
star citizen in year still in alpha tho
brother i need to know how fast your internet is if you doing it in a hour
all fromsoft games are smaller than you d expect sekiro was only around 16gb for example
it s all about level of detail rdr2 is a similar size when you re looking at things like interactive high quality terrain stuff like the mud in rdr2 it starts to add up this game will also probably be significantly larger than elden ring in terms of locations and unique assets even if not in pure traversable map but by all accounts it does sound large
fromsoft are masters of taking low res textures and making them look beautiful they also reuse assets like crazy but again are masters at doing it so it s not really bothersome
i m not super aware but elden ring does not have state of the art textures i expect survivor to have insanely detailed textures one thing that was really great about fallen order was how deep the walls were you d have lots of vines adding depth to the wall the walls in fallen order were like the armor in elden ring
elden ring wasn t especially large as open world maps go it also doesn t all that advanced graphics and hd textures
elden ring was not really huge by modern open world game standards the map is less than half the size of witcher and like one tenth the size of death stranding
thats a lie fallen order still uses ps4 code on ps5 traversal stutter hitch will be present no matter what its part of the game code being not optimized while loading assets for next area similar issue in almost every single unreal engine games with huge world that engine wasnt even designed for open huge world even callisto protocol have the exact same issue and that game is as linear as it can get
honestly not bad
hopefully my gtx 1660s can get a medium to high setting
phew have definitely considering gigs minimum next time i upgrade
that s because we ve really reached the point of diminishing returns graphics wise
re4 looks incredible at max on pc until it crashes it definitely eats vram but is the only game i ve ever had a problem with because of requirements
re4 uses 16gb of vram maxed out it makes my 3080ti founders edition crash textures can take up to 8gb alone requirements for games are getting wild
i just installed a 500gb ssd in both mine and my wife s pc just to dedicate them for ark
lol yeah i keep forgetting how big that game was i have not played it in a while i might have to install it again and give it a go i am sure my nvme drive and my few year old system would run it pretty well might be time for some mods if that is a thing for it thanks for that reminder
what a rhetorical statement without any proofs even if you included one or two title in it it could be an outlier because there are games out there that are 100gb and performed well i dont know how you come up with this conclusion big game bad small game good if anything its the other way around uncompressed assets put less strain on the cpu the only bottleneck would be storage speed but that would be on you for still sticking with hard drive when ssd has become so cheap
the idea is due to the high speed don t have to copy assets can load it all up on the fly thus bringing the size of the game down
from a quick test 757mbps download 105mbps upload which unless i fubared the math is only about half an hour to download the game then
would only take a half hour for me too assuming the file to download is the full that s on my 1gig fiber
agreed
fiber
shadows don t take up a lot of space
i m somewhat ashamed to admit that i thought you d gotten a certain droid s name wrong the first time i read your comment
elden ring has cool designs and animations but it has like year old graphics almost everything is flat without sharp textures realistic materials or shadows so it s not super demanding and shouldn t take up lots of space without large texture and other types of maps
they don t tell you what resolution that gets you though i doubt it s 4k since the recommended card is rx 6700xt
its not that incredible it looks similar to re village the only upgrade it has over re village is the hair strand rt effect is still low quality at quarter resolution and i think there is one missing rt effect that is available on re village not sure what it was though
that is just shitty optimization
don t defend nvidia on this one series was a joke on vram capacity
ah i see what you mean duplicating assets was never particularly common to begin with and it s already been left behind at the generational cutoff
i m sure it comes compressed but still
is that the name of the sequel
i did that so much when the game was coming out haha
better watch out saying that on this sub it s heresy to say anything bad about elden ring here
probably right but i don t think switching to 1440p is much of a sacrifice
it runs quite well for how good it looks the game just eats a lot of vram on the higher texture settings
i have a 3080ti with 12gb of vram
yeah i mean they do their jobs well enough but definitely better if used for 1440p gaming
recommended is almost certainly 1080p fps imo
there s no way they re recommending 1440p
its not even that good looking have you seen the lake area i dont know why they still havent improve water physics simulation it looks very gooey the only upgrade they did over re remake is higher resolution alpha texture and i no longer noticed the terrible low fps animation on anything that is meters away from you
right and the 1080ti had 11gb how many years before it 2080ti had zero increase in a whole generation
so in your opinion all cards should be rocking gb of ram now or somthing or maybe aaa games could optimize so you don t have to brute force computing through vram
in my opinion 8gb 10gb 12gb and 3080ti 16gb would have been the play why have a stronger core if the vram can t handle it i had a 10gb and ran into that 10gb limit very fast at 4k
you can t make higher resolution assets take up less memory textures and models that look good at higher than 1080p resolution require a shitload of memory
they double the price of the cards and offer no vram increases so that you have to buy in again in years because of planned obsolesce this way they can say they are the fastest cards but not have to worry about you keeping your card longer
region lokced in germany appearantly
great game still one of the only games that i feel got first person parkour right
thanks i look forward to acquiring and not playing it
that cover looks like a cover for a s point and click game
i really like to shit on epic games i don t know why i just like to do it but i appreciate when they give good games and this one is my favourite zombie game ever i recommend it even over the sequel
played through this already but i think it was on the ps4 time for a replay
thanks for the reminder
i can t check out with it it just says that an error occurred and to try later
download it on egs install it add it as a non steam title and play it on steam you don t even need to have egs open in the background to play it as long as you have your steam account linked with egs you re set
still not enough to get me to touch the egs again
is it really free if you re forced to shackle yourself to egs
too bad that i refuse to put the epic games app on my pc
holy cow ppl are still attempting to use the epic games store
deleted
genuinely struggled to play this game i just felt like a delivery man that likes parkour played it for hours and just couldn t anymore
i d like a dying light with a memorable protagonist and good story one day but i know that s not what the company focuses on
i d rather just buy it on steam
don t support egs they re very anti consumer
this is clickbait the game ain t free
yep can t even find the game in germany edit is it really banned in germany
theoretically it is except i can t freaking claim it i keep getting an error
passed both parts and the first was more impressive and more scarier for me
bought it earlier this year don t regret it tho
i can t claim it in u s error code
epic games is a savior of us from third world countries with insane dollar rate got to experience tons of games cuz of it though not a big fan of zombie games will claim it anyway
this is the only game that gives me motion sickness the head bobbling while parcour or looting are to much dl2 was playable for me
i might actually cop
downloaded it today but realized i cannot use my ps5 controller with it once i put it into steam it just for whatever reason isn t smooth and there s a bar at the top of the screen i can t get rid of very strange maybe i ll need to learn the ol m kb
anyone with an idea for me in germany how to access the game
god this game was so fun never played the second one worth playing
lol the funny thing is i literally just bought this on steam when i saw it was on sale
never played but this post inspired me to add it to my free game i ll get around to someday list
game s on the index list a which isn t an outright ban but makes it impossible to legally advertise for or with it which is why it can t be sold or even given away by online stores just get it from somewhere else it s a good open world zombie game with fun mirror s edge like traversal actually scary zombies and neat little details even if story and characters are among the worst in recent years
can t take it on my phone using a vpn i ll try it on my pc when i get home shame germany had some problems with the game p s opened the browser in incognito mode and when i logged in it said i first needed to purchase something and then contact customer support to change my country so it s a no go for germany
i d advocate for titanfall on that front i m guessing mirror s edge didn t quite do it
been saving games since summer have so many games and only play
yeah same here i hate having games on separate platforms and steam is a clear winner over epic not to mention i like having all of my achievements on steam and half of games on epic not even having achievements being split between platforms just isn t for me
why shit on them tho you enjoying steam having the monopoly rn
pretty sure epic games servers are having issues with all the people trying to check out
on the 4th attempt i checked out
it just starts up egs when you run it from steam you don t have to link accounts i would recommend a game launcher like playnite instead if you want to be able to launch your steam and epic games from one launcher
what s a egs
egs isn t that bad origin on the other hand
you sure showed em they ll be bankrupt any day now for certain
as a league of legends player i already sold my soul to the glory of china s
you can claim games using an internet browser
keep fighting the good fight free aaa games are a threat to democracy
i wouldn t do it i installed epic on my computer and now i m a secret agent of communist china and they have me working for them if i ever want to see my family again i gotta say it was worth it to play subnautica though
this has nothing to do with china i just don t like the direction romero took epic
same i couldn t care less about free games most of which i won t play anyway maybe if it had a capable offline mode i d reconsider but it s just too much bs
oh cool might as well throw away your pc the parts are made in china
free games is free games
just like people are still using steam you know the actual bad guy if you listen to anti epic logic
attempting succeeding over here
what did they mess up about the sequel i haven t played either but saw the sequel got a reasonably warm response from critics but didn t really become wildly popular thinking about picking it up when it hits
but you are not paying them with anything if you just get the free game
yes and as compensation we get a cheap ass shit game
not good story the horror element doesn t even come close to the first one parkour is ok ok i recommend if you want to give it a try in sale and only purchase it on steam
a friend and j were planning out picking up the second game per key that is but the website we tried it was bugging so now we just gave up
can t you just use vpn and buy from different country since it s free
that doesnt work
i loved mirrors edge
titanfall isn t parkour
first yes masterpiece 2nd one we dont mention
i also have been saving games since summer currently playing pirated gta san andreas
i don t think i have ever played a free epic game for more than an hour
no because my friends are there but now dying light have cross play so it works
yeah i got it
epic games store
why s we did really lost our soul playing lol
so is everyone a secret spy or just you coz i forgot which job i was supposed to take after installing epic games to claim a free game
neither are good but epic is worse in a few ways
combat has heavily downgraded physics characters are better but the plot and diverse choices aren t well done people dislike the unrealistic feelings of the parkour although i disagree with that it s so so so much more fun
though to be fair you are giving them your data but i m down i don t care free games
fun fact dying light was released with cuts in germany https://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?id=567225 drastically reduced blood no more gore no more dismemberment no more killing npcs in other words they made a dull game about zombies even duller by taking the few fun parts out because a tiny group of so called protectors of the youth in germany actual term they are using to describe themselves with complete seriousness still think that seeing some red pixels will mentally harm kids with a game that was never meant for kids anyway and couldn t be legally sold to kids because if a store does they get sued by the government i don t know about you but when i was young and easily impressionable games that i wasn t legally allowed to play hell that even grown ups couldn t realistically purchase due to some zealots who in the past even tried to ban certain comic books for being too sexy tarzan comics i m not kidding they disliked a fur bikini were especially interesting to me for precisely that reason i played tons of them swapped them with other kids in class and i never even ended up murdering anyone sorry needed to get that off my chest oh and brave developer publisher techland who i liked much more when they were still in the business of making slightly crappy but also quite fun for what they were bargain bin racing games wouldn t even admit to it unlike with virtually every other game with cuts on steam there s no info on the store page that the german version has reduced violence which is just scummy almost as bad as those completely fake screenshots on the store page edit i just read that the steam version is indeed uncut it s only the console edit and retail pc versions that were edited since techland erroneously believed that the game would get banned in germany which however didn t end up happening because apparently zombie games after decades of censorship are cool now weird twist to the story and i m too lazy to edit my above rant so sorry for being misinformed
don t want to risk my epic account with games almost all of which i admittedly didn t pay a single cent for for one title i already acquired using other means years ago i had no idea it was this many games until i looked it up to be honest it s nowhere near as many as i have on steam but still what a number also just looking through it i have tons of games in there i totally forgot about
wtf is parkour if titanfall isnt a legit parkour fps
why pirated
i got enter the gungeon and hitman played those for a while but played gtav the most
played death stranding so that was nice
control and hell is others i put many hours into
yes people like to say that but they dont really give any valid reasons to why because they give studios better support take less profit
there s a difference between advanced movement and parkour it s close but i wouldn t call it parkour
its better that way
man i just don t get that game put about hours into it and just couldn t get into it unfortunately
it makes you feel alive lmao
ryse falls into the same category as the order they are glorified tech demos meaning they look gorgeous and have interesting concepts but are way too short and repetitive
it s crazy to think that the most recent generation of gamers for the past to years have come up only knowing really good graphics and not really seeing all that much in terms of huge jumps and quality not that there weren t jumps in quality but not nearly the same as going from 2d to 3d polygons to well rendered looking models and so forth imagining the future of gaming used to be part of the fun of gaming looking forward to days like this it s crazy to take a step back and realize that we re here
one of my favorite little chill games the combat pretty much boils down to x x y x x y x x y but i still enjoyed my couple of yearly playthrough
i played it for xbone its pretty fun actually play throughs once on normal once on the hardest setting it is definitely not the worst combo based game i ve ever played the arena online mode is good for a few hours not worth the money but still a pretty decent game
i remember that being a showcase game when the console first came out
quicktime eventus
ah yes qte the game
ah the movie game
i really enjoyed this game but i got it for like on steam so the short playtime wasn t an issue
i love ryse the combat is so fluid and satisfying even the multiplayer co op is fun although upgrading the character is a bit tedious i really wish they came out with a sequel or a spin off using different historical period
i loved the first battle i played on here it was epic af then the second was the same then the third after that then the fourth after that
upvote because game name in the title normalize this r gaming
yeah but that s all that game was good for game was a boring ass tech demo that was released to show what the xbox one was capable of graphically
say what you want about it but that beach sequence is still one of the most epic things i ve seen in a game
i always wished there was a nude mod
that s what tech demos are for
my inner history nerd hates this game
pretty satisfying game but not enough for a second play through imo
ah yes the game where you kill the same npc model for times
ryse truly shows graphics aren t everything
i was so sad on how this game came out initially this was going to be a kinect game where you could fight and play as a gladiator and your body would be a controller still waiting for a game like that
fuck it i m posting this next time or should i go with days gone
beating up the same guy every seconds did get old fast
i hope you guys saw the digital comic and the gold you could collect there as i got to work on that cool transmedia piece there was also the smartglass menu that was the same on the phone as it was on the console a feat i am yet to see once again done by a game that whole menu was driven via html5
i should have loved this game at the time it came out i was a big fan of god of war dmc batman arkham etc and spartacus and hbo s rome were among my top favorite shows i didn t mind the qte that was becoming overused in games at that time but with all that this game still couldn t grab me there was no variety to combat and the progression system was very boring i have to imagine ryse sold really poorly because it was very disappointing
it s a fun gorefest for the short runtime it has not much else to recommend about it but the visuals are great
ryse is a fucking beautiful game and i will stan the graphics team who worked on it doesn t get brought up enough because the story is bland and the mc is the only memorable character
it looks incredible because that s all it has all the development time went into it s visuals cuz it s a really meh game
yes games from or looked incredible because they were released in the second decade of the 21st century when games looked incredible
well don t let looks fool you lol
son of qte s
get your eyes checked
great looking game but it s trash
is it just me or does it not look that great
i remember this game was a big showcase of the then new generation of consoles
because graphics were already developed by
was a bad game though
i d like to see a reimagining of this game the first one looked great but got very repetitive could do it as a trilogy 1st one raise of rome 2nd about the romans taking most of europe and 3rd the fall of rome
it s becasue of crytek s cryengine they re super talented in making insane realistic graphics in every game they make
we need more games set in ancient rome going around slaying barbarians is good stuff
this game brings me back to a time when xbox was the joke of the games industry never forget this is how you share games on playstation
if you think this still looks good try on ac unity for size
that s out the only thing that this game has going for it though
it s amazing to see how well crafted games can withstand the test of time and ryse son of rome is no exception the visuals gameplay and storyline are all stunning and immersive even a decade after its initial release it s a true testament to the dedication and talent of the developers who created it it s always great to see older games being appreciated for their artistry and entertainment value
game runs on x settings solid 60fps on a steamdeck to looks great on it
definite purchase when it is on steam
i played through this last year it was a good game but the best parts have you wishing they happened more often
ryse was a really fun and pretty brawler but has zero replay value imo
boring with mediocre gameplay
you posted a screenshot from the steam page
it s easy for a game to look great when that s the extent of what it does
that game was hands down amazing and one of my all time fav
underrated game
remember when this first came out smashed in a day mainly story was good combat could be repetitive
i m probably in the minority here but i played hours and hours of ryse as a teenager i even got an xbone just to do so i loved the arena mode which i always did single player it was repetitive and lootboxy if i remember but it felt so rewarding when you finally had a full set of armor after coming from a near naked loser
i played this a bit when i got my xsx it was fun enough and looked good but i got motion sickness and had to run to the bathroom after like minutes
i had a friend who insisted this game looked better than every ps4 game in existence because and i quote it uses the cloud to enhance the graphics rendering i shouldn t need to tell anyone here why that s the most incorrect thing ever
too bad it fucking sucks
who gives a fuck how good the game looks gameplay was ass and gameplay is king
yea looks great too bad the game was awful lol
brilliant game brilliant atmosphere story soundtrack combat mechanics i really enjoyed this one
video game graphics have really stagnated in the past yrs some aaa games that come out today don t even look this good
i found zero enjoyment in this game but i m glad others were able to have some fun
yes crytek is a good looking engine game is as shallow as a puddle though
yup looks good for sure too bad it was only like 2hrs long or so i remember being highly dissatisfied with the lack of any replay value
the game is so darn beautiful i hope every game has the same graphics quality
one of the most fun coop games i ve ever played
that s literally it s only trick though it was a glorified qte
this is the game i bought with my xbone i really enjoyed it
years ago cocks gun
the only real difference we re seeing is that consoles can run these kinds of games on their respective platforms at 60fps at 1080p now we ve been sitting back and waiting for them to catch up now that we re here though we re seeing 1080p at higher than 60fps and 4k targets which means graphical fidelity is gonna remain stagnant for a while again
i played this on a whim because it was on the games with gold backlog on xbox good game
looks great gameplay gets repetitive hours in though
this was the first game i played when i built my first gaming pc it ran hard but looked amazing it was also my first experience with quick time events and my first game with an over the shoulder forced camera that part was awful nobody wants of their screen to be the character s back
ahh another ad
one of those sale games i ve bought and never gonna play
it turned out to be a giant wet fart but you can t deny it s style same as the order i guess
hah soo much for xbox one exclusives
i kinda enjoyed this game i was just playing other things at the time i enjoyed
too bad it still sucks
i was so let down by this game
if only it didn t suck
i actually thought it was an open world game
this game was actually fun for the time a little repetitive but when i look back on it i think it was worth the price graphics blew me away and trying to get the bad ass multiple finishers was a fun challenge and looked sick
this was one of my first games on xbox one the story was incredible
this was the first game i saw on the new xbox one at the time and it blew me away the graphics and the new controller made the game a blast to play
it looks like an 8th generation game wouldn t say incredible at least not by today s standards
wasn t that a ps4 launch title
great tech demo for the launch i owned it day one
hot take the combat story and visuals were at least an out of
wow breaking news people game made for the last generation of systems still looks good who could ve ever guessed that would happen gotta be a teenager who made this garbage
great visuals story audio design soundtrack etc i was surprised by how much i enjoyed the gameplay it really just clicked for me couldn t believe it was panned so hard for it s combat
looks like diablo
is it any good i skipped it at launch bc i wasn t all that interested and i ve downloaded it on game pass before but did the thing where i opened it said eh nah then deleted it
this man was born to end lives
bucks on steam i m getting it
shadow of rome is an amazing game that was way ahead of its time honestly if you like this you ll probably like that tko
at the time i always felt this was the best looking game
the story was epic and the premise means it could be anywhere if someone with the right creative direction could pick it up they d have a concept that could go through history forever the literal gods were manipulating the story from the start and it s not revealed until the very end the mc was literally being used by the gods and devils nemesis which was basically envy they hated nemesis in greek culture but this concept could be used in a mc for different points in history as ryze son of sparta or ryze son of the rising sun or ryze son of mali ryze son of kemet ryze son of the lost a spin off with zombies and the underworld they dropped the ball
i bought it a few years ago on steam sale and i actually enjoyed it being relatively short looking gorgeous and having a decent story it was short but i also think that if it was any longer it would have become tedious the mechanics are simple but good i would have been annoyed if it was a full price game because for that it is way too little content but for a couple of it was great and i really liked playing it no replay value though
guess which gameboy came from a smoking household
i m quite alergic to pokemon right now but good for you that also goes for the i m not going to make my bed thing xd
is that smash bros besides charmander
i never make my bed either
maybe save up for a table no one wants to see your bedsheets
what s in the crystal chronicles box a gba link cable
ayo we have the same blanket
mom said to make your bed
pretty sure that is due to sunlight exposure not cigarettes
i got them cheap so i don t mind tbh lol
yee yee
amen it s boomer propaganda
nah i m gonna post more bed pics
that may be but i know for a fact that plastics that are in a smokers house get nicotine brown pretty darn fast my childhood nes that was always in the basement can attest to that same for the animator what a horrid yellow it is now
not judging if it works why not right my parents smoked in the house my nes is the lovely nicotine brown as well
nice the cover looks interesting
yeah a these games are all incredible that they never made another mario rpg is craaaaaazy
ff vi is an all time favorite
secret of evermore is also worth playing
mario rpg is legit one of the best rpgs i ve ever played
this was back in the day when it was square without the enix anything with a square logo on the box was bloody awesome i even imported secret of mana to get a copy
i think i completed tales of phantasia more than times such a great game
where mystic quest
you can t argue with dq and ff
chrono trigger breath of fire series illusion of gaia so many
even back then when i had an snes i was never into rpg games i wish i could but it s difficult to get into if you don t know the characters or story i did wind up playing mario rpg as an adult and i enjoyed it
secret of mana is still my favorite game from that time followed closely by link to the past
live alive it actually got a switch remake that adds voice acting
lufia
i don t think any of these are on switch online lmao
the only one worth playing is super mario rpg
turn your steam deck into a s jrpg machine especially if you never got to play some of the classics
metal max returns
poor us players didn t had terranigma
tales of phantasia is my favorite game of all time it s also the first game i ever purchased with my own money i wish they would do a remake or something because the new games are pretty mid compared to it
just realized secret of nana would be a great porn movie name
g o d mezame yo to yobu koe ga kikoe japan star ocean breath of fire i ii
love these all but don t forget lagoon https://youtu.be/vmi_balv_fc)
they had a falling out right after the game
they made paper mario and the mario and luigi series of games though they are not really sequels to super mario rpg
i would at least love to see mario rpg make it to the n64 catalog on switch i m not holding my breath though
ff6 and chrono trigger are my all time favorite final fantasy
yes it s always my add on the lists so good
i have such fond memories playing this game i wish they would ve done some sort of follow up with it outside of paper mario and mario luigi hell i d even take a remake similar to link s awakening
enix was great too terranigma is up there with chrono trigger and ff6
the tales series is so criminally underrated every entry has been a banger since the first entry tales of destiny for ps1 will always be my favorite
game if a ff in name only and put on easy mode still a fun game but not one of the greats
op said great rpg s mystic quest far from qualifies
the fact that chrono trigger isn t one of the pictures blows my mind it was rated number one rpg for super nintendo secret of mana link and chrono are the three best imo
even if i were born back in the snes era i still wouldn t have been able to play mist of these games when they were new because i live in europe and europe almost never got rpgs released back then
most of these have standalone characters you don t need to play the previous final fantasys to play
how come
it probably already is
yeah i would replace tales of phantasia with chrono trigger top is good but i would say it is the weakest of the group
tales of destiny for ps1 my absolute favorite of the series as well i ve occasionally seen it titled tales of eternia as well such as the psp version
the soundtrack alone makes it qualify
ah ok good to know i did try ff3 on my snes classic but i got stuck super early and gave up
yea and it may be called something else in japan as well fuck that game is so good i lent it to an old friend years and years ago and we had a falling out and i completely forgot he had it never saw it again sure i could emulate it but the copy is worth a fuck ton of money now lol
if you haven t removed the leaky capacitor you should open it up and do that before it damages the motherboard
rrrrrom dom dom
riders on the storm
thank you for this tip
oh i didn t know about that good looking out
there are literally documentaries on youtube talking about this kind of behaviour for years and it seems nobody really cares enough to watch them
uninstall
my coworker is constantly complaining about pokmon go and i m just sitting there with my ds able to get any pokmon ever with enough time and effort
lmao you know you can earn these without paying for them right
they are focusing more on people doing local raids instead of remoting in it s why they implemented campfire into the app now not saying it s right but it s why the remote passes and not the regulars went up in coins
i mean that s nintendo for you
edit after doing a bit of research came to find out that niantic most likely will keep nerfing remote raids because it s real money maker comes from selling the data you acquire for them by going to local raids and feeding them data about your whereabouts so they can sell it to advertising firms niantic is selling data and since kids play pokmon go niantic sells their information as well they sold your information too the only way they loose is when your uninstall and stop feeding them data do what you wish with this information
regular raid passes cost an even amount of coins the current great raid box is also an uneven amount of coins but i guess it s only worth complaining about uneven coin costs when the deal is bad you re also able to get legendaries for free at least one every day more if you are capable of putting up with the hot garbage that is pogo pvp
i don t even wanna know how much i ve spent on that game
i saw this coming a mile away the year it came out companies aren t for community or being the good guys when money is involved and now people are invested in their dex so are more likely to indulge these shitty practices people are quitting but some won t just because they re invested
it s free game you don t have to spend a cent on it can quit anytime you want
what s the problem
oh they do get watched but not by the people that matter at this point most of us are on the same page but as long as technologically illiterate dinosaurs have the say on any kind of regulation in the matter nothing is going to change in a meaningful way
can you link the video
true but this significantly affects players in the rural areas
yeah coin max a day just days of waiting before you may or may not catch a pokmon you physically have to go out and get but first you gotta make sure the gym you go to belongs to your team if not then add more grind time but you ll get a local pass to take on that star legendary by yourself because guess what no one s going to want to pay double what they used to for remote passes yeah such a great trade off
most people i know who s still play this game still play because we send each other remote raid invites i have a daughter and a full time career i don t have time to stop what i m doing drive out to the local spot pray to god some strangers don t look at me weird and then ask a kid who s half my age hey you wanna play pokmon together someone clearly didn t think this through but it s cool let the stock holder voice their opinions when suddenly niantics stock starts plummeting after the ramifications of milking their biggest ip
nah i think it s more like idiots with too much money don t care enough that these dinosaurs exist let s take diablo immortal as an example shortly after release i ve read how british streamers pumped a dum of over 120k into the game to test how much it takes to maximize your character with money i don t know if these guys really exist or if the sum was that large but when i see how much money this free game made it seems very possible
clearly not for you why play it
you could always one of the gazillion main line games they don t require you to get of your ass to play and they are far better games as well too
one of them spent money until they got a star gem like 12k then deleted the gem and closed the game they just wanted to see and show how bad the rates really were
are they free
there s not even a game shortcut on the desktop
this is so nostalgic
give me time since i just got it working also i keep my desktop clean of shortcuts
now that s how you censor a kid face in a picture for the internet
one of the first gaming experiences i had was just like this except i was playing halo ce on og xbox and i got upset cause i couldnt see anything and i was staring at the floor for like an hour
try lego spider man
now stand in the corner and think about what you ve done
first ps5 game i ve ever let my son 5yo try to conquer and he legitimately beat levels that i had died in was a cool dad moment
you might be interested in the hori mini game pad it s smaller and its wired my youngest used to use it all the time and he loved it it for his hands and he never had to remember to charge it
exactly he ll be better for it learning on his own haha
good call he got up from his nap and saw me playing so i decided to let him have a go he did better than i expected
he played in the same difficulty as you
yea just on medium kid knows how to navigate and use the gadgets grab items to throw at people pull shelves onto bad guys knows for the fat guys and shield guys that they re easier if you use a gadget on them to start it s pretty wild to me what he picked up on his own
congratulations
good game
depends on if you ve got wares to sell stranger
heheheheh thank you
depends is the bonfire new if it s not then i don t really care but if it is is i must be exploring a new area which means i need to restock the merchant is always a welcome site though because it means a brief safe spot and possibly goodies
how ya doin stranger
nothing ever attacked me around mr merchant i ve been attacked at a bonfire before fuck you lautrec
seeing the merchant gives a calming sense you can buy some items and strike a conversation
merchant i always chuckle when i hear that voice
whatcha buyin har har har har
the bonfire for the love of god the bonfire
is that xur
bonfire merchant doesnt sell ammo and smart use of upgrades and knife durability makes a huge diff
thinking of fallout the doors to goodneighbor were a relief took me forever to find that place so many super mutants and raiders and ghouls and synths and random land mines on the way there
bonfires for the first play through except for the third game that place is lousy with bonfires i don t always have enough coin to the buy the merchant s cool stuff anyway
game
welcome hollow
the purple is the vibe
aaah stranger
oh breaks over i guess
gun rhymes with fun for a reason stranger
the merchant looks like he should be in sleep token
yeah bullshit it s objectively the bonfire
maybe list the game titles next time otherwise you may as well post in the actual subs for the game if you re not going to provide any context
finding a new bonfire in a tough area makes me let out an audible sigh of relief
if i m in a poison swamp then bonfire all the way
definitely bon fire it s free
definitely the typewriter for this ganado
bonfire all the way i d be more happy with the merchant if he sold ammo and health sprays but that d probably make the game too easy
bonfire demons souls shortcuts and checkpoints getting the whole way around swamp of sorrow was brutal
irl the merchant would look like someone who d whack you and rob your corpse but in the re universe he s amusingly such a welcoming sight
i m relieved when i see the bonfire but i m giddy when i see the merchant
i d be relieved if i saw a save button in these games
don t get yourself killed line of the merchant reminds me of andre every time i hear it i follow it with i don t want to see you go hollow in my mind
also hearing the map guy humming in hollow knight is very comforting
boy even fallout has that bonfire in one of the dlcs it even let s you recover the hp
the bonfire doesn t have a horrible australian accent
merchant because oh cool i should become stronger now at a bonfire i might be able to lose slower now
what are ya buying and what are ya selling is ingrained into my head from the gamecube days haha
bonfire for sure
question for anybody who knows is the new resident evil four remake the exact same game just with updated graphics or is there some new features to it because i absolutely loved the original game and played through it multiple times to the point where i pretty much had it memorized i don t really feel like buying it again if it s the exact same game but if there are any new features or anything new that s fun to it i would totally buy it again please advise
now i have the re4 merchant music stuck in my head dang it
is the right one bloodborne because my ass is still at the fucking beginning i can t find another save spot and i want to play the game i just hate doing everything over again
at least on standard difficulty where you get a solid amount of ammo and healing stuff it seems barely relevant bonfires on other hand are always good and there is never enough of them
the merchant is happy to see me and i m happy to see him so he wins this one stranger
from what game is the image on the right
mimic bonfires form ds2
nothing more comforting than a cockney accent
whatta buyin
dark souls
definitely the bonfire
heal a man keel a man we love our merchant
stranguh
i felt a wave of calm and relief wash over me when i looked at this picture thank you op
definitely not the dealer in the remake why did they remove his classic lines why did they make the game so much more serious
right cause imo it s got more value and there s also a save usually near by
both are fine
i ve got a selection of good things on sale stranger
definitely bonfire for me
dude looks suspiciously like an emissary of the nine better have some good stuff this weekend you lovecraftian horror faced bitch
dark souls bonfire has lost its charm because bonfire grace are now literally everywhere _ atleast its a resting area
merchant by far
gun rhymes with fun for a reason stranger hehe
when you don t have wares to sell he is not very happy o
i heard that
sometimes it being a bonfire you ve already been to could mean new shortcut which is nice
i disagree when i hear the firelink shrine music from ds1 all of my worries wash away there s something so serenely soothing about it
potential spoiler maybe but the merchant isn t a safe spot necessarily most of the time yes but i ve been attacked right in front of him he didn t seem to react with any voicelines however
removed
removed
i ve seen him cower when i was attacked by zealots in the lobby area after i returned to claim the treasures i guess my money is no use to me dead and a cadaver is an easy pickpocket
lautrec is not aggressive unless you attack him first at firelink shrine
the bonfire does that same exact thing minus the conversation but like times lmao
ello stranger
same lol i ve seen a handful of people complain about his new accent but i think it fits i had a laughing fit right before the salazar fight because the merchant can see you just before you walk into his room i just walk up to a normal looking wall and heard a muffled complaint about his back hurting
not gunpowder apparently
remember when you upgrade your magazine and he gave you free full amount of bullet good time
dark souls series on the left resident evil remake on the right
if you haven t played the games the meme won t mean anything to you anyway
wait a minute ganados can t use typewriters un forastero
he does sell health sprays
dark souls autosaves re4 has save points in the form of typewriters they don t need an actual save button
neither does the merchant
the game is vastly different from the original it has the original setting and places but the gameplay has changes to it like the knife is more useful in combat where you can parry attacks with it game is great still as i played the original myself
nah right is the new resident evil remake stick with bloodborne it s my favorite soulsborne game and remember a hunter must hunt
resident evil remake
happy to be of service now what re ya buyin
most of the merchant s lines from the original are still in the game you just don t hear them as much because he s got significantly expanded dialogue from the original
wat i don t remember being attacked near the merchant in original game re4 is it something new to the remake
i guess you wrote your response in the wrong commentary
lol i chuckled at that something is wrong with me
inflation is no joke man
imagine my pikachu face when i upgraded an empty shotgun and it came back improved in capacity but still empty capcom played me like a damn fiddle
i tried that out just to see if they kept it a full mag of magnum bullets was always nice
the dude on the right looks like xur
he does i dont remember him doing that my mistake then
oooooo intriguing thanks for the info
that didn t make it better though the tone of the remake is a big miss for me
you have to bait enemies into the shop i did it to see if he d do anything it doesn t really happen in regular gameplay i really want to use a mod to spawn a garrador at the beginning and see if i can manipulate his blind ass into fighting everyone for me i loved that one room in the castle
i got attacked in the entrance to the castle well he sets up like right next to a scripted encounter and i found myself shooting hombres right in front of him
the remake almost has no loading screens so you can travel the entire map continually which means that with some clever manipulation or bad luck enemies can hunt you down pretty far
it s just a bot that stole a comment made minor changes to it and then reposted it elsewhere in the same thread original is here https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12d626b/im_not_sure_which_one_i_get_more_relieved_to_see/jf5bo8m?context=3 edit generally if someones comment doesn t make sense there s a pretty good chance you ll find that same comment further down with correct context just keep scrolling
holy moly elite force was fantastic i d completely forgotten about that one
oh man i forgot about elite force it was a great game pc gaming from was simply the greatest point in gaming history
i want a new unreal tournament before i die i loved their take on the rocket launcher monter killll
elite force was so good was a big fan of voyager and being able to play a fantastic shooter in that world was just awesome put a ton of time into ut2004 as well good picks
i like to kick ass and chew bubblegum and i m all outta gum those were the times
my first games were master of orion delta force and dune i still have master of orion installed on steam and i still play it
i would keep that elite force game
bring back coconut monkey do it
those pc gamer discs bring back memories
unreal tournament
ut2k4 was the shit
i was a sucker for elite force
i played ut2k4 for a few years right around the time the first halo was the shit we had just upgraded to dsl
fyi internet archive has the pc cd gamer disc isos and scans as well as tons of other demo discs
ut2004 was so good i spent so many hours playing this with my brother back then so many memories
got ut2004 too need to check about the pc demo disc though
and is when pc gaming died
i didn t know ut2004 had a dvd version i thought mine was like cd roms i still have it laying around somewhere
huge voyager fan back in the day and soon as i read the reviews in pc gamer i knew i had to have it was a brilliant game too
it got re released on gog
elite force had an expansion pack
i was just thinking the same thing i wouldn t mind a brand new not rehashed or remastered quake game as well while we re at it let s throw blood in there as well those fps games were great
a new unreal tournament would be absolutely fantastic i had soooooo much fun in those games lol
they were making one it was really good too but the dev team got pulled when fortnite took off getting kills with the impact hammer was so satisfying
yep these days we pc gamers spend more time chewing gum and installing hotfixes
master of orion is such a classic love that game
oh yep it s not going anywhere
oh this is awesome to hear i think a browse over the day weekend is in order
i believe they released the then latest version on dvd when that media became a big thing in the early 2000s which is when i jumped onboard that wagon hah
yup bf2 had a dvd version as well i still have my boxed copies of bf2 and ut2004 if i remember correctly there was a second disc with ut2004 that had the patches that had released and i think some extra maps and stuff
when i was a kid the only pc games my older brother played were star trek games elite force was an awesome game for its time i used to think growing up the show was boring as shit only now after watching every single episode of star trek the next generation voyager and deep space nine years later did i realize they were awesome shows i think gene roddenberry is turning in his grave at what they have done to the new star trek shows
dude i miss the pc gamer glory days
10yr old me hated that game lol i swore i was gonna get to fly the ship
did you ever play the voyager game on ps2 i never finished it because i was little and got stuck on one part but i always loved it
hell yeah and it was a decent one too for the time you got the whole virtual voyager mini game and they updated seven s voice lines with actual jeri ryan plus a bunch of mp maps and modes maybe my glasses are bit rose tinted as elite force was my first real computer game that i bought for myself
we did have that awkward period where some pc games were coming on multiple disks and patches were manually downloaded over the internet those were the worst of times as far as time till you can start playing
that was a line from duke nukem
not because of diversity but yes he would be spinning because they took his utopia vision and flipped it to being a dystopian nightmare
i actually enjoy watching the modern series i have to say ok they don t have the certain something that the old shows had there s no odo from ds9 for example among others or a captain such as janeway but the new series are visually stunning and at least some of the episodes have interesting stories i guess
oh i know
correct
yeah the new shows are missing the charm the older series had if they maybe had the same budgets maybe it would be better but i really dislike how they changed the klingons but picard was pretty good i luckily got to meet patrick stewart at a grocery store in park slope brooklyn years ago he owns a condo in redhook brooklyn he had no issue taking a picture with a fan
we re talking about a show that had the first interracial kiss on tv in it s first incarnation during the dark days of the cold war it had a russian officer it was always a progressive show roddenberry would be quite happy about that part of new trek but i think he would be quite sad that they got rid of his hopeful we can work together to build a better tomorrow ideals and made something dark and discordant and negative instead he wanted star trek to be something for us to aspire to and work towards creating and that s not what new trek has become to a lot of people it is a sad state when a parody show like the orville can be a more faithful to the source material product than official content
yeah i agree with you it was always a progressive show it is pretty sad i think most people enjoyed the orville more than the new series i didn t like what they did to the klingons but picard was pretty good in my opinion it took a while for my brother to take the time to watch orville and he thought it was better than most of what he has seen in the new series aswell
i couldn t take more than episodes overall of discovery and i got up to the episode before the season finale of picard and then just never finished it i kinda gave up on star trek at that point and haven t seen anything more recent it would probably take a lot for me to give it a chance again especially since they seem to refuse to really move the timeline forward and would rather just keep doing tos era prequel series
somebody in here about to say they wish they were the chain chomp
probably a weird comment but somehow the lightreflection in chompi bois eyes weirds me out the closer i zoom in
god i remember all the fucking bowsette porn and hype around it a few years ago
lawsuit incoming you re not allowed to be creative with nintendo ip s
my roommate uses one of those large bouncy balls as a chair and i just got the mental image of bowsette doing so with a chain chomp at a desk
the cosplay is good but i can t stop looking at chompy s eye it s just so off
r cosplay
why do i feel like these days many people are just using cosplay to show themself half naked or erotic in puplic
r lostredditors
this is gaming how
cosplays belong on r cosplay
why does literally everything non sexual have to be turned sexy weirdest cosplay i saw was a sexy dora an adult sexualizing a children s cartoon
the dog has an eye inside his eye
nice cosplay but come on look at literally all the comments on this post and tell me with a straight face that this is gaming content that has generated discussion about anything actually related to gaming
this isn t my thing but i think you re the lady who did the cosplay of fragile from death stranding if that was you you did an amazing job one of the best cosplays i ve ever seen someone pull off
that looks amazing
if bowsette is in the movie the internet will explode amazing job as always did you make the chain chomp
the chain chimp eyes are kinda weirding me out otherwise great work
step on me
the chomp is beautiful
cosplay as what who
wrong sub
with enough photo shop anyone can be hot
this is the first nsfw tagged cosplay i ve ever seen on this subreddit
i thought this was r rupaulsdragrace for a second and you were a drag queen lol
interesting you did red hair i ve only ever seen fan art cosplay with blonde hair and it never crossed my mind bowser has a red mane lol
i put the eye through an ai to make it look better unfortunately haven t mastered that part of 3d modeling yet
doesn t really have anything to do with gaming post this in some cosplay sub
is the chain chomp an ai render i ask because the teeth are wildly jagged and the eye gloss is weird not sure what the iso was on your camera but you didn t need to add more grain to the image
things like blender render always make me chuckle
an nsfw tagged bowsette cosplay is not what i opened reddit expecting to see today
really great render eyes are stupidly difficult no matter how practiced you are
finally some real gaming content
i didn t even look at the outfit first i looked at the chain chomp s eye it looks like it s eye has a little eye inside it
can we mark this as nsfw
love it i need a chain chomp like that
lol that s awesome chomp looks great too you killed it
i like it well done
mad props on making blender model
you should make an irl chain chomp
how heavy is the chomp
very impressive 3d render
chumming the water for boys again shameless
im confused why this is nsfw
i like how the chain chomp is just stunned and happy to be there good for it
never seen an irl chain chomp before lol
very cool
i think the light source needs to be offset to the left a bit it doesnt seem to align with the other shadows might just be me though
step on me then have bow wow bite my balls off
cosplay is cancer
oh god not this shit again
wow love it great textures
giga

stay classy staay claassyy if it was a me i d bang my fist into her coin box until she was panting and breathing fire yahoooo shit
why dis be nsfw
need me a cosplay girl
finally someone who follows leash laws
one common complaint i am seeing about the game is the proliferation of killbox style maps one solve that is used in a game like super mario maker is to force the creators to also complete the map prior to allowing it to be published is this something the team would consider it seems that the robot being able to make it to the core and back isn t enough to stop these certainly killboxes will still be possible with this suggested change but they ll be a lot less common due to the difficulty of completing them
are there any plans to make building role less grindy i played the beta and even there i felt it was bit too much since i enjoyed building the most from what i saw so far it looks like the grinding is even worse then beta because of price increase when you want to buy new outposts i belive the prestige cost is also bigger
in one of your surveys you asked about what people were interested in terms of skins one thing listed was sanctuary skins if i am not mistaken is this still something you might pursue or has it been written off as not needed
any plans for additional types of game modes really enjoying things so far
what are the chances we can eventually pet hrv in our sanctuary
can you please add sex
i m not sure if this a thing or not but will there be a way people can join a guild or clan and war each others guild for different types of prizes game looks amazing btw
hi there loving the game so far got a few questions will there be story events more lore added to the game right now it s a little bare bones would you consider adding something akin to the archives in dbd ie a mode that offers challenges encouraging players to try new strategies and rewards them for it tell us about some of the visual and thematic inspirations for the game
what is the teams favorite trap and what does the team think the strongest trap is
when will you be adding cross play and cross progression
hi loving the game so far i know the community already seems pretty split in terms of which type of bases they do or don t enjoy kill boxes death halls mazes doom likes and themed maps being a few examples rather than restrict players ability to produce certain map types such as kill boxes that are beloved by some but hated by others would bhvr consider a tagging system to let players simply find the kinds of maps they most want to play and avoid the kinds they dislike to me this seems a best of both worlds solution as it allows builders full creativity while allowing raiders to easily avoid outpost types they dislike you could even set an optional toggle that would disable map tag viewing allowing players who want to be surprised by the type of base to retain that mystery i understand that some outpost types like kill boxes would be much easier to implement this with than other harder to define varieties since you would presumably need the game to auto detect the type of base and assign tags appropriately but is this something bhvr has or would consider
is there a chance we could see map modifiers that allow you to disable use of equipment permadeath for mp no heads up warning etc also how do you play maps you friends make they don t show up in social would it be possible to have the harvester travel through holoblocks currently they block it s path but there s so much you could do if the harvester could travel through holo
me and my friend work very hard to create nice and fun bases yet only one of us gets loot for it would there eventually be a way to make clan bases where everyone in the group would obtain a part or of the loot having clans where clan members try each other s base would be nice there s so much that can be done with this game possibilities are endless expanding the editor playercount could be nice more players more imagination any idea if we will ever get doors that close open on genmat pickup so we could force players to take a different route when leaving i know this is more like suggestions but i m also wondering what other players are thinking about theses
please don t give up soon on this game this is my favorite type of game and i want to play it for as long as i have dbd 1k hours can you share any new trap plans or the ability to be more complex i understand complexity can sometimes make balancing really problematic but i am curious of the future of the game
do you plan to add an in game friends list and the ability to raid with users on other platforms also do you plan to release more cosmetics for suits and weapons
can we get remap controls on xbox please

le physique de la chimre va telle changer dans le future voluer et tre plus en accord avec a voix fr will the chimera s physique change in the future evolve and be more in tune with her voice
what is the max level for the chimera and your advisors does that level reset at any point do you ever lose any leveling materials access to mods or progress on rank reset
is there a chance you ll add multiplayer support for players at some point
where did the idea come from
will we in the future see a more comprehensive leaderboard seeing how height you are ranked is cool and all but it isn t the same as seeing all your competitors striving for the highest rank
i have questions any plans to make harveys movement alot more similar to the player having a bot that makes sure the player can get in and out is a good system but i think it should have all of the players moveset like jumping double jumping grapple etc to encourage more creative levels ill admit the first time i launched the game i was pretty dissapointed at the lack of player and weapon customizations is there anything planned for that in terms of head body weapon cosmetics i would really appreciate at the very least an option to recolor my robot self if think itll be a great addition to add to the advisor in the hideout that makes all the suit upgrades
are there any plans to implement seperate layers for traps and props i d like to be able to place a second wave trap on a block faces that have props like the vents or lights i m pretty proud of my outpost rathdrum which got a lot of exposure yesterday on release its a cathedral with a short simple but trap laden route it ran during beta so now its on prestige what happens at finally are there any plans in the works for community focused playlists like best outposts of april or anything like that are there any plans to introduce props that don t need blocks some of my maps would benefit from border width fences or windows
i ve played the game through both betas and am having a great time the confidence to allow makers to build bases without playing through them shows you have a lot of trust in your design to prevent impossible bases my question is what are your plans for open communication with players for the future i understand there is the forum for feedback but do you plan on doing more livestreams or amas like this one i m honestly curious to hear more about your own thoughts on the game and what kind of things you re looking for feedback on
right now rank you get from building is not enough to compete against main builder in the master leaderboard do you plan to add a specific ranking for builder or outpost will we get elo matchmaking
are there any additional future collabs planned with dead by daylight
hello i love mym but i was wondering if harvs path mechanics will be tweaked in the future i cant make a puzzle or parkour outpost due to the limited pathing
are there any plans to make more chimeras traps and guards in the future
in one of my feedbacks i talked about maybe some downtime things like catering to a plant or something like that something that might not have any impact at all but it might also be fun i get it if it is not possible but i am curious what your opinion on the matter is
how do y all plan to filter elevate the more fun map designs
you should make traps that do not turn off like saws and floor traps
just wanted to say i picked this game up yesterday and have been playing non stop i ve been having a blast and creating the bases has been incredibly fun my only suggestion would be more customization options when building a base such as new decals different worlds and maybe a way to customize our characters
hello ive played for about hours so far i am very into the game but i don t understand some of the design choices and i would love to hear the team s thought process behind certain decisions outposts must have a walkable path from entrance to goal i feel like in similar games i always see if you can beat your dungeon you can publish it why was this decision made i feel like my creativity keeps butting up against this i would love to make an outpost where you enter one spot and leave another or an outpost that tests skill with the grapple hook or a maze with tight disorienting geometry is there any chance of this restriction being lifted in the future 2a why do outposts expire doesn t that just limit the total outposts for players to play 2b why do outposts expire in hours with a global online community i would hope for so my dungeon can be seen by every time zones peak play hours generally as i understand it the ratio of creators to players is quite low in games that enable user generated content personally i m a frustrated that i don t have access to more interesting traps and enemies to start and that s caused me to be frustrated with how my first base turned out why is the box of toys so small i would love to make more interesting outposts but if i have to grind to get there i m pretty turned off to keep going
any plans on lore advancements i really like the premise and would love to see the lore expanded on also can i please give harvey a hat
i have excitement in my veins for this
any eta on fov slider and fully customizable controls on ps5 version of the game
you have plans to optimize the game more in the near future because some of us are crashing while we are in the sanctuary player hub i love the game so far great work
what was your inspiration for the art style of the game it reminds me of mad max the matrix and cube all rolled into one
hello i m not the biggest fan of dbd but it s always pleasant to spend an evening playing it unfortunately i haven t had a chance to try meet your maker yet but the gameplay has piqued my interest when i found out that the ukrainian language was on release i immediately bought it and hope to find time to enjoy it soon at the moment i don t have any questions but i want to wish you luck and success in your creative and work and much thank you for supporting ukrainians it s very heartwarming thank you
love the game can we have inverted corners for building
will you add a key item to unlock a door type wall i think it d be neat and really add to the dungeon feel to this game
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
do you love me
one of the things i really like about dbd is that new achievements get added with each major update can we expect the same with mym
bonjour salut will their ever be cross over events with dead by daylight content and could other ips end up in this game and who would you love to see if yes thanks
i ve been enjoying the game so far on ps5 it s a ton of fun but i have nitpicks is there any plan to add more weapon types like a shotgun or a spear etc 2nd will there be any plans to add colorblind support along any other accessibility options
what inspired the development of this game
this game is fantastic and i know it s probably been asked but what kind of perks and such will be added to weapons and armor will we get suits with stronger perks toward avoiding traps gun perks that maybe consume a shot but do burst or aoe damage
do you have any plans to help players protect harvey this is especially needed for maze outposts that intentionally kill harvey and is sometimes unavoidable by the raider
to start off i love the game it s so much fun great job me and my friend are constantly laughing at each other as we get both decimated question will there be more weapons in the future question in the future could we customize our sanctuary question could it be made easier to test your friends maps as they do not show up on social search question will night maps be added always being a desert sun can get a little boring after a while question can lights be added in the future so players can choose where it is lit and where it is dark
with the changes made to an outpost s active time window extraction will burial site and prestige costs be lowered as well in beta as well as the live version i m having the most trouble collecting enough synthite to purchase outposts and keep them active via prestige levels the decreased time between prestige levels is making it tough to have more than one outpost active at a time
i have dbd on xbox and got meet your maker on xbox how to i claim the free stuff for mym for dbd thank you
are you going to make the grapple movement more fluid
are you guys planning on implementing cross play or cross progression at some point
will you give me doritos
any chance for a flying harvy as an option would certainly add to base flexibility
would you consider adding a collect all and clear all button to the build menu for resources and death markers respectively walking around collecting all those when you have over a hundred deaths in your base is tedious
harvey cosmetics when do you guys ever watch replays of the devious team maps i m assuming that s y all who made those i love hate them
thank you i enjoy this game as is don t add the complete your own map thing i prefer simply adding more content like suits weapons traps guards etc
where can we meet you bc you re obviously the maker
dude you look like tim curry
what types of challenges came up working on both dbd and mym also besides what s already been shown is there any possibility of more crossover between the two
as someone who plans to play it because it is the game of the month for ps plus also i know literally about it what would you want a fresh player with no knowledge of the game to do first
any plans on releasing the game on the switch
are you gonna make updates based off numbers or actual gameplay both in house and from the community i ask this considering dead by daylight is updated based off numbers which very many are not fond of
hey there no questions i just wanna say it s fun to log in and see your lair has killed people i ve had fun with this one for sure some people are getting very creative great job and thanks
i saw soup and blargs video on it seems cool is it coming to on xbox and if so how much is it or will it ever be on gamepass
deleted
will a thing be added so map creators have to clear a map first before they can upload it also showing the tools use for the clear would be nice if this was added
i saw ign made a review of your game in my book you made it congrats
can you really take me to my dad
is there a lore reason why there is no neurological dampening applied to the chimera to keep it in check
the t shirts that you were wearing in yesterdays stream are those possible merch products in the future and if so is there an hrv figuring planned

does the dread shore dlc have anything to do with italy
hello devs been addicted to the game since discovering it can you give us any sneak peaks at future trap ideas you would like to implement
is the thing we see in the middle of the dread shore promotion art the new suit and if not why has the number three been inscribed isn t that the theme for all the fortalis suits to have the number of release sequences on it
is there anything i can do besides wait for a fix i upgraded my gear in another players game the ammo increase on the volt lancer and the magnetic link for the default suit and neither modification works i only have two ammo and the link isn t showing in my suit
is there lore about the speeder thing that the custodian rides on in the loading screen
i would like to know what advisor should i focus on mainly
will you even change the way levels are verified by letting the builder beat their level to stop kill boxes
is there any plans to lower the loading times when you die it s clear the gameplay wants you keep trying over and over after dying but the game s loading times really make it a slog
what kind of garbage keyboard you got there
will this game also be pay to win like other bhvr games
oh thought this was one of those reddit roast me things
would you like to eat my ass
this is an ad they aren t answering anything mods
should i buy the game i want it but money is tight looking for a totally unbiased answer here lol in all seriousness i don t have a question just wanna say congrats and i can t wait till i can afford the game
i only want to thank you for adding ukranian language there also there is no russian localisation knowing only these facts is more than enough for me to buy the game
tits or cock
can you say trans rights are human rights
ask us anything and we will do our best not to answer it
what game are you developing
you look like
how do you plan to incentivize making high quality and good bases as of right now the game is filled with bases that are made for the sole purpose of gaining kills and are impossible to beat can you add some sort of ranking system where people can upvote or downvote bases the game essentially is nothing but dying because there s no real reason for people to build good bases
will it ever be free
what is the teams opinion on killboxes as well as some peoples hatred of them
is that the horrendous pc port version on the right
ubisoft
amen
yup this is the one i think everyone had immense trouble understanding the controls let alone getting qtes right lol
that s wicked bro
i dig it
nice one i remember getting this car from the pink slip used it a lot until i got the porsche carrera gt to finish the game man i played this game so much as a child
it s not the first drawing of yours i see and i absolutely love them
for anyone who still has one of these controllers instead of letting it become e waste you can update the firmware https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_us.html) and use it as a standard bluetooth or usb controller update is available until the end of the year according to google
have you ordered it via internet explorer
i got an america online aol free trial cd somewhere if you need it
it s the future of gaming
r patientgamers
lol i also have an unopened one going in the museum
the controller is pretty nice to be honest
lovely doorstop nice of them to release an update to allow you to use your bt controller as a bt controller
cloud gaming is so stupid clouds are made of water and they ll ruin the servers hosted there
i mean i bought into stadia i got a controller a chromecast ultra and cyberpunk for then google refunded me when they cancelled the service solid value as far as i m concerned
i can still hear the guy from google on podcasts in my head podcaster so is google going to just abandon this like other projects if it doesn t work out quickly stadia guy blink blink blink
didnt stadia get shutdown
it was way better than i thought it d be honestly
op is internet explorer
lmao these comments are too high iq
does it connect to your home wifi network
downvote me all you want but stadia was bloody amazing
there s literally no fuss
i haven t seen a stadia or heard anything about stadia in like how far back was
will someone please give op attention for the ouya
with all the hate stadia got i actually played single player games on it and it worked pretty well i also tried destiny and division and it wasn t bad either i d say the tech is indeed revolutionary for the folk that have low end pcs or laptops i tested a little bit of xbox streaming nvidia sony and shadow i d say out of all cloud gaming shadow performs the best and allows you to connect vr headsets too but it is a pricey service to have for the long run xbox streaming worked best on mobile with the controller it s handy if you commute a lot you can sit on a train and play xbox games on your phone plus it comes with xbox pass perks sony has the worst cloud gaming imo on the bright side i got like over refund and a free controller once stadia got shut down not a bad investment controller came as part of the deluxe game purchase which got refunded
there s a fuss about this
it worked very well if you had a good connection the best part was no waiting for updates or downloads instant access from anywhere it s absolutely where gaming is going but typical of google they half committed to it in hopes someone would buy it at an inflated value
people talked tons of shit about stadia but it was my favorite platform as someone who also owns a series x and a switch cloud gaming is great no downloads no system uploads no game updates etc click to buy a game in the app and it s available to play in a couple seconds it was really great xcloud has not worked as well for me but i m excited for it to get better
you re finally awake
nice only months too late enjoy
it s a very good controller my main gamepad for pc now that s free
one of the best returns on investment into gaming i ve had
it s a nice controller not gonna lie
you just got yourself the best fking pc controller there is once you go through the process of converting it to bluetooth which is really simple you got yourself a great controller
makes a decent bluetooth controller for your steamdeck
laughs in ouya
if internet explore was a gamer
oooh i ve got some bad news my boy
cool dude my ouya gets here tomorrow
rip
this is just so sad
that ll look great next to your ouya
use my stadia controller for amazon luna now lol
tiny bit late but you ve got the spirit so i love it enjoy
i never used stadia but got the kit from the youtube premium promotion love the controller
what fuss
well you goofed up they stopped supporting stadia for a few months now
spongebob meme how do we tell him
who s gonna tell em
all the fuss there s no fuss lol
the controller s pretty good
honestly my favorite controller everything except the d pad feels so amazing
ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
give it up for stadia user number
this is like the internet explorer of gaming posts
well right now a decent gamepad and a chromecast months ago it worked quite well though
works great as a bluetooth controller for pc no luck with apple tv though
at least the controller still sorta works
is this service still active
it was cool when it worked but the pricing model was a flaming dumpster fire
it s a great pc game controller that google sent me for free
remember to update the controller so you can use it via bluetooth with your pc or smartphone
just remember you need an aol account first
nice controller very nice
that s a cool paperweight
oh man bro you just you just missed it
oh no
forget about stadia you need an ouya if you re serious about gaming
make sure to connect your 56k modem to it for best results
while an obvious joke the controller is pretty damn good imo so if you can still get it to work on your pc or whatever it wouldn t be that bad a purchase
man s ordered it thru windows
this post was made by internet explorer
damn i didnt know you could order corpses online
about that
should we tell them
internet explorer about to learn about stadia
i was genuinely gutted when they cancelled stadia i d just got my year old son into elder scrolls online using a crappy laptop and streaming the game so we could play together going to have to fork out for another gaming machine now
i got one for free back when google was giving them away i was planning to sell it eventually but i think that window might have passed lmao
why did stadia fail were as nvidia geforce streaming seems to have a completely opposite community view
uh should we tell him
honestly this is one of the most comfortable controllers i ve ever used google released a bluetooth update that allows you to use this controller with virtually any device that accept bluetooth input
i remember getting in to arguments with people in these related subs about how stadia was great and why would i want a pc or a console there s no input lag it s amazing ded
you are about to have so much fun live stream it for us
brought to you by internet explorer
isn t the fuss canceled
i would totally expect to see this post on r patientgamer
who s gonna tell him
i assume you ll be buying a ticket for the titanic next
stadia want a bad platform it was mainly due to how no one trusts google to keep things running long term
jokes aside google releasing a patch to turn these into useable bluetooth controllers was pretty decent of them and the controller itself is actually pretty good especially if you caught that deal a couple years back where google was giving a whole setup controller and chromecast ultra away for free
does it work with sega channel
back in my days that would ve been a great slowpoke meme
there was never a fuss lol
wow i read about that while i was surfing the world wide web earlier
aww this makes me sad i loved stadia i also got to do some work for it and was really proud of the work i did
lmao but no for real what are you using it for is it just a good controller i m in the market for a good wireless one for my pc i was thinking of getting one of the new xbox ones with the dongle
slowpoke jpg
ahh yes the controller i still havent opened after i got it for free
the controller looks really cool ngl
i use mine with amazon luna
stadia was awesome and their controllers still are even bought all the remaining colors after they shut down these controllers are the best
who s gonna tell him
alt binaries gaming said it s worth a look
in i ordered the founders edition of google stadia they cancelled it days later because they couldn t confirm parts of my information thanks google can t believe you fucked up google glass stadia search and soon youtube
how can judges even agree that they own the name monster or the colors white and green for logo s it s ridiculous it s time i make a brand named the and sue everyone who uses the in their brand gamename or whatever better make my logo red and white so i own red logo s now and sue coca cola later if they dont notice
lfmao it s a year old dead game with people all time peak and like concurrent players at most talk about being petty
there is monster hunter too why aren t they saying anything to them they are just bully well im glad i dont even like their crappy drink
how long til gaming youtubers twitch streamers and other public influencers drop monster as a sponsor for this blatant anti gaming fuckery never
google god s and monsters name change ubisoft monster energy already have previous with this and need to get stuffed ubisoft rolled over and changed the name to immortals fenyx rising rather than fight it in court absolute bollocks
they don t own the word so why is this even a thing
turns out the christians were right about monster tm all along
what monsters oops i said it now i m in trouble
that s that s a joke right
someone is made at their mom for calling the enemies in goldeneye monsters when they were a kid monster will never be used in video games again if they have it their way the drink was named sarcastically for this reason
wait until they find out about the monster hunter games
my mom tried to start a high school student a pre college advising company with the name froshmonster and they did the same thing threatened with litigation until she was forced to change the name she may have won the suit but didn t have enough money to pay for the legal fees the legal team at monster holds a special place in hell
profit profit profit
lol bro that is funny oh by the way sin
this is almost as bad as lay s suing farmers for growing their special potato crop
they are going after a small company that can t fight back to set up a precedent this will then be used in cases against larger companies
they wont monster are using the legal system to bully other actors thats it monster is way to general to trademark like that if we were talking about a drink and some other company made a drink with monster in the name maybe but even then my guess is no unless it was an energy drink hell if jack daniels https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165445243/supreme-court-jack-daniels) case where a dog toy manufacturer made a litteral jack daniels chewing toy bottle is close enough for the supreme court to take it this should be nowhere close
what judge has agreed that they own the name monster or the colors white and green
it doesn t really matter who would likely win when it s a large company with it s own legal department vs a small team the small team cannot afford an extended legal battle and there is possibility they could lose which would sink them prey for the gods had the same problem they just had to roll over and change the name because they couldn t afford to delay the game and fight for the name in court
but if they win they get a case precedent they could use to go after monster hunter and essentially extort capcom for a ton of money
coke goes after smaller companies expecting them to cave the smaller companies can t afford long court battles they won t go after capcom because capcom is big and the case will easily be dismissed
hell go after disney they made a game for monsters inc
i gotta say tho immortals fenyx rising is a much better name still bs tho
beat me to it
that s their goal target someone who can t fight back to set up precedent for a bigger case and bigger
any beverage of any sort would be infringing if they used the name monster even if they re not making energy drinks specifically that would cause what the law calls market confusion it would also probably apply to any type of food that s sold in the same spaces as monster energy drinks like for example a candy bar named monster
that was a fun read lol in my opinion jack danieles would make more by not hiring the lawyer no one is going to pick up a dumb toy and be like omg fuck jack daniels its poo if anything the toy prob would make people laugh and maybe even make them think of the j d people at the top of companies are nuts its a diff world
since the tm for monster hunter precedes the one from monster i seriously doubt it
i highly doubt monster hunter isnt already trademarked
capcom would tell them to get fucked
nah not really how that works
that and the fact that the game existed before the drink
til capcom is bigger than ubisoft
yeah i would imagine it depends though if they call it just monster sure if they make a candy bar called monster chocolate with similar colours probably as well if they made an alchoholic drink called beer for monsters though probably not which would be way closer to what they were doing with the video game title
but if they re selling the jd toy there s a risk to their brand if someone s dog chokes and dies and people think that the toy was some official jd merchandise if anything the toy prob would make people laugh and maybe even make them think of the j d right and if dogs start dying they think of jd in a negative way which harms their brand thousands of people playing with their dogs using the toy isn t news worthy but one single death ruins any meager positive benefits
damn wouldn t it be funny if this 180d on them and capcom sued them for using the word monster
at the time ubisoft was almost bankrupt
was the safety of the dog toy in question i didnt know that was a thing also if that did occur i am pretty sure it still wouldnt affect jd sales cause its basically solved by saying the toy was not associated with or endorsed by jd
capcom using the uno reverse card on monster
oh that changed
to a lawyer it s always in question they didn t make the toy and can t vouch for its safety or quality so why take the risk
well jd wouldnt have to be worried about a lawyer as they have nothing to do with the toy the toy manufacturer would jd would only have to be worried about any pr fallout associated with the toy though i dont think this one would fall back on jd i think people would hardly if at all make the association
jd has lawyers on staff whose job it is to send cease desist letters for brand related issues just like this some dog dies it gets out in the news that it was a jack daniels toy the dog choked on people start selling their shares of the company anticipating the dog owner suing for millions the value plummets and investors take a loss then it s reported that it wasn t their toy shareholders sue because the company did nothing to mitigate its exposure to this risk now the company has to defend a shareholder suit for tens of millions of dollars which even if they prevail is likely to cost millions to defend anyways they would make more by not hiring the lawyer is a fairly naive opinion
sure but tbh if i saw my lawyers worried about this i think id start laying some off instead of having them on my team full time
and that s why you re not in charge of the legal team at jack daniels
who
definately
capcom are bethesda fans confirmed s no but seriously it does look like vault boy

the first step in solving a problem is recognizing there is one
wow that s dedication some hardcore gaming in there
are you doing ok
running a file server is easier and takes less resources than a game server
it s because of financial security protocols that s the answer it s hard to keep up to date on security especially on legacy hardware and legacy stores systems basically it ll cost a lot to keep security up to date also if there ever is a security breach and say peoples cc details are stolen that s a huge problem for nintendo so better to avoid the risk
specifically because they don t like you
becasue they want to shut it down stopping purchases means new people won t join and people will eventually move from the platform till only a handful of people remain they can shut it down for good
i believe there are two main reasons one of which is understandable the other less so nintendo has been running the 3ds wiiu servers for years now with the current switch ecosystem as popular as it is and according to the leakers a new console not too far away it would stand to reason that supporting four different online systems is a bit too much xbox and ps have done the same with the and ps3 respectively now to the less than noble reason nintendo has a proven atrocious view of games preservation gutting a majority of its released titles from its legacy offerings nso has like of the actual library of the nes for example my estimate whatever games they do rerelease they charge far more than they should for said titles at various points and you know how they hate with a passion anyone who pirates their games ninty themselves have been accused and possibly caught using publicly available roms downloading them then reselling them to us for a pop a notable example was a super mario bros virtual console rom the closure of the eshops with no alternative way to obtain these games or is there is simply another notch in nintendo s belt in this regard
likely because you ll buy their other stuff anyway
i think there s legal expectations to support products sold for a number of years after it s last sale
it specifically says that online play is staying up for now it does only say foreseeable future which implies they know they will but not sure on when yet there may be more reasons but this does two big things first it gives more time to put out final patches and for people to download the things they want to keep second it helps with people that buy games near eol game servers going down days weeks after purchase vs months or years later one example of this would be the eu year warranty i imagine there would be grounds for a full refund if the game server was taken down within the years of purchase
this is probably the reason everything else is a valid reason but this is probably the business driven reason
full refund probably world of warcraft all expansions and playtime refunded that s gonna be a lot of money back
prince of persia the forgotten sands for the pc i am a massive pop fan ever since sands of time have played all the games and enjoyed almost all of them almost the forgotten sands was the most annoying buggy and shittiest piece of scatware i ever had the misfortune of installing on my poor hdd bought it brand new at release refused to install i e refused to run despite the disk being scratch free and everything so i did some magic like bored teens tend to do and after a few hours i finally got the installation running in danish whatever i tried the game refused to switch to any language but danish so guessing what options in the installation wizard meant what i managed to get it installed and tried to press play only for the game to forcequit itself as it tried to connect to the ubisoft servers took me days before i got fed up with that and i contacted the ubi soft helpdesk or whatever the equivalent back then explained the problems provided pictures of the gamecase the disk the cd key all of it all i got was that the cd key i provided was already in use that they would not help me install pirated software and that i would receive no further response so i spent of my country s currency on a brand new game in a reputable store it refuses to run use the correct language to install or to connect and ubi support decided that instead of helping me they should accuse me of being a thief and obtaining the game illegally so i did exactly that downloaded a crack to circumvent their servers so i could at least play the game yes i actually had to use illegal software to play my legally bought game and unfortunately the game was shit as well a lot of graphical glitches plenty of places where you would just fall through the level down into nothing a lot of crashes and a massive amount of gamebreaking bugs stalling progress during my playthrough it was a matter of principle at this point i had to resort to internetforums a grand total of times to obtain someone elses savegame after a certain point just because my game bugged out once again making it impossible to continue naturally this also for whatever reason fucked over the rpg power upgrade system because i obviously made different choices than the owners of the saves i had to borrow where it showed entirely different power ups than i actually had it was a shitty and miserable experience and i dislike ubisoft to this day because of it they did me and my poor prince dirty scarred for life
hmmm could i get back all the money i spent on league of legends skins if not that then maybe all the destiny purchases over the year

elden ring not saying it was bad just not as good as everyone said it was
elden ring good game overall as with most from software releases but i was duped by the hype bought it almost on lunch which is very expensive when taking my exchange rate into account tried to get into it but never could just not my type of game i suppose
the witcher it s a good game it s just not my kinda game i bought it on recommendation from a friend and rave reviews i just can t get into it
cyberpunk the game was completely broken the story lacked meaningful decisions impacts and wasn t for me for its direction
dying light such a disappoiting sequel
sekiro fuck that ridiculously hard game i like a challenge not the feeling of hopelessness
destiny i bought it when it was then i took it back to exchange it because it only took me a day to beat they told me they d give me store credit and that i could keep it overall decent experience

red dead redemption bought it on steam the intro training for the multiplayer takes longer to get through than their hour return limit started getting harassed by hackers griefers didn t want to play it any more
anthem
warno i bought it because it s company eugen systems made several other single player games called like steel division and war games i loved warno said it had a single player mode so i bought it it actually doesn t it s still in beta today sorry early access and is absolutely crappy a second loser is bannerlord bought it in early access thinking warbands was good and feel like i ate a poison apple
battlefield oh my god i hate past me
i like how you re thinking of the most economical refund
no better answer than this lol
yup does this include tokens for gold as well because that s a hell of a lot of money
what berry said
same i thought i was getting a spiritual successor to marvel ultimate alliance and instead got an okay brawler with mobile game mechanics slapped on the campaign wasn t terrible but when i realized it was just a glorified tutorial for the endgame grinding i got bummed out and haven t gone back since launch week debating revisiting it for the extra story dlc just to try and recoup some of the initial cost of buying the damn thing
seconded
but elden ring was good
i think a lot of people would share that sentiment it seemed kinda socially marketed as a souls game for a wider audience everybody should just go play sekiro tbh best from game
thankfully for me when i accidentally bought a souls like game steam refunded it i thought based on the photos on the website it was a turn based so the shock was nasty when it very much wasn t
absolute same i like most of the other games in this genre and by all rights should have adored the witcher but i just cannot get into it at all every time i try to play it i just sigh
i have the trilogy i always intended to play all in order since i figured that made sense i cannot for the life of me complete the first game without giving up and getting bored out of my gourd
i luckily got the full refund from sony on launch for ps4 i was so let down i couldn t play more than minutes without it freezing
respectfully i m downvoting you
i just dislike western genre games in general despite this i got pretty far into rdr2 just because there s something for everyone there it s not a game i d replay but it s not a refund worthy one i really hate westerns though
someone hasn t played it recently
i actually agree while i didn t hate mm it was just too different from oot felt like a different dev made it the time constraint wasn t for me
lol i forgot that actually got a release finally
why don t you just play it then the game you were expecting when you bought it wasn t finished at launch but it pretty much is now whatever trailer sold you on the game is actually a decent representation of its current state why be bitter
no man s sky is beyond finished at this point hello games have released more free content for that game then some games get as paid
not mass effect but the one that was so great it led to a trilogy
yeah brink was a steamer
i ve played a lot of games going back to nes this was the first actual game that had a game breaking bug at the end of the final level only one save and character was stuck i used the halo case to smash this disc into pieces i deeply regretted choosing this as one of the three games that came with my xbox launch day bundle
thirded
if someone cant handle elden ring with all the crutches that game throws at you what makes you think they can handle a game like sekiro which is actively the most difficult fromsoft game ever made
elden ring is ten times easier and accessible than sekiro what are you on about mate
while i completely that the gaming industry needs to be held more accountable for releasing unfinished games these days i think this is more because letting go of bitterness also means letting go of the feeling that these people owe you something and a lot of people dont want to do that
i m sorry but i ve tried to play me1 multiple times but it just puts me to sleep
no offense but mass effect 1s age is showing i returned to it again with the new collectors edition and ugh it s a good story admittedly but the gameplay is lacking hard you also don t really feel the impact of choices as much as you d think and the planetary exploration which felt great becomes lame when you realize how little there is to it even the decisions feel kinda lame few decisions impact the first game at all with the implications they d do so later da series does this well but mass effect decisions never seem to matter save wrex
the biased is strong with this one if you learn the cheese mechanics sekiro is a joke
the person said they just couldn t get into elden ring and that it was over hyped not talking about can t handle also while difficulty is subjective elden ring was way harder to me than sekiro
i agree that this buy our early access for trend is cancer but hello games made amends they owed everyone the game they promised that s what they owed this guy too in that promise is fulfilled they made that game and they didn t push microtransactions every update has been free someone who bought day one has as much content as someone who bought today so um yeah dude needs to just play the game and chill
run around and spam block
biased facts dont care about your feelings
he s a bad troll all he does is say shitty things in gaming subs i agree a game i think is hard might be a breeze for another gamer
i see only facts
please stop eating the paint chips
thanks for liking my comments
im calling cihild protection services
i bet you loved writing that title
is famicom the nes i think ive seen that game but get confused between that and earthbound and im never sure where to start
congrats beating mother is a very hard thing to do i attempted the same but mother beat me right back i never tried again
it s good but very overhyped one playthrough is enough
mother is called earthbound begginings on the nes vc earthbound is actually mother
earthbound beginnings is mother earthbound is mother the famicom is the japanese version of the nes and difference between the two is the nes cannot save games and needs special cartridges while the famicom can save by itself a lot more rpgs were on famicom than nes
mother is the first one also known as earthbound beginings nes famicom mother is known as earthbound snes mother is only known as mother gameboy advanced i recommend dont need to have played imo
wow thats pretty confusing for those not in the know i guess i know where to start now lol
can t wait for all the comments saying how trash the game is
happy birthday is your girlfriend single
happy birthday your gf deserves nice things for sure i really hope you enjoy pokemon violet i have really enjoyed it on my oled
i feel like girlfriends and wives giving their boyfriends and husbands video game consoles is a common theme on this sub common enough to make me skeptical of the veracity of half of them
the oled is clean af as well
just note there are many version exclusives if you have discord dm me on reddit so i can give that to you i know someone with a finished scarlet save
awe she s the sweetest make sure to catch her a shiny or two
now that s a keeper make sure to treat her right
you didn t post a picture of yourself holding it up with your mouth open as wide as possible what s the point
sorry this has to be your re introduction to pokemon
if you like that one get pokemon arceus
just so you know there s a recent bug where your pokmon scarlet violet save data might get corrupted for no apparent reason but there s a fix apparently you can just start a new file on a different profile save as soon as you can go right back to the old one and it ll be fixed don t know how that works but i ve been hearing it around
primals in scarlet are way better fight me
she must hate you then
get literally any other game
pokmon may have gotten a little laggier since you last played just prepare yourself
if you haven t played in years you ll be excited to know that the gameplay hasn t changed a single bit in the last years the graphics and some other things have gotten worse though
not a fan of the new pokemon games they are pretty bad
congrats on playing the best pokemon gen in a long time the well of content dries out once you the pokedex and do gym rematches final tourney
i m jealous happy birthday man
congrats i was super excited about violet being someone that had played and thoroughly enjoyed every pokemon game including shield however violet was mid at best at least botw2 is coming out next month
i also got violet i put it down but recently picked it back up this week i wish the towns had more of a story to them besides eating but i love how lost you can get in the game the world is so big and you could spend hours just in one province
i m years old and have played pokemon since a wee tyke pokemon scarlet and violet are my favorite pokemon game now i have never fallen in love with a cast of characters in a pokemon game as fast as this one i sincerely hope you enjoy the game
ooooof what a 1st game to get hope you like resolution at 12fps
let s goo system with some of the best exclusive games under the sun
my girlfriend did the exact same for me several years back
awful first game but switch oled is awesome
ooh you ll like the switch there s some mad stuff on it it s great pokmon violet itself is a pretty good game
she s a keeper
welcome back to the fold maybe you have an amazing adventure
congrats also i did not realize how clean the white looks for the switch good choice on her part
if i were you i would check your local library for switch games ours does free rentals and they have hundreds of games for every console
brotha put a ring on that finger soon
everyone s saying violet is pretty rough i m about to get my first switch and i too want to get back into pokmon what would my best option be the last time i played was pokmon xd on the gamecube which was also my last nintendo console so any suggestions are greatly appreciated
happy birthday
happy birthday i really enjoyed my time in pokemon scarlet i hope you have a good time as well edit typo
nice remember to get breath of the wild
i have had endless amounts of fun in violet my husband has scarlet and he did too i liked these much better than sword and shield have fun and happy birthday
may i suggest pokemon legends arceus
op congrats on your new console and new game i m sorry there s so much negativity on this feed this pokmon game is insanely fun you re gonna have a great time with it violet is the better version this board can fight me
you certainly do have a very nice girlfriend it s just to bad the game sucks
poor mates gonna be sad after that pile of shat game but regardless i hope he can muster some enjoyment out of it enjoy the switch m8
i have a ps5 a pc i built a gaming laptop and a nintendo switch i also have a year old so the switch is what i play the most and in bed i love my switch and i hope you love yours
you re in for a treat i m sure you ve heard mixed reviews about it but for me it s still been the most immersive pokemon game i ve played and i played over 10x the hours than i ve put into any other pokemon game
she got you what s probably the worst pokemon to date awesome
i really hope you enjoy the game though it s many problems i would have gotten pla but its the thought that counts
remind yourself everyday of what you have
deleted
nice enjoy
it s an ok game in my opinion it would be better if the open world had more to do the raids could be better as well if the online and performance was actually good after playing legends i can safely say it s the superior game and i highly recommend picking it up
great game superior color if you like it try arceus it s even better
she gonna need a ring after all that weird to be downvoted for saying to marry her lol
how long have you been with her if you re in the year range it might be time to start talking about and considering marriage dude
why would she get a game from a franchise you haven t played in a very long time
marry her bro
nice
r pictureofthebox
happy bday but how the heck are you buying that woah or i guess she
aside from the glitches which are mostly just funny and harmless the game is alright will last you a long time if you explore the map often hope you enjoy it x200b if you find a shiny please nickname it after the amount of pokemon you own at that point in the game
i could never get into pokemon the battling is so boring and catching them all never appealed to me
love that game but if you have any nostalgic pokemon memories get let s go pikachu or eevee amazing experience
it s super awesome ignore the lake and it s horrible lag and it s legit a crazy jump from previous pokmon games i had a blast playing it stuck around for some event pokmon now i m waiting for the dlc
it s a very different game now for me playing violet after my last game being pokemon black it was a bit of a shock but i m liking it now
words marry that woman no matter the game it s the action that counts
i am genuinely happy for you and hope you have a great time however though it s terrible this warning is needed for a pokemon title do not buy the dlc yet doing so can permanently destroy your save
not to bash op but i was one of those kids who was never really sure what game i wanted for christmas so my mom had to do a lot of research she would stay up late after we went to bed and read and watch reviews of games that were coming out soon sometimes i would wake up and see her asleep at the computer mom im grateful you didn t let me play shit games as a kid
dont lie you bought it yourself
if she loved you she d of got the new zelda pack
i don t want to be the cock block here but if your memory of pokmon games is like ruby sapph or even gold silver this game might be quite a let down for you
you have the richest gf
the saddest part of this post haven t played pokmon in years just that statement hurts it also hurts that your coming back into pokmon with one of the worst pokmon games ever made in my opinion probably would have got legends arceus to get someone back into it that game is awesome
you mean yourself
game is mediocre at best lol
steam deck is better just emulate pokmon violet lmaoooo
if he knows what you like he cares about you
man she must really hate you to gift you a switch
i also recommend arceus it is the first pokemon game i have played since the second generation and is nearlyeverything i ever wanted in a modern pokemon game i just wish they would make a modern 3d version of gold silver that would be amazing
you are very lucky dude
you re going to have so much fun palafin is the coolest new pokemon
i ve been treated so horribly my whole life whenever i see posts like these my brain immediately suggests it s so she can keep me occupied while she goes and fucks all my friends until i ve got none left lol
stop what you re doing and immediately go get breath of the wild play it none stop until tears of the kingdom drops and then buy it then play totk none stop no need to thank me
uhhh huh gf
i call cap no woman would associate with a nintendo person
yes yes you do and happy birthday today you made thousands of men jealous
hope you bought from gamestop
strange how the oled box shows the switch in docked mode not making use of the oled hmmm
that s awesome the mrs got me one of the launch versions a few months after it dropped way back in maybe i should talk to her about an oled lmaoo
miraidon is op
oled nice did you have to drop hints or did she just get it on her own i dropped hints for wife so she d get me a graphics card
returning player after all these years of time playing this game i have the same question wtf is that a pokemon or some enchanted object
happy birthday fellow april 5ther
my gf would have got me the same thing if she cared about me
i got a switch oled and pokemon violet for christmas i m sure you ll love it
i just read pokmon violent
happy birthday to you and many more
the oled is king the full length kickstand is killer plus the screen is gorgeous
that s awesome the last one i played was ultra sun because i don t have a switch i feel like that one was kind of a miss but i still had fun either way
download hades when you re done with pokmon it s a lot of fun
what makes it one or the worst games ever that s a tall order babylon falls anthem

really interesting data i feel like the cpu frequency requirement is a bit misleading because of multi core cpus going mainstream maybe around
link to the full dashboard where you can interact with and filter data https://public.tableau.com/views/theevolutionofpcgaming25yearsofsystemrequirements/dashboard1?:language=en-us&publish=yes&:display\_count=n&:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/theevolutionofpcgaming25yearsofsystemrequirements/dashboard1?:language=en-us&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) notes only mainstream aaa titles were selected using games from each year that represent pc requirements that year i ignored remasters non native ports indie and multiplayer games as they were usually non representative i have chosen median instead of average because average would give illogical values for memory sizes ex ram and also because the data isn t normally distributed so is more suitable as it is less prone to outliers the data was collected manually by me using steam official page https://www.sysrequirements.com](https://www.sysrequirements.com) and https://www.game-debate.com](https://www.game-debate.com) as these are the most reliable sources for pc requirements it took me long time effort and research to collect all these data using a mix of these sources and also manually verifying data for old games as there weren t very accurate or not available all in some cases there was a dataset that included thousands of thousands of requirements data but it was not very accurate and missing a lot of data so i had to do it all manually so i would appreciate giving the dashboard an upvote on tableau and nominating in for viz of the day if you think it deserves to
wtf caused the spike in ram size requirement in
nice can we get a log scale to see the small values
where s the comment op i wanna know more
i m upgrading in about years i m ok with my 3900x and might go super high end though for my next build to make it last longer
i remember when i had a 10gb hard drive i honestly thought it was future proof why get more when you simply would never use that much games were like 200mb lmao
the data is really interesting one thing though is that pc hardware has improved exponetially as well it jumps because 100mb of ram was fine and cost the same as 8gb today
the sudden spike around is insane
frequency also has little to do with cpu performance and is only a valid metric to compare similar sku cpus or cpus from the same architecture i assure you that my 5ghz i5 2500k does not rival an i9 13900k in single thread tasks
limiting your data to games per year is a bit small of a data set don t you think
maybe the release of windows
the small values were old games from before or something like you can filter the years to only show old games here is the link whet you can interact with the charts https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mahmoud1925/viz/theevolutionofpcgaming25yearsofsystemrequirements/dashboard1
also interesting would be of ram
sorry i was typing it you can check it now
i kinda agree with you i thought about that too but the thing is games tend to require almost the same requirements so i thought adding more data won t change alot but i might be wrong also the process of gathering the data was tedious and it didn t seem worth it to me so i stuck with
jump in to higher requirements is simple games were holded back due to piss poor performance of xbox ps3 x200b well there vere only handfull of pc games which needed really high requriments but since most games sell on all platforms so baseline is console hardware limits
also might be consoles both the xbone and ps4 didn t fully release internationally until feb and it may take time to adjust to new consoles
thanks yes i get it i just thought a log scale that went 16gb 8gb 4gb 2gb mb would make sense since it looks like it has seen an exponential increase over time
i d expect it to be have gotten cheaper at least for the minimum requirement
fair enough and you did go back to so that is quite a lot of games in total
i was gonna comment that this would be a better visualization than having an axis with major lines being gb anyway because that s not typically a number that s used
staring from to yeah a hefty load of data i also added each gpu and cpu name but i saved them for future charts but you can see them in the data in tableau
winter update removed ability to touch grass
i played elden ring for a good levels before i noticed i was touching grace
the game is rogue tower
hey mods can we please have a mandatory game name now to post it d be nice to know the games that people are posting without having to necessarily comment what game
best part is that someone wrote that from an air conditioned office
at least they aren t telling you to turn off the game and get some air like some games in the past have done
give me the ability to smoke grass and we ll talk
spring we re still getting snow
patch added grass allergies
why is reddit so obsessed with this stupid fucking phrase
i guess this function call command line to shutdown pc
what game
rouge tower i saw this yesterday too
based devs
now do autumn for the hemispherically challenged
i m so glad to hear that you found what you needed from the devs keep on pushing forward and never give up on your goals
reminds me of the stanley parable achievement that you could only get if you don t play the game for years
a while now would you say it s worth it
sorry devs some people have water restrictions in place
unfortunately there is a random chance your character could have the debuff allergy grass
not even in a game i m allergic to grass pollen
touching grass is extremely underrated
ahhh just what i needed
me walked outside for like five minutes came back in had a major allergic reaction out of nowhere had to take allergy relief a shower and then lay down
or just go outside
who needs to go outside when you can touch grass in game
ussr update grass touches you
it s the summer here in the ph and i ve burnt my skin trying to touch very tall grass
but all those annoying bugs in since alpha that they say have been fixed a dozen times are still there thanks devs
find it rally annoying how some many use touch grass as a gaslighty insult then again most of y all probably aren t legal adult yet
not sure when touch grass entered the lexicon but i view it as being essentially an objective intelligence test if you say go get some sun or go outside that s above average iq if you say touch grass guaranteed moron
stuff like this makes me think i m the only gamer who also has outdoor hobbies
so the eating of the grass comes after this update or no
i don t understand things like this just go outside and touch some grass
i really can t stand gen z and their phrases
give me an update that allows me to touch a ungroomed bush in the spring a trimmed bush in the summer and a barren bush in the fall and winter and you ll have a fan for life
r outside
i wonder if more games have that feature
r outside
me touches grass
ww
mindblowing
wink wink nudge nudge say no more say no more https://gfycat.com/agileindelibleannelid)
i can touch grass year round
reminds me of ac origins
it s bugged in sweden it worked when the update first dropped but the grass is no longer touchable at time of writing
what app is this i also want to touch grass
another update coming ability to feel the grass
please do not the grass
plot twist this causes the device to shut off
when is this update coming to outside the snow doesn t seem to be melting
thanks now i have another come back for the chronically online people on twitter
not for me there is still five flipping feet of snow
i do not need my seasonal allergies to be harassing me both within and outside of the game enable toggling please
touch grass has a hidden debuff dog poop hidden blended in
that gamemode through me in a loop
but when you see any patch of grass there s a sign don t walk on the grass
destiny also has an emote where the onscreen message says player touches grass
what game is this
what game
bro the atpmic heart loading advice essentially telling you to go out and touch grass when i first saw those i thought it was funny as hell
what game is this is it r outside or something else
i haven t seen grass since october
next update made air more invisible
ah that great pass time of touching grass the only interaction grass around here deserves is being cut in a most violent manner
tried it life is still shit and i still hate everyone
is this real i hope so
destiny made it an emote i love it
r outside
they should have added the ability to hug trees
as someone who is horribly allergic to grass i approve
can you touch grass you can touch grass on this game
i need to know what game this is now
pass on the grass
meanwhile the tires still feel like ice
destiny recently got a touch grass emote too
r outside is leaking
just play grounded then your doing more than just touching the grass your building an entire house out of it
right now winter is freezing rain
touching yes what about smoking
what s the game
r outside
which game is this i need this ability
what game
now i just need to wait for the update for fire emblem engage that lets lapis eat the grass one step closer
knowing a person who lives on his duel monitor this is definitely needed for some of you thick boys
this is an ability that certain basement dwellers will never achieve
r outside
what game is this
wait for the update that allows you to touch cloth
update added the ability to touch cloth
lol
what game is this i need to know
nice
better than having the ability to touch cloth
reddit humour
i ll remain inside as i m allergic to grass
am allergic to grass um cheers
what game was this lmao
ah gawd my weaknesses
there was a mario movie released back in the day it s considered one of the worst movies ever made a tie in might have had a digitized live action mario lol but for the current movie i m shocked nintendo didn t try to do anything tie in maybe they wanted to test the waters with movies again before committing to spending their own money on related stuff like a game or dlc there will definitely be a sequel and i m sure nintendo will do more things related to that movie
yes i will play any mario game that s a platformer
why not just say top lol

i d recommend doing the ground zeroes missions first
make sure you have a lot of time slotted for gaming when you start the first mission takes a couple hours and metal gear solid games have tons of cutscenes
sit back and relax first hour or so is essentially an interactive cutscene if you are confused about the plot don t worry it is a kojima game and doesn t make sense anyway you can play lethal or non lethal and as far as stealth goes this game is both forgiving and harsh that ll make sense the more you play when you unlock a certain inflatable device use it every chance you get other than that experiment and have fun
when they start talking about a disease outbreak at your base pay attention to what they are saying and do not ignore the problen you ll thank me later if you make it that far
this was my first metal gear as well i really liked it after the brutally sluggish opening sequence the first 3rds of the game were all time great but the last part gets a little weird and repetitive probably due to kojima warring with konami at the time
im playing throught it rn the game is good few things i dislike but i just use mods to fix them shame they didn t allow kojima to finish the game
it is honestly better that way the gameplay is top notch but story wise eeeeeeh
so you haven t played any mgs game but you ve played the first mgs game makes sense either way enjoy the game just playing with op haha
play ground zeroes first i won t spoil the mother base epidemic bit and its solution but it has something to do with the language also fully level quiet because she s the best companion
story isn t all that great but the gameplay is fantastic
if you like hitman then this game might make you cum a bit
want some advice just play the game nerd quit looking for attention
don t play to finish play to enjoy
i cant imagine mgs5 being my introduction to the series i d have never touched it again
it s not a bad game in the series it s just incomplete
im interested to see how you will take the story if you go by chronological order metal gear ps2 metal gear peace walker psp ps3 metal gear ps4 metal gear msx metal gear solid snake msx metal gear solid ps1 metal gear solid sons of liberty ps2 ps3 metal gear solid guns of the patriots ps3 obviously you dont have to buy them all you can watch a youtube of someone playing through them but im curious if the story will hit different since you started close to the origins
is mgsv as repetitive as it seemed when i played it just seemed to be mission base stuff mission rinse repeat
while the gameplay of is good it fails to be a good metal gear solid game in my opinion my personal favorite is but looking at mainline games my best to worst would be
ground zeros first listen to the tapes the phantom pain listen to the tapes and the chatter of your troops on base they will fill you in on backstory if possible try to play mgs3 snake eater

first gz then phantom ok thanks
i m currently finishing ac odyssey playing the dlcs right now and horizon fw playing some side missions i left after the main story so once i finish one of those two i ll start with metal gear solid v
the games do make sense and have a heavy political statement most times there s many hidden meanings etc as well
yes i read that kojima makes different type of games than the rest so i m looking forward to see what s all the fuss about first hour or so is essentially an interactive cutscene i don t mind i mean as long as i enjoy what i m watching but before jumping in into this game i ll try to get info about the plot i already saw a few gameplays of this game and it looked very fun that s why i bought it hopefully i can connect with the story too
your first too any trouble with the story
i mean it was so long ago since i played metal gear that i really don t remember the story i have a vague memory of the gameplay
if looking for attention is making a post on reddit then man it must be very tough for you being on this app lol
damn v is one of the first chronological speaking i guess then i m gonna check info about mg3 and peace walker before starting v thanks for your list it helps me where to start
that s kinda a weird way to look at it just because you have a home base the game is repetitive you could break down any game like that pretty much every game is missions quests non mission stuff repeat
from the view of someone only ever playing the first and not remembering much though the story won t make a lick of sense i mean you will probably be able to get the blatant political messages those are usually pretty in your face and in the dialogue every thing else though will be just an experience of what especially when you first wake up that part still doesn t make sense to me and i ve played the whole game haha
it s good i enjoyed it i had played the other mgs games sporadically throughout the years never really finished them i had played ground zeroes the prequel to phantom pain i highly recommend playing as well and enjoyed it so much i was very much excited for the next one honestly even if you aren t invested in the story is one of the best stealth action sandboxes i have played you can approach the same mission in so many different ways and use a different set of tools each time honestly i am glad i have it installed cause now i m itching to play hahha
i ve played a few more metal gear games since and leaned that no matter what you re always going to have some trouble with the story eventually kojima likes to make things weird that said ground zeros and v are prequels to the majority of the metal gear series so it works decently as an entry point i just missed some references but the plot was as understandable as it could be
i get it but i m just teasing unfortunately it doesn t pass off well in text
this actually takes place before
did you play metal gear or metal gear solid
metal gear or metal gear solid metal gear solid is technically metal gear afaik there were two bit games released before the playstation game
it takes place shortly after the events of peace walker trick is you need to also know what happed in mg3 but as other pointed out its a kojima game and its not suppused to make sense ive been playing since the 90s and i replay them periodically and still missing some pieces enjoy the game its a great one but if you felt that you want to know whats going on ill edit the post to include years of release and console
since you haven t played the other games you won t understand the beginning meaning
nono is fine
really oh that s a cool detail
there were metal gears i m fucked uhm i don t know i played one that was released for ps1 let me search on youtube if i can find the one i played
i mean i know the basics pyscho mantis was the smaller dude the guy on fire i think was another character from a past game you play as the first boss from the original metal gear games before the solid was there then the flaming sky whale throws me for a loop though
basically timeline is peace walker
i think the sky whale is a reference to moby dick games the gag studio kojima made to throw people off the making of mgs also more likely it s a literal moby dick reference
the whale is a reference to moby dick this is a subtle way of saying half the characters in mgsv are really really angry and want revenge
that sounds pretty kojima honestly i loved the mission in ground zeroes when you just save him lol
you know you s but it could be haha kojima loves literary references and the first npc you meet when you wake up does say call me ishmael flash forward to the end and snake is definitely consumed in his anger and grief
he does all kinds of funny hilarious and wacky shit he s one of my all time favorite developers and mgs is my all time favorite game series best game being mgs3 if you think that s funny mgs has some hilarious codec dialogue hidden dialogue that s great one good one being if you eat a glowing mushroom and ask the paramedic about how it charged your batteries they think your literally crazy i recommended playing it if you ever can do that it s older and slightly clunky but it plays fine and is an overall great game i ve probably finished the game maybe times no joke
dammit the s was a mistake need to edit it out i agree it was a real reference to moby dick
i mean i ve played the others i think the first i ve played was mgs2 on the ps2 just never beat any except v and revengance i own the complete collection so they are definitely on my list to complete even have the og metal gear and with it so that ll be fun i also love kojima s style some of his works are a bit out there death stranding was just batshit crazy from beginning to end but they are guaranteed to just be fun to play after some rough beginnings anyway
you know all this talk about mgsv just makes me want to play again i think i still have quiet in a cage so i have that to look forward to if i go back haha
oh yea of course he makes awesome games that for sure aren t for everyone but you ll be glad you played them if you do they have a very intricate and detailed story you have to try to understand it s not just explained to you like like mgs all have direct meanings being meme gene scene sense
mass effect fans and community were so passionate and fun that i wrote fanfiction then began narrating it and now i write original novels and narrate audiobooks
the fallout series cemented my love for 1940s 1950s music i m often cruising around in my car listening to peggy lee bing crosby frank sinatra etc and it s because of fallout

cities skylines and city planning i often look at different overpass designs traffic flow structures etc things i never noticed before i now have strong opinions about parts of my city are really old and badly planned throughout the years they have been rebuilding and replanning the city to make traffic more flowing and open up for city life its been really interesting to follow and nerd up on

purple is just the best color though
my approach to tasks and organization as well as drive all came from video games leveling up fetch quests and inventory mgmt are all things i use in my career and daily life
i have about history books from mary beard adrian goldsworthy tom holland not the spider man actor and edward gibbon along with some modern translations of works by historians like suetonius and livy thanks rome total war
if i didn t know my friends reddit username i d assume you were him everytime he gets the option he picks purple and its all due to saints row lol specifically saints row for me i guess it would be everything fantasy medieval going all the way back to golden axe
maybe it s a little recent to fit but x com made me absolutely obsessed with turn based strategy games of that kind i will literally get addiction itches and compulsively download one or two games of this type i already played i can say i played at least most of them surely all the mainstream ones from time to time last one i replayed was mutant year zero for the third time

pokmon has affected my life in a ton of ways
bubble bobble theme got me into writing music
gaming is my weird life long obsession
the world wars bf1 did this to me i become obsessed with great wars loved stories from that time and just learning about life from there i have no idea why maybe it s coz i felt like a ww1 solider charging into battle with my comrades in arms facing death or maybe it s just triggered my love for a time in life where i was studying the two great wars but it brought up a passion for learning a bunch of things from that period and my god i can get into the games to the point where i may shout when a player dies as i did not make it in time for a revive maybe there s something wrong with me but yeah
there some games that i only play when it s rainning i think it helps to set the mood for exemple castlevania sotn resident evil silent hill etc
the batman arkham games started my obsession with batman and superheroes in general when i was a kid i wasn t as interested in superheroes until after that game
the first star wars battlefront came out when i was in third or fourth grade and i remember thinking it looked cool from the trailers but i wasn t a big star wars fan yet it was the first rated t game my mom rented for me from hollywood video that game catapulted me into the world of star wars as i got invested in the movies books games toys and lore i ll always have a soft spot for that first game
fan fic the good ending
same
same here and i also collect bottle caps now even custom painted of em red and wrote nuka cola on em i tell people some day they ll be currency

i think he means this is the good ending of someone who starts writing fanfic i think normally fanfic writers end up writing massive amounts of pornography
nothing wrong with that okay sometimes lots wrong with that but still
buying any console for a single game especially a game that you ve never played any of the prior games and don t know if you ll like when you re not interested in any of the major benefits of that system seems like a pretty bad idea personally but you know how much a switch costs and you know how much the game will cost ultimately you have to decide is this worth that money for me to take a chance on but also how have you been playing games for three decades and never played a single nintendo game that s mind boggling
get a steam deck or wait for this asus handheld my wife and daughter have both they don t use their switch s anymore
i am a dude in his s who is mostly a pc gamer i got a switch for christmas and played it a good bit for a couple months haven t turned it on since march if i m in a gaming mood i ll be at my desk the couch is for turning my brain off i guess
as someone who buys nintendo consoles solely so i can play zelda titles if you re doing this just to play a zelda game that s a follow up to botw then it s prob not worth paying this price for a switch just wait for the next major nintendo console get a switch when they are cheaper and play the two in order maybe you ll be able to play these two on the next console but chances are you won t be able to play botw as soon as the next console arrives and the limited performance of the switch is true but isn t really an issue when it comes to nintendo made titles
maybe you can try first botw in the emulator so you can see if you like it do you have kids nintendo is usually pretty good on family friend games as well
i m in the camp of being doubtful a new switch is coming as soon as people think like maybe not for a couple more years bearing in mind that i m no expert if you do some reading and maybe think that s the case as well i d say go for it
switch hasn t been announced there aren t even leaks or credible rumors about it is it being worked on absolutely will it be released any time soon not likely getting a console for a single game is not the smartest decision but if you ve got the disposable income go ahead i d recommend looking at other games that are available or upcoming that interest you the more games that interest you the more sense the purchase makes
i love the switch but everything on it is so needlessly expensive first party switch games just don t go down in price or barely do if ever if you really want to play breath of the wild maybe see if you can find a cheap wii u because it was on that system too plus there are tons of other nintendo games you ve never played on there too
i would suggest looking at a steam deck and emulating it if you are savvy enough
the switch is great if you want to play nintendo exclusives but keep in mind most of the good ones are almost year old remasters switch fans will champion it as the greatest console ever made but in reality it s a great portable device that only runs low resolution games bad ports and is mostly filled with childrens games
wait for switch imo basically getting the same game but better
dont do it you ll get too addicted to the point of no return
i m in my 40s and have gotten more than my value out of my switch and i don t even play zelda i also have never had an issue with performance
for zelda botw i would i bought it played through it and sold my nintendo switch during the time when it was hard to get one
the ps2 was supported for like years so go for it if you want one then it being on the market for only years should not be a problem
don t do it if you really wanna play it maybe search for a switch used on facebook etc
honestly apart from breath of the wild and mario odyssey there isn t anything else on the switch that is a must play in my opinion botw will be the first time i pick up my switch in years
it s a bit late in the systems life i would say it s because they might launch a new console soon it will be at least a year before it s announced though if it is so if you don t mind being a generation behind after a bit i would say it s worth buying
don t know if it s been mentioned yet but nintendo made games are hardly ever below just something i wish i knew before i bought mine recently
i m and i love the switch especially love the mobility factor but botw mario odyssey metroid prime are all a among others depending on your favorite genres
buy a switch and try all of the first party games that look interesting they re all pretty fantastic
i bought a playstation for one game the last of us and it was worth it if it s within your budget
for reference im and was a nintendo guy all my life i got a switch when i had my second kid thinking i was going to play all the time then i played through all games they have that i like and sold it nintendo has no interest in 3rd party game support and have made that very clear i think you re better off emulating switch games on a steamdeck that can be used like a pc emulation machine and obviously for pc steam games but thats just me
this is the best time to get a switch i m in your same group and i purchased my switch a year ago monsters hunter rise was an exclusive for the switch at that time and it was my main reason for purchasing it i now own more than a dozen games for the system and my wallet is crying there are more switch games that i m planning to buy so my advice is to focus on how many games you want to play on it and not the performance for big 3d games like crisis core ffvii i buy them for ps4 my collection so far is monster hunter rise sunbreak astral chain octopath traveler i ii xenoblade and metroid dread metroid prime remastered pokemon legends arceus legend of zelda breath of the wild legend of zelda link s awakening legend of zelda skyward sword megaman zero collection live a live tactics ogre legend of heroes trails from zero future games megaman battlenetwork collection suikoden i ii collection legend of zelda tears of the kingdom legend of heroes trails to azure maybe
if you ve mostly been playing on pc until recently you might want to look at the steam deck you essentially get the portability of a switch while getting to play a huge chunk of the pc library some of which you might already own
i am also a year old and play pc and the other consoles i bought a switch for the first zelda and pokmon the pokmon games have been complete garbage botw was great i m sure the new one is as well but i can say i have never once reached for my switch on any occasion other than one of those games
better wait for the totk reviews to come out before you even ask this question i am super hyped for it but it wouldn t be the first time a highly anticipated massively hyped game turned out to be a dud unlike totk we already know botw is a masterpiece but only you know if you re rich enough to blow on a video game you might not even like
i think it s still worth it especially the oled model the switch may not excel at performance but the library is massive with many great games both zelda games are designed for this current iteration of the switch and i doubt the improvements would be substantial with a switch
no get a steam deck if you want a decent handheld
oh yea
i pretty much bought the switch for zelda since i have a very good pc don t regret it i highly suggest you play the first game before the second one it s worth it i also played the hell out of dead cells stardew valley mh rise and diablo on the switch
there are people who only play the switch docked which is perfectly fine also the console does have good exclusives besides zelda but i say maybe try botw first or wait until totk to see the reviews
warning essay i m just going to say it this is an opinion of mine that s slowly been formulating over the years and i finally have the confidence to say it despite all the hate i might get switch is the goat of consoles now for context i m a pc gamer if there s a third party game that i can just play on my pc i m going to choose to do that most of the time unless maybe it s a graphically simple indie game or something that i wanna be able to take on the go so i really only judge consoles based on their exclusives cuz that s all i buy them for i m also a very picky person and some of the few types of games i really love are zelda and metroid games so that plays a big role i m also partial to japanese game design in general like fromsoft capcom konami not just nintendo so with all that in mind why is switch the goat botw the zelda goat metroid prime remastered the 3d metroid goat metroid dread the 2d metroid goat mario odyssey the mario goat totk if it s as good as it looks ofc link s awakening hd the 2d zelda goat skyward sword hd smash ultimate the smash goat honorable mentions mario kart the mario kart goat splatoon haven t played but i liked the original and this seems like more of the same kirby and the forgotten land haven t played but heard lots of good things supposedly metroid prime is coming out sometime within this century advance wars reboot looks great loved the original pikmin looks good so far luigi s mansion also haven t played heard nothing but good things animal crossing not my cup of tea but i m sure even you have heard good things about this one especially if you hung out around any 20s 30s white women during the pandemic lmao dk tropical freeze haven t played and all the other wiiu games that got ported over captain toad mario maker not a port but y know pikmin just to name a few oh yeah and so so many of the nso games since you ve never played any nintendo games holy god yes the switch is worth getting if you ve never played a nintendo game even if you re not a huge nintendo fan i m sure lot s of people will argue with my opinion on all these games being the goats but i think it s safe to say that i don t think there s anyone who will argue that the switch is not worth getting for you in your particular case the first year it came out it had some great games and i remember thinking ok this is a good start but there s no way they can keep this up right but i ll be damned they kept it up i remember when metroid dread came out and i played it i thought to myself how how do they keep knocking it out of the park this doesn t make sense this shouldn t be possible they said nintendo was a dying company just a few years ago yet here are all these great exclusive games and that s a lot of games not a short list greatest video game console ever made fight me
if you are a pc gamer you might enjoy the steamdeck and it s possible to emulate a switch on it with some tinkering
worth it now
get a switch for the amazing nintendo exclusives and excellent portability
buy a gen switch and play it on the dock like a regular console cheaper to buy good for the environment better screen better performance old battery doesn t matter better controls and even free nougat if you know where to look
if it s just for zelda that s a big commitment then again i wouldn t recommend playing any triple a port either most of the ones i tried played very sluggishly and looked like mud it s very good for nintendo specific games but if you aren t really into them i d probably stay away realistically the switch is very weak it s not at all ergonomic and the games are very expensive if you still have your pc you can technically emulate the games there if you re specifically looking for a handheld maybe look into the steam deck far superior ergonomics can play a much better library of games with much better performance
probably not if you ve never played a nintendo game in the years you ve been of gaming you might as well just emulate super nintendo n64 gamecube games at this point i really like my switch and use it quite a bit but if you don t care for the portability i d say just pass on it and save the
i owned a switch for a good years here s my thoughts of the good stuff on a switch is nintendo specific if that s your main concern zelda mario pokemon smash bros etc etc yawn then switch is basically your only choice anyway but the nintendo only ips never go down in price the super mario game that originally came out on the wii u in and was ported to the switch for launch that pos is still usd it can be used as a retro console eg emulating nes snes the sega classics line but you need to have an active subscription you can jailbreak a switch depending on firmware to become an emulation powerhouse but that comes with risk and nintendo is always searching for ways to brick a jailbroken machine the second it connects to the internet there s not much by way of third party support and not many aaa games come out on it there s a skyrim and dark souls port but those games are years old and they run like shit on the switch majority of third party games are just indie things that sell for on steam the console itself is strangely too big and too small at the same time the controllers are too small and cramp your hands the console itself a bit too big to hold comfortably not a deal breaker if you get an 8bitdo controller and just run it on your tv but eh basically the switch s appeal is limited to hardline nintendo nerds i got rid of mine because i kept giving it second chances spending aud or whatever on a new game then realising that no it still sucks get a retroid pocket it ll cost less than a switch without any of the bullshit
i agree never buy a console just for game look into the console first and make a list of pros and cons ask yourself if it s worth paying for game i know friends who have never played a nintendo game in their life yr olds all started playing games during xbox era they all then switched to ps4 then now they have pcs never played on any nintendo consoles edit i clearly didn t take age into account my bad
feeling personally attacked because bought snes for ff5 jp bought ps1 for ff7 bought ps2 broadband for ff11 bought ps3 for dark souls bought ps4 for dark souls bought ps5 for elden ring bought nintendo switch for botw
sure with this in mind it is stupid but i dont have the time to invest myself deeply into consoles i play hrs  day when i am able too i love my xbox series x and would bot want to miss it nintendo was always kind of kiddy to me but with age those games might be more relaxing
i had friends buy a ps4 for no mans sky
this have a switch and stopped using it i got my steamdeck
thats a good advice what i was thinking about
no i dont cats i have no pc at the moment
considering the pokmon games we were given those weren t worth it in my opinion but i can say that alongside the zelda games did the fire emblem two show their worth in awesome ways for damn sure i absolutely _love_ engage
that was my impression for years that the switch is more for a young audience
this is my thought at the moment
nice post ty
his is the best time to get a switch i wouldn t be so sure about that as we re approaching the final year of the product s lifecycle almost every nintendo s major console release are years apart however they might use the covid as an excuse to delay it
nah he wants to get switch for zelda
he explicitly says he won t play it portable only plugged in
pokmon games have been complete garbage yea as a hardcore pokemon fan actually got shiny magearna pokeball version after completing the living dex the recently few game got me to lose all hope in it pokemon will continues to get worse as people will continue to buy the games no matter how shitty unfinished it is
yes could also get something like next gen patch
it sounds like they only want to play plugged into the television so portability probably isn t the focus point
my bad i almost do not know those games beside of diablo
cannot fight you its your opinion dont have any experience and i do not know most of these games but i am glad you invested your time wisely in your prefered entertainement choice
awakening hd best 2d game have you played link between worlds
ty but i am no more
that was my intention to do so
thank you
thank you and wait for next nintendo console
thank you a lot i moght wait for next switch my intention was to use it as a tv console i barely have time framws to might use it on the go
feeling personally attacked since i purchased xbox because of halo
op is
i think right now buying a ps4 for bloodborne would be worth it since they re clearly never releasing it on pc
huuuuuge difference in the gaming environment though between someone who started gaming in the early 00s and someone who started gaming in the early 90s nintendo was huge in the early 90s guy started gaming in this is the period where in households in the united states had an nes even if guy didn t have one i guarantee that some of his friends did
zuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuuurghhhhh
zwe ada best music
if u have a strong pc u can get a switch emulator and play the first game and than see if it s worth getting a nintendo switch
in your shoes i would probably say it s not worth it then personally i wouldn t drop hundreds of dollars for a single game but i also really like my switch it s got a huge catalog of games and the portable nature of it means i can use it on public transit or during my lunch breaks at work or when i m flying somewhere etc nintendo definitely has a large catalog of kid friendly games but it s absolutely got lots of titles to appeal to adults as well i wouldn t call doom mortal kombat return of the obra dinn inscryption or alien isolation kiddy games but ymmv
there s truth to what you said however my gaming cycle doesn t have to match the company s you can save lots of money this way with discounted console and games
you can play zelda on a steam deck if you re resourceful enough
zelda can play on the steam deck though
whereas the games have potential to grow and i very much agree with you in being the way they ve been over the years personally i think it s the company themselves who purposely lack in developing what they present the fanbase in again growth for the sake of awareness in those purchasing what comes out post announcement an example being the dlc no matter what isn t trusted in terms of effort placed into them both it s just that whereas gamefreak can supply the audience some of the best it s the money that matters in however us buyers are lured in at least it s how it appears since what we ve gotten from them i mean shit s v were so bad people were returning their games and then verbally going after the gaming company for what they gave us upon release and to this day both just aren t enough to revive gamers to go back to them both even for the recent raids so very much are you right it s just that since the last two some of us are now wondering about gamefreak and their ways it appears at least i know i am now
jesus what rock are you living under
of course lol i just thought i should draw your attention to some of these since you said you d never played a nintendo game switch is a great place so much good stuff out there waiting for you if you give it a chance
honestly i d pick link to the past over between worlds they are the same overworld but between worlds has a simpler story and is limited by the non linear nature of renting key weapons it means that you lose the impact of unlocking weapons and tools allowing the world to open up
yeah it s up there they re all great i should note that i d only call awakening the goat by a slim margin i think the thing that sets it apart for me is the story it just hits different when i was a kid playing for the first time i almost cried at the end
kotor was my reason to get an xbox worth it
rightfully so
true i didn t take age into account
i m accepting the downvotes i m going to get for this opinion bloodborne is overrated i ve played and finished it it s a great game very overrated though not worth buying an entire console for it just my opinion though
until you realise its fps of motion blurred giant pixels and oops you ve wasted your money because fanboys told you to
yes did but had pc
i m about to be and i had friends who had the nes i suppose it was a different time but i found it interesting that there are people who never were exposed to the nintendo gaming world
the benefit of following the company s in the situation though is that when a new nintendo console is announced then the switch will drop in price
really
a huge one where ps pc and xbox had a lot of space
that s fair i m just not personally a huge fan of the first zeldas they re just not for me idk
you not liking it does not mean it s overrated there is no game in world that everyone loves does that mean every great game ever is overrated
well i enjoy fromsoft games and ps4 can be found really cheap at pawn shops so
i believe you it s just mind boggling given how common nintendo systems were back then
eh awakening on gameboy was my first zelda i have a huge soft spot for it i really want them to do updated versions of oracle of ages seasons in the same style as the new la
woah i just said i liked bloodborne i just personally think it s overrated as i said my opinion
right dude i m astonished that it hasn t happened yet it would be so easy nintendo is missing out on free money they can reuse pretty much all the assets and the engine from lahd when lahd came out i honestly assumed that the oracle games would be following close behind in the next year or so just seems like such a no brainer
rdr2
red dead redemption
rdr
red dead
the witcher probably it had a good almost balanced mix of rdr2 s immersive scenic world and say skyrim s detail and exploration put separately i think rdr2 absolutely succeeds in its aforementioned aspects more so than tw3 even if slightly and similarly skyrim in its own as well
no game comes close to red dead it s leagues above the rest
red dead
red dead is probably the right answer
gta rdr witcher and cyberpunk feel the most alive to me
rdr2
rd2 and it s not close i ve played them all and that world breathes life and activity in every corner incredible realism and detail
rdr2 is full of people and so many varieties of wildlife
skyrim for me the fact you need to do the main story and just explore endless caves and dungeons was very thrilling for me
rdr nothing comes even close to it many devs had much time on their hands to work in unnecessary but very welcome details to the environment wildlife and animations because they still needed to work on something after their original job was already done and they were still getting paid the result is a staggering amount of mind boggling hidden details for example watch a persons food when its getting cut paired with in my opinion the best visuals for an open world to this day
the yakuza games
warframe sort of
i love rdr2 too but what about subnautica great open world game
hp legacy got me to actually stop and look around
outcast very few open world games including more modern ones manage to make the world feel like it s actually moving with or without the player of course outcast s open world of adelpha was smoke and mirrors like any other game is but its citizens moved around did their jobs talked to each other fled combat greeted the player interacted with the environment and did everything you d expect from a great open world game a decade before other games caught up
cyberpunk
witcher
ac origins ac odyssey and rdr2
witcher
sims
the elder scrolls morrowind oblivion and skyrim
world of warcraft back in
mass effect andromeda bite me is it the greatest game no is the story great guess not is there a ton of open world s all with different factions some super factions end of the world stuff etc etc yup a ton of it
tetris
kingdom come deliverance
not sure if it was the most full and alive but immersion wise kingdom come deliverance
red dead is the most overrated boring repetitive game ive ever laid my hands on enjoy riding a pixelated horse for hours on end then this is the game for you elden ring is the correct answer here
the yakuza series bar none the area is smaller than most open world games generally one district of tokyo and usually just kamuroch based on kabukich but it s jam pack full of people encounters and side quests and should always be the gold standard of open world games you even encounter some of the same people in new sidequests throughout the sequels giving a gorgeous sense of continuity across the open world a close second would be sleeping dogs which just felt vibrant when you got into the city outside of your car
division seasons and directives keep it fresh
incredible hulk ultimate destruction
god of war ragnarock
shawdow of mordor
breath of the wild
i agree it is dimensionally way ahead of its time red dead series is perfection
i see you re a person of culture as well
warframes world feels alive during quests like new war but sometimes i like to use an invisible frame and go around missions just to see grineer and corpus carryout their routine and doing stuff just for the sake of it
you a ulukai of culture i see
do you think the game still holds up today it sounds interesting i might want to try it
yeah that game felt like you were sucked into another world they did a good job with the aliens and their culture i always got an on patrol vibes playing that game like i was winning hearts and minds in iraq or nam they made a sequel for the ps5 and i won t shit on it but for now my favorite one is the first one
sarcasm
lmaoo
eh i agree that me a is better than a lot of people say but i think it barely even gets to the top ten of open worlds and most of the legwork for even that is because it was building off of the lore from prior games
look at me guys i can bash a game loved by millions then immediately follow with my opinion that i firmly believe is correct
i wouldn t call games head of their time i would just call them perfect and made with passion and the right amount of time to produce such a game
nope night city genuinely felt alive repetitive but alive like any other real major city i live in a major downtown area though so it might have an effect on my perspective
admittedly i took the extreme underdog here but dangit i feel like this was pretty close to hitting a mark lol
yeah this guy is a tool literally every video game is pixelated let me try to be him for a bit elden ring is riding around for hours on a pixel goat so overrated
they re not wrong rdr2 is a lot of empty open space like most modern open world games but then so is elden ring
nobody gives af about your opinion bud
i never said he was wrong about red dead i was making fun of him for bashing red dead then proceeding to state his choice was right which in my opinion is a worst open world game when grading on the scale of what makes an open world game feel alive
true but we care about yours even less
i don t think you re wrong but there s crtainly a case to be made that if you re charging money for a product it s fair to review it as is so to say
same thing happens with free to play games too i get if people can t recommend a game in it s current state or even just because it is not that fun an all out negative review though is usually unwarranted
games that are released are feeling like early access the lines are getting blurry and we get confused or they re just idiots choose your poison
you charge for the game and you offer only one hour of gameplay it is not early access and you are paying for a demo the dev saying it is a single chapter means nothing when you charge money and offer next to nothing then there is early access where the game is complete with many hours of gameplay and the customer can give feedback to make changes to the game before it is finished there is charging for a demo and charging for early access which is late alpha or beta man go back into the doom days where there were demos called shareware where it had the first chapter where you get hours of gameplay for free now you get early access and it is asking for money when you can get much more for free where they have a roadmap but never get finished i reckon if the dev can t meet of their road map must refund the customer you aren t charging for a promise you are charging for a complete product
reviews are meant to reflect the current state of a given product so that readers can decide to purchase it or not a game s potential or the promises the devs make have nothing to do with the current user experience if the devs are charging money for their early access game they should have a stable product that s actually fun supporting an early access game ultimately comes down to trust in the developer so one should not do it for any developer that doesn t already have a proven track record of releasing good games and brand new devs releasing early access games just seem shady
because lots of games don t come out of early access so complaints about early access are always going to be featured it doesn t help that some early access has weekly updates and some early access will go months between contact
i think how long a game has been in early access is an important factor in how reasonable a complaint about a lack of content is if you re bitching a month into early access that the game isn t complete that s a silly and unreasonable complaint but if a game has been in early access for over a decade and is still missing of the content that was promised i think a negative review about a lack of content is absolutely justified regardless of an early access disclaimer at some point a completed product is expected to be delivered and if it s not people are going to have some thoughts about that
yea i mean i get that especially if you don t like how it plays or something or there s bad performance issues definitely let em know but saying there s a lack of content when it s in huge letters in the blurb how much content you re getting and an outline of when more content is coming is so wild to me
if you bought the game you can complain even if you are dumb for buying an unfinished product
yeah people can be a bit daft like that lol
it s that fucking weedle again killing my party with poison
isn t there a comic where the kid tells mom there pokmon in the tall grass and she still makes him go outside and he finds a magikarp and proceeds to beat the shit out of other pokmon with it
when i was a kid i d love areas with tall grass i always ran in hoping i d somehow find a pokemon in real life miraculously i never got any ticks
the caterpies you d find before finally getting that pidgeotto that would make you finish whatever amount of pokeballs you had in your inventory making you start over again only satisfaction was killing it after the stupid bird freed from all of the balls i have ptsd from it
i got hit by a car playing pokemon go once the driver i mean
it was worth it for the early pikachu
knock knock zubat
i kept running into tall grass hoping an old man would come along and offer me a choice of starters
lol this is super funny i never got into pokmon turn based fighting games were just not for me but for me the legend of zelda link s awakening that was my jam slashing tall grass left and right now i m and find it relaxing to mow the lawn
that s why i was scared of long grass
yes i will be cut in half by black lines if i go outside
god please no all i have left is a lvl2 ratatta with 3hp just let me pass so i can heal him at the pokecenter for the love of christ
me playing phantasy star when i was
payback
i can hear the music
also pokemon games are awesome
just use a repel dude
i d creep across the grass to avoid being detected by pokmon
tall grass get your pokemon to use cut on it no more tall grass ya did not know that did ya
fax
i ve been playing blox fruit for over hours
what s grasss
i thought my gameboy was broken because of the stutter when one of my pokemon was poisoned even went back to the store with it i was like years old
if pokemon were real we d be screwed as a species there are some really twisted pokedex entries
pokemon was sweet why would i ever want to go outside
pokmon actually got me to love the outdoors more lmao
fun fact you can use hm01 cut to remove a 2x2 patch of grass so it is safe to walk for steps
also grass and plants can be full of ticks
using cut to get rid of the grass i can t remember if you could do it precrystal though
i dont know why but that would always startle year old me so bad i would have to go through the tall grass with the sound muted to reduce the effect
every to gawt damn steps too
just cut the grass with cut
a wild spider appeared
touch grass
not even once
same as in comic books movies https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n0vdoedzu8o
for me it was a wasp nest i accidentally kicked down
this needs the poison flash in the animation lol
i played red for the first time a while back i ran around some grass patches for ages before a pokmon showed up other times i literally would just turn on the current patch and get another encounter
this is hilarious but for me it had the opposite effect pokmon made me want to go outside in the woods even more than i already did would pretend i was ash looking for bugs birds and other critters
i ll take on a weedle over the zubats waiting inside a cave any day of the week
jared from manly guys doing manly things he got kicked out of the league because he let his gyarados eat their opponent s pokmon
same here but unfortunately for me i got a very concerning number of bug bites
it s crazy how much more prevalent ticks are now vs the 90s early 2000s now i will walk through my very short mowed grass and get them
i was about to ask but i m glad this sentence ended well
i did this once as a kid and was rudely stopped by running into an electric fence at full sprint i was a bit more careful after that
or when you decide to just train a pidgey and the pidgeotto appears right before your own pidgey is about evolve
same i loved both series and they definitely enhanced my love of the outdoors also enjoy mowing the lawn
this was the first thing i thought of when i saw the video omg
well actually you can t buy a repel at this point in the game
can t escape
then somehow becomes a pokmon professor because his gyarados is twice the size of a normal one because he seems to be the only trainer that knows sweets poffins pokeblock pokepuffs are a sometimes food
same here but it was mostly a fuck ton of stickers on my socks and shoes
every berry in your inventory was then ate it seems
learned in my entomology class that this is because of deforestation in your area if there are big developments clearing trees then the remaining areas get a big surge for a couple years
or when you finally find a pikachu after an hour or more walking around viridian forest only for it to run off die before you can catch it
aaaaaaaaaaah that is really crap too ahah
its a rough time up to misty if you don t catch and train that pikachu all those youngsters and lasses with bird types can slow ya down
i m always skeptical of games with amazing graphics by indie devs most of these really good looking games end up having lackluster gameplay in favor of graphics i hope this game proves me wrong
looks like it good be fun almost feels like how city skylines just took over for sim city
first i hear about paralives then life by you and today i m just learning there s another life simulation game called alterlife amazing
meh i prefer the more cartoony graphics of the other competitors announced before this looks great for people who want the more realistic look
graphics look amazing this could do well if it has good gameplay and at least a taste of that sims esque weirdness quirk
i wonder if any of them are good this one looks good but leaves me wondering about game play and if they re gonna sell lots of dlc
the sims community has been happily clocking all of these games through development at their inception the sims franchise was under the control of silicon valley tech bro types and they were taking the game in a direction the fans did not want ie star wars sims players started welcoming these indie efforts
competition is good
i don t think g man ever jump scares you he shows up at unexpected times yes but it s never shocking or startling there was one jump scare in hl2 in ravenholm involving g man but it was removed for being too frightening he s eerie and creepy more than scary but does he put jump scares to shame no doubt he is able to do that by being creepy on his own if seeing him at all makes you anxious he doesn t need to jump scare you he simply needs to make his presence known the perfect character designed to frighten you they just do without really trying
even better when he pops up in alyx

the npc interactions in gtav can get pretty crazy i once blew up a car and when the fire fighters arrived one got off the truck ran up to another npc s car pulled them out of the car and then punched her
i so badly want a game with a big map like gta5 but you don t do crimes and just get to live a normal life or do whatever you want let me follow the traffic laws run a flower shop and go hike the mountain on the weekend
this is the equivalent of putting the man on the little island on roller coaster tycoon
is that darryl from the office
your forever friend
omg the fact he still chased you for the bike as well
you be keeping him hostage
how to make friends as an adult
now you have a forever friend in your room
lol
nice man haha
you let him ride it
slave captured
almost a more fleshed out narrative than the main story
i so badly want a game with a big map like gta5 but you don t do crimes and just get to live a normal life or do whatever you want let me follow the traffic laws run a flower shop and go hike the mountain on the weekend with my wife before i shoot her times in the gut and bury her in a shallow grave
can i offer you a cup of tea
the weirdest thing is how npcs in the bike thief events don t follow you they just stand and wait if you go too far the game considers you the thief and despawns them just like the mugging events guessing you used a trainer to do that or one of the many tp glitches source gta speedrunner done those events hundreds of times
must have been parked in the fire lane
i remember one time in gta iv the taxi i sent niko on while making a coffee and listening to the in game radio accidentaly touched another car might have been the police so the driver of the other car shot the taxi driver with niko still inside the taxi driver died and niko was left in the car with a busted windshield and dead driver
it s emergent gameplay like this that makes me love the game so much in gtaiv i used to intentionally space invade people on the street until they got angry and threw a punch then i d watch the cops arrest and or shoot them
with advancements in ai npc interactions will be insanely good over the next few versions
i remembered another episode in the gta iv mission with the serial killer if you call the police around the final scene where he attacks you the police will take him down themselves if they observe his violent behavior
it sounds like you want life simulation game with open world me too my friend
kind of like a more realistic 3rd person sims game there s a new one in development called life by you i think it s still top down but it s supposed to offer more control than the sims
gta rp servers would be perfect for you do look into them
pretty sure you could do the same in gta but the normal people in the world would do some fucked up shit too so yea
should we tell him
arma life
i m playing this game now sadly it s extremely pay to win and can be tedious at times also it seems that starting attributes and traits are completely random some people start the game with a massive advantage while others just get royally fucked
tell me you don t have any real life responsibilities without telling me
you literally just described gta5 rp
can t wait til they start using that advanced ai learning stuff in games like the ability to have full conversations with them learn from them they can learn from you too and remember your actions stuff like that
liberty city with modern graphics would be sweeet i live in rural australia irl i d love to plug into the matrix in liberty city
mafia is the most realistic for me in this sense like yeah it s criminal based but it s super easy to role play solo as a normal person
ahhh the less sophisticated way of just blocking the entrance with do not enter signs
gta so probably the pontiac bandit from
unfunny emoji
cue ginuwine
this is a bot stealing comments downvote and report
i have the xbox version of gta so maybe the ai works differently
i ve had them chase me too you have to get the bike ride it close to them get off wait for them to start walking to it hop on and dip slowly they ll follow i was also on
i rarely upvote or downvote anything but this made me wheeze laugh so take this upvote you legend
is that little mac
gaming s most accurate virtual new york taxi ride
happened to me a few times sometimes i would set it up on purpose so it would happen if he lived you had a getaway driver and the chase good last a good while sometimes
had a similar accident in a getaway my driver hit another car and the npc was so pissed he chased us and even once the mission was completed tried to fight us and punched me i punched back there were police around and got stars instantly and after few seconds they shot me would ve deleted the whole game if that happened before i finish the mission
like it cunning fox d
now this makes me want to try calling police during a mission in gta v and see if they will take on any enemies trying to kill me
manual transmission mod and gtavred i think there is another mod that makes the game like real life
we will probably get covid lockdown simulation before we get open world life simulator i d still play both
isn t that just second life
one of my favourite things to do in gta was go into first person and visit the movie theater or the amusement park by the docks fun way to pass the time lol
i tried it too many rules and restrictions plus a lot of people on there are toxic i want a single player experience
why is this not the top comment
i just got to level it s not getting easier
tell me you don t have any real life responsibilities he says as he trolls away on reddit
i do have real life responsibilities the idea here is that i want to live a different life through videogames isn t that why people play them
yeah but i want a single player experience i tried gta rp and every time someone else ruined it for me
the new ai technology will be used heavily in gta mark my words this is the last fully for the most part human made gta
lol can a bot fk yo moms
i think that actually might be the programmed reason though
in game or
yes i m pretty sure it would work as long as they don t use guns you can climb on top of the car if they are just swinging at you with their fists or a knife they should not attempt to follow you until the police arrive
just looked up the red mod holy cow how well does it run
i want a single player experience a normal life with zero human interactions
i tried gta rp after seeing the goofy fun people like timmac had they can be fun but for the most part it s grim dark assholes trying to be the crime kingpin of the city and cops who desperately desperately desperately want to be the kind of asshole cop who makes the news
to many people probably don t know what it is
r outside
don t act like a bot by stealing a comment hours old almost word for word you being human is even more pathetic
aw man that comment gave me such joy too turns out he was just being helpful
probably a normal life with zero dickheads ruining everything every five seconds
i want to interact with the npcs obviously
it was a joke did u even read my comment
i m not really positive still funny either way
that s a pretty abnormal life if you ask me
try imagining a peaceful one as a normal one class dismissed
sounds extremely boring as a video game
and yet rp servers are full
i guess i i m afraid that line hit like a truck in this scene
take a chance that love exists
that scene it just tears me up every time i see it
i gave you everything i had gets me every time
that chapter of the game is sad as hell
pleasssseee rockstar please do a 60fps patch it s bloody criminal that you haven t done so yet
it finally went on sale and i got this recently besides the characters movements feeling like i m driving a dump truck underwater it s very entertaining spoiler alert loved the scene where the scientist woman says that making know it alls feel stupid is the best part of science
now go find the civil war vet in valentine and weep like a lil bitch
rdr2
this game is definitely something special i loved it i just wish it wasn t so sad i don t really like playing sad games
almost years later and still such a visceral memory
when he found out he was sick i was fucked up fr
it broke all of us the first time
what s insane to me is this is the optional scene you only get if you go out of your way doing a few easy to miss side missions for the other scene with the reverend is ok but no where near as good as this scene feels like rockstar kind of dropped the ball even if just a little bit by making this scene semi hidden
thank you broke me to the core
this one scene impaled my fucking inner core when he said that one line to the sister and his face and voice changed a friend of mine said i had the same face and sound in my words right after my wife passed and i recognized it in myself i broke
which game is this
i cried at least times after arthur s diagnosis this game broke me in half and kept kicking me over and over again with it s gut wrenching scenes best story of any game i ve ever and will ever play next to the last of us
that scene still sits with me over years later i remember describing it to my wife after the fact and getting choked up again i honestly don t think i ve had a game impact me quite so strongly
i haven t played it since i beat it after it first game out but damn this was one of the greatest gaming experiences i ve ever had the gameplay the story the characters all perfect
finally someone else with a properly bearded arthur
it d be fucking nice to know what this game actually is put it in the god damn subject line ffs
i liked red dead but not as much as the first
howdy
that scene is so good
took me years to beat this game bought it twice too
my all time favorite indie game
i wish i could forget how much it broke me so i can replay it and let it break me again
i never let mine get a beard or mustache so it s strange to see
how this game lost to gow is beyond me gow is cool but it s not as deep and compelling as rdr in terms of story
it is a masterpiece be broken is the usual feeling
this a is freaking amazing
that s the way it is
if only cornwall took dutch up on the deal
guess it s time for me to get this game again never finished it the first time around
you re alright boah
i immediately checked your profile to see if you were the same person who said hours in and this is already one of my top or something and sure enough gave me a good chuckle
hey guy why ya still scrolling do you want to be spoiled for the best video game story of all time oh you ve already played it carry on mister
game was so damn good imo i consider it one of those must buy game on pc arthur fucking morgan watching deadwood on hbo max now kinda remind of this game that era in america
closest a game has gotten to dostoyevski novel it blew my mind
did it hurt when you emotionally connected to a character who s personal development had you reeling with every twist and turn of the plot
i hate this game so much
seeing this has just made me realise the sister has a sims chin or lack thereof
arthur morgan is really one of the goats here
god i hate this game with a passion
rdr2 is the only game that starts off so light and cheerful all filled with hopes and dreams and by the end it hits you with a train full of guilt and emotions
i just wanted to be a cowboah
wow i had on almost the same exact outfit
i keep hearing about rdr2 it is supposedly one of the best open world games ever made but what type of open world is it is it map marker vomit like ubisoft games and the horizon games where the main story is spoon fed to you with a map marker trail leading from plot point to plot point or is it elden ring style open world where the world is laid out before you and you are told go find the story i don t care about the type of story i am not mega western fan but i can get on board with any sort of good storytelling
what game is this
it will break your soul at the end
ah yes that one game with this person talking to that person mods can we make it a rule to label the games
because going from point a to point b is a goddamn nightmare
tell us the game you chicken fucker
i ve had this in my library for a while but i m not prepared for the emotional damage of playing it lmao maybe after the summer i ll put on some big boy trousers and saddle up
whats the game
it s not just that it s not just the incredible line read it s the goddamn amazing detail in the expression it made me feel genuine sadness for a virtual character real tears welled up that and his entire interactions with mary felt like you could see the relationship they once had and saw the rest of it slipping through the cracks it hits like a freight train if you ve been in a failing relationship and it still hits just as hard for the concept of wanting x life but living the one you have it s just a damn good story and boy does that man s journal add so much
there is nothing to be afraid of mr morgan take a gamble that love exists never played rdr but it hits me every time it s in one of those it s just a game https://youtu.be/d42k7afznvc)" videos just thinking about the song makes my throat close up especially that second part was extra tough when i tried opening up again after a break up
roger clark did an absolutely fantastic performance as arthur
dude i sat there watching that train depart because i felt i owed arthur and the sister it that s how much it impacted me i actually wanted to give him that moment of peace
is this in multiplayer story or regular
fuuuuuuuck
and do a loving act
it s not that deep bro you probably like ea too
dutch was such a piece of shit x200b fuck that guy
honestly dude it wouldn t have been a big deal but the way arthur says that really fucks with your emotions and just makes you more furious over both dutch and micah especially fucking micah
i tried in the end i did is a close second to me in terms of hitting right in the feels
i gave up needed to get this game off my backlog got used to fps all over again lol
pc
what s a 60fps patch
that is my only gripe the movement is terrible changing it toggle to run helped a lot but still i keep crashing into things
characters movements feeling like i m driving a dump truck underwater i think some of that is just part of the game s animation but if you re playing with a controller which you should be try setting aim acceleration to max and dead zone to minimum it makes a big difference in responsiveness
i m currently on my first playthrough and only have a few epilogue missions left but i don t remember a female scientist at any point i would be interesting to learn more about this scene that i must have missed a quick search for rdr2 female scientist didn t return anything relevant
thank you
this guy thinks the picture is from star wars wtf
don t play any of the nier games
same i actually took a little break from the game when he got diagnosed you get to play through this power trip as a wild west badass and then all of a sudden his world gets turned upside down
it s a hell of a thing son
you should spoiler alert this
and the second time and the third time
i thought what version of the scene you get depends on your honor rating that s not dropping the ball it s keeping the story consistent with the players choices
i don t remember this scene at all maybe i missed it
oh wow didn t know that i m trying to do missables so yeah i m glad i got this one
i think it is a deliberate choice by rockstar it s seems like if the player invest or explore the open world you will be rewarded for your efforts in this case if the player finishes sister calderon missions they will be rewarded with this beautiful scene
did the side quest not have anything to do with the extended scene
it s a hell of a thing when a scene in media unexpectedly hits you on a personal level because of a connection like that i had similar moments from two cartoons that i absolutely did not expect it from south park stan s grandfather admitting to losing his memories in cash for gold my own grandfather has dementia and bob s burgers eugene having a meltdown from sensory overload at an event bob took him to in the laser inth i ve had similar incidents
red dead redemption
red dead
i like red dead too and you re right about it being better than red dead
did you just saw red dead starts off light and cheerful to be clear red dead redemption is the game were talking about right
get the fucking game already and be broken and don t you dare compare this masterpiece to any ubisoft crap i hated western stuff too then this game came around
red dead
red dead redemption
ah yes one of the most recognizable scenes in gaming history also read the ten other comments poor op had to reply to already
there s some games that everyone fucking knows about it s like seeing a pic from gta and saying guys which game is this
bah gawk
red dead redemption
red dead
i ll have to read his notes i didn t know about that
it s not just the incredible line read nah it is my game glitched out and arthur s face stopped moving during this bit still hits just as hard when you can t see what s happening
pretty fun tbh thanks for this
oh wow these gave me some real blasts from the past that guild wars screenshot hit me with some strong nostalgia
this is fun sharing this thank you
fun game however bug report forward back arrows seem to be broken on the oldest items from nov at least i started at the back and clicking on them from the archive you have to click one day newer example clicking on takes you to the puzzle page probably both related edit this behavior seems to persist from front to back the forward button always points at the day you re already on the back button always points to two days prior and the archive always goes to the day before the one you clicked got an extra in there somewhere edit oh perhaps that s what s going on the day listed on the page is always one less than the url for example https://zoomout.videoludid.com/daily/2023-03-15 says that it s march at the top
this was cool but spoilers because its the answer on my phone world of warcraft didnt show up as an option when i searched for it might be a bug i might have mistyped or i just didn t see it
nice idea
pretty cool idea
this is sick i m having a great time with it was this inspired by the zoomshot category on minnmax s trivia tower also btw there s a minor bug the button to move forward to the next day s puzzle isn t working for me
looks fun bookmarking and hope it doesn t get overwhelmed by reddit traffic
i have a bug with not being able to go forward a day although if i start at the most recent i can go backwards
error report the december puzzle has the correct answer listed as xcom enemy unknown but it is actually xcom this is a blast thank you for putting this together
thank you for the elaborate bug report it works for me though in what timezone are you that may be related to the issue
uhh idk how to do spoiler tags
it showed up for me just now not sure if you typo d or they fixed or what lol but working now
never heard of trivia tower seems to be a coincidence regarding the bug it could be timezone related can you tell me what yours is thanks
pst sorry pdt which is utc i was also curious if it was related to that heh
and without any spaces between exclamation marks comes out as spoiler
mountain time
here s a link to that trivia tower category if you re curious https://youtu.be/ts0kupn3nak?list=pl6fr1lkt9iimocqdr76naifjvro-nsjdc&t=4460
the fuck is that
i just don t care anymore after hearing it s a ps5 exclusive i tried to get one on release and couldn t they re still never in stock where i am and there s like total exclusive games i love you ff but it s gonna be a no from me
console exclusive nty
flashy generic hack slash make final fantasy play like final fantasy again
that plus every ff since 14doesntcount has been shite
downhill since xii
s
don t skip the beginning cutscene it s hilariously schlocky
don t forget the basement theme on the dualshock version
i still remember the day i got this game it was at target and it looked cool so we just had mom get it no reviews idk if egm had a story on it yet now it s this huge thing with movies and tv shows good times
better have a memory card too
you re missing the tall box
what is that thing on your table with the playstation controller in it
i have the exact resident evil directors cut on ps1 and i was so was disappointed when i got it because re2 had just been released but hell its better than the original just through camera and sound edits
remember for re4 you need to have the appropriate controller https://preview.redd.it/1ymvmprvcng31.jpg?width=474&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d2b2bc3de0ff158c7eb916d711a91b6740c1373), or you re missing out on the experience
nice playing code veronica right now
you were almost a jill sandwich
play in the dark the best
you think you re ready
the directors cut has a cheat to get double ammo you have to hold thebselect button on the start game selection it ll change colors and now all ammo boxes have double bullets
i ve got the green one i got it for christmas of when the opening scene started with it was oh shit the game knows
nice original have the best soundtracks
ahh yes the true survival horror where you can t kill anything otherwise you don t have any ammo for the boss
the way 90s god meant it to be played
i love the classic games of re
damn that would get you a dope monster on monster rancher
never noticed how great the adwork is
i get a strange wave of nostalgia looking at those
as soon as i seen the ps1 case this post caught my eyes
first ps game i ever bought before i got the console
get ready for clowns farting in the basement
ah the dc version with the opening movie in colour and all that hilarious gore instead of newspaper articles loved this
boy that brings back memories lol the ps1 start screen almost as cool as the nintendo logo when goldeneye first starts up yup im old now
the classic resident evil games are so scary the remakes are now more like action games
aside from the gc remake of re1 and og re2 what you have there represents the best in the series all hail traditional survival horror
don t forget to use the double ammo cheat
noooooooo don t go stands around like idiots
those cut scenes were awesome
remember the porn scene that someone made by editing together some of the dialogue from the beginning of the game man i felt so accomplished when i found that on napster i can t really remember how it went just that there was a jill sandwich at some point
good lord lmfao
you mean the best theme in the entire franchise
clown farts
that is the best track for any video game ever it can t be beat
it s the series most memorable theme
damn i had no idea target had been around since the 60s my hometown didn t get a target until i was almost out of high school in
that s all i care about what kind of special playstation box is this
it s the back of a laptop stand that i have my psone lcd sitting on
i love that i found the unique non demo single jewel case variant
if you own a ps4 you can play re0 remake remake remake code veronica remake vii viii revelations and revelations all on that one system plus re1 directors cut with an upgraded ps subscription and also that one online shooter game that sucked that i can t remember the name of right now
that s good to know thanks i can go in guns blazing now
i can not only hear this perfectly but also see the dutch angle goodness and 16fps choppy live action goodness
barry where s barry he s probably no
wtf
still a better sex theme than cbat
i never knew a time when target wasn t a thing i think it s why some people love the fuck out of target and hate walmart or the other way around
it s the back of a laptop stand that i have my psone lcd sitting on
that is indeed a special find enjoy
the live action bit will always kill me but some of those damn lines in game you know what i m talking about lol are just classic for the cheesy factor except the i wanna say keeper s diary that shit was sad to read at the time
thank you
i don t get nostalgic over much but i love that i can relive it anytime one of those things that kind of never gets old no matter how dated the tech i m not saying there aren t plenty of other great games but modern narrow fov 3rd person just isn t the same for me as static angles and dialog that might as well have been written by a middle school scriptwriter taking it seriously nooo don t open that doooor this house is too dangerous there are terrible demons
you forgot the best part of that last one the classic blood squirt out of him and ouch at the end hahahahaha
she wants to make a jill sandwich
although short re3 remake was a blast literally using the rocket launcher lol it was so much fun to play and it obviously looks amazing the several replays to get the platinum got a little old towards the end though but then again the game is very short and my final time on inferno with and s rank was like hour and 30min the only challenging part was the first 10min of inferno and then the last bossfight which was pretty damn tough to beat with his stunlocks and insta kills but i got it done btw to get the nice platinum screenshot i used the good old ps5 screenshot trick as it would otherwise have been a blackscreen which is kind of boring i thought this moment at the end was more fitting https://psnprofiles.com/gerdie_3000 as you can see here i have also been playing the re2 remake but not quite gotten the platinum yet any tips for taking on hardcore mode in that one
og jill was bae
that trophy name with that face gives me this is a good bye video vibes
jill is a badass
perfect except for that achievement popup
id smash
congratulations you finished your quest for a perfect screenshot you can feel proud
what a really good friend chris redfield
ask her where the rest of the game went capcom did this one dirty compared to and
haha who doesn t
on a scale from how hard would you rate getting the platinum
i think too many people played this game on normal and it s a shame i watched a few streamers play through it and they never utilized the dodge or slowdown mechanic you can just brute force yourself through normal playing it on hard though i came to appreciate the mechanic and had a lot of fun with it another thing i enjoyed from it was the added changes in the harder difficulties things like enemy placements being changed i d love to see this expanded upon in future games replaying through re on professional and i already feel like i know what to expect in every area i m in
never played the og games sadly i ve heard they were really great too
i wont spoil anything so can t comment on that lol i will just say that it s a great game with a cool ending
perfect for me at least
bestest platonic friend in the whole wide world
if you use the unlockables such as the rocket launcher and coins mainly because of the last boss which can insta jill you very quickly other than that is is pretty easy and very fun even nightmare and inferno difficulty with out the unlockables i would say i say go for it you got this edit kill not jill lol
someone on youtube bought this game on steam and asked if he completed of the game with all achievements within hours can i get a full refund well spoiler alert he did it and got a refund
to add on to what the other guy said i beat nightmare in like an hour or something just going stride for stride with a speedrun video and the rocketlauncher
agree i got much better at using everything to my advantage on the higher difficulties and on nightmare and inferno it s a whole different game
amazing
yep my first playthrough on standard difficulty was hours and on my final run on inferno the timer showed hour and min you can do it very quickly when you know the game after the several playthroughs that are required anyway and have all the op weapons
my re2 remake playthrough was like hours then i watched a speedrun and was like god damn i m a clown lol
fus ro d awwwww
good job u fixed it
who s a cute little dragonborn thats right you are
fuwu ro dah
you know that dude on youtube mikeburnfire yeah this looks like something his girlfriends character might wear regardless i love this it s cute and silly and looks comfy
where s your hot carl
bahahaha
this work in vr er what
i literally have that onesie
i mean if the dragonborn showed up wearing a onesie instead of armour i d be scared of that sheer confidence lol chainmail i don t need armour and besides i m cozy
where can i get one
i love this game
game is great you need your little robot buddy to read for yah
this game was a joy to play just the right length to enjoy casually and it was super endearing
i really wanna give this a go is it a chill game something to relax to
i still wanna play this game
meow meow meow meow meeeeooooow meow meow
oooh love this touching game
anyone else also spins the cat when in a bucket
not like i came up with it but there is a fan theory that the cat and its litter are no regular cats they might have evolved or originated on a laboratory and are very smart still doesn t explain where they learned how to read though
furry game played by furries
i just noticed this is on sale for ps4
game was great but yeah the start with the signs really stretched my immersion to breaking point
these super obvious signs

for the most part there are mobs you ll have to avoid eventually so if that s something you d find not so chill then maybe not so much definitely not a fast paced action game though
then play it its in the playstation plus premium
yes playing a cute cat game makes you a furry very good argument there
it s a game with a cat and robots because of the tanuki suit most mario games are exponentially more furry than stray is
bro doesn t know animals inspired furries and not the other way around
look i ve got no interest in this game but you re so off base that its actually hilarious even people like me who aren t into this game think you re an idiot you re not being edgy or cool you re insufferable
bruh
ok but who asked
meow
you d be surprised how clueless people in games are if there aren t big hints and markers everywhere game jams suffer from it constantly
don t have playstation sadly only xbox
have you seen furries
that s the point i want downvotes the game looks fine tbh it seems fun but i haven t played it which makes my takes more uninformed
have you seen cats
have you seen you
so you confirm you re being an idiot just to be an idiot reddit in a nutshell
https://youtu.be/upwwlwch3h8
that s not it but i remember that it was great the one im looking for was done over sloppily played drums it was more of an amateur band clowning around besides the drums the rest of the sounds were done by them not instruments haha
it s almost like he had to bury her by himself or something
goddammit why didn t i pay attention to the spoiler tag
a hole i genuinely stopped playing at that part i just didn t have the heart to continue
it bothers me that it s not a true bundle for the whole set is kinda insane
ff original classic no complaints ffii borderline unplayable ffiii meh ffiv excellent ffv decent ffvi the best one
you can get it on steam in a bundle for
does square enix want emulators cause that s how they ll get emulators
yeah i m still one for pimping out the psp route for these games a nice redone s 3d version after years and via ps1 i would ve been tempted to get a physical cartridge of this collection for or so but yikes
you got and the wrong way around is bland if a great improvement but is endlessly replayable
ffvi is the best one but also the one that needed a remaster the least i d argue the original snes version looks better than the remastered version
such saving much wow
and aunts
is the correct price for an entire bundle at this point i m just gonna get the steam version of and play it on my deck
well now we have to have a duel to the death
i was waffling to get it on switch oled for those pixels on the oled now i too think i might get it on steamdeck guess i could always just pop the ps1 version on the vita but i was hoping to see if there were any qol changes in the pixel version
i ll go to bat for ff5 all day the job system is so well done and being able to cross class by carrying over abilities from other jobs makes this a top game in the entire ff series for me people might rag on the plot but i d say ff5 can stand with any other ff when it comes to emotional beats and while it can get real goofy at times it just adds to the charm x200b there s also that tacked on multiplayer aspect in the snes ps1 versions that might sound like a nothing feature but man i ve had a blast playing ff5 and with buddies as we build up our own characters sucks that the pixel remasters removed those features
how about this ffvi characters plot espers and all that however the characters can change class and move down different growth paths i don t wanna open it up completely but let s say each character can switch between classes and the options are different for each character with some overlap like celes can be magitek knight melee caster with magic sword techniques healer caster with white magic bonuses frost mage caster with ice bonuses swordsman melee with sword techniques maybe edgar can be machinist melee with tool electrician caster with bolt bonuses dragoon melee with leap royal i don t know something cool maybe cyan can be swordsman knight melee with auto protect regen samurai melee with dual wield maybe locke can be thief machinist pyromancer caster with fire bonuses healer plus unlockable characters include gen leo siegfried ultros kappa gestahl
like absolute cheapest you can maybe find a non gaming laptop for if you re fine with sticking to less graphically intensive games and sticking to game pass selection deep sales i guess a controller phone adapter can bring you down to under if you re really hurting for cash but your options will still be fairly limited even with gamepass are there actually games you want to play on there
i feel you man i was forced to be a mobile gamer cause i m poor so the only option i had was mobile gaming but a friend gave me a ps4 and then my journey through great game began
steam deck isn t too expensive and steam games are very cheap you get to have the mobility still but with pretty decent power and controls consoles are an easy option quest is pretty awesome although not really traditional gaming
thats the thing the last time i played a game it was on the gamecube i would love to know the cheapest route for games as well because you d still be buy a subscription on top of it all thats why using just my phone is what easist but havent ever used something like gamepass before to know i have been running my free games so far and truly am blown away how nice they are so im sure the cloud based game system is even better
yea i cant complain as i am blessed in other ways but i would love to step forward here it blows me away how good games have gotten honestly but i just want to be the smartest i can to figure it all out
so he thinks he s too good for them or something
beware of yoshi s history of tax evasion
well he should get back to accounting
a part and apart have exactly opposite meanings fyi
so if he isn t in accounting in which department is he
he s good to have around when the company needs to eat the costs
i would have him roaming the store eating any garbage he finds
i can only imagine how he got through accounting at school okay so if i took damage and baby mario fell off me but i had just grabbed stars how many seconds would i have until mario was snatched up
welcome to your ridiculous new accounting employeeemployee
i remember getting the blue red and green versions of these i m sure they re stored somewhere loved them
be aware that this new employee sometimes does fancy flying at lunch time so it might be distracting
what s he doing
yeah he s sittin there
enjoy the irs audit of your work soon
i wouldn t put yoshi in accounting i heard he commits tax fraud on a regular basis
this is fucking meta and i m here for it
how much pain in his eyes
makes sense he s not in accounting he d just commit tax fraud
he is secretly stealing money from the cash register
yeah i don t think yoshi does accounting for walmart
toats worth risking a harassment charge from hr
he d be useful if you need a lot of envelopes licked
ylummm
he s probably gonna fuck the companies taxes up
that s why yoshi was hired at the company
canonical proof https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dw_u71mxgaugxul?format=png&name=small).
that s a crime don t joke about crimes
they are referring to the typo lol
he s apartheid of accounting
all according to corporates plan i m sure


based on your request my recommendation prob a samsung odyssey monitor or a gigabyte one maybe an aoc monitor the quality is good with a price that wont break the bank
i ve had my samsung odyssey neo g7 since july and love it
for my not so great aging eyes i prefer pixel density over screen size my sweet spot is 4k and i just got an lg 27gn950 b which is a 4k but also has a high refresh rate 144hz like many monitors it isn t perfect but for my needs it s fantastic i can scale windows up to and everything remains razor sharp
lg c42 oled 120hz tv best monitor
i have the g9 non neo and it s great you mentioned issues with text readability but i have no idea why that would be a problem in this monitor just increase scaling if you can t see the words not that i ve had a single issue at defaults the only complaint would be it is reflective as hell so if you have sun shining directly on it then it is harder to see you would have to jump the brightness up or close your blinds
how does the odyssey do for text i have been looking at the g9 neo but many reviews say it s terrible with text and thus isn t a good monitor for working
how does the odyssey do for text i have been looking at the g9 neo but many reviews say it s terrible with text and thus isn t a good monitor for working
i think with the i would really have to double up on monitors i have 2x right now and i just can t see getting 4x the amount of info in the same space and it being practical for me having to upscale to takes away the advantage of the extra pixels
i have some aocs and i can not work on them the text is crisp but regardless of settings they go from bright enough to burn your soul or too dark to see
i don t know about those but fifa every year because the online is what keeps the game alive and everyone plays the new one
these yearly releases are moot because the significant changes are just the roster changes that could easily be done via updates hell they could make game last years if they wanted to they never will because idiots not only dump the for the initial price but the waste of money micros that justify ea to keep doing it over and over so nothing really unless the visual changes are worth the upgrade
my entire life because sports games are a big nope to me unless it s exaggerated like nba jam hang time nfl blitz etc
if you re interested in the online playing then its every year if you only care about single player you can stick to only one every or years and even then the gameplay doesnt change that much
how much does hockey xball change from year to year wrt the sport until there are enough rule or player changes to create a meaningfully different experience you don t need a new version the other axis is platform when the underlying engine improves enough to provide a meaningfully better experience that s another time to consider updating that s for you as mentioned if you play others on line you pretty much have to run what they re running
with my brothers and i in the 90s through the mid 2000s we got them every year then we switched to every other year then we all got game pass ultimate which includes ea play so it s the best way to play ea games every year and gpu also includes the show
idk my last sports game was from like
you can t just do it with updates that s not how the gameplay loop works the main popular game mode in fifa is ultimate team the idea in ultimate team is that you start with a barebones squad and throughout the year you build it up you get new cards from the weekly promos and most cards are only available for a short time more importantly the game starts at the beginning of the year where an rated card is considered good by the end of the year most of your team will be rated cards then the new game comes out you restart that said if i go back and play fifa my squad is still there same with etc all of my cards that i earned that year are still there on those games if i choose to boot it up the only way an update system would work for that game mode is to wipe progress every year all the crazy cards you packed that year are now gone teams are constantly swapping players sometimes the game loses the licensing rights for a team or even a country some players retire etc it might be greedy to charge full price for it every single year but releasing a new game every year is logistically the best option
they could easily do a sports game and make people buy a season pass every year
in other game s terms basically just open up a fresh start server with each new season you can choose you play on an older server fifa and play with other people who already have fully built teams or play on the brand new server fifa and start fresh with everyone else
dumbass doesn t know that shotgun damage is dependent on your aim and range so either way he s shit because he s shooting a shotgun from really far or aiming for your shoulders and not all the pellets are landing smh some people
clearly a 5yr old if they don t know how to spell correctly lol
squeakers be squeakn
well he should have got a gooder shot gun
zelda botw no idea why
the witcher
xenoblade
soulsborne games i like difficulty high skill ceilings fantasy settings real time combat and complex loot systems everything about those games is perfect for me but i just can t get into them for some reason
metal gear solid i like stealth games i love jrpgs and even the long drawn out cutscenes but mgs has never clicked for me
i find megaman rarely has one hit obstacles basically pitfalls or floor wall spikes and you get lives per level iirc i prefer the x series because the dash and wall climb provide alot more mobility compared to trad megaman i also think alot of appeal comes from finding the right weapons to exploit enemy weaknesses which might be not to your liking
the just cause series i love sandbox destruction games i also enjoy certain story games so it seems like it should be the perfect series wasn t bad but i barely did anything aside from fly in the wingsuit but the rest i didn t really like
stellaris
elder scrolls it has the fantasy swords and staffs motif that i m always drawn to and i don t usually like playing real time action games with a party that s when i want turn based or hybrid if it s all action i want to play solo i ve been trying to love this series since morrowind tried every entry never got past ten hours or so i just cannot get into them to save my life and it doesn t make much sense at the same time the witcher iii is one of my favorite games of the past decade
i wish i saw what everyone else does in elden ring the enemies are so uninteresting and feel like robots the torture porn of dying and losing those exp orbs was also not fun for me even the leveling system felt broken eventually it required so many exp points to level up that doing anything other than bosses was futile in that effort and the bosses weren t fun for me either i get the enjoyment of fighting some huge monster but having to die repeatedly in order to learn how to defeat it seems stupid to me it s also funny to me the macho attitude so many gamers have regarding fromsoft games as if you re a pussy if you don t enjoy frustrating gameplay i d rather do actual hard stuff irl and simply enjoy my time playing games
for the life of me i can t finish a single fire emblem
dragonball fighterz i m not the biggest dbz fan but i m a huge tag fighter fan mvc2 umvc3 skullgirls battle for the grid i love them all dbfz is a gorgeous game but for some reason i just really don t enjoy it s gameplay idk i don t really understand why but it just doesn t feel fun to me
nioh cannot get into it gotta have to give another try for the 4th time
borderlands only game series that i can think of where the art style made me not enjoy playing it
destiny
kingdoms of amalur high fantasy setting with interesting elements check fun gameplay that allows for great versatility check a story written by r a salvatore author of my favorite d d novel series check tie in event with my all time favorite scifi rpg series mass effect check and yet it utterly failed to keep my interest for more than ten hours
botw i love the art style and really wish i liked the game but i find it just painfully boring everything in the game feels like its just designed to waste my time and give the illusion of depth every activity feels the same and like busywork the combat feels slow and stilted at first i thought maybe i just didn t like open world games but then i played elden ring and morrowind and loved both of those i don t get why i like those two games but i don t like botw
i love stealth games but i can t stand styx master of shadows for some reason i should love it to death but something about it just rubs me the wrong way
witcher was a huge skyrim fan but i can t get past like an hour in it or less tried several times
my biggest gripe with botw was the actual sword combat the enemy ai was superb but also not fun in straight up fights the jump attack was utterly useless because every single enemy jumps away too fast for you to use it and then there were things that the game never actually tells you like how to defect those blue laser beams and not get ravaged by the guardians even at high levels i had to go online to learn those things plus the very minimalist story was not appealing i hope this new game has a more substantial story even if it s the same cliched tropes zelda has zone for decades
same i enjoyed it when i started but after i walked away for a bit i just can t get back into it
same here love big open world rpg s but i just can t get into it the story is quite interesting but the combat is so repetitive c
i feel the same about this entire trilogy i really really wanted to like this series and the gameplay combat is just so unfun i normally love big open story based games and can often forgive bad combat like in mass effect but for whatever reason the witcher just doesn t scratch the itch i though it would
git gud
despite having a reputation for being stealthy i never found mgs encouraged stealth gameplay usually i would tranquilize a guy and run for my life lol
the first game was by far the most fun i had with the franchise
spikes falling blocks and those spike balls in the water levels that you usually can t even see because you re falling downwards and on the next screen they re littered about
i agree with the second half personally i like finding areas that give me a lot of souls or whatever they re called in their respective games and just farming so much that the rest of the game is easy as cake to me i like to play fromsoft games for the atmosphere environments and boss fights that feel tense but i still know i can beat i never understood the borderline masochistic vibe of i died times to this boss but i finally got him i don t have the free time for that
i haven t played er but i tried ds and felt similarly to you i feel like i have to try elden ring because people are obsessed with it but i kind of already expect i ll not enjoy it to a lesser degree i have feelings like this about botw i get what people like about it but i think it s far far far from the best zelda game ever and i don t think it s a stretch to say it doesn t play like a zelda game
git gud
or is way better in every way
some people say it s overwhelming and no sense of actual direction is what puts people off that s open world for ya
i don t even mind repetitive combat as long as its engaging it s just not fun for some reason and the witcher should be one of my all time favorites i didn t even make it past hours or so i think i also didn t like that an rpg made me play a static character instead of having the ability to customize to some degree like mass effect thats pretty forgivable in a team based rpg but i never liked it in an rpg like this
i know exactly the levels you are talking about lol but to be fair the original games on the nes were very hard but x1 x2 i think are the perfect difficulty if you haven t tried x2 yet you might find it a bit more forgiving that the others if you feel like giving the series another shot
which one was that i do think the quality of the x games fell off a cliff after x and are amazing is pretty good is mid but was the intended end to the series by inafune i remember being bad and didnt bother with the other two definitely recommend trying x or x2 though x3 is good but gets complicated and x4 has two different characters in x and zero that control differently
yeah i agree about botw i still enjoyed it but i didn t love it like i did with tp or oot another with elden ring i didn t mention is that world just felt so bad it was not like a skyrim or ubisoft open world it was literally just dark souls but no level loading there were no villages or really any npc s it was just a fake feeling world full of bad guys
and this point zelda inspired games are better than actual zelda games deaths door and tunic are a way better experience than anything botw could offer me this is just my opinion i love zelda clones could care less about actual zelda games
git original
honestly i like both types static character or customized and some of my favourite games only allow you to play a static character i just could not get into witcher at all just not fun for some reason pretty much sums it up for me too i just don t know why
honestly a lot of what you re seeing is kinda making me feel better about not buying it it s quite pricey and i don t really want to spend that much on a game i m feeling hesitant about in regards to the world feeling bad i also am kinda over high fantasy i really prefer interesting unique bright or vibrant worlds seeing the same medieval gothic fantasy settings with the grey and black pallette feels so meh i have a similar experience with fps nowadays i used to love the genre things like unreal tournament goldeneye perfect dark timesplitters quake etc all felt so cool and had interesting settings and unique weapon design but every modern fps is just military based shooter that tries to be hyper realistic and even if it s got sci fi elements usually it s just some bland pew pew laser gun or something still set in crumbling buildings and warzones
i would agree there s tons of great zelda likes out there but i still love a lot of zelda games twilight princess and oot are fantastic and most of the top down 2d zeldas i love minish cap lttp all still great
oh yea for sure i meant botw specifically and now totk it s too sandbox for me
magikarp can learn cut with those nipples
looking at that picture my metapod is so hard right now

snitties got nothing on fish nips
all the bots at ferox enclave
magikarp use hyperbeam wutthefuckyoumean you don t know hyper beam just use splesh etteck
natty carp
fight me
use harden
zaff brannagin magikarp use wet and sexxyy
my caterpie just used string shot
its got some hitbox and fluidity issues but its a fun romp and presentation combat does feel less gimmicked than greedfall
yes combat is much better though it coukd use better balancing and i think most of bosses probablydon thave enough health optimization is bad so check the requirements before you buy but it feels more polished overall keep in mind that it is a different genre there are some choices and multiple endings but it s more of an action game than an rpg
steamdeck witcher3 in bed
i think it boils down to them being really cool things to have aaa titles on a mobile device is insane just owning something like that is awesome
i don t live in a warzone i play it on a long train ride and i ll be sitting i also play it in pockets of time i also play it when someone s using the tv i can also play in bed because bed is more comfy than a couch i can also play a bit while waiting switch doesn t have a lot of games compared to pc i emulation ps2 and other systems several thousands of game roms and pc games i have backlogs i can clear aa or indie or retro handheld gba psp games on it and reserves aaa games when i get home i prefer to buy games on steam deck over switch xbox playstation because of cheaper price on pc and console tends to close their digital stores and render the library useless over time i can also be physically close to my girlfriend while she s watching tv not everyone has the luxury of having interrupted long gaming time
because i ve got a backlog of them that are steamdeck capable i need to play them but i only play games away from home when time is there i go work with my wife weekends at the local farmer s market so i game there on flights it is another time for example
you don t you re suppose to play your pc games while taking a shit
because i don t need a tv to play i have year old daughter i only play emulators on my phone because she is always watching cartoons so if i could play cup head on a portable in my bed while she watches tv i would love it i probably wouldn t play outside my house but inside
for me it s not about playing on the go it s about playing while not sitting upright at my desk in my office playing games is a lot more fun lounging on my bed or my sofa also allows me to play games while traveling
one of my coworkers plays a steamdeck on his breaks and on his way to and from the office on the bus he has a one year old and a three year old so i d imagine it s the only time he gets to play video games and i d bet there are plenty of other people in similar situations not just parents but students people with other hobbies or pursuits that aren t so portable etc
lifestyle compatibility if you live inside your car you don t have much of a choice
yeah i thought the same thing i m actually even considering the rog ally but not even to play outside my home lol just for chilling in the bed or on the couch lol but just for that not really worth it
i actually fully agree with the couch being close to spouse kids aspect funny because for a portable device that s one of the main aspects that seems to keep coming up lol
just curious when you play at the farmer s market it s during what a lunch break
year old always watching tv doesnt seem healthy
i ll get the steamdeck but will never play it lol
just here and there i just pause the game and sell or pack then back on it when done
yeah everybody create his sons the way they need wants
hmm nice that s great for you that you re able to enjoy it that way i personally am unable to enjoy a game on and off like that but if you can i envy you lol
wasn t always like that i just recently learned how to enjoy games like that a few years ago having kids helped a lot
having kids make us learn to play like this because we have to it either that or stop playing hahahha
no if they are planning to release the same fortnite rocket league sequel in future basically the same game just to create hype mint money from their popular franchise yes if they are creating something new creative really interesting ips using their unreal engine because unreal engine have good potential in future
there is no need to they have fortnite rocket league and fall guys plus they currently are publishing alan wake and also published rumbleverse which flopped i think epic games doing fine updating their ongoing games and publishing a few newer games
i was about to come in and mention jazz jackrabbit been waiting for a third for a while now
no
looks like they could drop a mean roaring 20s heavy rock hybrid album at any moment
shiet i was suppose to finish village before i started re4 lol whoops
she really should ve been the main villain of village
she s a perfect female counterpoint to ramon salazar and has the most genuinely interesting story and elements out of the four even her name dimitrescu is darkly satirical if you know the etymology behind it
my buddy had success deleting the install folder in safe mode and going back through a normal login and reinstalling via the xbox app
have you tried turning your pc off and on again
download is done through microsoft store app
wsreset
unfortunately i can t delete the folder i tried deleting the game in settings and now i don t know where it is i think i know which drive it should have installed to but its not in the folder i made for xbox and again i can t acceess the windowsapps folder so i can t check there
i fucked my libraries over nothing i m speechless the xbox app doesn t work but the default store seems to handle it just fine
tried that didn t work
yeah i had issues with all this trash last year and ended up going to far deleting and changing process settings and borked my drive haven t had issues since reformatting but i feel your pain
did you get the chance to play the incredible hulk ultimate destruction
i totally forgot about this game absolutely awesome game
super good game and if you like the developer check out prototype and also super fun
now watch the amazing bulk
is this the one where you just destroy stuff
i miss licensed movie tie in video games imagine if the trend never died and we got games for avengers endgame spider man nwh or a black panther game
definitely a product of its era lots of games then had a very similar style
this is actually on my list of games to buy
this was my childhood i loved playing it over and over
i remember when i get home from school i had this and little big planet on my ps3
that one was intense loved it
sadly no but i ll definitely give it a go
this one i remember there was a skill that let the hulk rip a car in and wear the halves like gloves to boost his power thought that was so badass
yeah i m having a blast
thanks for the recommendations
sega
lol sounds like a porno
no this is the one that s kinda based on the eric bana movie you re probably thinking of ultimate destruction
absolutely that hulk game took an entire summer from me back in the day i was totally shocked about it when i first head of it and tried it out i was all where the hell was this game the whole time
better than sex tbh
holy shit what a flashback i loved the ultimate destruction game omg i need to find a copy on ebay
holy mother of pearl it s a real movie lmao
oh it s real bad
i ll take your word for it lol
battery life minutes
looks cool but my mom said to avoid std
the literally dark days before hi res backlit screens who remembers trying to game on a car trip at night only being able to move when passing under a streetlight
who in their right mind would call their game company std a confused gamer nerd probably
i owned this when i first released pretty much had to get the handyboy to game on long family trips at night
i wanna be sedated with a gameboy
holy shit best is called out directly i have not seen an advertisement for that company in a long time a long time
none of the stores at the bottom exist anymore
i got an std from a handy boy
it would help ensure that the pokemaster wielding it would never need fear any other std
me as 8yo begging my dad to get std
who in their right mind would name their game company std avgn
it is a real mouthful alright
they ve got you covered like a jimmy hat
that stick doesn t look comfortable at all
std https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymfzwcfrpzk)
std we can help you win uuuuuhhhhh
slight overkill there just a tad
gamestop is in there if you re old enough
i remember thinking this was the shit and my life would be made perfect by having one
well thats an unfortunate business name
i thought the idea of a handy was to avoid getting an std
owning this was such a flex back in the early 90s
i used to have this great for road trips
breathing intensifies
hey how did they get a picture of my gameboy and all its accessories
i had this for my game boy color
fully loaded by std snickered the teenage boy in me
it s like a never ending entendre just keep peeling back layers of sexual innuendo
std can help me win
i had one of these for my gbc the best part was it had a built in light in the magnifying glass not sure if it was this brand
don t say it don t say it don t say it
had a similar thing for my gbc and it was pretty obnoxious to use and the light kinda sucked but i guess you take what you can get back in those days
lol i vaguely remember this from ads in old magazines but never saw one irl
biblically accurate game boi
they called it the std because if you had this you were going to get so much pussy you were bound to get one eventually
if i didn t know any better i would think this was a mock advertisement made as a joke
the handy
be cautious when your gamer girlfriend says she picked up an std on her vacation
considering the gameboy was monophonic the stereo would have just been dual mono channels still cool though
i had this as a kid and i loved it the joystick and button attachment wasn t great but the speakers and screen magnifier were really cool
i had that motherfucker and it was glorious
jesus christ my little night light for my gameboy ate batteries like crazy you d need like an ammo belt of em to get through moms hair appointment with this thing
i had this did not remember that name tho lol
this is not even my final form
battery lasted long enough for you to get to the title screen lmao
i think nintendo is the only company mentioned in this ad that still exists got real nostalgia seeing those best and kaybee logos
all this just to get stunlocked by wrap in pokemon red lololol
i ll see your handy boy raise you a booster https://images.nintendolife.com/fcf4c970f77cf/wheres-the-game-boy.large.jpg)
i had that
i too watch avgn every nite to sleep
this looks like it weighed like pounds all together
oh god i had this monstrosity for my gameboy good old days
i m not scrolling down to check who wrote i can t wait to get an std
ooh ooh pick me i want an std
that is a very unfortunate brand name
being fully loaded and getting an std go hand in hand
i feel like i contracted a std by looking at that
i can t wait to get an std
fully loaded handy boy mouthful std
only time getting an std is good
byline should say your boy s alright but my boy s got an std
ceo staggeringly drunk we re gonna be called std and sell handy boys
i know there s a portability joke to make here but i can t handle it right now need more hands to think of one but im not handy enough to think of one my hands arent enough for this ok how many downvotes are gonna get me so many bad and lame puns about hands
for all the people making std jokes don t learn c
deleted
i had one
when i was my uncle gave me an std
didn t this thing drain the batteries in like minutes the speakers alone would pull a lot
i prefer my handy boy to make it fully unloaded 
well it definitely looks infected with something i can tell you that much
the booster boy is much more overkill tbh
i had this and it was the dopest shit ever
a fully loaded std nice
so practical
it looks terrible and awesome at the same time
loved it
it works like shit
i had this one i didn t play much
ah yes a handy boy from std my favorite
i got an std but all ot did was make my pee pee sting
i wanted this back in the day
it makes me think of a synthwave music with 80s vibes for no reason
man they had some accessories back in the day
this is what i thought whenever i d see people tethering controllers to their mobile phones
looks fun but my science teacher told me not to go too near someone with an std oh wait what not that kind of std oh wait
thank you sexually transmitted disease for giving me this cool looking gameboy
a handy usually means you settled for less
i m currently sitting on two of these things without the dpad or the battery pack attachments so i can t see if they actually work lol
the handy boy from std is the best protection against stds maybe that s why they called it handy
reminds me of the old netgear his battery lasted around minutes
why get the small one
friend of mine had this thing it was stupid heavy and awkward so he used it once and then tossed it
fully loaded they knew what they were doing didn t they also learned about this from the avgn gb accessories video he made a few years ago
o boy std in my hand
ah yes the iron man of handheld gaming consoles
at that you might as well get a gamegear
i have a handy boy color the magnifying glass light and speakers are awesome the control stick is not
i love how creative things used to be with nintendo products this is really cool
isn t a handy boy someone who is very touchy but also how far have we come that you don t need a magnifying glass lamp and speakers to play tetris
legend says that every time you win a game there is someone else posting in a sub somewhere about how sbmm is broken and their lobbies are too hard
yeah i hate this the people running around with red dots etc on snipers are infuriating it changes day to day however some days i ll be k d in almost every game and others i ll play two matches and call it a day
dude for real do you not know that cod splits controller and keyboard you were in a new different sbmm pool as a newbie of course you kicked ass for a few rounds you were starting at level fucking one and now you re still getting fine tuned it s not a fucking magic wand that says behold thine level and places you at your exact skill level it fine tunes it as you play more it needs data to work with to figure out where you are you stomp and get stomped until you find an equilibrium like two people trying to balance on a see saw
i try and counter this by playing with friends the game will match the overall elo of your team with other teams if you re the better of your friends the game generally tends to be somewhat balanced then you do get the odd game where it s just rigged for you to lose
lord shaxx provides
sony hey can i copy your homework nintendo yeah sure just make sure to change some stuff
no only if they place the x at least one of the right places it is literally in the exact wrong place of any other system this would lead to chaos
you do realize that sony is japanese right not chinese
i want to hold it
would be a good controller to pair with a retro console assuming the dpad is right sadly the company will only put about of the qc required and it ll suck like a hoover with a full bag
this must be how they play in australia
looks ass tbh
buttons are fucked up
i can t tell if i love it or hate it
they literally worked together on a new console that s basically how the playstation came into being
to be fair at the time the super nintendo controller was considered one of the best not to mention their temporary partnership
oh wow that s quite interesting it was there in the beginning x is supposed to be for cancel o is supposed to be for accept it s often this way for japanese games and this is a tradition established from nintendo with a on the right for accept and b on the left for back cancel american games are often the inverse with the accept button on the left and back cancel to the right i believe this is because of sega having better third party support and companies like ea putting most of their games only on sega systems sega having buttons on the face in the order of a accept b back cancel and c menu considering the playstation was supposed to be a snes cd drive i ve always assumed their accept and back cancel used the nintendo orientation because of this or at least at one time it was going to be the inverse or someone before production remarked that having x on their accept button was counter intuitive
i think they do china makes the majority of cheap retro controllers
yes but you saying bootlegs and legit products are stamped made in japan
pega did a amazing ps1 clone
or left handed
nah is the japanese version of the american version
you sound as if i didn t already know about how the playstation came to be lol
i still think the super nintendo controller fucking rules i want the 8bitdo xbox controller in that form factor but apparently it s only for android hardware womp womp
it is also like this in japanese firmwares or bios of ps1 and also on the psp and the ps vita and don t forget the psx
yep when you think about that way the psx button layout is the snes layout it s only the american x o swap that changed it which is the layout both sega and microsoft later used
why would i want a trash bootleg controller i have worked video game retail and let me tell you they always suck
wish that was the norm
no u
one of my faves for 2d games and stuff is actually the sega saturn controller very comfortable but don t get me wrong the snes controller is great
there are some good companys like 8bitdo
it s super weird as someone with tinnitus i often don t hear it in the game and so miss sound cues or have to wonder if i m hearing it from the game or my own ringing lol
i don t really notice it tbh though i don t usually wear a headset so maybe my speakers aren t as aggressive with it i don t mind it when it is used right like an explosion in a story and your character is dazed or something but when it is just random for no point i could do without i do appreciate the newer shooters opting to let you turn it off in accessibility settings at least i noticed it in the new mw2 anyway
i don t know if it tinnitus but when they do that it gets weird for me as i have a constant low level buzzing in my ears not ringing just a buzzing but if games have a low level buzzing i doubt i would hear it
i have tinnitus in both ears and often don t even hear that noise in games it sucks when that s the sound cue being used as my tinnitus is pretty loud and never quiet and hasn t been in a decade at least eta i have significant hearing loss in one ear so i probably shouldn t rely on sound cues anyway
as someone with hearing damage i agree
i ve never noticed this but i also don t play with headphones
what games have it
take it as a sign not to wear headphones
i was kinda wondering how people who actually have it feel about it i definitely get some light ringing sometimes and i m kinda worried my repeated exposure lately is going to make it worse
i was actually going to include a comment about toggle based settings but couldn t put it into coherent words i ve had occasions where even when used right like an explosion they go so overboard with making it realistic i have to rip my headphones off though
i can get that especially with suspenseful games where they add quiet tracks to try to tense you up while exploring somewhere spooky
man thus comment section is turning out much more depressing yet enlightening than i thought it would i m sorry you have to deal with that
can can you hear it is this sarcasm or is it worse for you because of said hearing damage
off the top of my head days gone all three tomb raiders all three metro games control the new spider man games pretty much any shooter
this is probably the least constructive solution to the problem one could think of a lot of people use headphones for things like playing games when your kids are asleep but still wanting to hear the game or pc players as lots of monitors don t have audio output not to mention the obvious point of it being so much more immersing or tactically advantageous for people who play shooters or stealth based games where spacial audio is important
light ringing some times is pretty normal tinnitus is basically constant in my experience i only ever hear silence like once a month maybe for mins it s awful
fair i might just be numb to it at this point i also listen to my music at ungodly levels with headphones so maybe i m just half deaf haha
don t be depressed about it i ve had tinnitus in my mostly deaf ear for pretty much my whole life started having ear issues at like years old idk when the other ear started its eternal chorus of eeeeeeeees but i m used to the noise at any rate lol
i have hearing damage that causes things like that to linger in one ear i don t have much for definition in that ear either
i m not sure i understand you but usually that sound is used as effect of getting hit in the head or after exlosion
wasn t meant to be a solution to bad sound design just that regular headphone use for video games will cause hearing damage regardless of what you are playing if you are already experiencing short bouts of tinnitus be careful
i can only imagine is there any sort of medication that sounds maddening no pun intended
eternal chorus of eeeeeeeees is probably the most tame way to describe it i love it
yes those are examples of when it happens and it happens a lot more in some games than in others more examples are getting clotheslined in days gone plenty of random set pieces in tomb raider attacks from psychic type enemies in games like prey and so on getting hit in the head or stunned in ways other than some sort of explosion also happen way more than they need to looking at you dying light and the metro trilogy
not that i know of no mine came about because i had a slight unknown injury inside my ear i put in some wax removal oil stuff you can get in any ol shop but little did i know there s a lot of research that shows the stuff is highly damaging to the important parts of your ears if you have any kind of abrasion or damage to the skin in there it never heals or gets better and there s no real treatment outside mindfulness and the like
catch me on a day it does annoy me and i ll have angrier words to call it
man i am so sorry
thanks i ll survive though i hate it a lot and it breaks me down some times but when it gets terrible i just try to remind myself that there s people that would kill to be able to hear like i do even with ringing so while my situation is bad and someone else having a worse situation doesn t make mine better it does help me appreciate what i do have i can hear that s pretty awesome
thanks for sharing i got diagnosed with meniere s back in haven t had a moment of silence for as long as i can remember
that s the one that comes with dizziness sounds real rough hope you are holding in there good
i believe most rocksmith people are sticking with version and are playing chereb rock on repeat wink
cannot attest to rocksmith but i got rocksmith remastered for cheap and then just downloaded the songs i want there are a bunch of youtube videos on how to download songs and load them into rocksmith
god of war and horizon zero dawn are near the very top of this rarified list
i have found both spider man and god of war to be fantastic
played bloodborne on psnow on my pc and it was amazing
uncharted and lost legacy
basically all of them except tlou pt one for now spider man gow detroit death stranding horizon
gran turismo obviously
all of them except lou and days gone lou will be good once the port is fixed so wait until then days gone is good but not for everyone so i recommend looking up gameplay before buying i recommend it though
as everyone else said gow and spiderman though i found spider man to be a and how to be a
i played days gone on steam i enjoyed it enough to finish it the story and characters are mediocre and the gameplay is a bit clunky but the open world was decent and fighting the hordes was fun i also played spiderman on steam liked it well enough swinging around the city is the best part of the game if you don t want punch sponge enemies then play on easy
thanks as someone who owns and completed gow and on ps2 and part played gow on ps now of those two games i may elect for god of war i hate though why some game titles are re used on re boots like tomb raider and gow
many thanks i read that there is a deluxe version of spiderman miles morales that includes an enhanced port of spiderman is that the bundle i should go for or makes no difference if i go for spiderman on its own and then mm later
thanks the only soulsborne game i own is dark souls scholar of the first sin on pc and i like it is bloodborne also ported fully or only on ps now
thanks around i completed uncharted and on ps now was ok sucked is one of the greatest games i ve ever played do and ll match up to
thanks am considering spiderman and gow
many thanks days gone sounds like a post apocalyptic title something like fallout maybe lol sony seem to have a thing for the post apocalyptic genre looking at their games
many thanks if it s only one game i get therefore i will make it gow what pulled the spiderman score down for you
gow is one of those games that sticks with you i ve been a gamer since the early 80s and played every game worth mentioning gow is in my top if not my top i m currently on my second play through of breath of the wild played it on release in it s just pure magic even now it s just wonderful top possible the best
you might get an advantage on pricing but the games should be the same i played spiderman for about hours including all the dlcs and immediately moved on to miles morales and i m still having a blast i would have expected to be tired of it by now but the games are just that damn good
it s just on psnow unfortunately and last i checked the expansion wasn t included still really great though
imo and lost legacy are the best of the series although others may disagree
i d go spider man and gow
spiderman s gameplay and the story are not as good as gow and combat is slightly above average the only great thing i found in spider man was the visuals and movement swinging but in gow i liked the cinematics the gameplay and story and genuinely tried to stretch out the game so that i can play it for longer but that s only my opinion though
many thanks i m turning this month and am also gaming since the early 80s commodore in to those were happy years i have heard lots about botw a damn shame nintendo would never allow pc ports my first and only foray into nintendo was the original wii but i ditched console gaming after that to stick to pcs i personally think exclusives hurt gamers we don t get films or music on exclusive platforms so all can enjoy
great i ll do some research on the prices many thanks
many thanks
many thanks i may go for uncharted ll spiderman mm gow out of interest assuming you have played the original three games which of those three did you find best i have no idea quite what made so good maybe it was the mythology of the tree of life or the set pieces perhaps u3 i found paled by comparison
many thanks am i right in assuming that i needn t have played gow ascension so gow i can jump straight into as if it s unrelated so to speak
if i were you i d buy a switch purely for botw genuinely it s that good
it s been a while since i played them but i remember liking u3 more than the others u1 was too clunky control wise it had some outdated game mechanics and the story was a bit silly u2 was ok but i don t remember thinking it was as good as everyone thought it was although some of its set pieces collapsing building train were pretty impressive u3 seemed like the more grounded and realistic of the trilogy it also had pretty impressive set pieces sinking ship the plane sequence i never particularly liked the supernatural aspects of the first games maybe that s why i liked u3 better than the others it s also probably why i think u4 and lost legacy are the best
yup for sure gow is the reboot starts a brand new story different combat all good
collapsing building and train sequences you read my mind
thanks a ton
for those who like the game but more help with it there is wemod
they literally have metroid warmup has to be different to merit the effort
consoles are always cheaper as the hardware is sold at a loss
consoles are cheaper but games are more expensive than on pc specially considering the multiple sales a year from seller like steam
yup console gaming is more budget friendly than pc gaming
pc has a much better selection of games and the catalog is absolutely massive i used to be console only but i got my first gaming rig years ago and decided not to upgrade my console after i realized it would just be gathering dust
depends on the games you want to play if you just play the most popular games and aaa games then console is better pc though has way more games of all genres mods no paid online optionally better graphics and performance you don t need to buy a pc to get into pc you can find deals and build the same pc you are referring to for like instead
i m currently building my new pc my old one is years old and still running modern games but the fans on the cpu are faulty and i m starting to play games on medium settings i m watching sales on new egg i snagged a amd ryzen 5800x3d for i also got a amd radeon rx for with a free digital copy of tlou i set the budget to but patience will let me build it for far less
i like to play strategy games series such as hearts of iron age of empires and total war so pc is necessary for me but if you don t care about pc exclusives then a console is probably more budget friendly buying a console is cheaper than pc hardware you can also buy used games for consoles to save money which isn t possible with pc also xbox game pass is a fantastic value and i don t think any other platform has as much bang for your buck as xbox however i ve been a pc gamer for about years and i absolutely love it steam is by far the best game store app with frequent sales you don t have to pay a subscription for online multiplayer the exclusives are top tier especially strategy games and the graphics frame rates are way better if you have good hardware also xbox exclusives are regularly released on pc and even playstation exclusives have started getting released on pc the last few years i wouldn t trade my pc for a console but if you have a tight budget then i think consoles make sense especially the xbox i would avoid the nintendo switch because while the hardware is very cheap the games are almost always even for old games and sales are rare nintendo is super greedy
invest in a pc it can do much more than a console also you don t need a state of the art pc to game on start with something that will do the job and upgrade when you want
if it s solely truly for gaming and you re not planning on gaming online get a console unless you re also a fan of buying a game once and always having the ability to play it then get a pc
as a pc gamer stick to console that s what i ll be doing when my pc finally gives up the ghost
you said it yourself xbsx is less than the pc are you going to buy so many games that the difference between xbox sale prices and steam sale prices is how would you possibly have time to play that many games
my custom laptop with same specs as my ps5 cost aud after new year sales calculation compared to just aud for ps5 ps5 can do both 4k and 1080p flawlessly while my laptop can only do 1080p smoothly for latest games plus physical games most cost effective option to buy games for console on day
for budget gaming yes console gaming is still superior however pcs are better long term my friend built a decent setup during the amazon sales for about not counting monitors honestly real budget gaming is buying a samsung tv and using xcloud or amazon luna or nvidia geforce now
an xsx can do 4k ray tracing at fps
depends on what you re wanting out of it but for a budget consoles are a cheaper alternative
you couldn t make a new pc for with the same gaming capabilities and same ssd as an xsx or ps5 and include a controller not even close i haven t mathed it out but you d probably have to spend 1k or more and you d have to build it which requires some time effort unless you buy a prebuilt but then that just makes the cost go up more so the answer is yes gaming consoles are far more value for money for gaming purposes than pcs right now
you ve had a lot of answers already but as others have said if you re looking strictly budget friendly for right now then yes console gaming is the way to go what it looks like you re missing is those consoles aren t hitting 4k ray tracing 60fps natively they re using upscaling techniques which you can also use on pc x200b that being said you could build a budget pc for under that could get you into 4k territory with some upscaling then upgrade cards if you really want that ray tracing capability personally having played both with and without there are only a few games i ve found it to be a game changer and worth the extra headroom needed in power x200b with consoles you re already upgrading for every cycle and they re now adding in half cycle upgrades too plus the xsx which you mentioned here is the least powerful of the recent gen and struggles to hit 60fps on some newer titles you re basically just asking yourself would you rather upgrade full new consoles every few years or get a new card every few years x200b i built a pc last february that was within my budget around total around october i got a killer deal on a card upgrade went from an rx6600 to an rx xt when the was down around i could find cheaper 6800xt cards but the one i have typically sits around i won t need to get a new card unless this one dies for a long time my pc is more powerful than current gen consoles and when next gen comes out it will still be competitive enough that i won t really feel the need to upgrade but you might want to if you re still on console x200b at the end of the day yes consoles are more budget friendly right now but a good pc will last longer with the money that s put into it
it s always been more budget friendly
pc if you build it yourself but yes sx or ps5 are better value for casual users if you buy games on discs not digital lease copies
you literally answered your own question
upfront yes but pc is much cheaper to maintain and xbox has only a fraction of the offering xbox games even on discount can barely match the price on pc the standard price for a new aaa xbox game is but on pc with 3rd party key sellers i can even find re4 deluxe edition on pc cheaper than standard version on console right now you can spend to get death stranding aliens fireteam elite rollerdrome life is strange and some titles on humble monthly there s no way xbox or any console can match that there are also dynamic pricing and complete your collection feature on steam too i can also use any cheap available peripherals and consoles on pc i also do not need to pay for online gaming online is free xbox also uses proprietary storage which is expensive compared to off the shelf storage like a normal ssd on pc and i can t play many games like spider man or uncharted or final fantasy remake on a xbox
not always from a value performance pov it s cyclical certainly right now a console is probably winning that fight though
how insane are these sales on steam i did get the tomb raider trilogy on steam for like but then my macbook couldnt play it wasn t powerful enough so i re bought it on xsx for slight increase but still for games is pretty good imo because the sales i get on the microsoft store are like off if you wait long enough every year i get the newest cod in december for off for xsx
console digital storefronts have steam like sales frequently nowadays
i want a pc in the future myself but i can t see the cost being something i m happy to pay for a decent setup
damn that s wild and hopeful
it can do much more than a console does this apply if i already have a macbook pro and a work computer specifically for gaming what more can a pc do than a console mods higher frame rate and ultra setting graphics
my xsx is in my living room with my sony x90cj 4k qled if i build a computer it ll just be in my living room plugged into the same tv and using an xbox controller i don t plan on streaming any games just using steam epic and battle net
it uses upscaling same as a ps5 neither console is able to put out 4k ray tracing at 60fps natively you could build a pc to hit those specs for less than if you also employ some upscaling
yup
there was also the big advantage of sales in the early 2010s the console shops were never selling games at off like steam was thats changed for xbox and playstation as they ve gotten more competitive
the best deals aren t on steam various bundle websites like humble bundle or fanatical can give some great value and other websites that sell legitimate steam keys from the devs publishers not the 3rd party grey market sites will also have some deep discounts
i d only really recommend pc if you really want to play mouse and keyboard games
not a closed eco system cheaper and more available games beta games better games early access games i ve owned consoles and always go back to pc gaming especially since consoles charge a fee to play online
much wider selection of games emulation and better selection of input devices
any recommendations for gpu and cpu for that would i need or 16gb ram
sounds like that s what you d want then
since when what titles
not digital but you ve always had physical 2nd hand though
thank you
thank you yeah the big selling point for me would be to play games that i cant play on xsx
sure it really depends on your budget and making sure you aren t leaving power on the table if your budget allows i play everything ultra 1440p right now and i just did some testing in rdr2 so i could get you some actual numbers here x200b graphics card asus tuf 6800xt oc edition cpu ryzen 5600x 32gb ddr4 ram x200b 1440p ultra native fps depending on where i m looking 1440p ultra with amd fsr performance fps 1440p ultra with amd fsr quality fps x200b if my monitor was 4k i could easily kick up to 4k and hit 60fps admittedly this is without ray tracing as rdr2 doesn t have that baked in but everything that can be on is on and as high as it can go also you can get away in most titles with 16gb of ram still some recent games have asked for and you ll be future proofed but it s not necessary i only upgraded because i gave a friend my old 16gb and upgraded to x200b past that you re making a choice on how important ray tracing is to you amd offers great cards at good prices but they really don t hold a candle to how good nvidia is at ray tracing the trade off being you re spending significantly more money for their cards my card normally runs around i got it for about on a crazy good deal an equivalent nvidia card ti would be closer to normally
i assume always it s the reason i bought an xsx in re2 re3 gears cod cold war etc https://knowtechie.com/which-xbox-series-xs-games-have-ray-tracing/
a steamdeck is another top tier option if you re interested in a wider game catalogue than a console will offer mine has been extremely useful for emulating anything outside of the current console generation and you have access to steam s library of games as well
if you re set on the living room setup it s probably worth buying a lapdog style setup they have unfortunately become less and less supported recently but having a full kb m setup on your lap without the limitations of the bluetooth touchpad style ones makes actual gaming so much better i d also add since you re using it as a living room setup you have a much better selection of streaming platforms to choose from and the dreaded pirated content not that anyone would do that
thank you
most likely not some titles won t do fps at 4k and will get to 1440p
are you able to setup the steamdeck to a monitor and play in 4k
thank you like this https://youtu.be/_6ne0gaplhg?t=323)
i saw you d had another question mentioning a few cards that i can t seem to find here x200b if your budget is or less for 4k you re going to be looking at some of the cheaper 6800xt cards maybe a 6700xt if you want to go with an amd radeon card if you want nvidia for the ray tracing you re looking at s or under s are still crazy expensive for what they offer x200b a big part of the performance of cards as well is going to be vram most of the s i m seeing have around 8gb of vram and the 6700xt s tend to have around x200b the vram is basically faster ram that sits right on your graphics card instead of on a different part of the motherboard so it s quicker for the gpu and cpu to relay information typically things like textures might be stored here and in a lot of recent games the 8gb will get eaten through pretty quickly x200b i was curious and wanted to do some more testing so i loaded up sons of the forest as a more recent test x200b my card has 16gb of vram about 9gb were taken up when running around the overworld and about 17gb of ram x200b still at 1440p ultra fps 4k would definitely drop it down a bit but with some upscaling or turning a few settings down could easily keep 4k60 with no major drawbacks
you can connect it to a monitor or tv but i sincerely doubt it would support over 1080p edit apparently i was wrong it can do 4k 60hz when docked and connected to a tv you can also connect a controller to it via bluetooth
yeah exactly the lapdog is pretty crap though ngl but at least it s upgradable i can t remember the brand of the one i was looking at a while ago but it was a really good platform even though the keyboard wasn t upgradable
thank you honestly i m less concerned about ray tracing just want 4k60fps which you touched on
i had not read that about the steam deck that is an awesome deal you can also expand the storage yourself with an nvme ssd so a tb would be around or so you really do not have to get the 7k read write ones damn if my pc dies out i will be going with a steam deck i already have games on steam and such
awesome thank you for your feedback and insight
just chuggin fuckin lonlon milk
talon from the legend of zelda ocarina of time so you re telling me malon is mario s sister
true and ingo is luigi s
yeah talon and ingo are parodies of the mario brothers talon the face of the farm lazy and worthless ingo the jealous hardworking farm hand who believes himself better wonder if nintendo was sending us a message
if you haven t seen it mario s dad in the new movie looks like this did nintendo make a mario reference in zelda then go and make a zelda reference in mario with the same character
mario
i honestly didn t expect much different
yea and bowser is an incel
dario
the color scheme and the yellow necklace is just screamin chris chan right now
this reminds me of that smg4 video where mario goes to hyrule then he eventually finds this guy they get along very well
he probably having some rock and stone flashbacks
fuckin guns
dead
not gonna lie i kind of had a crush on him when i was younger lol
its a me daddio
wake him up we got shit to do

it s so funny that they then then went and referenced zelda in mario with the same character mario s dad looks like talon in the mario movie
yes
happy cake day
you see those colors and think chris chan
especially with the yellow necklace hell yeah i do
funny glitch that happened to me on ps5 p thought it worth showing but not sure if this has been discovered recorded before might delete from my channel again after a while though
depends which game s you re looking for larger ones are more likely obviously ark has at least large ones that i know of that are strictly devoted to finding servers r playarkservers and r survivetogether but you re looking for like one big conglomerate site
site or subreddit yeah it s cool to see what other games people are keeping online out there in some capacity
despite it having only 240hz i would go for the asus one since it s an oled panel and higher resolution tn panels look like absolute trash and even if it is 360hz the much worse color and resolution isnt worth it beside that the difference between and is miniscule despite the second being higher your eyes wont really see much of a difference
i have the samsung odyssey g7 1440p 240hz and i love it this is my first curved monitor which i was skeptical of but after using it i have no regrets i play shooters on it and it s just incredible
all the way just isn t enough for most things these days the difference between and is huge the difference between between and is barely perceptible
no monitor can compete in the competitive market with dyac technology playing games isnt color accuracy its not even a contest for zowies dyac get the zowie 2566k not any other casual bs if you wanna play sp games rather buy lg cx or and play it om the telly
it depends on the size of the monitor anything under go 1080p anything or above go at least 1440p personally i dont notice a difference after about 180fps and above so i would say is perfectly fine
yadda yadda yadda oled 1440p that should be enough of an answer lol dont do with a beast system like that
last i saw pubg was cancelled
thank you for reply btw 360hz is with dyac and 240hz is without dyac but have ms of response time
is there a noticeable difference between and hz i m on hz 1440p and i d much rather go up to 4k than worry about any more fps
thank you for this exactly dyac reduces motion blur to the great extent
1440p 240hz oled without dyac 1080p 360hz tn with dyac
thank you for the reply
the new project is named something else i think project black budget it is under construction it will be similar to pubg but with pvpve
your eyes have limited function anything past fps you won t notice screen tear or anything else just buy the monitor that meets hz and is to your other spec resolution
your eyes can see more but it s a reverse logarithmic scale you need more and more of a difference to see the same result thats why to 60hz is such a big jump while to isnt edit why was the guy i replied to downvoted i literally said the same thing as him
not to mention your reaction speed too
real talk the gamepad is surprisingly comfortable
thats such a scuffed picture
the wii u has a good d pad although the screen leaves much to be desired
i bet it gets better fps on games likes bayoneta mario zelda donkeykong pokmon than steam deck
worth the money
how the hell
it really is the perfect weight and grip on it no idea how nintendo went from this to the switch tbh
dimly lit room with a potato i did the best i could
oh for sure the game pad is currently being streamed to from my pc so it s trying to push a stream for a 1440p and on the wii us 480p display it looks horrible haha
it still wasn t portable it s still a home console whereas the switch should conditionally fit in a pocket
i had an event pop up where i found out that my daughter who was years old at the time was actually a bear she was married and everything so it checks out
yeah but it s glitterhoof glitterhoof gets a pass
i have a couple hundred hours in wondering if ck3 is worth it yet or should i keep waiting until more dlc comes out and then goes on sale
i love this game even the intro music gives me goose bumps
new fav game i swear i m not
least realistic video game
you ve never heard the expression hung like a horse
this event is awesome because you can give the bear a title and have lots of bears in your realm or even become a bear yourself i love ck2
so she was a druid brilliant
like the animal or
wait what is this a mod
i enjoy ck3 a lot and it does change some things i ve seen some player say they hate it i like it i still like ck2 but they do offer slightly different experiences you can alter a ton of rules to change the game though if you don t mind disabling achievements one plus side is that plagues aren t directly tied to prosperity one down side is that there is no world randomization and you have to get a mod for that right now i have a playthrough for the elder scrolls total conversion mod and it s really fun
if you are too tall it does get awkward too but we are talking about and over
what else would it be
they need more building options it s too easy to become rich and max out counties
i still can t believe how hard i bounced off of ck3 i have a couple thousand hours in ck2 and i think that maybe i m just too used to it to adapt but some of it was a lack of message system that let me keep track of my courtiers and relatives i really enjoyed watching my npc s lives unfold and that wasn t as enjoyable to me in ck3
a heavy set hairy gay man
the next patch is directly addressing this
i m kind of in the same boat more like just waiting for more dlc s maybe i m just a veteran but ck3 is stupid easy as well
hey it s that dog
it took me a moment to see it it kind of blends in with the background
worst part about re4make is that you can t pet that dog fix yourself capcom who makes a game where you can t pet the cute animal in
even when going for s stop over to thank the bud
looks like gmork from the never ending story
and they said he was dead
i am the servant behind the power of the nothing
pretty sneaky capcom pearl harbor pretty sneaky but lie about the wolf reary sneaky
thank him after the fight or you re dead to me son
dd
literally unplayable i shut it off once i realized i couldn t reach him
he was such a jerk
have you tried gtfo
check out devour forewarned and the recently released demonologist
does not exist as you define it games like alien isolation only work when the player is alone having your friends talking shit when things are chasing you tends to spoil the mood like with phasmo even this game likely qualifies more as action in your opinion horror games in general are lacking either they rely too much on jumpscares or chase mechanics or they are essentially shooters with atmosphere even without the banter of friends most of what works for horror doesn t apply well to a shared experience
id say project zomboid but you will need a lot of mods for it to be a scary edit devour dark and darker hunt gtfo and subnautica with mp mod
dead by daylight or friday the 13th can be pretty scary with friends it is just goofy though mario party can be pretty terrifying though losing a star right on the last roll chills
if friday the13th is still active then that was the best one
player phasmophobia or demonologist
evil dead the game it s definitely more horror comedy than straight horror and it works best if you re a fan of the franchise but a kandarian demon player who knows what they re doing can instill genuine terror in the survivor players using their abilities
silent hill
that s rude they re just asking a question s
we are playing gtfo already it has a good atmosphere but it s more action than horror
games like dark and darker or hunt are not scarry games devour is a good one we but we already have it
maybe i m strange but dead by daylight or friday the 13th arent really scarry tbh
haha dude if you hadn t added the s i would ve been so confused
tense is probably more accurate i don t know i generally don t play co op horror horror in general tbh
only for xbox controller in which every face button have a different length because the design of the controller
obscure blurry thing for scale great choice man
dude give me banana for scale
ah something used to scale that i am very familiar with i haven t had a coin in my pocket for like years but i have at least of those on my desk s
roger roger
the b button is even longer
longer than mine at the very least
when the two things you re trying to show are completely out of focus maybe take another pic
roger roger roger rogerson
didn t make the damn thing any tougher i can tell you that
but i can see the clear texture on the wooden desk they look nice
how do you not know the scale of a lego battle droid smh s
it s only like that because each company owns a patent on their controller designs including the insides no system or controller has the same d pad design or button designs for this reason even if a few share the abxy button faces
played it a while ago and i keep seeing it with new content on steam all the time i would love to see what other games they release next if any
same thing with klei they keep releasing more stuff for don t starve together released in including top quality cinematics on yt
supporting the game after all this time is dope takes notes
terraria has gotten its final update like times now several other games and developers out there with long term support too
ghost ship games does really well too
thats the thing with indie developers they can support their game s for years if they have the motivation resources because they dont answer to a publisher that wants to abandon a game they dont consider profitable anymore
havent seen any posts about that lately my best guess though cats
stuff falls because of gravity consoles and pcs fall because of gravity gravity is a gravity hates the console and pc races to quote former washington d c mayor marion barry all laws are racist the law of gravity is racist
