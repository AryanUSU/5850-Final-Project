the paper is slowly decomposing it s not mold but it s a sign your book isn t being kept in pristine archival conditions
hi archivist chiming in that classic old book smell is caused by a compound found in all wood based paper called lignin i know reddit too well so please no lignin these balls jokes this compound is what causes paper to yellow when exposed to air and light because it is acidic it is also is related to vanilla which is why it has that slightly sweet scent other interesting smells you may encounter around old media is a sour vinegary smell around photos and old film which is actually called vinegar syndrome this happens when the materials used in film and photos starts breaking down and unfortunately there s not much that can be done about it once it begins
slightly off side but maybe related would it be the same reason why music schools conservatories often in old buildings also smell like that
i have a couple books that are yrs old and they have very distinct smell that s unlike modern books the scent is very faint though not as strong as modern books and by modern i mean even yr old books my guess is all the different chemicals used in the process these days
paper has a compound called lignin in it it s actually a pretty complicated class of biomolecule so plant material is made up of these long fibers called cellulose it s why wood is so good at making paper you can remove most of the components get the cellulose fiber into a water solution spray it onto a moving conveyor belt and as the water dries the fibers form these nice flat sheets with all the fiber sticking together here s a fun interesting trick take two pieces of printer paper just holding the paper by the side tear one piece in half length wise then tear the other piece of paper in half cross wise now look at the nature of the tears one of the tears is crooked and jagged one of the the tears is much straighter and neater this indicates the direction the conveyor belt was moving in when the solution got sprayed against it the even tear is the machine direction most of the fibers ended up being parallel to that direction of movement but there s still enough going in the cross direction to make it a solid piece of 2d paper of course paper is floppy in the other dimension and if trees were only made of cellulose going in one direction they d be pretty floppy too in order to get very rigid the tree produces lignin which makes all the cellulose super hard a plant with a floppy stem like a dandelion still has cellulose but no lignin so a good deal of the paper making process involves getting rid of that lignin to get to the nice valuable cellulose there have been many different methods and paper manufacturers have invented all sorts of ways of doing it trying to minimize costs maximize efficiency etc this leads to a range of different quality paper of course if you re a publisher you want the cheapest possible paper but not so bad that the reader will be upset the cheap paper still has more lignin in it over time the lignin starts to oxidize and break down into a complex variety of byproducts some of the products are vanillin the same compound produced by vanilla beans this is why old books stores have a pleasant smell another byproduct is vanillic acid this lowers the ph of the paper and hastens the degradation of both the lignin and the cellulose these breakdowns make the paper both yellow and a little more brittle it s actually very similar to the maillard reaction that browns food when you cook it at any rate both lignin and cellulose break down into smaller and smaller molecules the smaller the molecule is the easier it is to evaporate volatility and it also makes it easier to smell the reason we can smell things like gasoline is because they re very small and volatile molecules the term volatile organic compounds is such a huge class of compounds it sort of means very little vanillin is probably the biggest one that causes the pleasant smell but there will also be a large suite of other compounds mixed in all of them going back to the breakdown of lignin and cellulose
mostly lignin it is related to the chemical compound of vanilla as paper degrades the lignin is exposed and degrades and gives off a scent so it s kind of a combination of that and very fine wood dust naturally rubbing or blowing off and a few hydrocarbon aromatics given off by old book glue drying https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2013/06/19/the-science-of-the-smell-of-books/ there s actually been a study on it https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac9016049
volatile organic compounds vocs and other chemicals that create the characteristic musty odor
slightly off topic but i bought a copy of naked lunch back in the 90s and it smelled so good it was a best smeller
paper decomposition it is called vanillin
not sure but i love that smell
museum professional here it s the organic parts of the paper and binding breaking down although mold and mildew can play a role sometimes too
bliblichor great smell totally normal it s glue and other vocs off gassing
a number of voc s that come from the aging of the paper the binding and the inks benzaldehyde almond like vaniilin vanilla like ethylbenzene sweet ethyl hexanol floral https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olli1guxvki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olli1guxvki)
the distinctive smell of old books actually comes from a variety of chemical compounds that are released as the paper ink and other materials in the book break down over time one of the main culprits is a group of compounds known as volatile organic compounds vocs which are released by the paper and binding glue as they age and deteriorate other factors that can contribute to the old book smell include the type of paper used in the book the ink and printing methods and even the conditions in which the book has been stored for example exposure to high levels of heat or humidity can accelerate the breakdown of the materials in the book and intensify the odor while mold can certainly be a cause of a musty smell in old books it s not the only explanation in fact many old books that have been well preserved and kept in dry conditions may not have any detectable mold growth but can still have that distinctive nostalgic aroma
oh dude i fucking loved that musty old smell it s almost nostalgic for me at this point plus my siamese cat smelled like that too lmao
it s the smell of ink glue and paper decomposing your book doesn t last forever and that smell is the last you ll experience some parts of it
kinda yes and kinda no it s the smell of the pages aging and what not fun fact that i m half remembering the smell of old books has a very mild addictive quality it s why people love it so much
the decomposition of paper can produce such compounds as toluene which can smell sweet or pungent hexanal also from the disintegration of cellulose and lignin in paper can give books an earthy musty old room smell which could be exacerbated by mold from environmental exposure
i had an old copy of goodnight moon as a kid the smell of it is a core memory i ve encountered it a few times in my life but never in other books something in that ink just had its own unique smell new copies just smell wrong
i don t know when i was a kid and i looked at my parents books i always thought this was how things smelled in the 50s and 60s
that s just the vashta nerada
it s the litmosphere you re smelling the qwerty itself
tca the same taint that causes a wine to be musty from a bad cork tca is an acronym for the chemical compound trichloroanisole it s incredibly volatile and most humans can pick it up at about parts per trillion the chlorine used in the paper reacts to moisture and tca is formed
would love some opinions on this smell i just started collecting books and ordered a few recently that came with a distinctive odor that old book smell it also smelled faintly of cigarettes or smoke and i was wondering if that was part of the old musky book smell of if others think that it s a separate instance of actually being stored where cigarettes were smoked it s very faint but noticable when smelling very close to the paper are the smells similar or distinctly different many thanks
ayo but the smell of a new book is so good
churches often have that smell from all the old bibles and hymn books that are slowly decomposing libraries not so much being that many are air conditioned
it s the book glue that holds the pages in the spine it deteriorates over time and has that pleasant musky smell
new question if my office is full of old books and i m breathing lignin in every day is that bad for my health
could be mold
could be mold but usually that s the result of damp conditions and you would likely see evidence of the mold in the form of water damage or black spots etc if it s just a a paper back book that s been on a shelf not exposed to water other than ambient humidity it s probably not mold i ve heard and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread the general smell of old books and documents is from the lignin in the paper from the wood fibers pulp that makes up the paper add in some off gassing smells of the ink and any glues used in the binding and that combination is the majority of the old book smell there might be also some environmental smells depending on where the book was stored like in a garage in a cardboard box or bookshelf under climate controlled conditions i had a classical guitar teacher that smoked a pipe all the sheet music he passed out smelled like old paper and stale pipe not like a cigarette ashtray kind of pleasant at times
this was a topic on scishow or tangents but i forgot what it was was it formaldehyde
i once worked with a book from the 1600s it belonged to mozarts father it was an early violin instructional book super cool but not super smelly
what u mystic_burrito said also if you would like to minimize that smell you have a few options find a rubbermaid container and put your book in it with either baking soda charcoal or ground coffee all of those will neutralize the odor to some degree we found charcoal to be especially effective but very messy so i would put another container in with charcoal next to your smelly books so they don t get all black
theirs a cool video explaining older book smell their made different idk if someone posted here but it s a different process
you re vividly hallucinating while staring at the tattooed carcass of a tree it s rot book isn t be kept in the best place i m not a bookologist so i can t provide you with the best place but i m sure google can help out with that
first thing that comes to mind is musty
why do japanese mangas smell different than english ones
my dad worked in owned a rare book store for years it s what he smelled like
i think it smells like old person pee
removed
fungas
mildew
mildew
omg this my aunt and uncles caravan smelled like old books and i adored it
you could literally just google that shit
book lice https://americanpest.net/blog/help-what-are-these-tiny-bugs-in-my-books/
the smell of old books is due to the organic materials in books like cellulose from wood pulp reacting with light heat and water and over time releasing volatile organic compounds or vocs coulda just looked it up
it s mold
the tannins
removed
mold is quite likely but it could simply be decomposing also keep them dry and out of sunlight
just had to move my old football programmes from under the bed giving off a strong damp odour what to do
it has to do with the air but also how it was kept
removed
the pages aren t molding but they are breaking down
does it smell like spanish flu
the degradation of the pages
it s mold
idk but it s one of my favorite smells
that scent and freshly sharpened pencils are like drugs to me
could be the paper ink used to print out the words possibly even the glue used to bind it all together or a mix of all of it
that library smell kind of like stale vinegar and nostalgia
i can t remember if it was jeopardy or quiz planet but i just learned earlier in the week that the name of the smell is bibliosmia but yes the typical smell is the paper and lining compounds breaking down though it could also be mold depending on where the book was found
just like fresh cut grass
eh i work in an archive and it still smells of decay can t beat entropy
a house full of books needs a lot of dusting unless you have closed doors on your book cases
i was wondering why that was alot of my vinyl from the 70s and earlier have that smell i knew it was from the cardboard sleeve just didn t know why that was thx
i was gonna say decaying paper
is that pronounced archival or archival
excuse me if this was already answered but what conditions would be ideal for storing books in the long term assuming i m not filthy rich and can t them in a vacuum
but saying i love that old book smell sounds a lot better than i love the smell of slowly decomposing paper
u georgiaokeefinitreal they also make your hands itch why feels like microscopic insects on your hands
thanks for your input joe i wish you and your new book store all the best
what s lignin
studying to be a chemist so i guess these are tangentially related topics lol is lignin added in the paper making process or is it already a part of the wood being used i would assume an acid would perhaps help break down the other components of the paper for a more even product but the downside is it accelerates decay please please please correct me if i m talking out of my ass i m still a chemistry noob and i know nothing about papermaking
can you buy lignin incense making my house smell like old books would be amazing
does lignin make people poop every time i go to the library i get the urge to poop
my mom made me throw away some of my favorite books as a kid because she was sure it was mold causing the smell i feel vindicated
is this what kinda explains what i can only describe as old church smell in older buildings which don t have mold issues or anything but still have a very distinct stale wood smell
wow that sour vinegar smell is also found on deez nuts
the vinegar syndrome thing is actually really interesting about years ago my family and i went to washington dc on vacation and passed by a gift shop that sold replica copies of the declaration of independence and us constitution one thing i distinctly remember about the replica i had is that it had that same vinegar smell to it
hell yeah it s a sweet vanilla smell i love huffing that old book smell
fun fact imitation vanilla of the vanilla extract sold is made using lignin byproduct from paper processing for this very reason
unrelated to the ops post but how does one become an archivist
can the film not be preserved in some sort of resin or other hydrophobic and oxygen free media or does the reaction not require either
i didn t know about this thanks for sharing
lots of old wood in pianos and rosin used on the bows release compounds that tend to linger in books i d say old technology organic glues used in the binding and of course paper is just recycled and regurgitated wood as well
to add to this places that humans inhabited but have not been lived in for a while either because they were abandoned or are being preserved but not lived in have a distinctive smell musky almost damp and for lack of better terms historical it feels simultaneously comforting and haunting to smell it you can find it in historical museums and abandoned houses from before about i have always wondered what it is and why our bodies kind of have a fear response to it is it a decay product of something human like hair or skin dander is it because wood and coal burning was used for fuel and heating
how about school book depositories
the quality of the paper and glue make a big difference paperbacks especially are made with really low quality paper that ages very quickly even brand new paperbacks have a strong odor that is different than hardback books but there is also a vast difference in quality among hardback books themselves trade paperbacks are usually somewhere in between
from other answers given in comments probably obviously a lot depends on the conditions the books are kept in i mean some books i have were stored in a loft for a while and others well i can t heat my flat in winter so even with dehumidifiers my poor books will barely outlive me i mean i m all for them being donated or sold but their condition by then is hit and miss kinda glad i don t have any books that are much older than 40yrs there s like the odd one or two but the bulk are on average years old
could it be animal skin book covers
i have a couple books that are yrs old can t say i m not curious mind sharing what they are
old books sound delicious
lignin balls lol thank you for your explanation g
thanks it s comments like this that keep me on reddit
and candles and perfumes that smell like old books
this guy vocs
op is asking what the source of the vocs and other chemicals is
formaldehyde
because they will buy it again in two weeks and get talked about endlessly in the meantime
most people legitimately do not give a flying fuck
this is not a new thing bud light has been an active proponent of the lgbtq community for decades they donate money sponsor pride events and promote actively in the community as do other major brands they re not alone here this is just conservatives finding the next thing to be outraged about https://www.anheuser-busch.com/newsroom/bud-light-joins-forces-with-nglcc](https://www.anheuser-busch.com/newsroom/bud-light-joins-forces-with-nglcc) https://people.com/food/bud-light-beer-rainbow-bottles-pride-month/](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bud-light-celebrates-world-pride-with-rainbow-inspired-bottles-benefitting-glaad-300843477.html) x200b https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bud-light/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bud-light/)
edit these people conservatives vastly overestimate their value to large national brands meanwhile new york city alone has a larger population than states
budweiser is owned by belgian company ab inbev and the us is the brand s largest market it is currently the top selling beer in america boycotts like this rarely make any noticeable difference in sales a few dumb celebrities post videos of themselves shooting cans or whatever and then everybody forgets it s likely this move was made to target a younger and more female demographic if bud feels they re losing ground in those areas
math they can read all the polls the gop can t read woke is just mainstream social change at this point conservatives think they have a much larger market share than they do in reality
were you talking about bud light on reddit two weeks ago that s why any company does marketing campaigns
conservatives are a political minority it makes sense to cater to the larger demographic and there are more people who are pro lgbtq than people who anti
the same reason any company does anything because it makes money maybe its because there are a lot more left wing people out there than right wing maybe its because any publicity is good publicity maybe its because they re trying to gain more young people but whatever the reasoning its because it makes money its a corporation not a person it doesn t have morals feelings or social insights
if i never heard the term they ve gone woke again it would be too soon all the major beer companies have been advertising to lgbt communities and sponsoring pride events for decades deal with it
hot take someone higher up genuinely supports lgbtq
there are likely a lot of reasons but the thing i keep coming back to is perhaps the anti lgbt community isnt as big as they think they are like you have the liberal side of the country and the anti liberal perhaps we cant based the size of these groups based on the noise they make
from a strategic perspective i would imagine their trying to increase their market share amoung liberal people i m sober but almost all of my friends are liberal and tend to drink more unique local brews rather than the big chain company products also leadership in the company probably genuinely supports the lbgtq movement and could give a fuck what people think about them in regards to that specific topic kinda nice to see a massive company like this being true to themselves whereas most try their hardest to hide their potentially controversial beliefs
all this hating on bud light from conservatives is just giving the company free promotion
economics there re more progressives and they have more money why would you market to a slowly dying off section of loud idiots who will huy your beer to performatively throw it away again
bud has had lgbt friendly ads and marketing since the 90s so i imagine their data shows that it makes business sense i doubt they d jeopardize their profits just to upset ultra conservatives homophobes are a minority in the u s and it s a rapidly shrinking demographic albeit a very loud one
sometimes you just have to upset a few snowflakes to sell your beer water
companies do value calculations all the time about what percentage of customers will leave not care or be gained by catering to an audience a good example is sprite it is marketed toward black americans though coca cola knows this will not deter most non black people from consuming it if we go down the beer path we see michelob ultra which markets heavily to golfers but of course non golfers will consume it too as a straight man i will not pretend to have extensive knowledge of the drinking habits of lgbtq folks but i was struck by the sheer number of cheap light beers available at the clubs bars i have attended with friends anheuser busch the makers of bud light know they will lose some customers but people s attention spans are short and they know most don t give a shit visiting the store today i did not see any of these new cans and plenty of non pride cans were on the shelves as long as that option is there then most people who like bud will keep buying it i do think they d go a bit far to print all their cans like this as even folks who are tolerant might for good or bad reasons not want to carry around a gay can at their next bbq with their homophobic uncle
well bud light and other beers have supported lgbtq rights with ads and such since the s conservatives only decided recently that they wanted to get mad about it additionally while bud is the choice of many conservative types it s only a fraction of their business in fact since beginning the latest ad campaign their sales have gone up quite a bit and i do have that evidence to provide to answer why bud decided to run the ad well companies don t usually base their business decisions on how fascists or nazis will feel about it so why would they be afraid of bigots and homophobes
the conservative party isn t a hive mind nor are democrats nor are lgbtq people the loudest conservatives don t define the entire party
bud light isn t a conservative beer it s just a beer and they ve done the math on who they d lose vs who they d gain from marketing this way and they think it ll pan out in their favor pandering is only pandering of you re saying what the majority agrees with you can t claim a brand is simultaneously out of touch and pandering
because bud lite is made from kid rock s tears
bud light is owned by ab inbev they own around of the beer market around out of every beers you see on the shelves are theirs if this hurts their business at all it will likely be insignificant meanwhile they are getting a ton of free advertising
publicity these homophobic people throwing out their already purchased beer costs bud light nothing once fox news moves on to the next culture war item they ll go right back to purchasing the beer
what the magas forget is that there was never a country more founded on the wokeness of its day than america circa or since america has been woke for the most part from its founding that s what makes it exceptional if anything does going anti woke or resisting the basic tendency if americans to seek out expanded rights and greater liberalism is at its base un american
they have actually been supporting the movement in one form or another since the s the reason it s so ridiculously overblown now is because of the state of the nation
they know where the money is at and is going to be for the long haul and it isn t a yr old white person with a beer gut and a failing liver
there s no such thing as bad media exposure this gets them tonnes
ab is owned by a european conglomerate who is very liberal and forward thinking i don t see a problem with whatever a private company wants to do
because they are no longer their target audience why go for the minority they are marketing to the majority also when their government check runs out half way through the month conservatives will be back buying bud because it is cheap red states have the higher poverty rates and crime per capita the popular vote clearly proves that conservatives are not the majority over the last decade
allying with lgbt is always beneficial from a business standpoint identifying with leftwing idpol always puts companies in a positive light and therefore their products plus it triggers the righties which is always a bonus
they ve been woke before it was a thing tbh people are just dumb edit to add corporations in generally basically invented wokeness not because they care but to appeal to a wider audience
conservatives will forget real quick they have memories of a goldfish and half the intelligence in the meantime bl sells a bunch of rainbows
normal consumers performative conservative weirdos if your goal is to please the largest number of potential buyers and for ab it is the math is very easy
in one of the videos the guy replaces his bud light with coors light i guess he doesn t realize coors light is owned by inbev which owns you guessed it anheuser busch maker of bud light i guess one could say that if they were drinking bud light it should be very easy for them to find a different brand of water edit i want to correct myself inbev doesn t own anheuser busch they are actually a conglomerate anheuser busch inbev you can check it out at their website www ab inbev com scroll down and you ll see it at the bottom left of their homepage anheuser busch inbev all rights reserved
bud light went woke decades ago because they realized that lgbtq people spend a shit ton more money on booze than the loudmouth conservative minority
there s no such thing as bad publicity this move got them so much free promotion the more cases of beer kid rock shoots up the more cases of beer they re going to sell he s practically doing a commercial for them marketing and advertising are all about getting people to talk about your product look we re talking about it and i don t even drink beer
these businesses are not dumb being on the right side of the lgbtq stuff is good for their business that means some or more of the following are likely true liberals drink this kind of beer too there are more liberals than conservatives in this country that drink beer not all conservatives are anti lgbtq not all conservatives will boycott the beer over this the type of conservatives that will boycott a beer over this likely already drank a different beer such as busch light they might lose some short term market share to conservatives but are working on longer game picture with a bigger marketshare of liberals and thinking about new markets
they ve been a supporter of non conservative stances for quite a while actually it s just that they haven t been advertising it as much until relatively recent i think they want to try to appeal more to everyone they can say they support something without condemning another group which is the way they seem to be going about it it may make some people upset but it s never going to make a difference in their success as a business america is becoming more diverse all the time not just in race and sexual orientation but in the way people view those those different than them there s far too many people who either don t care what they do in an ad or celebrate inclusivity for it to become a problem they can support their current base but also recognize that too many people are moving away from a conservative stance in general for them to ignore other potential customers
because it s happened before alcohol brands have supported lgbtq people conservatives have boycotted then they forget and start drinking it again until the brand does something new to remind them that that brand supports lgbtq rights
budweiser has been publishing lgbtq ads since the 1990s it started off subtle but became more blatant at the urging of the lgbtq community for people getting angry now it s only because they hadn t been paying attention before in any case they are a large company and i m sure they ve done the market research that shows this was a good decision financially only time will tell
it s comical anytime i hear of a corporation going woke like they re doing something other than maximizing profit at every opportunity
deleted
i am conservative i like the ad campaign because it shows budlight is willing to do anything for money capitalism wins again and everyone is cheering them on
because bud light understands that lgbtq money is the same color as straight money
the attention theyll get despite conservatives always laughing about how triggered the lefty snowflakes are they are incredibly fragile and so easily provoked triggered and will cry over everything that a snowflake is 10xs more strong and durable than they are they are intolerant of anything that isnt them and throw massive tantrums so this will get that response funny how theyre ok with businesses being allowed to deny people services because its their business like that bakery with the gay couple but the minute a business exercises its right to support who they want those rights they ranted about businesses having disappear lmaaooo
budweiser and all other beer manifacturers do not care if you are a conservative a liberal cisgendered lgbtq geriatric or all they care about is whether or not they can get you to consume more of their beer they want
anhieser owns all the beer brands if people switch to busch miller ultra coors guess what they still make money lol
because they ve done the math and have determined they stand to gain more than they ll lose from such campaigns that s really the long and short of it even more so with idiots buying bud to shoot at it or run it over bud made the sale regardless of whether the buyer drinks it or wastes it
pissing off conservatives is always good for business
why not we ve always had trans folks lgbtq let them live
budweiser has been a loud sponsor for pride events for decades
next week all the conservatives will forget about it and buy a fresh box to replace all the beer they poured out while a bunch of progressive youth will look fondly on budlight for the rest of their lives
all the conservatives that care about this are over and in poor health budweiser needs young people to drink their beer that s my guess
more people are liberal and less people are conservative most conservatives will give up the boycott in two weeks a liberal person who has maybe turned up their noise at bud light might give it a try still crappy beer
because they follow the money the amount of people who will like praise or not care outweighs those that will get mad the people who hate this are loud but in the minority
bud light has been sponsoring pride floats for years they support the lgbtq community and have for years i think it s brilliant because they re clearly trying to expand their market but in a fun way
they are hoping the conservatives throw out their beer it was already paid for the conservatives then sober up for a few minutes and they think omg i voted for trump they have come to their senses then they realize they are out of beer and go buy more bud light not remembering why they didn t have any
the people in marketing ran the numbers there s more profit to be made advertising as woke than not
inbev knows exactly what they re doing budlight aint even gonna feel this blip in loyalty neither will any of their other brands i ll say this though things like this have a funny way of exposing the bigots among us for the waste of oxygen they are
it s beer drink it or don t why is life so difficult for people live it and to hell with what the social media says i really don t care if you have sex with a damn camel that s your choice stop telling me what i should support and what not to support or get behind and stay off my damn lawn
so there s two factors to this one is that conservatives are very loud but not as big as their volume would imply a good majority of people are lgbt positive or at least casually tolerant so they don t really care about rainbow branding or trans people getting marketing deals the only people that really care are boomer conservatives who spend all their time watching fox and newsmax two is that companies love controversy outrage marketing is a big way to get people to talk about your brand when conservatives get angry at something a good number of people on the other side of the political aisle will make an effort to defend the company for making that controversial decision like hiring a trans woman to do an ad this debate will drive up traffic to the product in question likely leading in more sales if the ad was boring and rudimentary nobody would care and sales likely won t go up that much
it s not a new campaign they ve been a huge huge campaign at pride every year for at least decades conservatives can go firnicate themselves
list of things boycotted or canceled by conservatives for being woke sjw anti christian or anti conservative amazon american airlines amy grant apple at t bank of america barney the dinosaur the bbc the beatles old school conservatives didn t like it when lennon said the beatles were bigger than jesus and so album burning became a thing beauty and the beast ben jerry s beyonce bud light budweiser and this isn t the first time they boycotted budweiser for an ad showing their founder s arrival to the usa as an immigrant then again when they showed support for a transwoman then again when they put out cans with woke stuff on them campbell s soup capitol hill club carhartt cisco citigroup cnn coca cola colin kaepernick common core coors critical race theory the da vinci code delta airlines disney many many many times dixie chicks doom dr fauci d d ellen degeneres when she came out enterprise rent a car ford france remember freedom fries ghostbusters because women woke etc gillette the golden compass good omens goodyear the guardian hallmark channel happy holidays happy kwanza happy hanukkah harley davidson harry potter hershey hertz home depot the hunt intercontinental hotels islam james gunn jane fonda very old school going back to her actions during the vietnam conflict jpmorgan chase judaism kathy griffin kellogg s keurig the little mermaid because black mermaid levi strauss co many libraries liz cheney m m s damn you for not letting them have their sexy green candy lady macy s madonna mlb megyn kelly merck michelle wolf mormons ms marvel nascar nba nbc nfl netflix many times the new york times nike nordstrom s oreo patagonia pepsi pokemon potato head because they dropped the mr procter gamble pbs rock music old school maybe their first real attempt to cancel something back in the 1950s samantha bee same sex wedding supporting bakeries sandi patty sesame street scooby doo she hulk the simpsons starbucks many times stephen colbert target teletubbies thor love and thunder too many gays in it oh noes toy story united airlines ups viacom cbs video games long list and video games in general walmart many times wells fargo wrangler jeans yoga
they are a big company with many different lines not just bud light this imaging or rebranding might boost sales in this division that might have has been stagnant maybe it was a risk maybe not any controversy exposure is still advertising
maybe they re just doing the right thing and don t care about upsetting people over a can of beer with a fucking rainbow on it
something tells me they re not worried about losing market share because of white christian nationalist outrage
in a few years transphobia will be viewed the same way homophobia is viewed today it would make sense for them to market with that in mind if it costs them a toxic demographic all the better
because fuck the conservative snowflakes
my biggest question is why do all these companies feel the need to make political or cultural statements call me boring but i feel like if you make a good product you highlight the product i very much like the particular brand of whiskey i drink regularly i don t care one way or the other what their views are on cultural political issues
fox and the outrage industry has to continually have new targets for their faux rage
all publicity is good publicity personally i would have never known they did that but i m seeing the meme explosion that is why conservatives are doing for free what actual advertising would have done for many millions of dollars
conservatives trend older and can t drink for shit and are becoming more of a minority young people have their whole drinking lives ahead of them seems like a pretty easy decision imo it s not like major concert and sports venues are going to sever ties with budweiser over this budweiser is the best selling beer in america and 2nd in the world they know what they are doing
your question precludes a conclusion unsupported by facts most companies with a national reach have found it quite lucrative to engage in inclusivity commonly refered to as going broke it was jesus christ who first champion inclusivity several millennia ago and it had been widely successful over all if anyone is going woke again inclusive and going broke it was probably poor business practices that killed the business and not going woke keep in mind that all media sells is ads thus the content produced is designed to engage often times pandering to extremism outrage ensures engagement and thus revenue but the majority of us don t give a dip about extremism and thus we rarely make the news no one cares that i hate budweiser or that it s not even an american company or that my distaste is due to it lacking any flavor to speak of i am however very impressed that they can consistently taste awful batch after batch that s impressive as minute variations on the process can affect taste as to the answer to your question why would budlight start this new ad campaign conservatives hate the short answer is because they have determined that this is the best way to move more product and make more money at the end of the day that s the motivation for why businesses do what they do
i think budweiser inbev just thought the concept of gay rights was near universal and was just joining the crowd they miscalculated how backward and hateful conservatives are and closeted
the stereotypical conservative yokel bud lite drinker you re thinking of is a market they have pretty much locked down maybe they ll pitch a fit for a week or two but realistically what are they going to do switch to craft brews that cost twice as much how would a hazy ipa sit on your average bl drinker s palate and of course smaller breweries tend to be way more progressive than multinational beverage conglomerates all the majors in the cheap light beer space are similarly woke so there s no obvious alternative for them to turn to on the other hand lgbtq community likes to party and represents a relatively untapped market for budweiser
because most beer is owned by the same company so when then start having your usual non beer drinkers lgbtq community and forcing the one mad to start buying more expensive beer to drink thus increasing their funds from both sides of the spectrum
same reason as always
all publicity is good publicity it seems they have convinced people to buy their products just so they can checks notes shoot them and post the video online still sales are sales and thanks to the wonders of alcoholism those customers won t stay away long
in spite of their control of the media and politics conservatives are becoming fewer in number that is why they are constantly raging and it isn t a race thing it s a mixture of an asshole thing mainstream conservative political parties are coming out with statements and policies that would simply have been unacceptable not that long ago and i don t mean to their opponents i mean to their own parties and financial thing younger generations are not making the typical move to the right because they are being too exploited to get comfortable enough to start thinking about protecting what is theirs
they didn t go woke budlight has always been a heavy proponent of equality this is just conservatives finally realizing it
budweiser likes to saturate markets with their brand so they will be supportive of large popular ideas gay people have a storied history regarding night life and beer companies love night clubs entertainment venues that buy beer by the pallet are more important than people who get a pack on the weekends bud light doesn t have a strong tie to conservative culture it s just a widely available beer
it s an untapped demographic why not try to sell more of the product
check if they get money from blackrock or something similar
because
it s bud light s version of wearing a maga hat
nothing gets people talking more than mutual hatred did the thought of bud light even cross your mind once in the last like years how about now
my queer af redneck self sips bud light
bud light doesn t give a fuck about temporary conservative tears this was a calculated decision because they have analyzed where their money comes from the manufactured outrage will die down and conservatives will buy bud light again they are going into pride season knowing where the money is to be made at the moment
it s free advertisting like it or not their plan has worked simply by posting this on here you have contributed to their marketing strategy it s a clever move tbh
what does a conservative boycott mean for nike it meant they bought a bunch of shoes and shit to burn literally they made the company money just for pissing them off how many dumbass conservatives had the literal thought to go buy a case and dump it out i bet more than zero which begs the question if they really understand what a boycott is in a general sense second off so what if they dont buy the beer lets look at the big tobacco model for a sec most conservatives are older alcoholics most older alcoholics have liver disease theyre gonna be dying soon they need younger customers young people are more pro lgbtq than against it so if i have a deadly product like alcohol sure lets ignore the old boomers because theyre gonna be dead soon who cares if they scream on the way out time for some young new customers and finally well they dont care that conservatives are mad there are way more non political types and liberals combined than conservatives and that conservative number is ever shrinking so why would a national company care about a dying breed just because you yell the loudest on twitter doesnt mean that you have the purchasing power the real majority of the population does and i know i know conservatives are used to just saying shit is one way and people pretending like it is but here reality wins over conservative delusions again screech all you want but this idea of who gives a fuck what conservatives think anyway is gonna get much more prolific and i personally cant wait please keep denying science keep yelling as loud as you can over the stupidest shit it was only a matter of time before people started ignoring conservatives all together because lets be honest its the same shit over and over mad about x boycott y move on in a week to the next thing blah blah blah conservative are clowns they just stopped being entertaining a long time ago
sell sell sell
why cause fuck em that s why
because it s funny
fear and disgust are powerful tools to corral the masses to the polls
i m gonna show them queers i m goin sober
if they can get say of americans as potential new customers and loyalty to their brand vs losing of the people who will actually boycott them it s a win for corporate
they probably did studies and found out there was a chance conservatives would change their preference due to the marketing and a chance to sway a young liberal to their drink or something of that nature
just remember once the southern conservatives protested the beatles in they only got more popular if your business model is don t piss off the conservatives you re not going to be competitive enough to survive
bud light has been supporting pride parades and glaad since the 80s this isn t new republicans only get mad when they are told to do so
part of it is that cannabis and hemp are really easy to grow compared to tobacco big tobacco does not want to have to compete with the proliferation of small growers and boutique brands the answer is money always money they probably will get into the game once it is legal and regulated at the federal level
in general the tobacco companies have been worried that legalizing marijuana will hurt their business it s a lot easier for people to grow their own pot than it is for them to grow their own tobacco
i thought that said why has big taco not gone hard on cannabis like damn now that i think about it i don t know
i read a while ago that the parent company of marlboro has had the brand marley registered to launch a line of cannabis cigarettes as soon as it s legalized at the federal level they just don t want to launch it until it s legal everywhere to avoid any issues for example i have heard that even in states where mj is legal banking is an issue for dispensers because of federal banking regulations
they ve started investing in it in the last decade but before then there apparently just wasn t enough interest in doing so like with lgbt rights public opinion on marijuana legalization has moved very fast years ago it seemed like full legalization was a fringe position that would never pass anywhere there were already activist groups and think tanks lobbying congress for legalization and they were having basically zero success and i don t really think it was due to lack of money big tobacco dumping millions of dollars on those groups to help them lobby congress harder probably wouldn t have had much effect big tob must have assumed it would be a waste of money but like i said it s changing in the past decade as more and more states are legalizing and the federal government is starting to recognize the state level legal marijuana industry
it will eventually happen but there are still a lot of older people in charge who have antiquated ideas about weed
very half baked answers so far heh sooo they ve just been slow playing but that doesn t mean they haven t been very active like booze and pharma companies initially they were lobbying against weed because weed was seen as a threat to their core business namely addicted customers who continued to suffer however even as early as years ago big tobacco was laying the foundation for being in the weed game patenting marijuana cigarettes and other such nonsense but there are problems even beyond the generally non addictive properties of marijuana one main issue being it s very simple to grow to grow tobacco in large quantities takes some extremely specialized equipment we re talking 500k 1m per machine involved in the growing if you ve never seen a tobacco seed they are smaller than a pin head then there s also the extensive processing whereas basically any dumbass can dry a few buds from their pot plant so while the market is sort of exploding the last few years it s a totally different market in terms of agricultural monopoly addiction customer base and futures they re not dumb they re just evil so they ve seen all these trends and possibilities coming for a long time but instead of going deep on weed they re invested just not heavily they have pivoted to asia and other foreign markets where they have been making a killing pun intended
tobacco is making record profits growing in the us and seling to asia and africa they dont want to expose themselves to future litigation in the us over weed
because they don t have the upper hand in the cannabis market in the way they do in the tobacco market
you don t want the cigarette companies taking over the weed industry they ll just add a million cancer causing chemicals for the sake of making people hopelessly addicted
there are a few reasons why big tobacco companies have not yet gone hard on cannabis and pushed through legalization firstly cannabis remains illegal at the federal level in the united states which is where most big tobacco companies are based this makes it difficult for these companies to invest in the cannabis industry without running afoul of federal laws secondly while some states have legalized cannabis for recreational or medical use there is still a great deal of uncertainty around the regulation of cannabis products including issues related to quality control product safety and advertising restrictions this uncertainty makes it difficult for big tobacco companies to confidently enter the market thirdly there are concerns about the potential health risks associated with cannabis use particularly when it comes to smoking cannabis given the ongoing public health concerns around tobacco use and the associated health risks big tobacco companies may be wary of being seen as promoting another potentially harmful substance finally it s worth noting that the cannabis industry is still relatively new and rapidly evolving big tobacco companies may be taking a wait and see approach observing how the market develops and waiting for regulatory and legal frameworks to become more established before making significant investments
big tobacco will screw it up for example it s not the nicotine in cigarettes that s bad it s all the chemicals and additives they put in tobacco and the paper
they don t gotta do shit it s fixing to happen anyway and then them boys can go do they thing until then they still making stupid bread they eating
can t get addicted to pot you can get addicted to nicotine also it s harder to make cigs than grow marijuana
just come to canada it s legal here
i d never buy a joint from fuck ass marlboro and i know a lot of stoners would probably feel the same way
big tobacco companies have not pushed for cannabis legalization due to legal challenges regulatory uncertainty social stigma public health concerns and different consumer demographics the regulatory environment around cannabis is still evolving and there is a social stigma associated with it that is different from tobacco cannabis consumers are often younger and more liberal than tobacco consumers which may alienate big tobacco s existing customer base
when i used to smoke cigarettes if i smoked weed i d get too paranoid to smoke another cigarette for hours
keep them off our green no one needs that extra crap in their pre rolls
long time pothead here the tobacco industry has a body count in the millions please for the love for gob do not let marlboro do to weed what they did to tobacco
mass produced joints just wouldn t hit the same as going to a dispensary and choosing what s best for you that day
people who smoke cigs like nicotine its a totally different sensation compared to thc big tobacco already has their market of their customers arent going to quit nic for thc so for them theres no reason to branch out when you consider the risk of starting a new business venture
pot has been legal in canada for maybe years and not one tobacco company is involved in its cultivation or sale our largest drug store chain was planning to sell it as a medicinal product but has since decided not to for whatever reasons established companies are just not trying i am sure they have good reasons but it is certainly not what i expected
this isn t part of it this is of it they sell a product that is highly addictive and sells for 1000x harvesting price marijuana as a product is barely profitable the only people making money on marijuana are the retail locations
i just sold lbs of good outdoor cannabis for fml
marlboro has like the best name recognition though that would be like budweiser worrying about microbreweries hurting their business in my opinion
those companies are vastly underestimating how lazy people are and how willing they are to pay to do nothing i went from paying zero dollars for video games with torrenting to one click purchases on steam just so i didn t have to bother there s no way the few potheads who would care enough to actually grow the plants without killing them would impact their sales at all
underrated comment
i also read it as taco at first lmfao maybe we re just hungry
i think you re right banking is likely the biggest factor
the hippies from the s and s are retirement age now odd that they are not a stronger influence
yeah that s not it
oh i don t want them to but i just figured with the downturn of public opinion on tobacco and the upturn on cannabis they would have really turned their focus to the obvious new cash grab
that s not how that works sorry
yes this exactly
it s both nicotine is extremely addictive so it s also bad
that is not how science works sorry cigarettes cause harm because you are literally inhaling fire and smoke
just one story https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2021/02/09/tobacco-giant-altria-is-pushing-marijuana-reform-on-congress-and-state-lawmakers/amp/). in altria marlboro phillip morris parent company and one of the top tobacco companies in the world invested billion usd into a canadian cannabis company cronos one of the largest and the first legal multinational cannabis company for a share and have been very politically outspoken since then asking for looser regulations and international decriminalization of marijuana so wouldn t say they aren t trying they definitely are just politics and regulations are slowing them down and it s topic that doesn t get much news coverage
fill the void
i wonder if they didn t want the optics of competing with the government
thats not true altria invested billion into cronos
you know in states in the us where cannabis is legal they really do it right everyone s id gets checked the big government database checks how much weed you ve bought in a month so you don t go over the limits and if you try to rob the place you re definitely going to have a bad time they could regulate tobacco and alcohol the same way if they were serious about keeping it out of the hands of minors
the only people making money on marijuana are the landlords
kilos that should ve gotten you at least 35k
can t be that good if it s that cheap
the few potheads who would care enough to actually grow the plants without killing i think you re vastly overestimating the effort here in a state as far north as michigan you can get a single marijuana seed buy some shake and take a seed plant it in an pot with potting soil leave it in your back yard and have many ounces by fall literally the same amount of effort it takes for me to have some petunias sitting on the porch
those companies have no advantage in marihuana production any other companies can produce it they are afraid that people will smoke less tobacco which is a product they ve been producing for a while so they have experience and advantages compared to new companies that would try to produce and market it
very few stoners grow and significantly fewer do it a second time this is very accurate
i m not hungry but i always want a taco literally always
it would be a smart move on their part
explain
competing with the government canadian government give the big companies money whenever they ask for it like some grandpa sliding a bill to his grandson just look at bombardier
that s a good point probably a factor forsure
for real
welcome to the legal washington cannabis market
the buyer said it was the best outdoor he saw that year then he said he at worth of unsold inventory he already couldn t move quality doesn t matter when the python is full of pig
of absolutely garbage weed sure if all you do is throw it in some soil and leave it your end product isn t really worth smoking
smoking causes harm because the user is literally breathing in fire and smoke the degrees f smoke scalds the airways mouth esophagus lungs killing epithelial cell that then have to regenerate rapidly and are thus more prone to mutation cancer development byproducts of combustion burning are the predominant sources of the harmful constituents from cigarettes specifically the smoke which has been misconstrued as the industry adds cancer chemicals t0 them those harmful constituents are deposited into the body as tar and ash which would be like inhaling well ashes from the fireplace which we know would not be a wise choice happy to talk more over dm if you have questions
and also nicotine is naturally present in tobacco and is never added to cigarettes nicotine is addictive yes but smokers report they continue to smoke for the hand to mouth behavior and the routines they associate with smoking like waking up making coffee then going outside to enjoy said coffee and a cigarette in other words the behavior of smoking contributes to cigarette dependency
must be great for the consumer though buy 1kg and it ll last years
ya that s fair forsure there s definitely a market for it
is that really true
so weed is just as cancer causing as cigarettes since you re doing the same thing not that i ever thought smoking weed wasn t harmful also the chemicals are in fact not dangerous
nicotine is naturally present everyone knows that some do add nicotine though american spirit got sued for doing exactly that recently so are you saying the added chemicals do not cause harm
no the commodity market is moving to auto flower ruderalis that is shit but can be double cropped this flooded the flower and oil market there s still good indoor nitche market but the retail space is making money at the expense of both growers and consumers
at that price it is shit weed guaranteed
just not a legal market
yes well i m not an expert but i have grown weed before it tasted like shit it was moderately potent it takes a decent amount of effort to grow quality cannabis sure growing outdoors is easier as long as it s the right time of year the climate is appropriate the plant is protected from animals and the soil is fertile but you still have to separate the males and females the plants would still need to be tended to that being said with good seeds it s probably not that challenging outdoors i think indoors is more of a logistical nightmare then it comes to cutting off the buds drying and curing them which is its own process so yes and no
it s not rocket science but it s easy to fuck up the potency seems more or less predetermined by the strain as long as the plant doesn t get stressed and is properly taken care of soil ph nutrients water schedule light temp etc also flushing the plant and the cutting drying and curing as a whole yeah it s easy but imo it s also easy to fuck up if someone wants some primo flower it is easy to simply grow weed but not necessarily the dank stuff
ya pretty much i mean if you have little to no tolerance it wouldn t matter you d still get a good high off low quality weed but for anyone with any tolerance it literally wouldn t be worth it to smoke it you d just irritate your lungs without getting much of a high there is a pretty massive discrepancy when it comes to weed potency and while strain difference account for the bulk of it growing conditions plays a big factor too
the chemicals are harmful yes smoke from cannabis is as equally harmful as smoke from cigarettes yes if not more because cannabis burns at far higher temperatures because of its higher oil content compared to tobacco those who consume cannabis via smoking are indeed exposed to harmful byproducts however no one is smoking cigarette sized joints every single day like they do with tobacco cigarettes so the total amount of exposure to those harmful chemicals is lower it is untrue that cannabis use is safe and anyone who tells you otherwise is either in denial or misinformed and perhaps disinformed there are numerous measurable detrimental effects to health from cannabis use and the chronic high intake cannabis use we experience today is not yet well characterized clinically
by themselves no but yes they absolutely do cause harm and are harmful because the only way they are consumed from cigarettes is from lighting them on fire and inhaling the smoke eating a cigarette would likely only give you a nicotine buzz and a stomach ache
sounds like capitalism at its finest step squeeze suppliers for cheap goods then step over charge customers step massive profit
maybe if there were tax deductions but the irs don t play weed
dude similar situation growing up but i am an only child i would loved to have had an older sibling to go out with you would make her day
take her out my brother is years older then me has always been my hero
don t focus on what others may think you should do what you think is right
ok i ll do it the worst that can happen is someone confronts me but i ll explain to them as i m sure she will as well
not at all my big brother took me out once and i literally still talk about it years later it s one of my most cherished memories of childhood
don t worry what other people think in the end it s about building memories with your sister and being a good male influence i know for you it s about a different gender issue but i m years older than my sister and i took her to the park and other places all the time and people asked here and there if i m the mom at first i was bothered by it but i realized it s not what other people think but that my sister is happy
i took my little sister to dinner just last week to catch up and talk about life and just have some fun laughs nothing was weird about it and nobody asked stared or said a word to us
nope my brothers 29m and 33m take our half sister to the mall and the like all the time
it s definitely not weird i think it s awesome that you want to be a good sibling kids teens have guardians of all ages nobody is going to call the cops on you
when i read the title i thought you meant take her out as in murder once i read the body i realized my mind is royally fucked this is actually a very sweet question do what you think is right and don t mind the nay sayers
my sister and i have an even bigger age gap and i would never stop taking her out just because of what people thought fuck them she s your sister that means more than anything
definitely not my sister and i are years apart she s an adult now but we go to movies and stuff most recent was terrifier it was a good time if you ve got a good relationship with your sibling hold onto that for as long as you can
not weird at all take care of your sister my friend
take your sister out make it about her not you show her how people should treat and respect her and teach her about grace and understanding
since when is hanging out with a sibling weird keep that good relationship going i regret not being super close with my siblings growing up
it s not weird it s wholesome and sounds as if it d be great for her
that is so very kind and sweet it s not weird at all my sister is five years older than me and she took me out sometimes too these were some of my best memories i have as a kid nobody should care why you are going to a movie and having dinner together it really is none of their business
if someone says something just tell them it s your sister my niece and i would get weird looks from nosey people she would just tell them who i was
this isn t weird and don t worry about what anyone thinks she is your sister and taking her out is going to be good for her she needs someone who plans everything covers everything and makes her smile with a few corny jokes where do you find a camouflage airplane indaskies in disguise you are doing a good thing and it isn t weird or strange at all also i doubt anyone will even think anything of it so don t worry about that
that s your sister dawg it s fine don t let ol mtg out there get you thinking everyone thinks a dude walking around with a kid is a pedo some many people are normal and have siblings or cousins or friends kids they re watching or whatever no sweat also good work my man keep being the light you wanna see in the world
please keep hanging out with your sister for as long as you can it s good for both of you
it is not weird to take your little sister out especially if you want to be a good role model and provide her with support during a difficult time it is understandable that you want to catch up with her and spend quality time together as long as your intentions are genuine and you are not doing anything inappropriate or illegal there should be no reason for people to give you a look or call the cops on you it s important to be aware of any potential concerns or judgments but ultimately you know your relationship with your sister and your intentions best just make sure to check in with her and respect her boundaries and have a good time bonding
take her out if people look at you weird so what that s your sister people need to mind their business
why would it be stupid to hang out with your sibling even if the situation wasn t depressing under what circumstances is that wrong
this is lovely you re building memories
nope i was when my brother was born i moved away for college as a young working adult i d pick him up for a weekend miles one way and treat him to movies shows dinner etc amongst the many outings one of the most memorable was his 8th grade graduation present a week in the white mountains az since he like fishing then a last minute trip to the grand canyon fished at a nearby lake i m now we re still very close
sad world we live in when older siblings can t hang out with their younger siblings without having to worry about being confronted or labeled as something take your sister out you shouldn t be nervous and it sucks that you have these worries society has to do better
i wish i had siblings either to take me out or for me to take out take her out build a solid foundation with her and let her feel that she can rely on you
oh my heart this is so wholesome you are doing great
its perfectly normal to take a younger family member out to do fun things only thing that would make it bad is if you actually had bad intentions
hell no enjoy the time together
has anyone actually ever confronted you about hanging out with her before or are you just imagining a scenario of people getting mad suspicious of you for it that sounds like anxiety to me people usually do not give af about strangers in public who are minding their own business
my older brother and i are years apart and he used to take me out all the time it was great we did half dome together when i was about your sister s age be there for your sister that s so much more important than what anyone else thinks or says she ll remember it forever and so will you
teaching a person how they should be treated with respect is part of the sibling code teach your sibling they are worth more than their sexuality that interest should be based on intellectual pursuits
do it i m sure she will love spending time with you if you want ask her what movie she wants to see it s awesome that you care about her and your relationship
you re really thinking about this too much it s fine and completely normal no one is going to bat an eye
same as everyone else take her out and be her hero
you ll be fine anyone who assumes y all are in a relationship has fuckn issues
no
perfectly normal people don t call the cops on a man and a teenager unless he s putting his hands on her
take her my brother is years older than me and we also have different dads i would have loved if he wanted to spend time with me he s been in and out of jail since he was over years and he s currently in federal prison he s a deadbeat
nope according to my dumbass parents it is weird then these clowns had the nerve at a family gathering to say idk why these kids aren t close
it s only weird if you are acting like a bf gf couple if you are there just hanging out at the movies and eating a burger nothing wrong with that good for you to be a good older role model for her wishing you both positive thoughts
my brother took me out after our mothers death just to walk and get fast food and talk and be together i cherish that memory it s not weird at all
shes your sister it is not weird to take her out
no younger siblings need that just keep ids handy and a phone to contact someone elder in family if police gets involved
no that is not weird
my brother is only years older than me he took me out all the time and people would assume i was his girlfriend which was barf but we we would basically just react obnoxiously as a response to them laugh and have fun being miscreants definitely take your sister out
i m sorry we live in a world where you d even feel like you should question this
bro it s your sister you re family don t be weird and it s not weird everything you described is a pretty normal every day thing lots of parents are divorced and kids lack father figures
completely normal just hangin with a sibling
she s your sister y all can bond like siblings can do and there s nothing wrong with it fuck anyone who makes assumptions about you while you re out
absolutely not anyone who says differently is an idiot be a good role model and have fun together
not at all there s nearly years between my sister and i i use to take her out all the time when we were younger and still do on occasion out for meals out for drinks away for weekends etc she s one of my best mates why would i not
as the oldest of my siblings just take her out if anyone says anything tell the truth we re siblings just hanging out
it s not weird
you would absolutely become the coolest person in her life you absolutely should
i m years older than my brother we went out to play pool last weekend and before covid nerd movies every month or so it was only weird when he was super young and called me mom half the time
my cousin is years older than me and we use to go out to dinner just the of us all the time when i was a teen i never thought about it being weird as it was my cousin and if anyone said anything that s all i would have said honestly we are still close and i learned a lot from him and am forever grateful he wanted to spend time with his little cousin
of course you can go for a meal with your sister relax
dude i m in my late thirties but i look like i m in my mid twenties i get looks when i take my teenaged daughters out but idgaf don t let what other people think ruin the moments you get to spend with your family because they don t last forever
if anyone bothers you just tell them she s your sister i think this is great
it s essential that you take out you little sister that way she ll know what a bad date is when she has one tell her you are showing her how a guy should treat a girl and that you want her to have high expectations when she goes on dates don t worry about weird look from people it s your sister who matters
i m i wish i had a younger sibling to take out i wouldn t even think about what other people think
you definitely should do it even if people do look at you weird it s worth it just to be a good influence in your sister s life especially since she s going through some tough times she needs supportive adults in her life people she knows she can rely on it really does make a world of difference for a kid my sister 7yrs older than me did the same for me growing up when my dad was battling with cancer
that s completely normal hope you guys have a good time
its weird that you have to ask that
both boys and girls need a male influence growing up enjoy spending time with her
nothing wrong with taking her out for a movie just be careful not to do anything to suggest you re dating such as holding hands putting your arms around her etc
you re siblings it is fine if you said is it weird to take my year old girlfriend out then i would say yes but your own blood you should hang out and enjoy yourselves your sibling relationship is important
i m the sister to a brother with the same age difference though there were some rough times in his teen years i really love spending time with him and we get each other much better than our other siblings closer in age to each of us definitely spend the time together and i don t think you ll have any of the issues you re worried about really heck once i was asked if my brother was my son and i don t look old for my age i hope all goes well and your sister and you have a good bond
if someone calls the cops on you the cops will pretty much immediately find out everything is okay and they might go chew out the person who called them listen buddy spits on ground you can t just call us and waste our time with this bullshit
it s not that weird
dude absolutely not w big bro
if someone says something say mind your own business
my brother is years older than me he used to pick me up from school from time to time and take me out for a snack those are some of my happiest memories we re both old now and still close
so maybe people give you a look if you believe this is the best way to treat her and all this do it and let people think what they think you re being a good big bro they don t know
as someone who had half siblings but grew up an only child take her to hang out don t listen to anyone who says it s weird she s your family
nahonestly its fine tbh
spending time with your sibling isn t weird no if you re a positive male influence that s a good thing and a lot of people don t look like their relatives anyways i think it s really sweet that you want to spend time with her and i think she d really appreciate it is a crazy age to be as a young kid regardless so i think it would be awesome people are gross and it s their weird problem if they re sexualizing siblings and people who are obviously not in a romantic relationship
not weird at all this is an opportunity for you to become closer to your sister and be that mentor she never knew she needed
do iiiiiiiit when i was a young girl i d wanted an older brother like this someone who had my back but undeniably was a pain in the ass because he s my brother it s his job some will give you funny looks ignore them just because they assume the worst doesn t mean anything you re out with your sister fuck em a disturbing number of people forget men can be fathers brothers friends and mentors i am so so sorry that is the reality of the world however for children like your sister but not your sister i m glad people try to watch for signs to be worried even if they sometimes look in the wrong place go out have fun play laugh talk cry yell do what you guys need to do and don t worry about the world s opinions my advice from being her age tiny rebellions are just silly and fun at the cinema produce hidden candy from a jacket to share informing her that smuggled candy tastes better night time drives with loud music through non residential areas are the best shit since silced bread and dont underestimate her is plenty old enough to understand the realities of death and what she doesn t know she can understand through conversation like how it s sad someone who was suffering is gone but can be a relief they aren t hurting anymore and that it s okay to not feel as sad as you expected for instance i think what you re doing is amazing a brothering
this sounds awesome
take her to an amusement park
don t worry about what other people think it s also none of their business take her out and be the good role model that she needs this should make her day in fact if you re in the same area you could make it a thing you do on a regular basis at least monthly
the fact you can t go out with a family member and enjoy time together days two things either the place where you live is fucked up or you are overthinking and exaggerating everything to much you shouldn t care about anyone else when you just want to spend quality time with your family
same my brother is years older and was more of a father figure than my actual dad it s so admirable to recognize that you want to be a role model to your younger sibling op as a younger sister my brother is also my hero and i m grateful for him
yeah until people think about calling the cop on the dude i can see why he concerns since people kinda love jumping right at the chance to call someone bad names
you don t need to explain anything op just relax and have a nice time with her ignore everyone else
will ask her to bring her school id just in case i have to prove it
your post got me a bit misty eyed so i really hope you do do this with her may it bring a little healing to both of you
first of all there s a chance no one says a word to you second that s their problem if anybody says anything just tell them she s my kid sister now kindly fuck off
huh what country do you live in that people would find you suspicious for taking out your little sister
highly doubt anyone will approach you if so just be a dick and tell them it s your sister and to stop being weird you re doing nothing wrong taking your own family out
i would assume that you were brother and sister if i saw you
i think your thinking about it way to deeply none has a right to question anything if your not giving them a reason to it s your sister not your underage gf none needs an explain or id
lmao royally fucked might be right
we do not live in such a world we live in a world where people have irrational fears of being confronted but that basically never happens
for example i spent my niece s formative years watching cosmos and encouraging her toward a stem carrer i m proud to say she is a marine biologist student at a top uni with an internship at a major aquarium
its not weird at all
they get eaten ants can clean a bird carcass pretty quickly other animals eat them too
most animals tend to retreat to a place they feel safe when dying for birds they are so mobile so they can get a lot of places humans can t and go very far as the crow flies they will die near their own nest they are also small and plenty of scavengers will leave nothing but feathers after a short while
birds are small and often rot or break down quickly
i don t feel like you re looking for dead birds i find them constantly their remains are just quickly scattered because their bones are fragile and thin so they break down quickly feathers are the main remains that last very long and they are scattered by the wind easily if you ve ever seen a pile of feathers that s a dead bird
into the belly of a predator i had a picnic interrupted by a very ill pigeon the seagulls tore it apart and ate it before i d finished my apple
what have you done to every dead chicken you ve ever seen
removed
same reason i don t see any cat food in the bowl a few minutes after feeding my kitties predators and scavengers
they get eaten
i don t know my dog is able to find them well enough
as a dog owner i see a lot of dead birds my dog seems to think they are part of the buffet
when they feel ill they just fly up to heaven
birds have antigravity by default that s why they cling into branches to sleep and why they have to flap their wings to stay near the ground when flying when they die they obviously do neither of these things so their bodies just float up and away into space
possums are the vacuum cleaners of nature
apparently smashing into my window x200b every year our neighbors spray their lawns with some anti mosquito treatment and every year i find like dead birds around my house in the month afterward some just sort of go weird and die others smash into my windows and die x200b our neighborhood has cats though and occasionally vultures so if i don t find them something else does
people don t go most places you d find them rooftops fenced off yards parking lots overgrown areas etc we spend nearly all of our time in a very limited space
the government usually picks up their drones when they die in order to hide the truth from us
other animals eat them circle of life and all that
they are all eaten by something
r birdsarentreal
r birdsarentreal
the insides of cats owl pellets and other predators also their remains break down incredibly quickly hollow bones and all so unless you happen across one within a couple days it d likely blend into the leaf litter entirely
it s funny you say this because i found a pile of bones and feathers literally just yesterday
they look for a quiet place to hide https://youtu.be/eo0_bhb2wry)
the side of the road in wyoming is a great place to find them i rode my bicycle almost the entire length of and saw hundreds maybe thousands
they don t die they go to a farm upstate where they can fly and play all day
depends on the bird in my yard alone they go to the chicken coop to die when my dog goes out and eats them or the hawks get them one died in my pool recently often times all i find are feathers and a bit of entrails to know a bird was there in a matter of hours a dead bird will be scavenged by crows rats ants and other insects and in days the remaining tissue is covered in mold and other fungus nature is a great corpse recycler
they all go to dartmouth ns i moved here years ago and i ve seen more dead birds than in years prior to the move
they are a very abundant food source yum
i ve actually seen a lot of dead baby birds through out the years and i live in the city in the city there is a lot of clean up so it will be harder to see them if people are doing their jobs here you shouldn t see a single dead pigeon i got to see a dead pigeon and a dead rat because they didn t do their jobs they stayed on that street for days and people would see them when they passed that street
elton john had this same question https://youtu.be/\_geuouekrcw](https://youtu.be/_geuouekrcw)
they re all outside of my aunt s a frame
in the united states alone outdoor cats kill approximately billion birds every year https://abcbirds.org/program/cats-indoors/cats-and-birds/#:~:text=in%20the%20united%20states%20alone,outdoor%20cat%20plays%20a%20part.) keep your cats indoors people
they are snackies
the exterminator who came by to check my balconies for termite damage told me there s a dead bird on one of them i didn t look
they get scavenged pretty quickly by other wildlife but i assume most of them die in more heavily wooded areas where they go seeking shelter
i see dead birds all the time the hell u talkin bout
windows
i live in a more rural area i see lots of dead birds
so apparently you have never read jonathon livingston seagull
i spent one summer at a restaurant under a large bridge with a popular fishing spot there was a pigeon hanging from the bridge with fishing line around its neck hung there all summer so to answer your question they find a nice peaceful spot and hang themselves
according to this podcast from the smithsonian we lose billion birds a year just to window strikes we don t see them because people pick them up https://www.si.edu/sidedoor/lights-out
they just replace the batteries s or is it
have you ever eaten chicken
birds aren t real
removed
r birdsarentreal
they go back to the fbi
because birds aren t real duh https://birdsarentreal.com/
birds don t die they run out of batteries
in order to be able to fly birds are lighter than air when they die they just float upwards until we can t see they any more
let me introduce you to r birdsarentreal
birds aren t real they are government surveillance drones then they die they go back to the repair facility you can even see them recharging on powerlines also the name bird is an acronym bravely intrusive reconnaissance device
birds aren t real
they go back to headquarters for flesh replacement and endoskeletal replacement or recycling
birds like many animals are subject to a range of natural and man made factors that can impact their lifespan however you are correct that finding dead birds is relatively uncommon given the number of birds that exist one reason for this is that many birds die in areas that are inaccessible to humans such as in dense forests high cliffs or bodies of water these areas are often remote and difficult to access making it less likely that humans will come across a dead bird additionally many bird carcasses are scavenged by other animals such as insects rodents and larger predators which can quickly break down the remains and leave little evidence of the bird s death another factor that may contribute to the relative scarcity of dead birds is that birds are generally very good at hiding signs of illness or injury this is an evolutionary adaptation that helps birds avoid predation as sick or injured birds are more vulnerable to attack as a result many birds may die quietly and out of sight without displaying obvious signs of distress or injury overall while finding dead birds may be uncommon it s important to remember that bird populations are still subject to a range of threats including habitat loss climate change pollution and other factors that can impact their long term survival
cats
the circle of life makes quick work of energy rich carcasses
i found one squished and stuck to my car tire last summer as far as the others i never really thought about it
there are a lot of scavangers
our dog takes care of any of them in our yard
as others point out they get eaten though as far as i can tell none point out that they get eaten by squirrels a cat wants to eat something that it hunted but squirrels are scavengers they eat what they find and they are often in a position to find a bird that is dead or near death
i have cats i find dead birds in my yard frequently well usually wings we don t always find the whole body also i have found a few squirrel tails in my yard
because they are actually robots to spy on us
i see them very often where are you looking
my dog sniffs them out and has a little munch
well my dog takes care of about of them per week my wife doesn t even scream when she finds dead birds in the couch anymore
they go to dead bird island it s a place that has baffled science experts of all fields some say it s a rumor or a hoax no one has ever returned from dead bird island
my back yard apparently i find sick dying or dead pigeons in my yard at least three times a year it s some secret pigeon graveyard or something i don t use any pesticides or pest killers because both my front back yards are desert gravel so i know it s not my fault the pigeons come to my house to die it s just weird
birds are tasty most anything will eat a dead i ve even seen a cow chomping on baby herons if birds are actually dwarf dinosaurs then it is karma for being terrible lizards for millions if years
birds are small very calorie dense compared to many mammals and their hollow bones get broken down much quicker than mammal bones all this means that their bodies get eaten by scavengers slightly quicker add to this the fact that they can go just about anywhere and they aren t as likely to be roadkill and random dead birds seen much more rare than raccoons and possums i m assuming op is american of course if we had a larger population of temperate forest dwelling penguins you would see way more dead birds
where do you live i ve walked over dozens of dead birds just walking down one street
one day in middle school i was walking under the train with my friend apparently there was a birds nest in the railing and a bird ended up almost splatting on my head luckily it just missed and ended up grazed my leg the bird was completely torn apart it was very saddening we went to the mta worker and told him about it he said they ll remove the nest but i never checked back i hope they did
my cats bring them to my back porch
i feel like i see them fairly frequently on sidewalks in the yard and even more so in the street
i was sitting in the park with my family we had just got done eating lunch then a bird that looked like a crow just dropped out of the tree we went to check it out and it was dead
do you work outside i m a letter carrier and i see dead birds all the time
i have also read that it s extremely rare to find a dead bear it s a sort of a mystery where they go
there are so many dead birds and other animals including kangaroos on the road and highway in australia
that s because birds aren t real maaaan
most birds live forever
i d imagine it s because freshly dead birds probably get eaten
i used to live next to a hole public golf course in auburn ma the land was owned by the audubon society and leased to the golf course management company i d walk the perimeter each morning and got to know the groundskeeper one of his dawn tasks was to pickup and dispose of any dead birds before anyone noticed they were secretly using toxic pesticides fertilizers and didn t want landlord to see the carcasses
they just die in the air and drop into woods fields lakes and rivers cats dogs and rodents eat the rest
i eat them
i live in toronto lots of hawks here i see dead bird parts all the time
birds aren t real they don t die but at some point their batteries won t hold a charge and need replaced the authority has workers gather the fallen birds at night and take them to have the batteries replaced once replaced and recharged they re sent back out
my cat brings me one every other dang week
the owl that lives behind our house takes care of them
ants
well i dunno about you guys but i ve been making sandwiches with em little sun fucked grackle on marble rye action
you ll find many outside of hospitals and other type glass buildings
because birds aren t real they are government drones
earf is big
in the belly of other animals
they are in my yard i always find pieces of them
scavenged by larger animals i have raccoons that have taken dead rats and rat traps from my back yard on multiple occasions eta rat traps with the rats in them
they go back to be re fueled at a government facility so they can keep spying on us and dropping chem turds from the sky
i saw two dead ducks last week both by freeway on ramps i am a beaver though so i was not saddened
i just saw a dead hawk yesterday face down wings partly out though i was way out in the country and stopped at an intersection to stretch
don t offer them snacks or plan lunch meetings during ramadan
my advice find a friend with whom you can have a frank conversation i worked with a man from china for a few years he was amazingly open about chinese culture and how it differs from american culture we sat during many lunch hours talking about those differences we learned a lot about each other for example people in asian cultures tend to bring the bowl to their face whereas americans tend to bring the spoon to their face because we had mutual respect for each other these cultural differences were seen as an opportunity to learn about each other not as a reason to create a division between us another example my daughter went to a very multi cultural preschool and kindergarten and became very good friends with an indian girl the girl s parents became good friends of ours and we had many dinners together one evening sitting in their home i had my legs crossed on the couch the indian woman pointed out to me that the sole of my foot was facing her directly she said that in indian culture this was offensive she didn t say this because she was offended but to tell me to be careful not to do it among other indians for fear of having it be seen as an offense so my advice is to find someone open to talking about culture differences and open to some cross education about different cultures between the two of you
they likely have a prayer space i d make sure i knew where that was and never walk in there with shoes on the muslim community center i work with from time to time has allowed me to wear booties occasionally to be able to keep my shoes on if i wanted but i just wear slip on shoes so i can be as respectful as possible other than that they basically acted like any other person i d ever met before in high school the like muslims i went to school with just didn t like having to sit in the lunch room during their fasts so i guess if you wanna go the extra mile you could choose not to eat in front of hungry folks none of the ones i ve met have been dickheads about anything so they re probably really understanding when it comes to faux pas made by people who don t know they re doing it they ll probably nicely tell you if you re really fucking up
just don t bring up religion
it depends on which part of the world you are in and which country they are from muslims are a full spectrum from the super religious to the super closeted non religious be curious some places like dubai is super chilled don t go about offending anyone s religious sentiments but that s just basic manners things to be wary if super religious alcohol pork dating are no goes don t offer or ask people out for drinks pork dates unless they ask with women keep a respectful safe distance and let them take lead definitely no handsy gestures or harmless touching in ramadan just be kind and conscious of your eating habits around people who are fasting one tip don t ask people if they are fasting it s just going to be awkward for you if you are not in a progressive space considering women dont fast when they have their periods assume everyone is hope this helps you got it the fact that you asked means you care
just asking goes a long way you might have to just accept that they have some weird hookups but every muslim i ve met could fit me into their worldview without trying to change me straight white american dude so i wouldn t worry too much
in addition to the above if you see someone do something you know is broadly haram do not ask them about it i know it might feel like a way for you to demonstrate your sensitivity or awareness or get to know them as a person but it s just awkward i m not even talking about the big stuff just things like oh you re eating that candy i didn t know they made a gelatin free version or oh so you eat gelatin it s not going to be a productive conversation best case scenario they ll spark an actual conversation but most of the time it will be somewhere in between oh yeah i just don t care about that or i do care about that and feel extremely guilty but i just love haribo also don t assume people are consistent either with one specific belief or generally like well he lives with his girlfriend so probably eats gelatin also just because someone doesn t practice something doesn t mean it s not part of their cultural conciousness for example i worked in an office where most people were not strict about religious dietary requirements but if i d brought in something with bacon bits i would not have had as many takers because fundamentally many of them had not eaten it much and been conditioned to see it as appetizing in the same way as if i d brought in rat meat
if you are a man don t touch females in any way instead of shaking hands for example putting your hand over your chest heart instead
muslim here just ask if you by accident do something inconsiderate i am sure it will cause no grievances and they might correct you politely islam is not too much different from traditional christianity or orthodox judaism contrary to what other people here say we don t get offended if someone offers us snacks while we are fasting i am not sure where this stereotype came from
if there are women please don t touch them even in a friendly way like a pat on the shoulder
wow came to say don t take advice from reddit for such a sensitive issue but instead came away pleasantly surprised the top stuff is good and won t get you fired on day i had a similar situation and asked a friend i made we spent many an hour discussing religion and appropriate respectful behavior i learned a lot and came away better for it i was just open minded listened and tried to understand instead of arguing
just treat people with dignity and respect you don t need to know anything about religion over time you will gain knowledge about your co workers just like any other job
i m muslim from a middle eastern country and happy to chime in it s hard to comment on cultural specifics since i don t know what country it is muslims can vary widely culturally from place to place if you re comfortable saying the country i may be able to give more specific advice i think in general you should be fine with just going about things normally but here s a few tips for ramadan people will be fasting but if you see someone not fasting don t ask or inquire why there s lots of reasons why people can t fast like medical or health reasons also women don t fast when on their period or sometimes won t if breastfeeding pregnant etc you definitely don t want to ask a woman why were you fasting yesterday but not today and get yourself into a mess of talking about her menstrual cycle people will be tired and grumpy while fasting most likely you can say ramadan kareem or ramadan mubarak or eid mubarak for eid a lot of people will be absent for eid since it s a holiday or some may take a few days off this really depends on country customs because it varies widely but i wouldn t shake the hand of someone of the opposite sex unless they extend their hand first again it really depends because some countries it s socially fine to shake hands and some it s very not you can place your hand over your heart and say nice to meet you if they don t seem to be into a handshake people may go to pray during the day this involves going and washing up in the bathroom and then going to a room area to pray the bathroom might have water all over if that s the case then it s from people washing to pray if you do see someone praying it s better to walk behind them rather than directly in front of them one thing that always gets on my nerves as a muslim woman muslim women you work with have agency and are not poor oppressed people needing to be saved people choose modesty and like the life they have just know that there s nothing to be sorry for us for or thinking that there s less power than men or something of course there s always exceptions and some women are put in awful situations but the vast majority of us are just regular women who prefer dressing modestly eta i personally don t mind when people eat in front of me when i m fasting but it seems to be split some people mind but i d say most don t mind if you wanted to ask what people prefer that would be nice also if you don t heat up pork in the office i know people would appreciate that as people find the smell off putting of course you still could if you want i m just saying if you wanted to go the extra mile that would be something people would appreciate good luck let me know if i can help with anything else
stick to a common workplace rule dont talk about religion while on the job
muslims typically pray multiple times per day look up the times and try not to schedule anything overlapping the prayer times unless you want it to pause in the middle if it is a muslim workplace there is probably a prayer space where they will go when they pray don t disturb the prayer while it s ongoing ask a coworker about any prayer space policies before entering at other times currently muslims are in the month of ramadan outside of certain exemptions sick very old very young pregnant muslims do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset i would recommend eating apart from your coworkers during this time it s not nice to see or smell food when you re hungry but you can t eat do not bring in any food or beverages for your coworkers until ramadan is over after ramadan make sure to ask one of your coworkers about halal food restrictions if you plan to bring food for others that s pretty much it
not that you re going to but don t make jokes about allah muhammed or even other religious figures some muslims have a profound respect for all prophets and some don t like any jokes about deities even telling a jesus joke could be disrespectful but just know your audience some might be devout and others might be very secular
i work with a lot of muslim people and one of my best friends there is muslim they encourage me asking questions about their religion and culture and are very nice friendly in general they know that everyone is not familiar with their customs so in my experience they have not been offended when i first started i offered my friend some fruit snacks and she looked at the ingredients and said no thank you i can t it has gelatin i said oh are you allergic she said no no haha it has pork i can t have pork in my religion i felt so bad i was like oh i m so sorry for trying to give you that she was like don t worry you didn t know i check everything just in case i d just say don t be super vulgar but why would you at work anyway bad language can offend anyone lol
if everyone seems a little grouchy and tired right now it s because of the fasting i work in a boarding school and a lot of our kids are celebrating ramadan they ll be so serious and down all day then the second they get back from breaking fast they re back to their old selves all cheerful and dancing around now it s easter break we have some students just spending all day sleeping don t underestimate how much fasting can impact how a person seems everyone will be a lot chirpier and friendlier once the fasting period ends don t eat or prepare food in front of fasting colleagues if possible i made the mistake of placing all the food for them to eat later in the common room and they were all sat next to it sadly staring at the chicken nuggets this should go without saying for any coworker regardless but don t touch female coworkers different people have different levels of strictness but some women will not even shake a coworkers hand for example if a coworker is ill or has a headache or something please try and be accommodating many will be avoiding all forms of medication and pain killers along with their fast we have a lad with a broken arm who isn t taking painkillers during ramadan and won t take his prescribed medication until after he s broken fast many won t mention it but i ve noticed a lot of my students just grinning and bearing it when they have bad headaches from fasting i m just trying to be mindful of noise and stuff so they have a quiet place they can come and get some peace
muslims have zero humour about their own religion but often plenty of humour when it s not about religion be yourself and don t talk a lot about religion
try not to eat in front of everyone during ramadan it s kinda rude in general i d know when the normal prayer times are and avoid scheduling meetings then heck you might even wanna join in for a short break from work just kneel on a prayer matt and meditate
if your going to offer food make sure it contains no pork or gelatin since it has pork in it avoid talking about religion
ignorance is curable be open and honest and ask questions
honestly just the fact that you are here says a lot and people around you will notice just be kind and honest and if you do make a mistake it s not a grave thing or anything just say sorry i didn t know and try not to do it again also a subtle thing that goes a long way is if you learn the proper pronunciation of names it s something so small but it goes so incredibly far
don t bring pork products and alcohol
muslims are humans treat them like would any other human in the workplace don t be a dick don t talk about religion or politics with that said the workplace you re describing is an edge case and it couldn t hurt to make some accommodations and do some research read up on islam with a focus on holy days and day to day practice your coworker may observe during ramadan consider not eating or drinking around people who are fasting if you re comfortable with it during your first with you new manager ask about office culture parties hours etc people are not dumb they ll understand what you re looking for
be open that you know little of their culture but would very much like to learn more about it imagine how you would feel about someone asking you to teach them something you are passionate about they will probably feel the same
you re not dumb its a nice thing to ask i work and have worked with muslims i also love bringing treats and snacks in to work but havr become more careful even some sweets far too many tbh still contain pork gelatine so avoid them in general avoid offering food right now until you ve made friends also don t assume anyone of a particular ethnicity is muslim i work with a few lovely ladies on nights one from karachi the other from somewhere in india i ve been secretly eating hiding in the toilets cause i thought it might be rude to stuff my face infront of someone who is fasting get this the lady just pulled out a lunchbox full of sandwiches and offered me one lol
if you bring baked goods to share make sure that you use alcohol free vanilla extract had a muslim co worker and he couldnt eat my baked goods
try not to be noisy during friday s they tend to do prayers on that day if you bring lunch make sure it s not pork and don t eat it near them if you do have to eat it ask if they re ok with it if you want to shake hands only shake the hands of males bow your heads to the female workers if you have any doubts on what you should or shouldn t do near that always ask never hurts to do so
as a jew who feels my own religion is often misunderstood and as someone with muslim and hindu friends you can politely ask questions in many cases they may appreciate your interest i would start by looking into what holidays are in islam though and being familiar there otherwise a well worded apologies for my ignorance but what is ___ is usually okay apology optional
pick one muslim guy at work that you feel comfortable asking stupid questions to lol that s kinda what i did any time he has stupid racist ignorant questions about mexicans he asks me and vice versa as long as you can both understand the end goal is to learn you should be good
i would have a chat with your boss you are not dumb just ignorant let this person know that you want to respect their religion so if they would not mind giving you a crash course and what to understand so that you do not insult any other co workers unintentionally
your blt is going to be pretty safe in the fridge at work
you re already ahead of the curve if you know it s ramadan
showing the bottoms of your shoes can be seen as offensive to some
if you are a man dont try to shake hands with your female colleagues
just be nice and make friends
honestly it s a lot harder to accidentally offend people than you think if you have good intentions and do a faux pas people are usually understanding unless you re really stupid like eat bacon on a plate with the prophet s image on it i ve worked in multicultural environments and everyone gets along really well even though we come from vastly different cultures races and religious backgrounds just be interested and appreciative p
muslims are people too typical office etiquette is fine asking questions is fine most likely someone there will notice you aren t a muslim and will be eager to share anything specific that the larger group likes to do at an occupational level how a muslim person works is likely no different than anyone else so let the more personal part of any relationships happen naturally and keep your focus on the day to work and just again being a normal kind person
in the workplace apart from not saying anything awkward which is just a good general rule be mindful of dietary restrictions during potlucks and what not aside from that you ll probably find they run the gamut in how devout they are to their observances islam is not anymore a solitary block than christianity do be aware holidays and such ramadan is currently going on which requires fasting from sunrise to sunset your co workers those that observe might be dragging ass or grumpier than usual
don t assume an individual is religious
let them know you don t know much about their beliefs and would like to learn more most people appreciate being asked directly about their religion and beliefs
ask them talk to them explain that you know very little about their beliefs and want to avoid doing anything that could be disrespectful communication is key
be respectful and ask questions people like to talk about their beliefs
don t ask them to draw mohammad
all of these comments are a load of rubbish you can do anything you like we re not in control of others eat infront of us it s totally ok we even get more reward when fasting and being around others who eat lol also you can eat your bacon etc it s your life we re not controlling others if you are respectful that s all there has to be but you don t need to be restricted to anything as that is not what us muslims impose on others so don t listen to these bigots and islamophobes in the comments they have no clue what they re talking about coming from a revert white muslim
say salam alaikum shalom or peace be with you don t touch people of the opposite sex bring some chocolates or some baklava as a gift except during ramadan during ramadan being some dates and if you work past sunset break them out don t be a dick be nice
eating is important they don t eat during the day when it s ramadan which is basically may and part of june they don t drink alcohol and don t eat pigs and some parts of cows either they also stop doing the things they re doing to make a pray sometimes during the day so surely they ll have an alarm for that
let them know that u dont know too much about islam and im sure they will give u passes just obviously dont be offensive and they will teach u stuff most ppl are reasonable and muslims are just ppl
zero religions dictate what kind of person i am i have empathy i m not rude i m not a bigot or racist and basically try to treat everyone the way i d have someone treat me i m not going to clown around and halfway assimilate if eating a bacon sandwich is offensive tough luck
ask your co workers this question so they can see you are making an effort not to offend them
ask the individuals for information about their practices stating that you don t want to offend them on accident i guarantee that they ll feel grateful and honored to explain and to teach you
if they do a potluck don t bring in pulled pork
things that come to mind don t initiate any physical contact including hand shakes with females avoid touching and passing thing to others with your left hand give them space and privacy quiet during prayer times avoid bringing pork products for lunch
ask someone most people are happy to tell you about their customs as long as you are sincere
well my advice is this just be open minded if they ask you about your faith be honest and you can open with well to be honest i don t know alot about your faith and culture will you be able to teach me the last thing i want to do is offend you or another follower of your faith i had an old co worker who s a muslim and i told him something along these lines and he was happy that i had questions about his diet prayer culture religion and life
do like i did and plead ignorance when it comes to the religion and ask questions i ve had coworkers explain judisim hindu and muslim religions to me most questions revolved around food
you are so sweet
tell your coworkers exactly that ask them they ll tell you
don t touch anybody no handshakes just eye contact keep your 5feet distance ask where their pray rooms are and avoid that place do not enter do not joke
just explain and ask them what they want you to avoid or do most people love to talk about their religion
i think it s pretty cool if you to take this into consideration it would have been easy to show up first day and be polite and quiet while learning the ropes but the fact you re worried about this again is pretty cool
it s going to be an uncomfortable workplace for you not because they are muslim but because of your co workers are of a different religion culture than you are and you are the outsider good luck to you i hope you feel welcome and fit in with your coworkers
just go with the flow and let people do what they do if it s obvious that you don t mean any harm most people will be forgiving if you misstep at all
don t mention jews or israel
dont bring up religion or joke about mohammed but other than just dont be a dick you probably shouldnt invite them to a happy hour or microwave pork in the office though tbf you shouldnt microwave pork ever
dont make a muhammad joke
start looking for another job they will force you out one way or another
do you ask similar questions when you know you are going to be in work related situation with all christians how about jewish people hindus x200b my point being that in a work related environment religion plays no part in work place conduct unless you are working at a place of worship
definitely don t be gay or an atheist don t talk about science biology or geology preferably don t be a woman and try not to get your head cut off
you don t have to do this but i would learn of their food restrictions so that you can bring food that isn t absolutely taboo to their religion if they feel you will go to hell for consuming pork and you eat pork even if they say nothing it might affect your reputation with coworkers which can affect your well being at the company again you can go the idgaf route and do what you want but everyone wants a calm easygoing and enjoyable work environment and that sometimes means respecting other peoples views even if they are unfair
if they are normal people nothing you do with no ill intent should offend them they can not expect others to show anything but normal consideration for them as people their religion is their own buisness and not something anyone else needs to mind at all
the beauty of it will be that once you get on with them you ll realise that all of these rubbish comments are lies and you ll start to know how muslims truely are and you ll love it even convert who knows it happens all the time ahhaahh me included
depending on the person they may have an aversion to you using or offering your left hand
don t touch any women the guys might be touching you though
don t show them the bottom of your shoes when sitting don t eat around them during their holy holidays
if you re an atheist don t tell them that
don t touch or shake hands with the opposite sex dress modestly and in line with your gender for their faith men wear pants and can wear short sleeves women wear long sleeves and long skirts or pants
islam is a totally stupid belief system don t bring up anything hinting at pedophilia the prophet had a wife who was betrothed at years old and whom he had sex with at the age of when he was
avoid realistic pictures of the prophet muhammad use cartoon depictions instead
they like when you draw stick figures of the profit muhammad
put a framed picture of the prophet muhammad on your desk they love that
bacon sandwich for breakfast every day
don t offer them pork and talk shit about bin laden all day long s
i used to work for a devout muslim engineer they are actually very gracious and understanding people very respectful and very tolerant of others i wouldn t overthink it
you should definitely avoid being a woman they hate those
bacon sandwich and a cold beer for lunch and you re all good
it s not your job to tiptoe around other peoples fragility mind your own business and if they take offense at something you did that s their problem you are there to do a job not to act as a cultural ambassador
tell them you rather not talk about religion if they ever bring it up also no allahu akbar or aloha snack bar jokes
i have to ask how you found this sort of office
even though it s tasty as hell don t offer them bacon
good luck
new employer should give you a read out with documentation up front to avoid any perceived transgression
are you left handed per chance
don t offer to buy the office pork ribs
don t bring pulled pork so share with the office trust me
i don t have any sound advice other than doing research about that culture so that you can prepare yourself i just wanted to tell you that it s awesome that you care that much
let them do their thing and you do your thing muslims are just people
don t say god bless you when someone sneezes
i m probably going to get downvoted for this but if you re not of the same faith or from the same region country you re probably going to be very discriminated against and passed over for advancement in this new company muslims tend to be very cliquey in my experience and favor their own over kafir non muslims ymmv though that was just my experience it s honestly pretty normal behavior though but just a little more pronounced we tend to favor and tend to like and gravitate towards people who are like ourselves
because almost all of our political contests are winner take all smaller parties don t really have a chance to get off the ground since casting a vote for a smaller party is functionally the same as voting for the party that you don t want to be in office
because first past the post voting systems without external influence will almost always devolve into two dominant parties cgp grey did a nice video on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo)
our election system isn t set up to handle it first past the post each voter gets only one vote and can only vote for a single candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins naturally results in the formation of two dominant parties as described by duverger s law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duverger's_law). there are a handful of states moving to adopt ranked choice voting but they re a small minority among a sea of fptp
math the election system with the winner takes it all leads to this phenomenon but i m sure others will be able to explain this better
everyone blaming first past the post but then other countries with a first past the post system have multiple parties the real reason is the electoral college in this system each state is given a set number of electors or electoral votes which they can give to a candidate based on the results of the election in some states it s winner takes all and in other states it s proportional the total votes needed to win is the maximum votes you can get is reagan won votes being the most winningest president of all time so now take that number and divide it by two the number you get is meaning that in order to win you have to get more than half in any kind of scenario where you take this system and start dividing it between a growing number of parties it becomes impossible to crown a single president unless one party has of all votes because this is such a tight race absolutely any attempt at forming a third party in the us is perceived as an attempt to spoil the election and undercut democracy without ross perot siphoning republican votes george hw bush might have won instead ross perot took of the total vote without getting a single elector perot spoiled again in and was shamed to make sure he never tried ever again similarly in al gore lost by just votes and there sits ralph nader with million votes congress and senate are different there are some people who sit as independents or third party like libertarian party member justin amash but for the most part these people will caucus with a bigger party because they want power
a lot of the counties you re probably thinking of have parliaments multiple parties work great under that system if it s just winner take all then two parties is the natural result
the us constitution requires that to win the presidency you must have a majority of all electoral votes cast this pretty much means there will always be two parties that are competitive in presidential races because if there were three we d almost never have a majority and congress would have to pick our president and nobody wants that so our political parties have organized themselves around this structural truth if there is a strong third party then one or both of the two major parties absolutely will adjust their platforms to attract those voters
it is in both parties best interest to have the least amount of parties possible
our political system can t handle parties much less than
primarily citizens united and lack of ranked choice voting
it has to do with the way our elections work the president is selected by general election rather than being chosen by a parliament as a result any 3rd party risk siphoning votes away from the most similar of the candidates to them people don t want to tank the major candidate they align with more by voting for a 3rd party candidate that won t win so in the end everyone consolidates around opposing candidates
first past the post ensures we only have two parties unlimited spending by corporate interests ensures both parties serve the same masters which is exactly how they want it we live in an oligarchy not a democracy
the two chosen parties are sponsored by the banks and debates are carefully guarded by government troops that arrest and detain dissenting parties candidates the threat of the other party keeps most people making apologies for their chosen lesser evil
probably less confusing to the lobbyists when they have to pay people off
the system we use most countries with a multi party system operate under a parlimentary system with multi member districts and or proportional representation these two things essentially mean that people vote for a list of candidates from the party they prefer and the percent of the votes the party gets translates to a roughly equal percent of seats in parliment the u s operates under a presidential system and usually has single member districts this combined with the electoral college being winner take all pushes electoral politics into favoring two major parties the u s system pushes politics into parties in a number of ways first the electoral college is set up so that if a person gets a plurality of votes in a state they get all of the states electoral votes importantly a candidate can only become president if they get electoral votes these two facts combined mean that it is only mathmatically viable for two roughly equal parties to compete for the presidency and have a chance of winning a majority of electoral votes another factor is in the u s often having single member districts in which one candidate who wins a majority vote wins the seat in the house this pushes the two party system in the same way the ec does the parties will never actively change any of this because it helps maintain their power these factors also mean that if a viable third party ever arises it is either absorbed into or replaces one of the main parties
cuz the mega corps that own america like it that way

the electoral college system does not allow for it in my analysis if there were several parties it could result in no party having a clear majority in the electoral college in that case the constitution allows the house of representatives to choose the winner i d like to see the electoral college eliminated and shift to a parliamentary system unless the democrats can have super majorities in the senate house and state houses that won t ever happen the ec benefits the republican party so there s no way we could get them to approve an amendment to the constitution regarding the ec
a state like california could try a system like proportional representation in their state assemblies tomorrow or texas could too for that matter they absolutely will not because the dominant political parties there have figured out having near absolute power is far better than sharing power in a coalition
if there were equal strength parties none of them would be able to earn the electoral votes needed to win the presidency it designed to have two parties and a dustbin or whatever for the of independent voters
i would be happy with just a third one
because people are brained washed to think that it is either dem or rep
americans would like to know the answer too
we are meant to be divided so naturally sides are the easiest to pit against one another
because corporations only have to bribe two sides and still get to maintain an illusion of choice
is cheaper to buy off than or duh
because so many people vote the party line there isn t room for other parties because we re all so afraid the other party is going to gain power it s assanine but i cannot tell you how many times people have explained that to me that s why they won t vote independent
because big corporations want it that way here
easier to pay off and control two parties than five
money
yeah it s total bullshit here we re basically stuck with a two party system we either go with democrats who have their issues or republicans who are batshit insane and give no fucks about anyone it seems like any time a third party comes along trying to offer something else the democratic party and republican party crush them nearly out of existence and third parties are just so small they can t keep up with or generate the money that the two main parties have but i would like to see a very innovative party come along some day and actually have some success i was never into the green party or the libertarian party
because americans are too fucking stupid to realize they are all falling for this you are throwing your vote away bullshit if they vite 3rd party i bet the top comment says it
makes it difficult for the uni party to control the masses
because the powers that be d s and r s two wings of the same bird squashed that shit last time it was tried ie unity party everything is legal and tolerable so long as it doesn t threaten the rich and powerful
plurality rule would be minority rule one party with a larger percent overruling parties that could equal a majority just wouldn t work us system is more based on compromise at least by design more of a lesser of the two evils
there has never been a single country with a viable multiparty system they are undemocratic nightmares that imperil the will of voters by subverting elections in every single case bring up a case and i ll immediately shoot it down as worse than the us go ahead and challenge me looking at you israel france germany canada
you only get i think we have parties with seats in congress right now
our election system was setup as an oligarchy people have been trying to use it as a democracy ever since with poor to medicore results
when third independent parties get a lot of support it will either be absorbed by one of the two major parties or split the votes for example in candidates ran each getting at least of the vote this allowed jackson to win the plurality and election with just of the vote even though of voters wanted somebody besides jackson those were split and a vast majority of voters didn t get what they wanted with how much american politics especially presidential is voting against one candidate rather than for another the two party system makes sense is it good no at least i don t think so but until american s understanding of politics change and they are willing to vote independents into office in larger quantities its the best there will be
they do but there s only two viable parties this is pretty much the same situation in these other multi party countries however it s a reddit favorite to cite this so called lack of choice in the usa as an issue
they do but there s only two viable parties this is pretty much the same situation in these other multi party countries however it s a reddit favorite to cite this so called lack of choice in the usa as an issue
there s a multitude of reasons such as party loyalty the media being dominated by democrats and republicans etc but the main reason is simply the way we vote our voting system is called first past the post which just means that each person gets one vote and the person who receives the most votes is the winner the problem is that this naturally devolves into a two party system since you re incentivized against voting for anyone other than the absolute most mainstream candidates because if you use your one vote on a relatively unknown candidate your vote is effectively wasted you can see why this very quickly becomes a self fulfilling prophecy
countries with multiple parties almost always end up with a fairly moderate center right or center left government being formed anyway really not a ton of difference whether those politicians with extreme positions are absorbed by one of major parties or remain independent in a small party and just form a coalition government with a centrist party
there are tons of state and local laws that make it difficult if not impossible for third parties to be competitive but in the end it comes down to the differences between a parliamentary system which usually tends to favor multiple parties working together and the u s congress and electoral college which tend to favor two parties in an adversarial role to each other
most other countries don t have viable political parties
electoral college at the top
because we re not quite fascists
it s political
it s probably because the u s is an oligarchy controlled by the richest people on the earth let alone america if the government wanted a true democracy we could have one same with any of the problems the richest nation in the world is facing currently whether it be gun violence a terrible healthcare system homelessness drag queens apparently my point is we could and can solve the majority of issues in the country drag queens are not an issue i was being sarcastic turns out unless i can make an excess gross profit on doing the thing i have no incentive to do anything that doesn t directly make me money living wage naaa health care naaa bailing out the banks for the 3rd time lets goooooooo
take a look at duverger s law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duverger%27s_law) doesn t fully explain it but gives a really good institutional structural account of why the us has an entrenched party system
most states have actual laws that make it very difficult to start a large third party for instance the state will pay for and administer primaries for democrats and republicans but not for other parties
harder to control the masses with dissenting opinions the duopoly will milk this country for all it s worth
well it s stupid see we let them set the rules there used to be more than two early on things shook out down the line into the two we have now then those two decided to make rules about what it took to get on the ballots in each state the number of hoops you have to jump through just to get required signatures is fucking ridiculous it s a shame really because i bet a lot of americans like myself don t align with the big two ideologically we just vote the lesser of two evils i am socially libertarian and economically social democrat i don t believe taxation is theft as long as you spend my taxes to create a society and government that works for everyone i want universal healthcare and education fair wages a solid social safety net and i want to love who i want and be who i want to be and have all the guns i want and be able to buy a little weed every now and then i want the government to get out of the way of people living their life and start working to make a country where people can live their best life
two party system with a single executive not a parliamentary system
main thing is first past the post as others have said i would also add that in early america the major political parties that formed were intentionally pan american and actively worked to be popular across the various states this early on the two party system was intentionally or unintentionally worked towards from there the third parties that gained any traction were usually absorbed by one party negating the need for the third party in the first place
we do it s just that no one ever votes for them we have democrats republican libertarian green constitutional alliance legalize marijuana now unity working class and working families however people only vote for
duverger s law https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/duverger%27s_law)
one problem may be that third parties dont generate enough revenue to run viable campaigns
because it s all rigged and corrupt it s an allusion of freedom here in the states
illusion of choice
americans tend to lack nuance there are only two sides to everything yours and mine and are easily manipulated
i m sort of convinced the end of expanding congress with the apportionment act killed any room for 3rd parties in congress you can see small bits of that back when a house seat represented only 200k people now its pushing million per district yes congress would be absurdly large but gerrymandering would be much more difficult to pull off with viable 3rd and 4th parites
because our stupid government is already so corrupt you mean the nra now has to pay off five different candidates or the drug companies have to pay off five
the usa has a primary that weeds out all the extra people ending up with just the most popular of each opinion just about everything falls on one side or the other there really isn t anything to gain by having more parties
because everything s secretly controlled by the illuminati duh
we do they just all categorize themselves under the two big labels of democrat or republican the progressives and moderate liberals would be two different parties in a parliamentary system but in a winner take all system it makes more sense to run on the same ticket edit it s not that much different than coalition parties at the end of the day
first past the post and math
because they control the narrative and have gotten most people to believe that every election is life or death and voting third party is wasting your vote and will result in armageddon it s also why they never have to fix anything they can use that to blame the other side and it not only increases the money they can gat but it gets people to vote no one would bother voting if we had good healthcare common sense gun laws common sense immigration reform and abortions where federally protected
because the two parties set the election rules which ensure that they will remain in power for example to be invited to the televised presidential debate a candidate must be polling at a certain percent is several different polls the issue is that the polls are conducted by media companies which are in the pockets of the parties another reason is because of funding the parties can take money from donors in one state and use them to help a candidate in another state so unless you have incredibly deep pockets or funding from across the country you really don t have a chance
most of the time third parties don t have automatic ballot access that means they have to spend tons of money and time collecting signatures to gain ballot access even if they get enough signatures both republicans and democrats challenge and fight to keep third parties from even gaining ballot access then you have to consider that elections are winner take all and since republicans and democrats are already so big it takes an incredible amount of votes to overcome either party
it s us versus them don t ya know people think it s hopeless to vote for anyone else those people are why we re trapped with the two they keep voting for the lesser of two evils that way they don t have to think too hard about their decision they just spout headlines and vote one party most of their life it s super depressing there should be some sort of competency test to vote i dunno something needs to be done about it ignorant people turned two parties into two massive corporations that are tearing us apart
the us uses first past the post voting you choose one singular candidate that s it this is very inhospitable to new comers and encourages defensive voting more than it does voting for who you want now imagine there are parties red green blue of the population want to vote red want to vote blue want green green voters want green to win they are fine if blue wins blue is a bit extreme for them but green voters very much want to avoid red winning now imagine if green voters vote for the party they actually want red wins the vote because is the majority so instead green voters decide they ll vote blue just so that they take the lesser of two evils what this means that any minority parties basically go bankrupt from campaigning year after year and eventually can t come back two party system is made this is also why the current american party system is split between extremes they need to be distinct from eachother because any moderates get swallowed up by the closest party and notice with blue winning only of the population got what they wanted
because it s a lot easier for us to work in 3s
we can t count that high
because we were founded on the ideals of liberalism and conservatism
without a parliamentary system it would be meaningless one small group of people could dominate the country
because money rules politics
because it wouldn t work for our government to keep up held down as they do so they keep us to two
because third parties only split votes and the republicans and democrats are the two parties that most closely have the same beliefs as most americans
it s because of the country doesn t vote it s because people get indoctrinated into one of the two parties it s because of an incorrect overwhelming social belief that voting for another party is a waste of a vote or vote for the side they don t want it s because there is massive gerrymandering it s because there is a lot of voter suppression it s because the education system sucks nuts it is in both parties best interest to have the least amount of competition possible
bc we have a executive presidential system and not a parliamentary system winner take all no coalitions or power sharing progressives actually hate when green party or other progressive parties run in elections bc it dilutes their voter base
we do we have dems reps libertarian green and independent maybe more the problem is no one is willing to vote on the other parties so it usually just becomes a battle of dems vs reps
like who china russia
it s easier to control people one side says lets kill all the poors and the other side says that s horrible lets compromise and only kill half the poors and then everybody votes for the one they think is on our side without realizing that both sides have teamed up to kill us
the united states does not have viable political parties like most other countries due to several factors the winner takes all electoral system favors two party systems the lack of proportional representation makes it difficult for smaller parties to gain representation in government strict ballot access laws make it difficult for third parties to get on the ballot and third parties often struggle to raise funds and get media attention
because two parties is the least number of parties you can have while still pretending to be democratic not that americans care about democracy but in the land of spectacles you need this paper thin lie otherwise you might actually have to do something i m american and unless you re living the great refusal none of us are this is the truth
because republicans and dems have rigged the system o prevent any viable 3rd party from coming about most 3rd parties spend most of their money just to get on the ballot and at a national level it s near impossible to get in the presidential debate as a third party so their messages never really get out at a national level the system is rigged to keep the two major parties in power and they have done such a good job of pushing their bases to extremes every election is painted as life or death the most important election ever voting third party is demonized
we are also a much younger country than other countries so it could take time for the neanderthals to realize
because the democratic party and republican party work together to keep each other in power that s the whole point of a primary election to restrict the same two parties that have always been in charge to stay in power if not one then the other and let me tell you the democrats would rather have a house and senate full of republicans than any elect third party candidates
why is the united states the longest lasting contintuion government ever in the hisotry of the world
japan now really only has one viable political party meaning the other parties don t have the numbers to take power
opinion not factual just my guess each of the two parties is composed of several factions but it is all an illusion the parties do not represent the people but represent the party leadership and they take they lead from corporate money our media likewise is heavily influenced by political parties and corporate money all are guided by greed and power so in the end it would make no difference if there were twenty parties or only one and i suspect we are not alone in this regard
because our political landscape is too polarized if the vast majority of americans shared similar political leanings we could have dozens of candidates but because of how damned opposite nearly two halves of the country are we re stuck voting for one side or another currently if there are two candidates running that share similar views they ll be splitting half of the votes of the side that shares those views while the other side has only guy getting all of their votes you end up in a situation where one side is united behind one guy who gets of their votes against the two guys girls sharing votes the single guy wins it s trash but until the majority of the country shares similar political views it will stay the same
canada is also winner takes all yet of the mps in the house of commons belong to different parties
they re literally businesses the dnc and the rnc closest third option is the libertarian party which there s already enough overlap with the other parties and the green party people could run under the two main parties and push their ideology ie populism with the last president or a sitting president would have to change their party affiliation while in office which could shake things up or they d just be one term in the first years or so of the country we did have viable options
an explanation is not an excuse get to work my boss
and yet somehow there are plenty of first past the post parliaments with multiple parties
canada has multiple parties with first past the post voting
i have an idea that could help a little political parties can t have more than members parties that exceed that limit must split into as many parties as needed to ensure no party has more than 800k members and parties with members must reject additonal applicants
love cgp gray he really puts things into perspective and offers a unique insight on things
exercise your free will bro
a and d ointment is basically butthole chapstick it s primarily petrolatum just like carmex with some extra ingredients to soothe skin it is very soothing for after events like diarrhea and if you know a painful blasty shit is coming you can put it on there preemptively to reduce much of the burn take it from an old guy it s great to have a tube in each bathroom just in case
you can yes should you do you really need to are you sure you will remember not to use that chapstick on your lips moving forward
just don t use carmex unless you want your b hole to feel like it s on fire and frozen at the same time commenting for a friend
you can put anything you want to on your butthole
makes it kissable
you can put anything on your butthole if you re brave enough
sure if it s chapped chaffed sore etc
i recommend aquaphor
i mean sure but if you re borrowing the chapstick you must warn them what you ll be doing with it
i knew someone who kept a tube of chapstick with the word ass written in sharpie so yeah you can put chapstick on your butthole
burt s bees
thanks you ruined lips for me now
put preparation h on your lips
lmao used chapstick for rear end play one time
make sure you don t get the chapsticks mixed up
yes and the thought of it really chaps my ass
friendly reminder to never share chapstick with anyone
you can should you no
i mean you can put chapstick on anything and everything yes
this is the kind of question i follow this sub for
just don t use the same stick that you use on your mouth
in that case you could put hemmroid cream on your lips
old sailors know you can use preparation h on badly chapped lips you may want to use a new tube if you do
it is actually a bit more fun if someone else puts chapstick on your butthole especially if they use the chapstick on their lips
there s not much you can t put on your butthole you just need normal human length arms and a finger your don t care much for
put tiger balm on your butthole i promise it won t have a strong tingly mint like burning sensation
you can don t know why you would just make sure you keep a dedicated chapstick for your hole to avoid putting ass flakes in your mouth and you should be fine

give it a swipe on your jeans and you re good to go
speak for yourself i don t want to be put on their butthole

burt s bee hole

decreasing birth rates especially mixed with longer lifespans causes demographic issues where there are less working age individuals and more people in retirement which makes social welfare more difficult yes this can be partially solved by immigration from countries that have extremely young median ages but only partially for the most part
it s a temporary solution to a permanent problem
apparently that doesn t work see france raising its retirement age due to falling birthrates despite taking in huge numbers of immigrants
culture shock if you take large amounts of people from one part of the world and relocate them to another part of the world without them being acclimated to the way things are done in their new home there s going to be problems on small scales when the migration is voluntary you re likely talking about someone who already understands what the move will mean for their daily life and is ok with it on very large scales when the migrants have no real choice chances are they won t be so flexible
first world nations don t want immigrants from the global south they re seen as undesirable the more educated a country s female population is the lower the birth rate in the us this is the reason we are witnessing not only rollbacks of reproductive rights but also education cut backs
or just plan for a shrinking population infrastructure and social programs will need to scale i think the real fear is politicians will have less people to boss around and less funds
nothing could go wrong there if your domestic population can t afford to have children does it make sense to import people to fill the gap or fix the affordability problem causing the decline in birth rates
well that depends on the stance of overpopulated because the usa u k china and russia are all considered overpopulated countries i doubt they d allow the average citizen of any of these countries simply move anywhere they like nowadays it s more of a cultural and social class thing whether a population is more or less likely to produce offspring varying in how many offspring between them quite a bit too i think the study would have to be more extensive than simply viewing overpopulated countries
because old people retire and stop working without youngins there will be nobody to work and pay taxes
that is pretty much what we are doing
you are correct but for complicated reasons the people who run countries who are generally older and ethnically homogenous don t want to do that but yes the data is pretty clear especially when a labor force is in decline that allowing more work visas is a boost to the economy
or hear me out maybe we could just make living affordable to allow people to comfortably raise a child
it s global issue the impact on the us is minor compared to china se asia western europe
you can t really force people to migrate to your country if they re already not thinking about it if the country s isn t a common migration destination then it would be hard to get that many people
you do not want to do that unless you want your country overrun by people who at beast don t participate in your culture or at worst outright hate it
letting tons of people in from countries with differing values isn t a good idea there s a reason we have a vetting process to check those coming into the country
i think a lot of this comes from the fear of white genocide it s pretty ridiculous
there s also decreasing birthrates in the overpopulated countries too china the world s largest country is going to have a major demographic fall fairly soon they had a one child policy for probably too long and will now need to import more workers to make up these shortfalls as other countries begin to have their own birth rate crises they ll also be entering into competition for immigration the problem right now isn t just birth rates down but broadly biological fertility women s fertility was well understood when it went down and we understand the causes but male semen fertility is new and more problematic
we absolutely can but we don t want more of those people we want more of our people
gonna put it extremely blunt why would you rely on foreigners to bolster your own country s numbers
if a bunch of clones of this guy https://imgur.com/a/k6ptooh) want to come fine by me
that s what will happen the aging population crisis will be better in places that can replace their numbers with immigrants preferably young and skilled i think the usa will come out good in this because our population is aging less rapidly than most of the developed world and there is generally a large pool of people globally wanting to immigrate here
the issue is that people concerned with birth rates also tend to be people not entirely okay with mixing of races cultures case in point your question is the easy solution staring these people in the face but allowing more people from india or china or anywhere else into the country is unthinkable
because that doesn t fix the underlying issue of why people aren t having kids it just acts as a temporary bandaid
hell no this is a shitty idea
theres only one country you could argue is over populated and india seems to be doing fine if the us keeps importing people eventually a third will be foreign born which is a lot for the 3rd most populated country nigeria could be argued is overpopulated and america has a mil more people
the problem is that the parts of the world with high birth rates also has a high percentage of illteracy so what happens in practice is that now we must support both the elderly and the immigrants
it s about the whole world not one country
birth rate is decreasing more or less rapidly on every country in earth for decades
we should but politicians and companies want to keep as many people in poor countries as possible so they can take advantage of the poor conditions and regulations to pay them bordeline slave wages for cheap labour
because the smaller the population the smaller the pool of people who can have certain jobs which will make companies and the rich have to pay people more to make all their money which hurts their bottom line it s also about controlling women s bodies large population on this planet has the outdated thinking that women are nothing more than baby factories and should be nothing but subservient to men
mass cannot be created or destroyed only changed you don t decrease people by moving them around plus mass migration is always a massive problem it would murder our infrastructure trying to process it all
decreasing birth rates aren t there more and more people on this planet every day
babies aren t immigrating after a certain age immigrants add to the problem rather than solving it
but less poor people in poor countries means less people we can pay pennies to pick our crops and make our clothes we gotta keep those pesky brown people out of our nice fancy white countries who cares if he are the ones who stole all thier resources and start wars there s
the only people concerned are racists and xenophobes hand wringing over their racial national purity
that will reduce the racial purity of the societies why do you think most countries have visa quotas by country
thats only temporary solution which only works when your place relatively atractive migration spot if that changes you may lose migrants that already came
import the third world become the third world with everything negative that entails your good intentions will pave the way to hell
immigration doesn t necessarily make a ideologically homogenous people which historically nations have needed which is a big problem
because you ll upset the conservatives on fox news it s only a temporary solution
everyone here ignoring that they immigrants they are talking about have melanin decreased birth rate is a dog whistle for decreased white birth rate thus the chants of you will not replace us as if they had any say in that
no because they are animals and will overrun civilised countries with crime of all types after some time civilised countries will become their shitholes and birth rate decline would be solved since no more natives will exist only animals
in a perfect world that s literally exactly how you handle decreasing birth rates it s economically and socially a perfect solution imagine having a new citizen in your country and you don t even have to spend years feeding and educating it without it being economically productive the problem simply comes from various forms of bigotry and white nationalism or regional equivalent a lot of vague fear mongering about other people and their social customs coming into the country and replacing the total dominance of what already exists sadly the issue entirely boils down to we have the perfect solution but racists would rather deal with economic slumps and or force young people to have children they don t want because the alternative is a dystopia where the rides at disney world give safety instructions in english and then again in spanish
racism
you have more people leaving the work force than entering
culture
cause diversity causes chaos
the short version when old people outnumber young people the ability of society to sustain the total number of living people will collapse if only of the population is working that means of the population is just feeding off that work if that happens because only of people have kids it becomes totally unavoidable and because growth rate and stability rate are usually pretty closely tied when growth rate takes a down turn well you end up with an upside down pyramid
oh hell no
there are bigger issues that stem from using immigration to counter falling birth rates the countries with falling birth rates are similar to other countries with falling birth rates these countries don t have excess population looking to migrate the countries that do have high birth rates are culturally and socially and economically very different from countries with low birth rates the naturalization process is long and difficult and expensive it should be allowed but it s more costly than home grown populations if we did just import large quantities of people from the overpopulated poor discriminatory countries without doing naturalization we would also be importing the problems of that country
there is a cost to importing people who do not speak your language don t understand respect your culture or have a high likelihood of poverty
too bad the people from overpopulated countries tend to suck
we brought slaves from other continents before and that hasn t worked out very well
because we ve had lots of immigration for half a century anyone from the third world with a halfway useful skill is already here
honestly we have too many people on earth as it is
the churches are running out of flocks to fleece can t groom the youngster s if there aren t enough to go around
australia does this to great success especially in countries like afghanistan if you have some kind of higher education the government might offer to pay for you to migrate here
i m all for immigration from overpopulated countries no one should be made to have kids if they do not wish to reproduce
no thanks we could change our economy in a way where we benefit from less people instead of paying for a bunch of free loaders coming over
the way our society or economy is built it relies on a healthy supply of new people being introduced into the mix mainly i forget the exact number now but it takes something like person working to supply social security retirement payout to one retired person i am not an expert but in short it is required to have more working people paying into the system than non working people drawing from it as the population thins out it becomes older and at some point there just isn t enough able bodied people working to keep paying retired people in the usa specifically this is mainly being solved by immigration as you are suggesting the political parties and talking heads on tv can say whatever they want but without a major reform it is absolutely necessary to keep the current level of immigration going because of the decreasing birth rates china is going through a social security apocalypse right now remember their one child policy yeah guess what if two people have only one child there will be time when those two people retire and on one person will be there to work and pay for their retirement they are entering some tough times because of the previous policy add to it the generally crappy economy in the world and the country itself guess what even after the policy was changed people are still not having kids because they can t afford a family and unfortunately for them the immigration in china isn t anywhere near the number it would have to be to compensate if it s even possible to make up for the deficit
you want more low skilled migrants from bum fuck countries
hope someone with more understanding can explain are birth rates for the world overall declining in the sense that they re not continually increasing at x rate per year or is it 801k babies born years ago 800k years ago 798k last year is it really something to be concerned about
but they are strange people who may not look like us we have to be afraid of them don t you get the fascist take on immigration they want to make us all muslim or intermarry with out children and make us all brown or even worse black or maybe we need to learn another language the fear is real i welcome mass immigration to fill the workforce and provide for economic growth how do they think this country was founded and grew
united states uses legal immigration to its maximum advantage the temporary visas are granted to young and educated workers who contribute taxes and social security but get nothing back the government spend on them is zero many of them contribute for decades till they become eligible for any minimal benefits usa can continue this model forever and be a great productive country
half of humanity is too racist for that
as someone from an overpopulated country if you import too muany of us you won t have your own country in few years you will become minority your culture will be replaced nor any of your ideals or principles slow careful assimilation is the only correct way
you can but your culture won t survive this is called demographic replacement when forced it is a crime against humanity although i suspect it will not be called a crime if the replaced culture is saxon protestant america
the solution essentially requires fewer workers while technological efficiencies pick up the slack however at least in a country like the united states this isn t possible because there is a strong opposition to social programs that would redistribute wealth from the highly wealthy to those attempting to survive there s probably no reason it can t be done as far as we ll still have enough workers to produce the goods and services necessary but those workers won t be able to fund social security properly and it is not politically palatable to reorganize the economic system to do so
see japan for an ongoing example
good points inherent in many of our evalulations of what is positive for society is whether foremost it is good for the economy like a disembodied alien entity
except immigrants tend to have more kids
is it though the unemployment rates are sky high in a lot of large countries and the population rates are still climbing somewhat rapidly obviously it might not work perpetually but it could move the issue back decades
and they have very high birth rate for modern european standars
yeah but that s partially because their public retirement system is insanely generous basically a full pension when you re in your s that s or decades you re committed to paying someone to do nothing from tax coffers
great example
yes we have seen this is france and the uk with neighborhoods becoming unfriendly or even hostile to other people native residents and other immigrants alike i think a lot of it is isolation due to cultural differences language barriers and just regular misunderstandings these things tend to alienate people a lot
they won t even experience culture shock if there is a single large scale migration they would form communities on their own and most likely don t need to integrate into the host country s culture kinda like sweden
nobody is saying they should suddenly let a million people in over night just gradually increase the immigration stats over time
oooooh this is spicy this needs to higher
my son and his wife can t afford children they both want a children
russia is anything but overpopulated it s the biggest country on the planet but it has less than million people total
ok so russia is the largest country in the world by area https://www.worldometers.info/geography/largest-countries-in-the-world/) russia is 9th largest country in the world by population with of world population https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) how is russia overpopulated
when was the us considered over populated
i know it comes down to many factors as to why somewhere would be deemed overpopulated but i still find it pretty mad that only of britain is built on all that land and we still can t build affordable housing
lol the usa is definitely not overpopulated we re on the low birth rate side of this equation we d be taking in immigrants in this scenario not sending them abroad
do you mean the countries those people come from because afaik for the us at least you don t have to apply to leave
russia ain t overpopulated at all lol it s still dealing with the loss of men from ww2
the us is not over populated
corporations and billionaires paying their fair share would solve the tax thing
that s what some countries are doing japan isn t doing it which is why they are suffering from the changing demographics more than most china is unlikely to do it which is why they are more worried about changing demographics than most
can you break down these values you speak of
holy shit
yeah lol conservatives already have that one covered
ridiculous are people like you fighting that strawman here ignoring the point of ops question
the other options is to cut reproductive programs and gut education funding
there are thousands of indian h1b visa holders who are being forced to uproot their families and go back to india because they were laid off from tech jobs they are highly educated and motivated to work
thats not true in only years we grew million people way more than ever before from to to be precise population growth is decreasing mainly in wester developed countries
also xenophobes and racists being shitty
sure play racist card against everyone with difrent opinion how rational and mature
your focusing a lot on sex and not the stuff leading up to sex you may need to try working with a therapist or dating coach to help identify what s giving you the most trouble
well if your username is a representation of you irl you might have some things to work on
be nice to women but not in a mlady fedora tipping kind of way don t ruin your attitude with incel manosphere bullshit and toxic beliefs try being a genuinely good friend to several women without the agenda of banging or dating each of them and eventually some woman you meet will think of you as a catch and want to date you if you befriend enough women without being a douche they will introduce you to their friends
chill out and focus on other things besides sex get a hobby or some friends this much focus on sex is how you become an incel
to deal with the touch deprivation go for a full body massage you can have a male therapist if that is better for you but i strongly suggest you see a therapist making a connection with another person is often not possible until we are comfortable and happy in ourselves
hos exist for a reason
we are taught that sex is a big deal it is not in the way you perceive as a kid it just isn t the magical thing nor does it fix all your problems when young especially through puberty hormones are crazy plus adults really don t prepare you for anything the burden of good christian values is a complete avoidance of all things sex so you re never properly taught about anything it s really quite stupid worse yet this follows you well into young adulthood even into marriage child rearing everything you might want to look up dr ruth and watch some videos she was a sex therapist and was a pioneer on promoting a healthy idea of sex this includes self care self love and the kinds of things that currently frustrate you there s a lot freely available on youtube
no you don t really want to stop being attracted to women it sounds like you need help for some pretty heavy psych issues as ridiculous as it may sound it really can get better i suggest finding a therapist and perhaps getting a psych evaulation
try to take care of the physical contact part take up a sport bjj judo etc where you will get physical contact non sexually it will help with being touch starved
have attempted to go out and meet someone just to hang out and at least make some friends
just pay someone lol
hire hookers my friend
easy apathy
this one is probably above our pay grade and you may need professional help but i see at least a few issues here you might consider i want intimacy so fucking bad but at this point i ve accepted that it s likely not going to happen for at least a few years all of those things are separate even if you do have sex you are not guaranteed the intimacy i want to stop desiring women in any way so i can stop being so empty and feeling so hungry for something i will not have for at least another years you re putting way too much onus on women here like you re the next coming of siddartha gautama and all that s standing between you and enlightment are those pesky women with their wiles do you think sex havers can t feel empty hell some sexual encounters can leave you feeling even emptier browse the dr nerdlove http://www.drnerdlove.com) archives because you re question comes up once a week at least and there are some insightful answers heck some advice here is mentioned in the archives like getting a full body massage to suit that human touch craving in a healthy way tl dr sex will probably not fix the emptiness you feel work on figuring out why you feel that way
have you actually tried to go out and meet people if not then start socialising there will be no birds knocking on your windows to tell you to keep waiting because love is on the way if yes but you keep getting rejected try to reflect on your past attempts why do you think that is it could be something like hygiene your style or maybe you are awkward or boring to talk to or even an asshole it s not easy to admit your own flaws but it is necessary to acknowledge the problems first before you try to work on it so you can grow to be better
yes multiple times over the course of the last years didn t work
that s called an open relationship
that s all well and good if you both agree to it i d get regularly tested tho if you re both going to be having different sexual partners
only person i know that had this go on ended in divorce when his wife got pregnant he had a vasectomy years before they had an open relationship but something about her getting pregnant with another man s kid fucked with his head too much he turned to alcohol and eventually the whole thing resulted in a divorce i just feel bad for their kids but if you guys are really okay with it you should have nothing to worry about i think some people go along with the idea of it until it becomes real then for a lot of people it s too much to handle
i ve had friends that do this the other comments are right it s an open relationship at some point though the girlfriend decided to make her main relationship with one of those one time hook ups instead of her initial bf so it kind of backfired on the guy
the boundaries you have are less common but not odd just sounds like a more open relationship nothing wrong with that at all
sounds like open relationship and that s not odd when everyone involved is fine with it
a lot of people are saying it s normal i wouldn t go as far as saying it s normal as i believe most relationships are understood to be monogamous however if both of you are okay with this arrangement then that s up to you with that said open relationships are becoming more common or at least being open about them is more common
boundaries are unique to every relationship labels like odd or weird are completely meaningless however yes you will find more relationships out there where hooking up with others is considered a no no
problem with this set up is that it s almost never a mutual agreement it is usually one person pushing for it and the other person crying themselves to sleep every night
open relationship aren t that uncommon and that s what you have
it s something i used to see at least a few times a year in my early 20s and less in my upper 20s i gave it a whirl twice i dont think it s weird just tougher to sustain
i think that is fairly common more often called an open relationship not my type of thing but if you re both okay with it that s all that matters
not exactly what i d consider normal but as long as nobody is getting hurt who cares
if it works for you guys why does it matter what others think
as long as you re both ok woth it good for you in the end you re just looking for gratification it s not different from using a dildo
this definitely isn t the norm for most couples but if you and your partner are both on the same page about it then it s fine
questions is the gf having way more hook ups than you or vice versa how do you communicate the hook ups are you both committed to safe sex
no it s not new but goodluck hahahah
that s all nice and great until one of you has a one night stand with someone you really click with and want to see again trust me i d know gf left me for a guy she slept w at the bar
it s unusual but if you ve communicated that those are what the boundaries are go nuts
if it works it works i guess
extremely odd in my mind but it doesn t matter because the important thing is that you and your girlfriend have come to a consensus that works for you i also don t think you re alone i think this is some form of an open relationship
emotions can get messy
if you both consent to the other doing that then it s not cheating your boundaries are what make you both comfortable and if you re both comfortable with it there s no problem sure by society s standards it s odd and taboo but you aren t society you re individuals with nuanced opinions you do you
odd no statistically outside the norm yes
if you are both happy and don t have issues with your setup then rock on to many other things in life to cause problems to be focusing on a situation you are both happy with
save some for the rest of us
that s an open relationship if it works for your relationship with consenting adults no issue personally for me it would not work
boi of only you knew how many of these relationships got ruined and posted on r tifu
what s the point of being in a relationship can t you have sex with each other on a random night
and what happens if an accidental pregnancy happens while either of y all are doing your innocent hookups what if the sex between the two of you changes bc of the other sex you re partaking in what if you unknowingly start to like hookup sex more than with your spouse and what if you end up falling for your hookup still cheating imo and really weird to even think about
have the same thing with my now wife we ve had a set up similar to this since we started dating after a one night hook up years ago it s worked out fine and sometimes we go years without doing that and one of us will get drunk at a party or something and go home with some one and then come home and talk about it which usually follows with more sex cause it makes us both horny hearing about the others night it s fun if both parties are very comfortable and a lot of the women i meet are very chill with it while most men she meets are not very down with it and are usually upset when they are turned down the next morning for a date or whatever
wouldn t work for me but i know a couple that does that they even have rules like never in their shared bed and some other stuff
i m not sure it s odd just a bit uncommon if you re comfortable wi it en go for it
as long as both parties are cool with it and make sure to get regular std sti checks
about of couples are in open relationships https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/all-about-sex/201911/open-relationships-are-more-popular-you-might-think
one thing people fail to understand is that it s only ethical non monagamy if you get tested between every single partner regularly and are open about how many partners you have so that people can make an educated decision on the sex risk
as long as you both are okay with it who cares what other people think about your boundaries
i say good for you sex can be just sex and not have an emotional component if you both are honest a clear and have certain rules then go for it
certainly different but not uncommon
to each their own if it works for you then that s all that matters
basically same but we decided it s only cheating if you try to hide it or lie about it i consider it a health concern more than anything else like i m not jealous i just don t want to get surprised with an std
dan savage calls this monogamish
no boundary is weird as long as it works for you couples break up over that because they had not established that they were both okay with that therefore it was cheating but youre definitely in a non monogamous relationshup
i feel like it s cheating if you go out with the intent to fuck a stranger that night but since it s basically an open relationship my point is moot
question if you were in the same city location would you have the as needed hookups personally i can separate out love relationship vs sex hookup i have an extremely high libido desire sex several times per day in my ideal day and if i was not near my gf i would for sure be looking for random hookups somewhat regularly but it is more of a physical need for me just speaking for myself i ve not met some random out had sex and felt some life changing connection but i am also not looking for that i think that people in monogamous relationships cannot fathom that others are not like them if i was in your situation long distance then this is the only way that i could remain in the relationship if i could have sex when i need it and someone mentioned being a sex addict above but i am not a sex addict lol some people want it more than once per month or week so for me your relationship is not weird if you were living together then maybe i would consider that more of an open relationship though technically i guess you are open now but for me it would still be a love relationship like this is my gf with some sex hookups on the side because i was horny and gf is across the country as to people talking about opening yourself up to a love connection well no sex needed for that you could be at work or at school and feel a connection that could break up your core relationship if i meet someone at a bar and we only have sex i may not even talk to them enough to develop the emotional connection may not make sense to the majority but makes sense to me
so long as the two of you are okay with it and fully consenting to the idea of an open relationship i say that is ok
if it works and u guys are happy more power to u i can see ways to justify your boundaries personally i wouldn t wanna be in a relationship like that but that s cuz i m a straight dude i m sure my girl would be able to pull way more than me and that d kill me inside lol
the only rules that matter are the ones you both agree on everything else out there is just noise
it s your choice but can be a slippery slope finding ons s willing to do live by your rules is work and your ons was pretty good and you like them enough to sleep with them so you end up having multiple hookups agreeing that it won t lead to anything but if you like each other and the sex is good sooner or later one of the gets jealous and someone is hurt not saying don t do it just keep that in mind
i ve heard tons of stories of couples breaking up over hookups and stuff and was just wondering about it this happens with monogamous relationships that try to change to an open relationship i have never once encountered a couple that did it successfully you can t rock the foundation like that if it s how you build your relationship from the ground up there s less upheaval and distress
yes to each their own and it doesn t effect me so i don t care and neither should anyone else but anyone who doesn t think it s odd is kidding themselves
does it matter if it s odd if you both agree to it and are content with the situation you do you
not odd or abnormal at all lots of people have nonmonogamous relationships my girlfriend and i are polyamorous and we ve been together years
every couple is different i could never have the same relationship boundaries as you but that doesn t mean your relationship is weird also who cares what others think are you two happy do your current boundaries work in practice if the answer s yes then screw anyone who says you re weird
i m sure this won t end badly at all
it s a great arrangement until one of you falls in love
i mean if y all are both chill with it i don t see the harm in it as long as there s open communication and honesty it sounds fine also no you are far from the only ones out there that have that sort of relationship i myself know someone who s done that
do you think you re the first couple to have an open relationship or something
an open relationship isn t that odd everyone is going to have slightly different boundaries in their relationships only you decide what cheating means to you
if those are the boundaries you both want and work for the of you that s all that matters one of my bffs has a similar relationship they both travel a ton for work so what happens while traveling is fine just don t bring it home at home they re monogamous originally it seemed like a very strange boundary but it totally works for them and they re super happy
is it weird that we are in an open relationship it s it s the wild west out here
recently read a stat that of couples in the us identifies as polyamorous more than have had some kind of open relationship it s more common than you think my partner and i consider ourselves ethically non monogamous enm it started with just hookups and we ve opened our boundaries to allow dates and friends with benefits we re working our way towards something i ve heard called kitchen table polyamory where you can coexist with each others hookups and all be friends with eachother it takes a lot of patience and practice to have that trust in a partner but for us it s made our relationship much stronger
eventually one of you will connect and have chemistry none of this free open love works if it did wouldn t we see several older couples doing this no one over does this stuff i know people try to replace monogamous relationships for many different things there just isn t a real substitute two people fully giving themselves to each other is something you can t replicate with multiple people in my opinion your way of life is because of sex addiction or some other personality issue by doing this your maybe afraid of actual trust respect commitment monogamy is hard because it involves getting over yourself not controlling another person there are certain things you can teach anyone but truths always stand the test of time everything else eventually fades i wouldn t label your relationship true love i d say sure it s love but true love is something deeper you don t need one night stands or even consider it because you re fulfilled in all the ways that make you happy and healthy everything else to me is just an attempt to convince yourself i can do it my way i don t think it ll last one of you likes it better than the other because they re just not into the other person that much you re probably in your 20s
why bother having a partner
it s odd in a sense that most couples don t do this but it s not wrong or anything communication and consent is important with things like this and you guys seem to have that down you guys are showing the signs of a very healthy relationship with odd boundaries being odd isn t bad
all sorts of boundaries are fine as long as everyone involved is okay with them
your boundaries are not odd just different if you both are consenting along with your one night stands then do you
well it depends on the relationship for me that s cheating because if i am in a relationship with you and you expect me to be loyal to you by sleeping with you and investing time into you and only you in a romantic way i want the same in return it depends entirely on the relationship and the people in said relationship because like i always say one persons definition of cheating could be somebody else s normal i don t care behavior and vice versa as long as the people involved are both above the age of and it s a healthy relationship where everybody is consenting i honestly don t see a problem with it
info i saw in a earlier comment that this is a long distance thing op do you think these boundaries will hold when one of you moves how about after you start cohabitation marriage if that is in the cards after babies on the question as posted whatever works works as long as everyone is honest and transparent
i really like this rule tbh
it s an open relationship and you can just say u trust one another but usually this means there is a problem
bro thinks she just invented open relationships
i a question that i hope you don t find insulting so it s a bit of an astonishing fact that one in every of us is a psychopath up to in the upper echelons of business and in prison they have less remorse and empathy and behave differently to social norms psychopaths can achieve certain things due to the superpower sometimes for good sometimes for bad i m not a psychopath i m quite the opposite i m very emotional and get jealous question do two psychopaths in a relationship have open relationships because neither get particularly hurt by it is it one of the benefits of the condition
works like a charm until it doesnt of the time have met a number of couples who tried this over the years i cant think of a single example where it ended well
makes sense to me
the relationship is not long for this world
it s called an open relationship and loads of people have one it s not a majority of people as most relationships are monogamous but it s a sizeable minority of anyway
that s what s called an open relationship they re not super uncommon just not the most standard
it s odd in that the boundary you are discussing is uncommon is it odd in terms of the boundary itself being normal that s for you and your girlfriend to decide it sounds like you are both okay with an open relationship just be careful as these sorts of things can get messy quickly have another conversation about it make sure to be explicit in terms of what can cannot occur the proper procedures etc if everyone is on the same page and in agreement without coercion then no there is absolutely nothing odd about it
as long as you both agree and stay on the same page there s never an odd boundary
progressive do you have limits on one night stands
months from now tifu by being in an open relationship
you have an open relationship not everyone is anywhere near mature enough to function happily in an open relationship but you guys are crushing it good job
my boyfriend and i are similar we dont really care about random hookups as long as we chat about it stay safe and use protection obviously and make sure the other is feeling loved id consider it cheating if he had feelings for a hookup and would feel weird if the hookup had feelings for him didnt know he was in a relationship sex is just sex imo sex when you love someone is a totally different feeling and the sex we have feels more real and intimate its also fun to hook up with friends or practice doing the whole flirting and seducing thing sometimes
nowadays it s not odd divorce rates are increasing and birth rates decreasing your relationship will work until it won t love that founds a family demands more i don t judge you do you hedonism is a valid way to live as well
actually sounds very healthy to me
that s not odd unless you ask a republican when someone else can hear the answer
sounds pretty normal to me
this is such obvious bait lmao
enjoy the future break up
this is an open relationship also called polyamory also called ethical non monogamy you should check out the book the ethical sl t it may give you some ways to think about it and look out for potential problems in the future
i genuinely think there s something wrong with people that are able to have casual sex and fool themselves into thinking it doesn t mean anything like they need therapy
regular degular homie
what if your partner has a date but you already planned one with them just a rescheduling no biggy or are there preferences priorities or rules set are there like deepseated expectations like this
those are odd boundaries but not necessarily bad boundaries
it s not that odd we already had this discussion with my wife stating that while it s not what we currently want we could totally see ourselves having this kind of deal years down the line after all why not as long as both parties agree
i ve never heard of things being specified exactly that way but as long as everyone is cool with it it sounds like a healthy way of doing things
repent and seek god
it s not really a relationship your just friends
cook everything yourself from scratch not only does every bagged boxed packaged food have sugar in it more often than not it s loaded with salt too
keto forums will likely have good advice on this as might diabetes forums
you trying yo cut back on sugar or eliminate it
you can get sandwiches from a deli the bread might have some added sugar but most have some healthier options to choose x200b but yes most processed food is indeed full of sugar that isn t even an usa only problem if you want to eat healthily you have to cook yourself
add flour oils and milk products and from then you can bassicly cook everything yourself
cut down ok cut out might be too much have a few taters maybe some yams bread is surprisingly easy to make don t add sugar to yours x200b balance is the key unless you have a medical condition requiring an imbalance
meat and veg
baking your own bread isn t as difficult as it is often made out to be if you love bread and really don t want all that added sugar i really recommend flour water salt yeast by ken forkish the recipes only contain the four title ingredients and the results are amazing but to echo everyone else here you ve got to make your own food from scratch find some basic recipes you enjoy that aren t super messy or time consuming to make and it s actually fairly easy to cut out sugar and you ll end up cutting out a ton of unnecessary sodium if you drink fruit juice cut that out go for a fuller fat milk the higher the fat percentage the less sugar per cup but even then the sugar in milk is different than processed sugar don t stop eating fresh fruit the sugar in fruit is different than the sugar added to juice or put in bread and processed foods this should be the last kind of sugar to go if you like canned fruit get the stuff canned in water it has less sugar by far it s okay to eat things that contain sugar but you really want to watch for the added sugar label that s going to be the processed stuff i mean if your doctor told you no sugar period then listen to them first but in general natural sugar is perfectly healthy to consume in moderation
you can cook the vegetables also you can have grains legumes nuts you can even have cheese you re describing a full diet
i m down to basically raw vegetables eggs and meat i see nothing wrong with this throw in some fruit and personally i think you ll be fine
whatever you do don t have sugar free candy
whatever happens at least now one more person has become aware of the stupid amount of sugar that is in basically everything here now seriously that much in my dang crackers
i don t get why are you cutting jesus christ from your diet how and why was he even included there in first place
nuts avocado hard cheeses edamame tofu and sashimi
some frozen vegetables here have added sugar eat starch potatoes are your friend
well yeah vegetables eggs and meat are very good things to form the staple of your diet
there s no reason you can t eat cheese i m sure some processed cheeses have added sugar but this for instance appears to have none https://www.walmart.com/ip/joseph-farms-sharp-cheddar-cheese-1lb-chunk/11027672 as others have said vegetables can be cooked steaming broccoli and carrots is good don t overcook one of these devices is a cheap way of being able to steam if you have no other https://www.walmart.com/ip/prep-solutions-stainless-steel-easy-reach-8-inch-extendable-steamer-basket/16565399?athbdg=l1102
i was surprised at the rarity of a good soy sauce in the united states not plum sauce or one with sugar actual soy sauce from cultured soybeans maybe whole foods has one my essential partner with rice and stir fried veggies
mostly just stay away from pre made convenience foods if you re not very experienced with cooking soups are a good place to start making your own salad dressings is also way easier than people realize find a good local bakery instead of buying pre sliced big name bread or make your own bread
cut back
fruit sugar
starch breaks down into sugars after you eat it not your friend if you are trying to cut back on sugar
look for low carb stuff then such as breads totillas in terms of sauces or specialized meals that have sugar added you can learn to cook them and sub sugar for a sweetener i think one of the more common amongst low carb keto carnivore diets is called monkfruit
there s no escape
let me put it this way i m assuming you re a liberal i am too consider the film ghostbusters it s a movie about people who leave academia to use their knowledge for financial gain in the private sector the worst human character is from the epa it contains a clear narrative of government oversight causing the main characters nothing but trouble when you were watching it did you relate to the epa character i sure didn t in spite of environmental protection being a huge priority for me because that person is a bad guy he was a pompous condescending ignorant ass who caused nothing but trouble and reads as a clear antagonist and when a character like that appears on the screen no matter whether or not they re on your side politically or philosophically you don t root for them because they re asses and we love the ghostbusters because they re the good guys they re funny and clever and know what they re talking about so they re right when the epa guy is wrong they re the heroes and i watch the film and never think yeah you re right people should go unregulated by the epa i m thinking go ghostbusters and no matter how intellectual we are or how much we care about issues these levels of good guys and bad guys play a real role in our reaction to these movies it lets us enjoy the narrative no matter where we land on the political spectrum and i suspect that when conservatives are watching movies with conservative villains they are fully anti villain and pro hero the same way we are when we watch ghostbusters edited for grammar
my dad s a reaganite conservative and he really liked the movie zootopia because he saw it as an allegory for reverse racism rather than the movie s actual message that all racism is bad
when people watch movies they usually relate to the protagonists when conservatives watch footloose they associate the conservative townies with liberals they identify with the main character and say hey this is just like those liberals trying to take away my freedom of speech or my guns or my freedom of speech to think and that believe that homosexuality is bad and it s my opinion they see themselves the way you do and you have more in common with them than you think people who identify with miss trunchbull are either abusive control freaks which has nothing to do with politics or they re junior high teachers of every political spectrum it s hard not to feel like trunchbull when you ve taught junior high
i think it s possible to enjoy a story even if you think the villains are an inaccurate caricature of you or someone you agree with man of tai chi is awesome and i enjoyed it even though keanu reeves s villainous character clearly represents american mma fans as bloodthirsty monsters full of contempt for chinese tradition
i think there are works like you re describing that are very satirical i don t think liberals watch footloose and go yeah fuck banning dancing i m going to dance everywhere i go i think most people look at these things and think this is entertainment and i m entertained where you get into muddy waters is less obvious examples really brilliantly written movies allow a lot of people to look at one character and see themselves in it despite being completely different people and the same is true of music we could both listen to the same music and take something different from it american conservatives and liberals tend to think of themselves in the same way they re all disrupting and changing the status quo they re all trailblazers or innovators they re all taking on a cause bigger than themselves and they need you because only the people can fight _ _ _ insert cause a few years back republican paul ryan when asked his favorite band he said rage against the machine in response the band indicated that paul ryan was the kind of person they raged against
conservatives can often engage with art and not take it seriously enough to realize they are the ones being criticized trump plays fortunate son at his rallies without a hint of awareness chris christie loves bruce springsteen but the boss won t even talk to him paul ryan loves rage against the machine and tom morello mocked him for it personally
i grew up in an extremely conservative household and the assumption was that liberal hollywood always wrote these cartoonishly evil conservative characters because they wanted someone to sneer at and couldn t find anyone in the real world actually like that same thing with protagonists that didn t have traditional values but weren t hurting anyone and had hearts of gold you tell yourself the real teens from footloose would be way more out of control and the real adults would be way more reasonable looking back now i can totally see how that constant headcanoning of entertainment made it easier to apply the same mental gymnastics to news media
i found myself remembering the day in kindergarten when the teachers showed us dumbo and i realized for the first time that all the kids in the class even the bullies rooted for dumbo against dumbo s tormentors invariably they laughed and cheered both when dumbo succeeded and when bad things happened to his enemies but they re you i thought to myself how did they not know they didn t know it was astounding an astounding truth everyone thought they were dumbo elif batuman
one thing to remember we as people always see ourselves as the good guy so a conservative would rationalize this for example they would see oppressive government figures maybe relate it to the covid lock downs or they may relate it to arbitrary silencing of expression similar to how they feel social media has treated them a great example would be v for vendetta both sides can see the movie and find authoritarian moves from the other side to relate it to and feel it perfectly relates to the abuses they see from the other side so instead of trying to look at a movie through your side and their side try connecting to others through the movie how does it make you feel how would others feel how can you connect or a more novel idea just enjoy the movie and leave politics at the door
definitely the latter part of being closed minded is a lack of self reflection it s automatically assuming your preconception is right and trying to twist the facts around to make it sound like it is so of course those people consider themselves the hero in a story even when presented with evidence to the contrary
i can easily see a conservative watching footloose and saying it s a film about big government and overreach very easy to read in narratives you want
i actually think it s more the latter many conservatives today truly feel that they are not racist they think of racism in terms of jim crow laws they don t feel that they are racists or bigots which is why they are so offended at being called racists they truly think that whatever negative feelings they have towards blacks or other minority groups are objectively justified by the cultural attitudes and behaviors of those groups by the perceived advantages they feel they get e g welfare programs diversity hiring etc by what they perceive as pandering to those groups by the biased media etc so many of them can watch anti slavery movies or movies celebrating the end of jim crow because they feel that those events and attitudes belong in the past that racism did exist but that we have moved on we elected a black president and continuing to complain about it is just black people whining for more handouts
i grew up in a very small people hyper religious community overseas most of those people forbade us from even watching foot loose when it eventually made its way there on vhs the ones who didn t forbid it sided more with the kids than the conservatives those parents also tended to be less accepted by the rest of the community too though
they don t watch those movies or they go well that movie was stupid
two things i really love are star trek and the newport folk fest and both of them have at least a vocal minority of conservative fans when the new star trek shows started there was a surprisingly large amount of why is star trek woke bullshit now considering woke bullshit is the brand the newport folk fest was founded by an ardent socialist and an interracial couple in the 50s expressly as a place with a progressive agenda yet every year a few posts appear on message boards from people wishing the artists were less political in both cases i think there s just other stuff to like it s pretty easy to watch star trek as a space cowboy show and pretty easy to appreciate the musicianship at the folk fest for some people i think they just miss the other stuff and for some people they ignore it i think it s worth it to remember there are probably conservative pieces of media plenty of liberals like too i think the dark knight is a pretty awesome movie but that trilogy s politics are not good i ve liked plenty of south park even though i think my politics are probably radically different from the creators i used to love while recognizing that it was a conservative fever dream and so on
in footloose the pastor wasn t fighting against rock and roll because he was delaying progress he was fighting it because his son died he turned his grief into a weapon and hurt his family his daughter in particular and his community when townspeople took his messages to heart and attacked progress and started burning books he opposed it and realized what it was he had done and how he failed as a leader and as a father so while he still doesn t like rock and roll or dancing which he s entitled to not like he doesn t oppose them like he did at the start of the movie though convincing the townspeople to change course can be a more difficult change long term
it s a lot like how people on the left like harry potter or the lion king harry potter in the wizarding world all the people are armed at all times and train every citizen in combat kids are armed at school and all the schools are private the government tries to get involved and ban the study of combat or keeping of arms prof umbrage essentially trying to implement the wizard equipment of gun legislation in response the main characters form an illegal militia da eventually they break into a government facility to steal intelligence data the main good guys are unified in another illegal militia order of the phoenix rather than try to work with the government against the threat that eventually becomes the government the evil government then makes the private school a public institution open combat breaks out where the illegal militias kill government officials and take back the school making it private again harry potter is a pro armed populous anti government story or the lion king ask yourself why the lions thought scar was evil nala and the other lions didn t know that scar killed mufassa even simba didn t know scar killed mufassa until they were already fighting so why did the lions hate scar well because of the two policies we see scar enact as a ruler scar opened up the borders to free immigration of another ethnic group the hyenas in order to keep the hyenas loyal scar initiated what is effectively a welfare program with the lions hunting to feed the hyenas we seen that scar promised the hyenas food from the lion hunters in exchange for loyalty and see that the influx of immigrants on this welfare program lead to massive overhunting and destruction of resources eventually when scar can t deliver any more welfare and the lions are kicking out the immigrants the people scar worked for the immigrants he fed and gave shelter turn on him and kill him the lion king is about the immorality of welfare funded immigration redistribution of wealth from the local ethnic group yet i know many many pro welfare pro mass immigration anti armed society people who love both those stories
no matter what side you are on those kids did dance to much
i m sure i read a few articles about how george lucas has said that in a way star wars was a vietnam protest film and essentially the empire was an allegory for the the united states at the time well still to this day more likely and so with many fans across all walks of life including no doubt some conservatives it was interesting to him that everyone cheered on the rebels for defeating the empire when the empire was really them
i know about a dude who is a republican and his favourite movie character is the bad guy in karate kid he was also rooting for cersei in game of thrones all totally unironic
my dad uh would totally side with the antagonists insult the protagonists then say whelp we can t watch this it s stupid and has corrupt morals
most conservatives see themselves as being the little guy up against a bullying domineering conglomerate of the media the academy woke corporations globalist interests and the deep state from their prospective there is a far reaching effort to take away their tradition break up their family instill values they don t agree with and subject them to tyranny this allows the conservative to empathize with the upstate hero because the conservative often views their conservative ways e g their anti trans beliefs as being counter cultural rather than retrograde
idk do people on the far left identify with marcos inaros in the expanse
i heard something somewhere about conservatives watching the boys and thinking homelander was a great guy and a terrific superhero and didn t understand why the antagonists of the show were against him
firstly i love how reddit comments on conservatives like we are these strange mysterious creatures secondly that movie is almost years old i m a year old conservative today but i was like when footloose came out of course i identified with the protagonists and i still do being a political conservative in doesn t mean you are automatically some stodgy no dancin southern baptist what a ridiculous caricature you all really need to get out of your little bubbles and meet a more diverse group of people it s not going to hurt you to hear other people s opinions even those you might disagree with and if you feel the urge to comment well i don t want to know conservatives because their opinions are awful evil fattening whatever then you are suffering from the very ignorance i m talking about
on a flip from many of these answers i grew up very conservative and we just didn t watch footloose it promoted promiscuous dancing and sex im an atheist now but still have never seen it i guess we were just the bad guys in it and we assumed it was glorifying evil while ignoring the actual consequences of it the big one being burning in hell for eternity unless footloose ends with them all burning in hell then i guess we just missed out
footloose is what happens when someone breaks away from the true church the catholic church and starts their own catholics don t ban dancing
i am a older guy probably older than the average redditor s father i m socially liberal fiscally conservative and libertarian over all so i don t like most of the politicians in dc and i don t talk much politics on reddit bc the left leaning hive mind is not enjoyable to interact with that said here s my take on your interesting question i feel that religious conservatives probably have a harder time seeing or admitting that their team can be oppressive and are therefor more closed minded on topics that cut close to religion and morals personally i believe that whenever religion is heavily baked into government bad things happen on the other hand many but not all conservatives that are not primarily driven by religion are open minded and can see the ill effects of bad policy and the benefits of a better way in my lifetime again i m old i ve seen a steady and growing disease of closed mindedness on the left almost like leftist politics has become a replacement religion for them they assert a position and do not listen to any questions or concerns they attack and cancel those not a part of the hive mind i may get down voted here based on the above paragraph which would sort of prove the point nice question op and interesting comment thread
oh goody another thinly veiled screed denigrating conservatives pretending to be a question
you watched footloose and you thought a teenager wanting to hold a dance is an example of holding back freedom progress a kid getting a ticket for playing a song by the police is a far cry from the guy standing in front of tanks in tiannamen square
my family is mostly conservative i m more moderate than anything but for them and myself honestly idgaf about that kind of crap i m watching a movie to enjoy some entertainment i am not watching thinking hmmm which character aligns with my political views the most personally i hate this kind of question because why do we need to make mountains of a moehill there might be those political undertones or influences but most people don t watch movies for their political commentary they watch them for entertainment long story short who the hell cares what side conservatives or liberals should take with a movie just enjoy the piece of entertainment for what it is entertainment
they don t if you ve watched the boys you can see this play out on the subreddit it s very obvious that the biggest heroes are horrible people who have hate and contempt for regular people because they believe they are superior to them one is a literal nazi conservatives just saw them as heroes speaking what we all think but don t say which is what won trump a lot of votes the jig was up when one of the shittier supes said supe lives matter too then they got it and flipped out
considering how many conservatives watched the boys and were utterly shocked when they eventually realized that homelander wasn t a good guy conservatives identifying with the most blatant obvious and on the nose villains and characters mocking their beliefs is a much more common thing than most people realize just like how many of them love bands like rage against the machine they have zero self awareness or ability to look at anything with even a hint of nuance
or they can actually separate reality from fantasy and enjoy footloose for the ya wish fulfillment light entertainment that it is
conservatism and liberalism are both vital parts of our political process conservatives hold on to and try to keep the old ideas literally in the name they look at these traditions and see what works in them the good that comes from them liberals look at traditions and see how they fail us so they want to replace it with their new ideas it s important to remember that neither side of the equation is inherently evil or wrong just different perspectives obviously there are wrong ideas and evil people in both camps just speaking broadly here the ideas that liberals were putting forward years ago are now ideas that conservatives are fighting to protect that s how the system always goes so to answer your question when politically conservative people watch movies like footloose they are likely seeing a link between the close minded townspeople and an even older generation of conservatives that believed in ideas that had changed and they had not moved on yet people like their parents or grandparents rather than themselves after all there likely aren t very many people these days who would refuse to let kids dance but move back a century or two and i m sure there were more puritanical communities where that was a big problem
the problem is that you re mischaracterizing what conservatism means we look at miss trunchbull as morally bad yes we don t wish to preserve all bad trends from the past we just want to preserve the ones we strongly believe are good which most often leftists want to dispense with so to put it concretely when i watch a movie like these i disagree with their unfair unrealistic portrayal of conservatives particularly if it seems they re trying to portray all of us that way which isn t necessarily always the case anyway if you left out that last part we d be making the same mistake you and a lot of leftists make judgmental gets thrown around in strange ways a lot but this is a great example of it you just try to impose your preconceived notions of conservatives onto all of them without really trying to get to know them with matilda haven t seen footloose but i m sure it s relatively fair compared to today s average leftist movie i m not too offended we all recognize trunchbull is bad and maybe reminds us of our own experiences as children with bad leaders she literally locks kids in coffins with needles it s actually offensive you d act like we might condone this but as an example of something i do find offensive don t look up was really bad as was vice iirc that s what it s called it s the dick cheney movie they just are very dishonest portrayals of your average conservative and they absolutely know they re being dishonest edit almost forgot about the mindy kaling scooby doo it s especially worse when they inject politics where it shouldn t go some racial movies like get out or sorry to bother you are borderline but not great they re still entertaining regardless there s many many examples most movies today are overly political and left biased and inaccurately portray conservatives that s why we call them propaganda other examples portraying conservatives as solely being the religious right opposing lgbt identification or behaviour outright etc when in reality we just find the way leftists impose it everywhere bait homophobia accusations etc appalling we d similarly dislike if straight people got excessively sexual around kids or in the general public some conservatives are like that but there s much more variance of thought or diversity among us i believe the reason leftists don t consider this is because there s so little diversity of thought among their groups cancel culture tends to have that effect edit moreover some conservatives believe different hypotheses about this stuff not even agreeing with the way leftists frame things but leftists ignore this eg many conservatives don t really see gay as a fundamental innate personality trait in the first place gay is as gay does but they believe gayness is always culturally acquired and that such people always start out straight in early childhood i tend to believe this is true and the arguments leftists make against this are terrible and irrational they say but you didn t choose to be straight right in actuality this is why i believe this in the first place it s not reasonable to assert that gay thoughts or tendencies work exactly the same as straight thoughts or tendencies there are many other properties where these two differ like rates commonness in society in fact they differ in nearly every way
they think the antagonists are the heroes and the movie is a tragedy
progress isn t a clear objective and measurable concept like freedom so progress is just a broad meaning for whatever you think is good according to your own values so when people talk about progress they re talking about the values they have which can be own or borrowed putting them in a position of social order progress for liberals consists in individual liberties and symbolisms such as gay marriage which is pretty clear while for conservative people progress consists in other kind of thing such as getting your own store with your savings made when you were the employee of another store
people who are conservative feel like hollywood is preaching to them on how to behave but more specifically they feel like people who are corrupt and amoral with drug abuse issues and marital problems have a lot of nerve even making a movie like that because of the inherent hypocrisy of it i m not a conservative but i come from a very conservative state and have religious family members who feel this way
on the topic of the film itself footloose came out in conservative politics were different enough years ago that even some conservatives have conceded and changed their thinking on many issues for those conservatives not born before maybe the issues raised in this film are not ones that bother them and their ideologies lie elsewhere
i ve always wondered this about the handmaid s tale television show like do they see themselves in those characters at all
different strokes for different folks celebrate the diversity
my wife s family has an annual tradition of watching it s a wonderful life on christmas eve one year we had a brief discussion with her dad about what he a very fiscal conservative style republican thought about mr potter turns out he thinks potter is a socialist he quickly changed the subject when we challenged him on that notion
i guess they didn t cut loose
a lot of superhero movies are conservative but i usually don t think about it when i watch them villain i have suffered an injustice and after my master plan device takes effect no one will ever suffer that injustice that i had to hero no it will cause more suffering sometimes this is true sometimes not
you have to understand that conservatives are not homogenous there have always been conservatives that drank alcohol danced and used birth control but were against gay marriage there are conservatives that have always supported gay marriage and attend churches that have supported gay marriage for half a century but are still vehemently anti abortion and i know dozens of liberals who support laws that restrict gender affirming care for people under because their personal experiences make them distrust the patents of trans children
i grew up in a very conservative atmosphere that believed similarly to the town folks rock music evil dancing leads to premarital sex around the time that movie came out the message i got was that movie was bad hollywood as a whole was evil because it makes christians out to be the bad guy so yes they identified with the town folks and thought they were good people doing the right thing kevin bacon bad leading good kids astray also we weren t allowed to watch that movie
i haven t watched footloose in a long time but i think i remember that the reason dancing was bad was because the son went dancing got drunk and died in a car accident so the father banned dancing to stop kids from doing anything that might lead to that again i don t get why people alway attribute that to conservative views the law was put in because of an overprotective dad i don t think the dad is footloose was like that until his kid died
you re asking a bunch of liberals how conservatives think none of these answers will be relevant or useful
what have conservatives done that is remotely close to banning a town from dancing would liberals watch the movie and identify with the antagonist if dancing was banned because there was a respiratory virus
you guys really have a warped sense of what conservatives think bring on the down votes strengthen your echo chamber but for shits and giggles did the left enjoy controlling that my kids can t got to school my travel was restricted that i have to comply with a big pharma vax or the government would force me to lose my job then if any questions were brought up you were banned for misinformation ps you literally prevented dancing not like in a movie actually shut down clubs and demanded social distancing if you forgot you can still see old signs stickers etc around follow the science i guess
i seem to remember conservatives watching the show the boys and not realizing the bad guys were basically conservatives some even thought they were radical leftists it s all perspective i guess you see someone bad and you assume it s the other side
well they just recently realized ratm is political music
this amount of bewilderment is crazy do you actually think to yourself how can someone like something when they don t think like me it s like yall want people to stay in their bubbles
i heard that when colbert took over the late show conservatives were upset that his conservatives agenda disappeared not realizing it was satire
i ll answer this as someone who is fairly conservative relax i don t like trump i can t speak for all conservatives and i see people doing that often i don t really care people can express themselves however they want as long as they re not bothering anyone people can do whatever they want
some people just enjoy movies and don t force politics into it
op is offended by footloose lmao yeah op conservatives also watch star wars and say man the empire kinda has a point i lean left not far but still left of center i just read your post and giggled to myself the whole time are people on the left really this out of touch with people on the right or is this post just a meme given my field of work i deal with right leaning people all the time talk to one op most of them are normal people i m sure i disagree with many of these people s thoughts but that doesn t make them bad people
op i ve read a lot of your responses in this thread and i d like for you to take a step back and look at yourself you are immediately antagonizing conservatives assuming they align with maga agreeing with points of how they are the villains of real life and how all they believe in is harmful to everyone but themselves you are bringing up the worst possible shit and blaming it on conservatives then justifying your position and obviously your position is going to make sense with any alternative being wrong i think instead of seeking a reason why the antagonists are justified think about how someone with different world views would think and why they think that
you should see how conservative fans of the amazon prime show the boys view the show they heavily favor the superman parody character homelander when he s shown to be an archetype of a racist and all powerful sociopathic fascist they miss the message the show is trying to convey especially with the in show homelander supporters that are literally parodies of maga supporters that they view to be normal they think the show is anti leftist because it pokes fun at wokeness cooperate conspiracies rainbow capitalism when in fact its poking fun at everything but the underlying message is the dangers of the alt right
people can grow learn evolve change in their or so years of life since that movie maybe viewers related to the closer to the protagonist versus the antagonist or vice versa and changed their viewpoint over time or not i just think that people should be allowed to express themselves through dance and that footloose was the greatest movie ever
humans of all political stripes are incredibly good at rationalizing cognitive dissonance
probably the same way we feel when we watch conservative messaged films like american sniper or whatever conservatives are humans too and all of us suffer from biases and warped world views
that s not the purpose of these films or a meaningful understanding of any modern american ideology there s also just no reason to assume that every actor writer director or crew that works on or develop these films aren t also aligned with republicans or conservatives in their respective county state or federal constituency at the time of filming do you need people to realign their economic and social views based on their entertainment experiences do you want entertainment products to be truncated and corrupted to accommodate every ideological view what s lighter timeline here and which one do you honestly believe will lead to either better films or more liberal policies
with the old comedy central show the colbert report where colbert played a parody of a bill o reilly type of satirical character many conservatives thought it was serious and that the host was a right winger like them they never got the point it was making fun of them for whatever reasons conservatives don t pick up satire like more liberal people tend to do it s also why a lot of their comedy tends to fall flat with liberals
conservatives are about of the country the religious right is a subset of that group but don t come anywhere near the majority of it the democrats have done a great job pretending that the smaller subset represents the entire group because it makes it easier to discount all conservatives i truly believe the left is the more close minded group here nobody on the right thinks all democrats are bernie sanders level socialists or that they are all aoc level environmental wackos of the time the right attacks the individuals on the left and their ideas where the left assigns fringe beliefs to the entire group of conservatives and then tries to attack the entire group based on that i m conservative i don t go to church i don t think religion should be a part of politics i don t think drugs should be illegal and i don t know any other conservatives that disagree with me on any of these
this post is well thought out but you lack self awareness what s with the deep rooted us vs them mentality in that regard you yourself are just as close minded as the conservatives you re talking about you think your beliefs are so far removed that you forget that everyone is human and many people arrive at conclusions based on different experiences of their lives you do realize you could ve just as easily been one of them had you been born in sliiiiightly different circumstances right
because conservatives are able to laugh at themselves because they know hollywood is leftist and would never write a movie with a leftist villian the hollywood villians are often caricatures of conservative ideology through the lens of a leftwinger viewpoint the difference between actual conservatives views and the ones portrayed by hollywood allow conservative viewers to disassociate themselves from what the conservative villians
they always think their form of conservatism is good and noble but their parents form isn t so a conservative baby boomer who likes rock and roll and 1960s era dating standards in which chaperones were considered a stuffy outdated annoyance will sympathize with the protagonist in footloose they don t process analogy very well
lol its just a movie the movie if i remember correctly is more about protecting the towns youth after a tragedy claimed some young life s i grew up going to a southern baptist church and won a halloween costume contest dressed as freddy krueger i think most people are liberal or progressive just at different stages
conservatives always think they re the victim despite being the literal bully
this says more about you than anything op do you just blindly pick who you root for in a movie because of their political views
they miss the point i have said to people i am surprised you like this song because this means x y z explanation and they then suddenly are offended by something they loved minutes ago books are notorious for this and many people do not dig deep into what they read it is a shame because that is where the best parts lay
it s the agenda turn kids against parents trust the media take it from me parents just don t understand
or do they watch it while on the team of the protagonists but never realize that in real life they re much more like the antagonists generally this one most people are pretty easily able to convince themselves that their boundaries are reasonable and movies media tend to make the bad guy obviously bad so it s a bit of a caricature they also tend to be a bit behind the times they generally won t tackle hotbutton issues until the tide has turned someone already made the example but paul ryan and rage against the machines are a great example also as a more modern thing there is a perception that hollywood is pretty liberal so sometimes they ll shrug it off on that
you re making the question unnecessarily political and perpetuating the stereotype that politics is necessarily a culture war you said it yourself older generations misunderstand younger generations this is not political closed minded people aren t just those you disagree with they re on both sides and of all ages you re also suggesting that young people can t be conservative and that somehow they only become that way when they re older which certainly does happen but is still a stereotype to claim as universally as you have you have many unconscious biases modern politics wants you to think this way so not saying it s your fault but keep in mind that your differences with other cultures and generations does not always boil down to political differences just different life experiences
i mostly look at the consequences of rampant liberalism in the world today and realize that the antagonists were the good guys all along
or people just don t read so deeply into things and take them at surface value for simple enjoyment
it s really funny watching so many people who are clearly against conservatives think they can answer on the behalf of them in here definitely not biased answers at all
do million people have this experience when watching a movie or this experience the answer is yes
the more i converse and associate with a large number of conservatives i find that they don t really watch anything i find that i can t use a lot of references to common shows and movies because they haven t seen them it s not all but a large number of them a lot also seem to be generally dull i d love to know what they talk about when they hang out in groups i m guessing it s generally all hunting guns and work because they don t seem to have a personality far beyond these things
they say liberal propaganda of course nothing like ruining a good movie with your politics edit i have been around my fair share my whole life but yeah some do just like movies and turn off their brains
people with conservative ideologies are neither items in a zoo nor real life villains they re just people just because someone has a certain political stance doesn t mean all people with those ideologies react the same to a movie that s generalisation gone completely bonkers emotional reactions in a movie have jack shit to do with politics personally i d be very careful with categorising people that way i put it to you that doing so in a way is repeating history that we should have left behind us
i get very angry when i stumble upon these types of degenerate talkies on the television young people need to know their place in society i killed germans during the war and i have earned the right to not put up with this hippie crap it s also a very good movie
you missed the point of the movie it s not about an ideology holding back progress it s about fear corrupting and twisting an ideology in the end it was the bible itself that helped the pastor realize his fear had put his congregation on the wrong path
most conservatives don t want to ban dancing or put people in the chokey to the extent banning dancing is a metaphor for banning something that the youth like to do i imagine the pro dancing anti whatever x youth want to do conservatives don t consider the issues to be equivalent rightly or wrongly fun fact the conservatives of the english civil war who wanted to preserve the monarchy were pro dancing the revolutionary pro parliament roundheads banned dancing so i dunno it s complicated
everyone in the comments is acting like liberals and conservatives are the light and the dark side lol honestly guys i know everyone likes to have an enemy but demonizing the other side for their differences based on overinflated caricatures in movies seems really counterproductive generally everyone will side with the protagonists regardless of if their core values align usually because the antagonist is amplified to absurdity becoming unrelatable even to those that usually would agree with their goal or values keep in mind there are a shit ton of people out there that don t like rock music and dancing but don t intend to put people in jail because they decided to partake it doesn t make you the bad guy to oppose something that many others approve of or vice versa it makes you the bad guy when you are the one trying to start a war over it my take as long as you keep your music down to a reasonable level and aren t dancing in my garden we shouldn t have any problems
american culture is built around a very specific set of values one of if not the most important of which is individualism the problem with that is that it allows anyone at any point to identify with the lone dissenting voice regardless of context and that s what a lot of those heroic characters are i wouldn t call myself a conservative but i m sure a lot of redditors would call me that i see american progressives and see the same exact process but in the inverse if i see some hyper progressive pro hate speech legislation pro censorship champagne socialist who sees fascists around every corner watch footloose and identify with the main character it comes across as equally un self aware it only comes across as not that when i know the person and i know they are consistent in aspousing those core values the movie represents and since media is often also incoherent that s usually a rough one but yeah in short american culture at large has a pro little guy stance that makes it so that both macro groups see themselves as the scrappy underdogs fighting a nefarious army of enemies whether it s libs looking at the american government and seeing fascist white supremacists or conservatives seeing globalist elites importing mexican illegals to rape their children since neither is correct either s interpretation of them being the lone hero against a group of people who want to do bad thing to be interpreted through the lens that better suits the political side is also incorrect as for for footloose it s very simple dancing is not drag today s conservatives are the children of yesterday s conservatives very few of them were not progressive compared to their parents and that means their status quo includes the idea that they progressed to a point that is good enough for them unless you are a progressive progress is not done for progress sake so being in favour of change is highly conditional to what that change actually entails in practice compared to the status quo a lot of bad things are change a fascist dictatorship would be change a communist takeover would be change change doesn t mean positive change and people who don t see change as a good thing on its own won t simply say well the movie is about changing things so we should be in favour of all change they ll instead look at the push for change on a case by case basis and side with the option they feel is a better fit so they could easily be pro dancing in the streets and very much against drag queen story hour
conservatives see a movie like this and instead of watching it they tune in to fox news and let cucker carlson tell them if they should be mad about it in fact it s quite bold if you to assume that the average conservative has any independent thoughts at all usually that s why they re conservatives in the first place
this is simply a fundamental misunderstanding of what conservatism is in the us at least
i found myself remembering the day in kindergarten when the teachers showed us dumbo and i realized for the first time that all the kids in the class even the bullies rooted for dumbo against dumbo s tormentors invariably they laughed and cheered both when dumbo succeeded and when bad things happened to his enemies but they re you i thought to myself how did they not know they didn t know it was astounding an astounding truth everyone thought they were dumbo elif batuman the idiot everyone thinks they re dumbo
i don t watch movies for political ideals if i like the good guy then i root for the good guy even if the bad guy has the same politcal opinion as me if the bad guy s a dickhead then he s a dickhead
wait do liberals identify real life villains because they re similar to characters in movies
they likey identify with the protagonist not realizing they are the antagonists in real life being able to ignore the cognitive dissonance is a hallmark of conservatism in america just think about what they champion small government while voting to legislate other people s bodies protect kids while screaming their 2a rights come before kids lives etc etc
conservatives laugh at how limited the minds of liberal movie makers really are the resorts where those elites spent summers only existed because capitalists had enough cash to take vacations unmentionable how many jobs were created by capitalists able to get out of town for a week or two
keanu good trump bad aita thanks for the gold kind fat ass loser
op you have the patience of a saint and i commend you for it i myself am lacking in that department so will never be the good progressive i aspire to be if it matters i m and more radical than ever so not all old farts are conservative i hope that helps
of course walter peck was basically right about everything except for shutting down the containment unit which is a big except sure but keeping all the ghosts in an unstable reactor in the middle of nyc wasn t a good idea in the first place
i agree entirely with everything you ve said i ve actually thought a lot about this before the ghostbusters charachters are fun intelligent funny are supposed to be the good guys the ones triumphing despite villains like peck and zuul getting in the way but if you think about it too much you realize they re actually not nice or good people venkman for an example is basically a con artist that s very good at lying and taking advantage of the people around him including his friends to his own benefit taken seriously that kind of character could easily be a villain himself but this is a comedy and instead his antics are played for laughs you should laugh the deliberate absurdity of it all is meant to be funny
social media is a broad term op calling it all bad for us as a blanket statement is a bit of a simplification food is bad for us if we have a bad diet imo the internet is still in it s infancy and we re just learning how to live as a connected species we re very social animals we need to learn how to have a healthy relationship with it
watch the documentary on netflix called the social dilemma
the internet from to looks so different than now
lol i watched that last night and it honestly just confirmed what i already knew we live in a hellscape
at one k per day this is very big motivation especially if i can choose to leave at any time do i get a window how are the meal qualities do i get yard time hows the air quality and the sleeping conditions if it s a rancid dungeon then maybe maybe maybe one day if it s a dignified jail and i had access to some simple things like a calendar and paper or books or something then i think i could hold out for a fair amount of time as i d know the reprieve is available at a time of my choosing that makes it much unlike a real solitary confinement stay if you caught me at the peak of my mental health and readiness and the conditions weren t too too bad i think i could make it up to two weeks
lol people in here saying they d go years days of solitary is considered by the u n to be torture people can develop permanent psychological damage or go on suicide watch even from short term stays
about grand would go super far for me so i d do a week
minute then i d take my cents and walk free
days i believe that any longer would be a risk to my health and i could splurge a little with that money
days anyone saying months or years has no idea how difficult that would be to do voluntarily no internet no computer no phone no belongings no books no sunlight no idea of time you d go nuts very quickly
the bet is an short story by anton chekhov about a banker and a young lawyer who make a bet with each other following a conversation about whether the death penalty is better or worse than life in prison at a banker s party fifteen years ago a young lawyer defends the position that life in prison is far less humane than capital punishment the banker disagrees and proposes they bet two million rubles in exchange for fifteen years of solitary confinement rubles per day huge amount for century the terms of their agreement allow the lawyer to have access to books food and wine and over the course of his imprisonment he reads widely nearing the end of the fifteen years the banker comes to realize that he will be ruined by the lawyer s winning of the bet and both men find their lives changed by the lessons that the bet has taught them read it http://m.free-short-stories.org.uk/anton-chekhov-the-bet.htm million rubles in would be equivalent to approximately billion rubles in today s currency
is not enough in terms of hour spent in the hole it s basically hour that s just a job that you have to do for hours a day that will ruin your mind even more than a regular job does i might try it at 10k per day
services provided size of the confines details about the place if it s my house and i still get to use the internet you d have to pry me out of it if it s just a dark room with meals a day through a door then fuck no
every other day
lmao at the people saying more than a week solitary confinement is one of the most dangerous things for a human to go through
no more of these questions we as a society have shown we can t stay inside to save our own grandmas
well i ve got somewhere to be on sunday so probably until then
that s 365k a year hmm i don t think years a prison is worth million dollars especially with inflation maybe i d do it if i had a computer television phone
easily then up for reevaluation
as long as i could a week maximum or i d go nuts
probably a week tops i think i d lose my mind with nothing to do if we re talking about just being home but not going out i could do it longer because i have stuff to entertain me
true solitary confinement with no stimulation or windows i d try to go days and rely on sleeping the whole time to get through that s enough to either cover a wedding or start a down payment on a home reality would probably last days
a few daysmaybe less than a month
not even a day
as a fairly extreme introvert i think i could pay off my parents house fiancee s car and a house of our own so i d try for a year or so but i may feel differently if put in that position in reality
assuming basic rights while in confinement i d do two maybbbbeee three years if it s all mine tax free after
if i had porn and some weights and youtube probably years
i did and a half years
until i needed the hospital
if i had access to internet entertainment and things to do with my hands a couple years probably i have very little human contact as it is so it s mostly about making sure i can move enough in whatever little cell i m in and seeing the sun if only through a window
depends on the conditions and if i got books i d hope for a month but realistically i don t think i could do more than a week i d miss my kid too much and probably start having panic attacks from the isolation
if it s the type where there s constant noise and light like in the states none i prefer my sanity over any amount of money if it s a normal prison the way they have it in the netherlands or germany i think i d go for a day about twice or three times a month nice income that way
forever if i would have a phone and internet and dim lightning
loophole while it might go against the spirit of the challenge it doesn t say it has to be consecutive i could do a few days every month for the rest of my life
as someone who suffers from maladaptive daydreaming i m confident i could do at least a month my brain will provide plenty of engagement on its own lmao but beyond that unsure
one day a week probably
if i could have books and daily vitamin d supplements i could make it probably a month maybe two without the vitamin d my mental health would tank pretty quickly maybe a week
for every month do days spread out over the month catching up on sleep and meditation then enjoy the rest of the month and never have to work
if i m allowed a couple of books snacks of my choosing a piano or keyboard and things for making art i could last a week minimum with no contact throw in some weed and shrooms now we are talking a gooood while lol
probably around months maybe more if i am feeling up to it
as long as i could
i think i d be able to do a week if the conditions were right i d need a window and a couple books john oliver just did an episode of last week tonight about solitary confinement last week or this week can t remember but it looks rough
if i can define the terms of how my solitary confinement would go then i can probably go for years otherwise just no
i d be shooting for days because that would position me for financial freedom
i think i could do days which would be more than enough money to last a longtime
for as long as i can think of things that i d be able to do with the money one month and you ve got a house deposit a second month and i guess i can buy a bunch of unnecessary tech and a few holidays a third month and i m really starting to run out of concrete reasons to want the money beyond this might come in handy some day
depends on the conditions if i have any book i want or worse internet and a nice chair i d do that once a week for the rest of my life no sweat
i m stupid enough to stay there beyond the point where they are willing to let me get out lol
i think i could do a year
i d do days so just shy of years a million dollars would set me up for a good while
i think the realistic answer for anyone is they either wouldn t want to attempt it at all or they would just go as long as possible until they couldn t stand it anymore for some it might be one day for others it might be a year
half a year so long as i still got healthcare i d just crank up the ol maladaptive daydreaming and come out the other end able to buy a house easy peasy
i did months in solitary o r wing in cya down and up
deleted
do i get easy access to books or does the book list come around once a week and if you miss turning it in do you go without for a week do you have a shower in your cell or are you marched to the shower in your underwear with your wrists shackled behind your back is there a tv in the cell and cable channels are you allowed visitors or are they banned for your duration what does your hour out of the cell a day look like is it a big dog kennel looking out at the guard towers or is it four concrete walls with only the sky visible if i didn t have a family now and all of the above questions are positive answers i d do days if the above answers are as brutal as being in the hole i d do days
well that s my week for about days thanks to my disability and lack of family so a week it d actually make this worth it
days i m not desperate for money and that shit will destroy you mentally bump it up to and i d stay day there s no amount of money you could pay me to stay longer than that that shit is legit a method of torture and needs to be abolished
assuming that s after tax tax free i m confident i could do about months get myself a cool 100k and if it was a daily re up where i could choose to stay or go any day rather than having to sign up for a specific amount of time at once i d see if i could stretch that out to a year psychologically i think i d have an easy time going for quite some time if it were day by day but a very difficult time if i had to choose the amount of time in advance
as long as basic needs were met and i could read whatever i wanted to indefinitely
whats the point tho
i wanna say i could do up to a month given the money i definitely couldn t do years weeks seems doable
i d aim for weeks the ability to leave at any time would make it much easier for me i m assuming the conditions would be like at adx at which point i d read a book or just sleep
wasn t that essentially lockdown and being paid to not go into work s probably not mentally sound enough to withstand actual solitary confinement
can i take my x box
if mr beast thought me anything the question is what can we do inside that solitary confinement
weeks maybe
two months tops i value my well being and mental health too much for this shit great question by the way
a week can t get more vacation days
if they give me a pen and paper i ll finally finish my next book and will get paid for the writing process awesome
two years i have my reasons
depends on the sort of solitary confinement if it has a toilet and food water then i could probably hold out a week or two if it has paper and pen i could probably be there for a month or two if it has books i could probably be there for a year or two if it has internet i might not need to leave for a long time if it has good food a bed and a shower on top of that i might not even want to leave
if i get a computer i can go for a while if it has internet i can probably go indefinitely
years
that s easy i just survived a winter in wyoming same thing
i would pay you that for it in fact it s how you wake up
i don t know who wants to pay me to find out
with books days no books maybe two
how the world is going and how l live my life now with the luxury of working phone bought with the first days pay check l would at least make my first million l live this lifestyle now in the main all for a state pension and perks
as long as it s not complete darkness i am by myself there is a toilet sink month to jumpstart my life woo
days probably
could i like leave and come back like i stay for a week give it a month come back stay for another week etc cause if so maybe like one a month i could spend a couple of days there
i d happily do a year or two
no internet entertainment i d try for weeks
about days regardless of state or conditions yes i desperately need 15k
so if you did this for years you d just get on the right side of one million imagine people making billions in a year pisses me off every time i think about it honestly i d try to go as long as i could but up to a year tops
when do i get the money is it all given at the end or does 1knget deposted every hours while i am in solitary can i invest the money i get and like make it start working for me
the rest of my life
i live in victoria australia sounds like a lifelong holiday isolation to me aslong as i have my computer internet and food delivery i m in heaven
i m an introvert loner this would be heaven for me
months so i could walk out pay off all my debt and then truely be free
one year easy any longer and i think i would feel like it was a waste of my life money ain t everything
i do it every day for free lol
do i have internet access and or books and able to communicate with the exterior lockdown lol for introverts this is the perfect scenario someone s else does the shopping months easily
feed me and water me and change out my books and i could go really long time but i m a hermit that lives on ranch and can go weeks with out seeing or talking to other people no books and nothing to do not long
long enough to never have to work again
i mean if i have a big stack of books i d be okay for a while
i suspect that i could last a month if i was allowed to read and write and see the air any more than that and i suspect that the psychological harm would outweigh the benefits of the money
year
i can do days longer than that and i ll lose it my plan would be to use all the techniques i learnt from therapy to stay sane
depends can i have books what all am i able to have with me cause that is going to determine just how long i can stay but when i was locked up i got sentenced to months in and a half hour a day lock down for failing a drug test on work release when i was locked up couldn t have any books not even a bible no extra commissary as i was on disciplinary segregation only soap shampoo and bathroom type items and that fucking sucked so bad i honestly thought i was going to lose my mind you don t realize just how much human interaction weighs on your mental health on the daily
if it was a standard jail situation i would stay for days that would pay off all debt including mortgage and car loan and would be enough for a nice vacation as a treat afterwards
i ve done a few months deployments i bet i could make up a fake friend and we could survive for a month or two
until i die assuming i had access to the money and a digital store to buy anything i wanted to be delivered
i would go for two weeks i can really use the money i would try and do a lot of workouts a nice tolerance break from the vices and some reading oh and sleeping lots of needed sleep
most people with epilepsy are prohibited from driving
if someone with epilepsy still has seizures meaning it s not under control with a doctors help then they are not legally allowed to drive
as a passenger yes it could cause problems but generally speaking you are not legally allowed to drive if you have epilepsy some states just straight up revoke your license
you can drive with epilepsy but you must be seizure free for a length of time not just epilepsy every state has laws of how long you must be seizure free in order to legally drive and rules for exceptions in ca it s currently or months exceptions while in states like tn it s a year if a person is sensitive enough for the passing of trees to trigger a seizure they most likely wouldn t be seizure free long enough to qualify to drive due
yes it can happen to some people that have epilepsy it could act like a flackering tv monitor depends on the person not all people that has epilepsy gets triggered the same way but like the others say epilepsy and driving is just like you are playing russian roulette way to dangerous
if your complaints of a game are of fundamental aspects of the genre then you aren t the target audience like if you find yourself complaining that a turn based rpg is too slow or that a linear action shooter should have more exploration and romance if someone honestly was giving critiques this way then people will easily dismiss them as not being the target audience
people say it when someone is criticizing something that clearly was not made for them like the other day i saw someone saying a bunch of old cartoon network shows were bad because they were formulaic repetitive and didn t have overarching stories which is true but that s because the target audience is children who don t care so it s silly to try to criticize them from an adult standpoint
things are marketed towards the people most likely to buy it if i m selling stuffed animals i m not going to market them towards adult men if i m making resident evil remake i m not going to market it to junior high girls
the reason people are saying this is an implication of you should not be surprised if you do not like this thing because the author creators were not trying to appeal to you
how can i even tell if i m the target audience if something has a significant following but you don t like it it doesn t mean the thing isn t good it just means it s not meant for you for video games elden ring is a great example of this it was immensely successful but not everyone will enjoy that game
imagine you re not a musical fan and you complain about a musical having too much singing and dancing that just means you picked the wrong thing to watch instead of that musical being bad now that musical can still be bad and have too much singing and dancing but you re not a reliable narrator because even if the musical didn t suck you would still not like it so how do you know you re the target audience the thing you complained about does it change the entire genre of the thing you re not the target audience you just don t like the genre do you not like the specific thing but you do like other things in the genre and minor adjustments could make the thing better for you you might be the target audience
imagine a man complaining about women s clothes not fitting him that s it
people who make content often make it with certain demographics in mind especially age the producers of the bachelor don t expect preschoolers to enjoy it and the makers of bluey don t expect teenagers to enjoy it
example you don t like spicy food you order the spicy nuggets on the menu the food is spicy you complain that the food is terrible and should be removed from the menu because it hurts your mouth someone might rightfully reply that you re not the target audience for those spicy nugs and direct you to try something that suits your tastes example you are an adult you watch a children s tv show the show contains lots of elements that children love and need repetitiveness consistent characters foundational starter level gags easy to understand plots with clear emotions you complain that the show is terrible because as an adult you ve already grown accustomed to most plots characters gags etc and you find this show beneath you someone might rightfully reply that you re not the target audience for that show example you come across a programming humor podcast you know nothing about programming and a lot of things they talk about are over your head wtf someone might rightfully point out that you re out of context for the show and not the target audience for their podcast the show is meant for people who already know about programming to be a little place for them to talk shop that means unfortunately it is not something you can easily consume in general the concept of not target audience is that many things are a matter of taste sometimes a show or piece of media is specifically inflammatory or provoking harmful opinions about outsiders but much of the time shows are just sticking to their niche which means not every show is for everyone the main way you can know if you re not the target audience or not is to see if you can relate to the main characters or speakers if you can t relate to them it s probably not meant for you you can also tell by looking around at the general fanbase for that thing
here s a really simple example my wife hates john wick movies i think they re super entertaining she watches them and says he just shoots a lot of people and looks fancy who wants to watch that this is terrible and i say omg he shoots people and looks so fancy doing it this is awesome my wife is just not the target audience but i am
it means the makers of the product service don t care much what you think your criteria for liking something are not important to the makers when making the product service for example if i m designing a guitar there are a lot of choices to make regarding how i make the guitar if i am making a black electric guitar with sharp angles and strings for someone who wants to play metal music i don t really care if the acoustic playing singer songwriter likes the guitar or not the singer songwriter is not part of the target demographic
there s a great roger ebert quote about this the star rating system is relative not absolute when you ask a friend if hellboy is any good you re not asking if it s any good compared to mystic river you re asking if it s any good compared to the punisher and my answer would be on a scale of one to four if superman is four then hellboy is three and the punisher is two in the same way if american beauty gets four stars then the united states of leland clocks in at about two when you say you don t like something ask yourself why is it because it s bad or because it s not meant to appeal to you
comic book movies are a good example comic book fans love comic book shit like multi spider men showing up in a timeline i bet studio execs have been saying no that s stupid to tobey showing up in garfield mcu movies for years or any sort of multiverse type stuff like that i m a little optimistic about james gunn being given control of dc he understands comic book shit
i think you re being asked to imagine if someone else might enjoy something rather than assuming that if it doesn t appeal to you it s just shit you could ask who the target audience is to push the conversation further mister rogers didn t have to be an actual child to say that a lot of tv shows for kids were objectively poorly made and weren t really helping kids grow up intellectually and emotionally as an example i think the designs of kingdom hearts look ugly as hell and from what i ve heard of the plot it sounds like a manuscript that a publisher would recieve with a mental hospital as the return address but i can imagine someone who goes to disneyworld every year and exclusively plays jrpgs would love the art and story
my go to example is beiber one direction boy bands and the twenty somethings that loved to bash on them and their music listening to and critiquing them is fine i love pointing out how many of there songs are about you generic listener and nothing more but that doesn t mean they didn t deserve to exist and play music just because these adults hated their music and that s because the music isn t geared towards them the style of the bandmates and the songs themselves were geared to appeal to teen and tween girls they weren t producing music to appeal to adult men and that s fine those adults are not the target audience and boy band music isn t made to cater to their tastes some people though still felt the extreme need to hate them and their fans even with the plethora of other music and media to occupy them just because the boy band genre was unappealing to them thus the phrase you aren t the target audience is usually leveled at people who whine that something doesn t appeal to them by design and feels this fact is a grave injustice to their sensibilities
this is what unintentionally cracks me up about youtube reviewers like the critical drinker a bunch of grown men with beards whinging about cartoons meant for children while simultaneously moaning about how badly men are represented in modern media catch on to yourself nitwits
if your complaint about the fantasy book is the world building was mediocre and the characters were stereotypes and it s predictable those are legitimate complaints if your complaint about the fantasy book is dragons aren t real and magic is silly you are not the target audience basically the thing is doing what it s supposed to do it s just not something you enjoy
companies make products for a certain audience diapers for example can t be a product for year old kids the target audience for diapers are parents or more like people in the parental age brackets if you have no children chances are you re not the target audience but you can still buy diapers for other uses how can i even tell if i m the target audience if you like it or has uses for it then you re the target audience no matter what the company or everyone else says
when somebody thinks or says that something sucks they re saying one of two things that can both be true at once but are nevertheless distinct it was clearly made for somebody like me i tried it expecting to like it and was sorely disappointed i didn t it wasn t clearly made for somebody like me i tried it anyway not sure if i would like it and sure enough i didn t if somebody voices their dislike of something and someone else responds with you are not the target audience they re picking up that you re surprised by your distaste and are surprised that you re surprised by this what they re hinting to you is do you have the social awareness to imagine the type of person that thing was made for and if so do you have the self knowledge and self acceptance to realize that you re not one of those people
honestly to know if you are the target demographic you have to look at yourself and know what you like it s fair to try new things here and there once you know your own preferences you know what is targeted at you when it comes to games hardcore games and games that require me to pay attention for hours to get through the plot are two examples im not in the demographic of im like games that are a bit more casual or allow me a bit more freedom if i went into say elden ring and criticized it for not being casual enough that s a bad review because any due diligence would show it s not a casual game
there is no need to tell if you are the target audience or not buy it or don t there is no try
i can only speak from my own audience experience but generally speaking if a game doesn t appeal to me on multiple levels then i just assume it was marketed for a different demo
content is never designed for everyone just as an example i remember a bunch of year old men complaining about how twilight was a terrible novel when it wasn t written with them or their aesthetic values in mind it would be like if i tried to watch sesame street and complained about how it was too basic
im a game designer so i might be able to answer accurately different games have different motivations for progressions for example some games focus a lot about exploring and seeking every part of the place this style of game will appeal to a specific type of psychological profile of a player because of this the game will focus to cater it s features to that style of players those would be the target audience you can tell you are the target audience if the game app especially speaks to you and your wants needs
you hate action rpg game diablo is coming out you don t like it it s not grand 4x game you want to play the game is not meant for you you are not the target audience
if you like it it doesn t matter for instance the original book the wizard of oz was a commentary on the gold standard oz is the abbreviation of ounce the standard measure of gold and the yellow brick road speaks for itself at no time did the author think that someday they d make a movie that would become a gay icon imho
it means you are being dismissed instead of hearing your concerns until your dollar goes away then you will be shamed
it is a deflection to criticism hey that is a massive plot hole this doesn t make any sense you aren t the target audience
that phrase starting to have a double meaning to it the first is you are literally not the target audience think of something you do not like the other which i am thinking you are asking happens when fanbases express outage over unnecessary poor or forced changes usually virtue signaling to their favorite something companies will use that phrase as a snarky remark to their fans to deal with it i understand their outage i had the same feeling with starwars when rey suddenly became chosen one and everything that happened with anakin fuck it i love rey she is my favorite character outside the movies there are valid criticism about companies faking it and capitalizing on tokenizing diversity i think that is what you might be trying find out
it means exactly what it says everything that was ever created to be utilized by people other than its creator had a target audience sometimes you are not that target audience
what it really means is we deny the existence of any possible valid criticisms of our thing be it movies video games etc and instead would like to attack usually straight white men in their s for being racist sexist and homophobic against our thing when in reality your show movie video game is a steaming pile of shit
a good game should appeal to most people you are not the target audience is just a defensive deflection to critique usually legitimate ode to joy was probably targeted to rich german aristocrats but the number of people worldwide who hate it can probably fit inside a telephone booth
it means you re probably not gay or trans or you re just someone that doesn t like gay or trans porn on your tv
it means if you re you need to put fluttershy down because you re cringing everybody else out
lol my parents don t watch any pixar movies since they are marketed to kids similarly they won t watch the simpsons or south park because it s considered adult animation a phrase that reminds them of porn
they mean if you dont like the media dont buy consume the media
i didn t build him for you dr frank n furter
an rpg video game is marketed towards those who wanna play a lot multiple hours a day a horror game is marketed to those who like jump scares a board game is marketed to family friendly casual play etc
if they came out of the newest sudoku vr game where you can play sudoku on a park bench in the middle of a park if that game doesn t sound interesting to you then you are not the customer they re making that game for if they re making the next call of duty fortnite whatever and youre interested in playing it then you re the audience they re trying to sell to
it may be more obvious when you are not the target audience if you want a driving game that s as realistic as possible you will want to try titles like assetto corsa competizione iracing or gran turismo to name a few if you prefer a driving game featuring cute cartoon characters that can run over special sections to achieve powerups and have the ability to knock out your competition by throwing bananas at them then the mario kart series is more your speed pun intended a pre teen who knows nothing about cars and just wants to sit down and play without hours of setting up his car won t be the target audience for the games in above
i ll focus on how can i tell if i m the target audience and sometimes you can t you might check all the boxes and still not be what their design team envisioned a target audience might look like super fans of the series that love the characters and the story you want to build the franchise this game is a love letter to the fans fans of the game genre that you want to be a part of you noticed that 1v1 3d fighters are really profitable and you want a piece of the action a demographic that will have certain actions this game is great in short stints and is easy to pickup and putdown perfect for a working parent who doesn t have much time in their evenings weekends all of that to say there are a lot of variables in whether or not you re the target audience to echo u chosenscim if you are upset about the way the game is styled vs something more nuanced like a story element or character trait that s a pretty strong indicator that this game wasn t made with you as its target
one needs to understand the different genres as well as your own genre preferences well first before you ll be able to know if you re the target audience people often confuse faults with what s intended because of this knowing and following development companies often tell you what to expect from their games too
if you complain about a game because of the game it is not because of design flaws with a game or genre for example people who hate sims because there s nothing telling you what the objective is means you are not the target audience or like i don t like fortnight because the loot pools too small that just means i m not the target audience
i would rather walk barefoot through a room full of legos than subject myself to a fromsoftware game that said i don t think they are bad games im just not the target audience
target audience is a marketing term so think of it in marketing and basic business terms what kind of product is this thing what demographic categories such as age gender race income and so forth does the average consumer of this thing fit into is there overlap between the people who spend money on this thing and people who spend money on another thing then ask yourself do i like other things in this category or thing do i fit into the demographic profile of the people who spend money on this thing do i like other things that people who fit that demographic profile might like if your answers to those questions are no then you re probably not in the target audience just as one example let s say you re going shopping for a car you have about 20k to spend and you look at a kia a mazda and a track ready drift car with a roll cage which are all in your price range after test driving the drift car you say i hated the car it wasn t comfortable it had no cup holders or even a console and it was very loud and difficult to drive did you dislike the track ready car because it was a bad drift car or were you just not in that market despite it being available to you similarly if there s a cartoon or a movie or song you don t like are you just complaining that the drift car has a loud exhaust and isn t comfy
when a game or movie has a target audience it s intended to be a lot more niche with a specific type of person in mind for example action films are broadly made for men and young adult romance is broadly made for women if a man were to complain about a love triangle in ya romance or a woman was to complain about violence in an action film it d just illicit the response you are not the target audience with niches it s expected that not everyone is going to like a thing it s also a means for shutting up out community criticisms with a community there s an expectation that certain basic tenants are going to be accepted
person a i m thinking of trying this horror game but i hate jump scares person b this game has a lot of jump scares you should probably avoid it because you are not the target audience hopefully person a will be able to understand that games with jump scares are valid even if if it s not something they personally enjoy
market might be the correct term things aren t usually designed to be just mass appeal like a fps that targets dinks is different than say cod and probably not large enough of a segment also think of four corners upper left is cheap but gaudy upper right is expensive but austere lower left is cheap but austere lower right is expensive but gaudy
if you don t like it you are not the target audience
easiest way to tell if you re the target audience is if you dislike something for a deliberate creative choice verses a bug glitch error if you don t like pokemon because it s buggy as hell then that doesn t have anything to do with you being a member of the target audience or not but if you dislike pokemon for being an rpg then you clearly just aren t the target audience better example might be super smash bros if you love ultimate but hate that it isn t like your favorite classic fighting games you still really aren t the main target audience another way to think of it is look you are a very specific unique person there will never be anything perfectly catered to you you are going to be met with games designed to simply please the most people possible often without knowing what that entails
there are a lot of hardcore gamers who think that if something doesn t appeal to their specific neuroses that it s a problem with the game and not their expectations there are people who complain about too many korok seeds in botw because they re completionists and they get bored doing them all of course you re not really supposed to get them all but the hardcore completionists will act like they re oppressed by not being able to the game they re not the target audience
a good way of knowing is if you are already a fan of the series or a fan of other games in the same avenue of thematics gameplay like i enjoy platforming and metroidvanias therefore i am a target audience of silksong i think sports and adjacent activities are boring in a game therefore im not a target audience of sports games and racing games such as fifa
i think the simplest way to describe it is that the target audience of a game are those that are into the type of game it is let s use call of duty as an example if you like shooter games especially ones based on warfare you are part of the target audience a lot of times when you hear target audience we think of specific groups of people but video games are different because not every person of any group likes one thing universally so when it comes to games it s not really going to be more specific than that
if you are complaining about an inherent trait of a peice of media note that i mean here not a poorly done trait but that it is there then you might not be the target audience if you don t like blood and violence then doom is not the game for you if you complain the gore is not well executed then that is different basically it s pointing to the old fact that in matters of taste there is no argument your opinion is not invalid but it is based on personal taste rather than anything quantifiable as for how to tell reading reviews and checking against your preferences can help maybe find a reviewer or two in the relevant feild who s opinions align mostly with yours if they like something maybe you will too
depends on the media shonen anime are meant for boys and young men if you don t relate to the pervy characters in them that s why it s not meant for you long story short not every genre is for everyone if you don t like something about a genre but like other aspects of it leave it alone don t try to change it to mold to your tastes
the first answer is probably the best i don t like playing rpgs because i want to control the character like link and not select actions from a menu that control the character like cloud so i m not the target audience for rpgs
if you go into a fandom and want to heavily change the thing that is being fanned about to fit you this is not the thing for you and you should find something else
like when white ppl say godfather of harlem is a bad show
like if you watch an action movie and then complain there were too many car chases and cool explosions or that the fight scenes were unrealistic that s not because it s a bad action movie it s because you don t like action movies same goes for like complaining that children s cartoons are too simple or that russian novels are too long those things are just part of the genre and if you don t like them find a different genre
often that people have different tastes in things
the phrase you are not the target audience means a product or media is not designed for you but for a different group of people and it can be aimed at a specific age range gender cultural group or people with certain interests or experiences to know if you are the target audience you can look at marketing and advertising materials as well as the content itself however just because you are not the target audience does not mean you cannot enjoy or find value in it
this needs to be higher because it hits the nail on the head for the answer if you don t like the game that much for x reason and the game doesn t do that thing badly or most people who play the game really like that thing but you don t then you re not the target audience the target audience is people who like that thing x200b take cyberpunk for example i don t like that game i think it s incredibly shallow and not all that well designed however i am it s target audience i like first person games role playing games and sci fi games in cyberpunk settings but if i didn t like it because it was first person or cyberpunk then it would be clear that i m not it s target audience
exactly right my first thought was of going to conventions local tabletop convention with an artist alley i m its target audience nerd convention focused on women totally made for me car show not so much dental conference you ve lost me that car show and dental industry conference are probably great shows but i wouldn t know because it s really not for me and i would lose interest real fast
also the people who complain about people breaking out into song and dance during a musical that s the whole point it s like complaining about the characters in an action movie solving their problems through violent set pieces instead of sitting down and trying to solve things through diplomacy or mediation
it s this plus if you re just against the general themes of the work an example was the last of us show some people were very upset about portraying homosexual relationships it wasn t the way they were portrayed but that they were at all those people just need to realize they aren t the target audience it s like i m not going to critique christian fiction for being focused on the religious aspect i m not going to enjoy it but that s not a fault of the artist that s because i m just inherently not the target audience for a religious work
it s worth pointing out that this doesn t inherently mean that the criticism is unfair or wrong genres evolve just because something is doesn t mean it s best has to be that way or will always be that way generally speaking the you re not the target audience comment is a flippant way to ignore or dismiss someone s feedback without having to actually address the content of said feedback
you are totally excluding games that are just terrible and don t even please the target market there have been plenty of flops like that oh you just aren t the target market is often a cop out for terrible marketing design development testing or rollout
tbf to your first example some turn based rpgs can be pretty slow
one example i ll always point to is that woman power scene in avengers endgame i found it pretty eye rolling myself but eventually i started seeing posts photos and videos of little girls being ecstatic at that scene and saying it was their favorite part of the film i a fully grown adult male was not the target audience of that scene not every single part of media is designed specifically for you as a lot of media nowadays is meant to blend adult appeal in with child appeal marvel and star wars make a lot of movies designed for adults but you have to remember they re still franchises that originally catered to children
it wasn t necessarily that kids didn t care about the serialized nature plenty of shows targeted at adults are serialized looking at you law order csi ncis etc but because the network wanted to be able to continue to make money from the show in syndication they were somewhat legitimately concerned that viewers not being able to jump in at literally any episode during reruns would prevent people from watching it after the original run
i think this is just a legitimate complaint about old cartoons though many new ones have some sort of continuity and some sort of story or stories that play out over the course of the show old cartoons have an episode then everything is back to normal they usually don t go back to those old episodes and there is consequences from the decisions they made in prior episodes with all that said its not that the old ones were bad they were just a product of the time
removed
i think it s fair to have criticisms as long as you are aware of the difference between something being bad because of taste versus execution if i don t like a show because it s formulaic i can say it s not my taste instead of saying it s bad because it s formulaic which is implying a show being formulaic is an objective flaw versus saying it s bad because the execution of it being formulaic is bad maybe the formula itself isn t interesting enough even to children maybe another element clashes with it being formulaic like if a major theme is teaching children that people change but every character resets their lesson by the next episode but it wouldn t be bad because it was formulaic but because it wasn t executed well taking into account the audience s perspective is important when deciding if something was executed well for a specific audience group but i also think modern children are a different audience from the ones that watched old cartoon network lots of shows even kids shows are chronological now like avatar the last airbender that doesn t make older ones worse but it may be less of a divide between adults and children and just a divide between more modern trends
so only children are allowed to criticize those things
me a year old man hiding my giant pokemon plushies under my bed yeah stuffed animals are clearly for children only
i m selling stuffed animals i m not going to market them towards adult men i think you probably could it s just how you market them for example groku or something that makes star wars noises simple creatures
but when it s less obvious like modern games now you might like the themes of a game but then you play it and don t like does that mean i was never the target demographic
my interpretation of you re not the target audience is often you re not entitled to an opinion because the game wasn t made for you
exactly as a corollary to this if you truly do belong to the audience targeted by something and therefore expect to like it but are disappointed to find that you don t you ll probably find a large plurality or majority of people from your fellow target demographic echo your sentiments whenever my kids encounter something they vocally don t like i m in the habit of asking them a thought provoking question what kind of person would likely appreciate it and if they give me a thoughtful answer i ll follow up with and would you say you re one of those people or a similar group of people done in a lighthearted non preachy way this brief socratic exercise is a great way to teach kids to each his own or in today s parlance don t yuck other people s yums it s much more compassionate while at the same time true to oneself to instead say not really my thing but you go ahead and enjoy it
i mean there are a lot of really obvious examples straight adult men were not the target audience for twilight everyone knows that was made to appeal to teenage girls it s obvious right doesn t mean all girls like them but i m pretty sure every single straight guy out there knows twilight was not made with them in mind as the target audience doesn t mean you can t be a fan of something despite being outside the target audience though i mean i m a year old woman i m not the target audience for pro wrestling but i enjoy it
eh i dont like that argument the kardashians have a significant following but they are definitely not good
that s me when it comes to musicals i like my shows to be immersive and somewhat realistic so when random people who have never met start singing songs like they ve rehearsed it hundreds of times it breaks the immersion for me fantasy is totally fine by me however it s what the characters would do behave if such a world and environment existed but knowing random lyrics out of thin air nope
this isn t really a fair comparison as some people are assigned male at birth and unable to fit attire designed for women
that s funny because i have seen lots of adults liking the bluey show
are comic book movies targeted at children i don t like them so i can t tell
agreed criticism isn t just people shouting about what they like or don t my favorite critics discuss meaning and their interpretations based on evidence within the content at the same time they recognize how the content is positioned and who the intended audience was supposed to be
i don t even click on those videos but they annoy me just by popping up in the suggestions i wish i could block those channels from ever appearing in the suggestions if every show followed their criticisms it would just lead to the most formulaic boring shit ever
that isn t true the wizard of oz is just a kids book the whole it s really a commentary on the progressive party thing came later cause there was a teacher who came up with it none of that was actually intended by the author
i mean the ruler of oz in the later books is kind of trans so frank might actually have had an inkling there
i thought the author got the name oz from looking at a file cabinet marked o z
sort of relevant but have you seen the netflix show arcane if you like cyberpunk the city of piltover is full of it amazing show i can t shut up about it
so you also thought it just felt shallow
but i feel like there are some exceptions to that such as if you think a game would be better in third person or first person because you think it would better fit that genre
i felt personally attacked until you said during a musical lol my coworkers don t seem to mind too much when i m singing at least
yeah saying someone is not the target audience can certainly be done unfairly but it can also be said fairly depending on the circumstances i remember i was watching the review of some call of duty like game and the player was given the objective to point a laser at something to have it be destroyed the reviewer kept ignoring that and trying to jump down somewhere and kept getting a mission failed screen and then called the game trash because exploring off the map wasn t allowed that is what i think of when i hear this if someone has an actual legitimate complaint about a game and other people dismiss them as not being the target audience then that is a whole different thing i suppose the difference is people who critique features of a game instead of asking for random features outside the scope of the game
there is a difference between saying aliens colonial marines is a bad fps and saying that alien isolation is bad fps one is a poorly made game the other is a stealth game
i mean sometimes yes https://youtu.be/ghmdmit8ahy
i think attempting to change the demographics that are being targeted by already established works world s and ip s with a loyal fan base made up of those demographics is a more then valid complaint to have against a peice of media or studio 1000x moreso if the person making the new stuff isn t the original creator
the first time i watched avatar as a kid when it came out i was like damn this show is awesome then i watched the next episode and was like holy shit this show has a continuous story
product of their time because there was no such thing as streaming or dvr s you d be lucky if you could get old episodes on vhs and even then you would have to have waited a year or two for them to be released the problem with having a continuous story from week to week is that if you missed a new episode because you had to go to soccer practice or something it would be confusing for a kid to come back and not know what happened the week before especially if a new character got introduced or an old character wasn t there anymore better for syndication too because if you do reruns you don t have to worry about running them in order
no by the time you re out at pluto the sun is just a bright star between stars you d have a hard time picking it out there is very little light out there
that s an interesting question on really clear nights here on earth with no moon i have been able to see my hand by starlight but then there would be all that reflected light from all the stuff around me you wouldn t be getting that in deep space but on the other hand the atmosphere does block some light you don t have that problem is space my gut reaction is that you would dimly be able to make it out but i m not sure how to get the data to back that up edit found this https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-dark-is-space/](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-dark-is-space/) it suggests that the brightness of all the stars put together would give as much light as of the full moon i think that would be enough to make out your hand in front of your face
i want you to know that this was a fantastic question and it really warms my soul to see some interesting astronomy questions here
i asked a similar question on stackexchange years ago and got a great answer light days from earth would be like the full moon that s just a smidge from our sun to the next in between it would be really really dark all space shows with lit up ships must be real near a star https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2308/would-space-faring-vehicles-in-interstellar-space-be-in-pitch-darkness-show-ref
no it would be insanely dark think of little light a star in the sky provides that would be all the light you had basically what the desert looks like in the middle of the night
it would be too dark to see your hands some stars in our galaxy are bright enough to light up their surroundings but it depends on the object s size reflectivity and distance
while i dont have the numbers on hand but it can easily be calculated by determining the amount of light released from both stars the distance between them assuming youre in the middle then apply the inverse square law on both stars for how much light you d receive i d wager the answer is no as that distance is absolutely massive
isn t our sun the closest star
you would be able to see but not because there is a lot of light there is very little light envision perpetual night and dark moonless night at that but you would be able to see because your human eye is pretty amazing you d be able to see just fine in that low light because your eyes would adjust
no
if you were floating in the space between our sun and the closest star it would be dark and there would be no ambient light to illuminate your surroundings while stars emit light they are usually not bright enough to illuminate nearby objects and the intensity of light decreases with distance squared due to the inverse square law however a very bright star or nearby planets reflecting light could potentially illuminate your surroundings
to put some numbers to this lux is roughly the lowest level detectable to the human eye starlight on a clear moonless night on earth is lux edit interestingly on a clear day there will be a time where the brightness in your location matches noon on pluto it s brighter than you think there s even a calculator from nasa https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/plutotime/) for this edit due to factors such as air glow and sunlight diffusing from the far side of the planet a clear moonless night is probably more typically about lux lux is a measure of energy per unit area so we can see the stars themselves because all that energy is concentrated into tiny points but that same energy spread out over the entire surface of the earth is well below what our eyes need to function edit maybe not while lux seems to be considered the lowest threshold for vision i ve found some sources that indicate it is possible to detect changes down to lux at this level you couldn t tell anything about shape distance or texture but you might be able distinguish the presence absence of an object
maybe this is stupid but if pluto perceives the sun as what we would recognize as a bright star how are we sure that we re not in the gravitational orbit of a bright star in our sky rather than our sun or both like our solar system is in the gravitational pull of another bigger star in this question i guess i m making an assumption that there s some correlation between the strength of the gravitational pull and the perceptive brightness
thank you yes the answers are great seems like most comments lean towards no but it s still interesting to imagine how it would look like
but wouldn t the night sky in a desert be filled with stars i ve seen photos where you can see huge parts of the milky way from down here i haven t been in such a location though so i m not sure how bright it would be
even if you re taking all the stars of the milky way into consideration i imagine the sky would be filled with those
op meant between our sun and the next closest star which would be proxima centauri
yes i believe they meant the closest star apart from the sun
uhmmm i ve been out camping well away from light pollution on a star lit night and saw well enough to manouver around and see my hands heavily shadowed but still i ve also been out at night with storm clouds overhead and that was feeling like mine level dark
we do know that our solar system orbits the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way
you can vividly see the see the stars and absolutely nothing else the moon will provide a tiny bit of lighting if it s out but when it s not you can t see your hand in front of your face the stars don t provide any ambient lighting for your environment
a moonless starlit night would give you scotopic vision meaning no color and basically just being able to make out shapes badly you wouldn t be able to read or clearly make out shapes of objects that aren t of a bright white material i suppose in space where no starlight is blocked by a huge ball of rock things would be a little bit brighter but functionally probably not much so if you wanted to actually do anything that needed vision with any precision in space between the sun and the nearest star you d need to bring a lamp
due to factors such as diffused sunlight from the lit side of the earth airglow and light pollution of which there is always some a typical clear moonless starry night is about times brighter lux than what i quoted possibly more a cloudy moonless night is lux figuring out exactly how dark it has to be before you have no chance of making a determination of there vs not there for a given object would require figuring out exactly how many photons are bouncing off that object and striking your eye relative to the number that are striking your eye when the object isn t present this isn t precisely the same thing as what is normally considered the limit of human vision i think you re right lux is probably closer to the threshold for determining there not there making that edit

orca
yes there are tons humans are an example as are lions orcas wolves etc the term apex predator refers to predator animals that themselves have no natural predators this doesn t mean that will eat them in a pinch but just that they are on top of their ecosystem s food chain and don t have other predators that are adapted to kill things like them
polar bear comes to mind even for humans stopping one of those is exceeding difficult
human
chuck norris
yes there are many mostly on islands naturaly kiwi birds
orca
kea i think
this is a surprisingly difficult question to answer and it wildly depends on your personal interpretation of what counts as a predator
the dodo had no predators that is until humans showed up
us
orca amur tiger
as juveniles we re all prey
mighty orcas or basically any apex predator
porcupine
as long as humans exist nope simply because we manage to be the predators of animals that otherwise wouldn t have one
hippopotamus
humans
wild boars in hawai i
polar bears
polar bears
quokka
apex predators don t have predators tigers and lions don t have wild predators and humans are forbidden to hunt them for meat the hippos and elephants of that area could kill the big cats but don t like to hunt similarly the wolves of northern areas have no predators unless humans are allowed to eat them the bears of those areas can kill wolves but not chase and catch them
pretty sure nothing eats bald eagle
tardigrades
tardigrades i have a feeling they will outlast the sun
yeah a lot actually although the number is much lower if you count humans with guns as predators
no there isn t every animal is at the very least opportunistically preyed upon by other animals
couldn t humans be considered predators because we kill each other reasons could include cannibalism but mostly for other reasons we are very unique because we kill for non survival reasons but it s still a predator behavior but in a different category
i don t know what you mean whatsoever are you saying an animal where no single individual of that animal has ever been eaten in all of time that would be impossible to say but as for animals that have no natural predators i believe the obvious answer is humans
humans lions tigers bears etc think of apex predators
polar bears
polar bears
the giant tortoise until we found them and almost ate them all
elephant
children i hope
humans
great white sharks
actually not humans we have jeffrey marsh to prey on us
capybaras have only a few predators like but do yourself a favor and look up all the photos of them chilling with every other animal including crocodiles they re the miss congeniality of the animal world
the term is an apex predator humans rank among the few
icelandic horses
what about these little dudes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue-ringed_octopus) i couldn t find any mention of natural predators anywhere i read not a lot of things out there that can stomach a dose of tetrodotoxin
there is no animal on earth that has no predator whatsoever every animal is part of a complex ecosystem and has some form of predator or natural threat that it must face however there are some species that have very few natural predators due to their size behavior or other adaptations for example adult elephants have very few natural predators due to their large size and strength but their young may still be vulnerable to predators such as lions or crocodiles some species of venomous snakes such as the king cobra have few natural predators due to their highly toxic venom and aggressive behavior
manatees have no natural predators
banana slug
koalas
crocs
it really depends on how you look at it technically there are multiple predators at the top of their food chains however there are still other animals that can and do attack them lions are at the top of the food chain i m africa however hyenas will still attack a lion humans are at the top of every food chain however people are killed every year by other predators so no predator is above being hunted by another predator
killer whales
capybara
ocean sunfish
they orcas are still hunted for food in small numbers or as a means to control their population in greenland japan indonesia and the caribbean according to the iucn
there is video of them killing great white sharks
humans hunt orcas
wdym i love hunting orcas
came here for this basically unless it s practically dead so that it s effectively being scavenged other orcas and humans are the only real threat to orcas
humans seem like the only example honestly humans actively hunt all the other examples for food and sport
but mountain lions and bears for example kill wolves
humans need weapons to be effective predators and in the case of a shark attack weapons won t help as much as you think so i don t really see us as apex predator there s videos all over the internet about people being killed by animals including domestic dogs
before we got to a good tech level probably bows atlatls large cats were our primary predator
orcas will eat polar bears that are swimming between ice
almost but walruses and wolves can kill them
i mean technically polar bears hunt humans as in follow them long distances and ambush them they re not really scared of humans
they orcas are still hunted for food in small numbers or as a means to control their population in greenland japan indonesia and the caribbean according to the iucn
their eggs and chicks but it seems to be in less danger than most mentioned like other animals man seems to be the worse
predator an animal that will kill for food survival
close nile crocodiles lions and spotted hyenas are known to prey on young hippos beyond these adult hippos are not usually preyed upon by other animals due to their aggression and size
despite being numerous on the small offshore islands the quokka is classified as vulnerable on the mainland where it is threatened by introduced predatory species such as red foxes cats and dogs it requires dense ground cover for refuge
thanks
yeah maybe you re right
interesting read but i don t think so they have to be careful though although tardigrades can survive extreme conditions they still have predators nematodes a kind of worm amoebas and sometimes even other tardigrades all prey on tardigrades
don t tardigrades eat their own
yes because they are extremely resilient to high and especially freezing temperatures
by preyed upon you mean consumed correct if so orca are excluded from even human predation
we re very much predators we kill for survival as well especially that i d say there s just a few humans that kill just for the sport we don t personally kill our prey ourselves but i m pretty sure that works the same in other predators they share too as far as i know the killing each other is something else but also happens in other animals
except each other
www reddit com r todayilearned comments gvstu til_that_siberian_tigers_eat_bears utm_source share utm_medium mweb3x utm_name mweb3xcss utm_term utm_content share_button
lions hyenas and crocodiles
their only known predators are certain populations of orcas and humans
sorry no according to wikipedia they can have a lifespan of years but tend to live less than four years in the wild due to predation from jaguars pumas ocelots eagles and caimans the capybara is also the preferred prey of the green anaconda
we might have a winner because these creatures icelandic horses have never had any predators in their natural environment they are not easily spooked making them very approachable and friendly
such beautiful colors and you would think that their highly toxic venom would protect them alas no the biggest predator of the blue ring octopus is the moray eel other predators also include whales seals and different types of shore and marine birds
yes sadly i m with you just hoped for a few to be completely free young or old but as you say it s a complex ecosystem
in some places is almost true but in others they have predators https://www.manatee-world.com/manatee-predators/](https://www.manatee-world.com/manatee-predators/)
predators include california giant salamanders garter snakes shrews and raccoons even humans have been known to eat banana slugs in emergencies
today the natural predators of the koala do not make a significant impact on wild populations they include goannas dingoes powerful owls wedge tailed eagles and pythons all of which are most likely to prey upon juvenile koalas
so by this logic and to answer your question the only animal to not have a natural predator is humans humans can at any time just say fuck it and kill anything we desire
they also eat moose
yes they also learned you can incapacitate them by flipping them over
i mean by this logic absolutely everything has a predator because humans can at any point decide to eradicate anything we so desire
false
ya just grab your fins and snorkel let s go
humans hunt other humans frequently but they don t usually eat them when they kill them so i guess that doesn t count as hunting not a legal expert
humans have been eaten by animals
they ll fight and kill wolves when they re forced into it either by starvation or by the wolf hunting them but they won t seek out wolves for food given almost literally any other option
wolves are apex predators because of their instinct to exist as packs a wolf pack would easily kill a bear or mountain lion they stalk large prey for days not allowing them rest untill they finally attack the weary prey
the fact we can make weapons i think is the argument that makes us apex predators if we weren t an apex how would we displace or endanger as many species as we have as far as sharks the same can be said for any other apex land species that crosses into the shark ecosystem our own stupidity or arrogance gets us killed more than anything else
holy shit that is terrifying
wait a walrus can kill a polar bear i may have drastically underestimated walruses
the constitution gives states power over their electors most likely what would happen is that a government in exile would represent hawaii
there is no provision in the constitution for this the assumption is that if there are valid electors selected by the process put in place by the state government those electors will be recognized if it happens we will see what can be done
the state wouldn t be under foreign occupancy part of the country would when it comes to things like this it s not just hawaii has been invaded it s the united states has been invaded
hawaii is under foreign occupation the usa is the foreign occupier
the constitution asks for the state to send electors to the electoral college and the state can determine how it s likely the us wouldn t recognize an occupier as the state government and a government in exile would send electors instead how those would be chosen is anyone s guess probably not through elections in the occupied territory
honestly if another foreign entity fucks with hawaii again the us might kill us all just to make a point
that would be the last of our problems most likely taking over a us state would cause nuclear armageddon
i would say the states of us are like nato an attack on one would be an attack on all if somehow a foreign force overpowered the initial defense of the strongest military in the world and occupied hawaii on election day it wouldn t stay occupied for very long and the special circumstances would allow to just vote afterward but considering your username and age of your account it calls your motives into question
this scenario sounds like a war thing this would most likely invalidate any kind of vote due to foreign interest swaying the votes
i m sure the election would be postponed and the united states would go to war with whatever foreign presence that is controlling the state in order to liberate it
they would probably suspend said election
yes
if a us state was attacked by foreign power the war would probably go nuclear before it was occupied
ccpisbased let s say hawaiian is under foreign occupation on november hello is this the cia listen i found this reddit post
if hawaii were under foreign occupation it is possible that the federal government would declare a state of emergency and take steps to ensure the safety and security of the people of hawaii it is also possible that alternative arrangements could be made for the people of hawaii to cast their votes such as absentee or mail in voting in terms of the electoral college it is possible that hawaii could be excluded from the college if its votes were not able to be counted due to the occupation however this would ultimately be up to the interpretation of the u s constitution and federal law and would likely be subject to legal challenges and political debate
that poor invading force first you have the rebels who are armed better than most armies then you have the criminal organizations the angsty teens the indignit college students the hackers who already cut comes and the very isolated armies americans are also more likely to be serial killers
see the presidential election of
how does that affect my question
it is but is it any more so than large tracts of the continental us
based take
i didn t say they occupied it on election day just that on election day it was occupied and no one s military stays on top for forever
usa had many election during war time
usa had an election in
don t worry it s just a fedposter
the us dropped hydrogen bombs on the last country that attacked hawaii
because the fact that they attacked only hawaii would be completely irrelevant that s how genius
what difference does it make whether or not it was occupied on election day or was already occupied on election day and you didn t say forever you said
that doesn t really contribute what i say and is a bit out of left field to what i said there have been elections during war time but i don t believe there s ever been a state occupied by another power that was allowed to vote in said elwctions
and congress did not count the electoral votes of louisiana and tennessee because they had only been recently recaptured from the confederate states of america the other states did not send electors for obvious reasons this is probably the only real precedent and what people would look at if this came up
i know i just see things being different nowadays everything is so polarized people would want to see a completely fair election edit you make a good point i could also see there being an election where we don t count the electoral votes from the occupied states it s just hard to discern what path our country would take in this hypothetical situation in this modern world
and the southern states controlled by the confederacy were excluded in the election
more like fedsmoker
still not an answer
technically the election in
the only other instance i can think of that was remotely like this is the election of in which dueling sets of electors from multiple states tried to represent their states and led to one of the worst election crises in us history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_commission_(united_states) legislation was passed in the aftermath that is supposed to clarify what would happen if this were to happen again but the hypothetical here is outlandish enough that i think it s fair to say nothing would be simple if the occupying force sent electors while another group claiming to represent the state sent another set
and the explanation given still applies from the first time you said that to the other comment
my guess is three main parts first in catholicism for the purpose of fasting fish is not considered meat so mentally a lot of people just work with the idea that fish isn t meat second fish are very anatomically different from land animals so someone who might feel sympathy for little chickens and therefore become a vegetarian might not feel the same sympathy for a fish or sea creature and still eat them no problem third someone s people are vegetarian because of some kind of health problem like a red meat allergy or for some other health concern but fish often doesn t have the same health impacts as red meat so some people might not eat meat for health reasons but will eat fish totally fine
it stems from religion meat was considered from the land what was in the sea was not meat
fish meat is practically a vegetable ron swanson i think
you really can t pet them
i once had to convince my mother to not make chicken pot pie for her vegetarian friend she thought it was fine because chicken isn t meat
eating fish is eating a carnivore it s always a carnivore unless you re eating fish that doesn t eat other fish
the reason why some people do not consider fish to be meat is due to different interpretations and definitions of the term meat some people define meat strictly as the flesh of mammals while others include all animal flesh in some religious traditions fish is not considered meat and is allowed to be consumed during times when meat is not permitted
the early catholic church defined fish as not meat so that people could still eat meat on no meat fridays
deleted
yeah the definition of meat is kind of vague some people don t consider poultry to be meat either i guess meat is mammal flesh
a lot of people are pescatarians for religious people and historically they were often called vegetarians some people mostly old people think it s still the case in romance language such as french spanish and italian there s no word for meat the word people typically use to translate meat doesn t include fish so if people speak one of those languages they might not know that their word and the english word meat aren t equivalent
fish is meat unless you are religious
fun fact in the 17th century the catholic church declared beavers to be fish so that colonialists in north america could eat it during lent their justification because it swims
usually it s only during the catholic season of lent some schools will do it for the entire spring i m surprised if a school does this for an entire year
i did this when i was younger i used to get off on the fantasy that i was so attractive and special that the dude was willing to cheat on his partner with me fuelled by a scarcity mindset and competition with other women it made me feel like i was winning somehow the taboo of it being off limits also made it hotter and then i could justify it with a not my monkeys not my circus mindset that i wasn t the one making commitments to his gf wife and it was his problem in retrospect it s awful and i d never do it again but it seems like this thread is lacking honest answers so i wanted fo provide mine
i had a friend who slept with married women and he said they re going to cheat on their husband anyway might as well be with me
idk i had a friends ex come over to hang out hadn t seen each other in a while and we lived together for years i though we really were just going to chill and play video games she had other plans shit happened she came over a few more times she lived with her ex different ex not my friend as they couldn t break the lease things got lightly serious ex calls my cell phone that he snagged out of her phone sobbing and cussing me out not her ex at all i just apologized to him and told her to make a choice she said she couldn t so i said go take care of the person crying over you and get the fuck out i felt like shit for months about this they weren t married i didn t know and it still ate me alive i don t know how people can happily do it different strokes i guess
as a homewrecker they don t fucking tell you they do things like hide shit lie about shit it s almost never the strangers fault it s always the spouses fault
usually the married person is lying about how bad the relationship is to the other man woman or if it s a one night stand type deal they figure that the married person is hot and one time out of town doesn t hurt the marriage if you ve spent however long being told all of the worst imaginable shit about someone s spouse and never hearing anything good eventually you re going to believe that the spouse is a terrible abusive person and by the time you get to that point sleeping with the married person is almost an act of desperation to cling to sanity you have to understand that most people even cheaters don t see themselves as the villain cheating is pretty much universally regarded as a shitty thing to do
it s a moral question different people have different morals the fact that a person is married may matter a great deal to most people and most people wouldn t act on an attraction to a married person to others the fact that a person is married does not matter or matters little i ve never knowingly slept with a married man but i have friends who have and before anyone says i m a shitty person for being friends with someone who sleeps with married people statistically you have friends who do the same they just haven t told you whether male or female they just don t care it s something they give very little thought to usually it s a fwb situation though one of my male friends was hoping she d divorce and be with him she divorced but they re not together thank god generally they take the position that they re not married they aren t breaking their vows the ap affair partner is breaking his her vows what a he does when they re not together isn t their concern they don t compare and aren t trying to convince the other person to love like them more of leave their spouse out of sight out of mind the ap is a grown consenting adult they re not forcing them they have agency and can choose to or not if it wasn t with them it would be with someone else if the marriage mattered to the ap s he wouldn t be sleeping around if it doesn t matter to the person who is in it why should it matter to them they don t care more about your marriage than you do
not everyone places the same value on marriage i ve been in situations where it could have happened but it didn t i m glad furthermore some people act spontaneously and don t think things through some of them are probably the same people that buy something foolish on the spot and later have buyers remorse as someone that used to work in corrections let me just say there are plenty of people in prison for killing the person their spouse cheated on them with so you better pick the right one that you know is only going to cry about it i have a buddy that has a friend that s made almost a lifestyle of this stuff and i ve always wondered how he hasn t had the hell beat out of him yet he s been caught countless times probably has to live looking over his shoulder
i ve done it and i won t go saying i m some sort of saint it s fucked up i know i ve been cheated on before so i know how much it fucks with you that being said i never once thought of the girls involvement in my relationship when i was cheated on it wasn t relevant they didn t cheat on me they didn t break my trust they didn t even know me my partner did
even though i personally feel like my situation is very specific i m sure that a lot of other people who do the things i did feel the same so i ll share when i met him he told me that he was married but that his wife knew what it was he meant she knows that i m a cheater because she met me in a relationship so if she doesn t know she can imagine but at that time i was young and impressionable i took this statement at face value and responded as such either he knew for a fact that i thought she was aware or couldn t have been bothered to wonder why i asked him certain questions but either way our first couple of encounters happened mostly because of plausible deniability then feelings happened by the time i realized that she was unaware i was pretty much in love with him and i was convinced he loved me too i felt like if she gave him all of the love he needed then he wouldn t crave me i felt angry at her for knowing that he wanted more but also making him feel like he would lose his family if he searched for that fulfillment and i resented him for not being willing to question challenge her directly on this i was never raised to think that loving someone is supposed to be shown via denying yourself on their behalf i felt like it was kinda sick tbh and since i cared about him i wanted more for him i also resented that we were in a society that valued monamory over all other forms of love because if polyamorous love was considered equal then he would either have to admit that he didn t care about me truly or that she wasn t right for him of course in this situation he was doing a lot to of manipulation help me think these things but i doubt they are uncommon sentiments even if the cheater isn t manipulative i hope this gives you some insight of the thought processes of these people but i think the overall point is whether the cheating partner is a super villain out to end all marriages one fuck at a time or love of the cheaters life the person who is in the relationship is the only person who must change in order stop the hurt everyone else can only stand around hope they get the benefits
some women like the fact that they re unavailable that they lavish their time their money on them they don t want them to leave their wife they want to be the other women full benefits of a relationship with none of the responsibilities
was young and stupid still living a fairly consequence free life in college and not taking the time to consider the ramifications she was also unhappy and wanted divorce just hadn t yet it wasn t a situation where we were waiting to be together after divorce more just a couple of friends with attraction and it never happened again she ended up getting divorced and remarried i talk to her once in awhile to check in she seems to be much happier now this was almost years ago she has a new husband and kid and i just got married no idea about the original husband i never knew him he messaged me online randomly to tell me he knew and that she was cheating on me too we weren t together and never planned to be but i m guessing he didn t know that lol i didn t correct him thought it might help him feel better i m not trying to excuse anything i did for any reason cheating is wrong she should have separated first i don t have much sympathy for him because he didn t seem like a great person but that doesn t make what we did ok just immature and selfish
i was and selfish and stupid i did it once because he was hot and i wanted to hated myself after and never again would i knowingly do that
i don t engage with these situations when i know upfront but a few times i found out weeks or months into it should i have cut them off at that point probably but seemed moot at that point and it s hard to shake the feeing of it s not my problem when you are already that deep into it and they re clearly the one who made it happen
i ll really answer honestly i have not once cheated on my wife in our ten years of marriage but the thought has been creeping a lot for me lately that s because she is just not interested in sex anymore ever since our son was born her libido just vanished on top of the emergence of several mental health issues that was six years ago and i think we ve probably slept together like two or three times in that duration i have stood by her through everything and she has stood by all my life tasks as well however when we got married i really didn t imagine that one i would need to rely on pornography to take care of what i think is a basic human need i feel ashamed to think about getting into an affair even though it would have no emotional significance for me i just crave some intimacy time with another human i would never divorce my wife because she is a wonderful mother to our son she is also for the most part a good partner again anyone who has lasted years in any marriage understands that reclaiming one s individuality is a kind of necessary chore to ironically keep the relationship strong so the answer to the question is that people grow and they change and certain common understandings go with that as well if i could get away with cheating in order to keep my mental health together i would really consider it at this point even though i m too chicken shit to actually do it but when i get the courage to i m going to ask her if she wouldn t mind if i had a friend with benefits and honestly i think she ll be okay with it so to upgrade my answer a little bit i think it has to be a conversation and doing it behind your partner s back can be justifiable yet unjustifiable at the same time it s a quantum entanglement thing
because i really liked her wasn t particularly fond of her partner i thought he was a bad partner and borderline abusive at times and she wanted to sleep with me kept up the affair for around months during covid he stopped drinking and is a new man i m told and now i very rarely see her i do think that the boredom of covid was motivating factor but it was mostly just my amoral attitude and wanting to get laid
as someone who slept with and later married a man who was married i was friends with a woman who claimed her husband was all the problems in their marriage she told me he had cheated on her throughout their relationship she also admitted she had cheated even cheated first however she insisted it wasn t as bad as what he had done and didn t count i was very much so on her side and considered her a best friend paid thousands for her to go out have fun a baby shower and helping her find resources in the area over time roughly months and basically hours a day i started to see things that were increasingly upsetting she began to just leave her kids at my house and wouldn t answer the phone for hours she would be abusive to them knocking her three year old to the floor and never even looking up she engaged in sexual behaviors around her children drank while pregnant all seriously upsetting things she even admitted to sending nudes to a year old meanwhile i watched her husband going to therapy and literally getting electrical shocks to the head and kissing her ass while she literally spit on him i caught him with a gun in his mouth once after she ripped him a new one because he had cheated on her over two years before honestly i didn t know what to do i considered making an anonymous report but i was afraid her husband was a good person but he was scared and trapped she turned everyone against him i had been going through a very similar thing with my own husband i chose to start distancing myself from her but she made it impossible she would just leave the kids in the car or at home alone and show up randomly when i found out she was running around to the people i introduced her to saying she didn t want me around and talking shit when she would literally show up to my house on her own i guess i just stopped caring as much she had even assaulted him in front of my house at one point one day she kicked her husband out of the house and literally locked him out and i said fuck it stay the night with me and we talked about everything i had seen and what he had gone through and that was that there s a lot more complications and things to the story but this is the basics and truth he later divorced her won full custody and had enough evidence of her abuse that she now has supervised visitation she doesn t exercise we ve been together for years now it wasn t that i didn t feel guilty i hated what we were doing but both of us were lonely and found comfort in each other we helped each other find the courage to leave our abusive situations and have a much happier life some people will still hate on me for it i would do things differently if i could have but i don t regret my husband
taboo hot also i m not cheating on anyone so it s not really my fault they re scummy to each other i d still tip the homie that his wife is a thot
ok so i specifically had a co worker who only went after women who weren t just taken but living with their significant other what makes the whole thing a little spicy was she as a 20something female who was posturing as a lesbian there were men she had been caught by genuinely lesbian partners of hers arranging to meet up to hook up so we were like confused if you re bi just present as bi basically aggressively pursuing other women who were in long term live in relationships with men or were a much older women in one rare instance what made it even weirder was that she went after not just co workers but her supervisors so it was one thing when she attempted to do it to myself and i didn t bend because while i was unhappy in my abusive and hetero relationship with an older guy i wasn t secretly a lesbian or bisexual so she missed her mark with me buuut over the course of like years i d learn she had broken up separate marriages in multiple states and cheated on all of her relationships with her next mark i d run into someone and they d be like listen to this drama in my workplace and it was this girl all over again what blew my mind was hearing about her doing it in entirely other states through total happenchance of mutual people we knew telling me they learned of it it was unnerving and weird and very single white female the film behavior she s honestly mentally ill and displayed severely sociopathic behavior when i personally knew her but then wound up working with other former co workers of hers in our industry over the years and hearing about her next homewrecking efforts she s calculated basic pretty and violent and hearing about just how many situations she deliberately caused before i met her and since really made me realize i was dealing with someone who needs professional evaluation and who i ll see on a true crime documentary some day the more i learned about her upbringing the more i realized that she wasn t acting on attraction she was acting on some very fucked up survival tactics her mom was in prison for some sort of fraud scamming when i met her and realized that she was inserting herself into these relationships that were hetero and with people who were more financially secure than herself basically she wanted the proverbial house and white picket fence they had even if it came in the form of a nice townhouse and suv and went after supervisors managers owners of the businesses she worked for because as someone who job hopped as frequently as she relationship and housing hopped the only way she perceived herself as moving up professionally in the world was to align herself with management in a way that she could either force herself into positions of advantage favoritism or seduce her way into them
to have sex
a metaphor in the spirit of a thought experiment one has a job with a contract disallowing the active seeking of employment with another firm while employed the person finds a want ad that they are drawn to and apply anyway the new company is told during the hiring process they re not allowed to contact current employer as they aren t allowed to job search the new company courts the person a while but ultimately offers the job to another person the old company finds out and fires the person whose fault was this the new company for interviewing a candidate who explicitly stated they weren t supposed to be job searching or the person for applying for a job in breech of contract it s completely clear in this situation that the onus of maintaining the contract is on the party who entered into the contract at the end of the day that s what marriage is too the onus is with the married individuals to remain faithful not any third party it s easy to see that when emotions are removed but of course in an emotional situation you feel how you feel and it s natural to blame the third party because it s psychologically easier than blaming the one you love and as a disclaimer i ve never been party to an affair but i have been the victim to my ex husband s he lied through his teeth to her about our marriage being over etc etc i hated her for years but ultimately realized that it isn t her fault it s his eta i think a lot of people who ve never been cheated on don t realize the sheer amount of lies and deceptions cheaters stoop to in order to succeed a multitude of third parties in cheating situations are told half truths if any truth at all and are victims themselves the cheater will say anything necessary to cheat once they ve decided to do it blanket assuming the third party is the fault instead of putting the expectation of responsibility on the spouse where it belongs isn t going to do anyone any favors
she s separated their breakup was public enough i know no games are getting played and she is in the process of getting a divorce lmao technically i m still sleeping with a married woman
why are we blaming the third party the person in the relationship is the one making the mistakes they made promises to their partner the third partner made no promises to anyone i hate it when people want to take some blame off of the person they love and focus it on the third party
some genuinely don t care some are getting revenge on their ex who did the same to them some are so lonely they ll accept any stranger some girls just wanna have fun
good question i am very strict about this myself as my parents divorced because of my dad s infidelity to my knowledge i have never done this but people do lie i have heard various reasons for sleeping with people in a relationship married ranging from it just happened to feeling an attached person was a better choice for someone who didn t want to get involved i have heard of men and women who are serial monogamists sleeping with their next partner before exiting the previous marriage relationship because they can t countenance being single messy imo
well your main answer is selfishness your boyfriend could have done other things bought only one concert tickets won a trip but went alone as you note he didn t care didn t consider your feelings didn t factor you in cheating is just a part of that and selfish people stay selfish to your exact question i know someone who has cheated and we ve talked about it some people don t hate the life they have but want a different one sort of or they just can t get out of the one they have without big consequences divorce child support custody having to sell their home etc so cheating is straddling part of one and part of another
it seems like the honest answers are getting so much hate here and i get it but since you asked and i think you are trying to find relief i am sorry i ve been on both sides which doesn t make it better at all or justify anything i ve slept with married people because we were both choosing to and i didn t know their partner at all so i guess i had the detachment of guilt i was basically thinking that the person cheating had the responsibility to them would probably never get caught in a one off and it was a completely no strings attached strictly sexual thing for me with lots of alcohol selfish and thinking in the moment only
because it s not my job to maintain your marriage i m looking for sex and so are they we consent another person who is not there not consenting doesn t matter to me
just because there s a goalie doesn t mean you can t still score
my question is why would you help someone cheat without assuming they ll do the same to you
i ll bet that the answer to this question hasn t changed much since b c have you considered investigating the thousand years of literature on this subject
i ve done something similar once before and i percent regret it the man manipulated me at a very vulnerable time in my life and made his partner out to be a villian also he drugged me at one point by the end of it all found out that he had lied and that she actually liked me until she found out the affair i worried more about her once i found out the truth she hates me to this day blocked me on everything but ended up marrying the guy even though i knew he was still cheating on her i own up to what i did but he s also a god awful person
never slept with a married guy but i did sleep with a guy in a long term relationship we worked together and had an absolutely crazy making intense kind of forbidden love situation i was in my early 20s we were so into each other and had so much chemistry it genuinely made me lose my mind how much i felt the vibes between us but to then remember that he was in a relationship with someone else i dunno i guess where i landed with it was that it was his relationship and his choice to make whether he cheated not my responsibility to choose for him i kind of thought it was possible we would end up together i guess mostly though it was because i was really young and didn t have the maturity to be able to understand that the situation was bad for me
you can read through the comments here to try to understand why people do this but andy samberg summarized it best in words doesn t matter had sex
when i was married my ex husband cheated on me and the woman flat out bragged to me about it she knew he was married and had a young child she sent me a message on facebook and said it s not my marriage and it s not my kid i can do what i want with whoever i want and i was in your house today while you were at work she went as far as to say she liked my daughter s pink snow boots to act as if she had met her my daughter had purple snow boots that year people are disgusting
there is a personality trait called impulse control some people lack it
i was that guy when i was younger she wasn t married but she was dating a guy and they eventually got married it was so long i don t remember if they were engaged at the time or just dating i feel awful about it i m not sure i ll ever be able to forgive myself for it ultimately my reasoning was simply that i didn t care i was a selfish pos and thought my wants were more important than anyone else s obviously she deserves more of the blame because she was betraying someone who she claimed to love but i still shouldn t have done it i also had some level of hope that she d leave him for me and for some reason the thought that she d eventually do the same to me never crossed my mind end of the day the reason was because i was selfish and didn t care about anyone else
there isn t going to be any single answer to a question as complex as this
look i was in the middle of getting divorced and a married ex gf wandered back into my life thanks facebook and one thing led to another i m not saying i m proud of it but i m not saying i regret it
marriage is over at the point you are willing to step out and probably has been for a while
because i simply care about myself more than this person i didn t know fucked up sure again do i care no
his wife left him and moved in with her ex on the other side of the country months later she calls and says she s pregnant with his kid and wants to come back he felt he had to do the right thing so we broke it off she didn t see it as him doing his own thing because they were separated instead she made it out that he was cheating and i was a terrible person for being with a married man not that it matters but she ended up leaving again after the baby was born she left the baby behind and he raised it in his own a few years later he learns the baby was never his
it s all context lady i spent time with had a crazy jealous controlling husband that cheated on her all the time i didn t feel bad at all and she left get husband soon after
she is technically still married they re separated but divorce costs too much for them he had an affair he doesn t want a divorce because he thinks they can work it out she wants him out of the picture for good zero contact but they have a kid together she s trying to decide the best for her kid as far as parenting goes divorce will come but slowly i m just insanely attracted to her she s got her flaws but she s just the most absolutely wonderful person i ve ever met she makes me want to be a better man
told me she was divorced i found out later that she wasn t
why because what they want especially in the moment is more important than anything else anything else
from what i can tell some of the perks are you can pick and chose what part of the relationship you provide the so of the cheater is expected to provide for the cheater s needs so there s less obligation on you validation you re special this person could go to their so but they just can t pass up the opportunity to go to you instead you fulfill their need in a way their partner just can t and this is someone who already has the seal of approval so the validation feels extra special since it s coming from someone other people find desirable you re helping their partner just isn t doing their job you re helping this poor person out and if you didn t someone else would anyways so there s no reason to encourage the cheater to find a different solution the attraction must be powerful if you re enticing enough to make the person stray you must be soul mates forbidden love is more exciting disillusionment with love all you know is divorce and bad relationships the fracture of a relationship is inevitable you re just helping nature take its course if happy relationships could be a thing then why did your parents have to get divorced
from a selfish perspective when in the prowl if you sleep with someone who is already taken they won t follow you home
i was sad and needed therapy i liked knowing that there was no guessing what the relationship was with a married person it was only sex and it meant i didn t have to get hurt
i feel like this could be such an educational thread but there are too many people who have been victims of infidelity that are using this as like an opportunity to jump on and criticize ppl who are giving genuine answers releasing all of their hate for cheaters on random people giving their stories even though that s what op asked for
i did that back when i dated somehow a lot of married women young old were just separated at the moment looking for a bed to ride around in and somehow after a few weeks of fun doing so which was about all the attention span i had each of their marriages just sort of magicked themselves right back together again like it never happened at some point i started to be able to identify when i was just someones backdoor man but at that point the damage had been done i realized women s relationships don t actually mean what we idiot guys grew up thinking they meant the marriage is only one kind of relationship providing one set of needs but people want their cake and to eat it too they want the stable guy with the good income and the nice house but they also want excitement and to feel desired and the thrill of sneaking around a little not necessarily long term but just for a while to add some spice to their sense of being underappreciated maybe not enough to go looking for it but if you re a guy available and you re making it very easy for them nearly everyone will cheat on their spouse i don t even know if i was ever rejected even once newlyweds one girl who literally got married in the middle of our month long affair i got to meet her husband he had no idea the guy who he just handed his wife s forgotten lunch to has been fucking her every way possible thinking he was out of the picture and i was finally in love at that point i realized that if someone is married her marriage is her business and since i was not in it it wasn t my business i was just a voice operated dildo might as well have been made of plastic bc i didn t matter if she wants to risk or end her marriage or just get some love on the side the decision is hers i ve got love to spare have nothing to say about the details of her past entanglements even if they re current marriage apparently isn t worth the paper it s written on to most people as evidenced by the majority of them ending in divorce anyway and maybe that s for the best considering it s just a leftover medieval rite of human bondage that treats women as property since they re only a half step up from children unable to provide for themselves need a man to tell them what s best for them i mean that s literally the tradition still in the script beyond that if the person you re with is lying to you and going behind your back they re just not as interested in your marriage as you are
i ve wondered about why i ve done it and this is what i came up with the married men i ve hooked up with are closeted and oftentimes living a double life of sorts on one hand i m being a part of betraying someone s commitment to someone else on the other i m a part of someone s exploration of their sexuality moments where they can be their real selves and give these guys a chance to be in a role they secretly want there has only been one or two times i knew going in the guy was married usually i don t find out until afterwards i think there s a different standard because for so long many gay men were in the closet and married to a women while having a special friend on the side it s morally wrong but more culturally acceptable than when straight people cheat i live in the south where it can be extremely unsafe to come out and it can ruin someone s future for coming out it s a no win situation for these guys
cause people are weird one of my friends didn t want me until she seen that i was interested in someone else
i was dating the man before he met his spouse got married we were long distance he met his future spouse while we were dating and they proceeded to get married after a year while he continued to date me on and off i had incredibly low self esteem at the time and yep continued to date him even when i suspected he may have started dating someone else long distance made it a little easier for him to get away with it all i guess they eloped he didn t tell me they got married i found out he got married when he was tagged in a facebook picture he wasn t a big social media user so nothing else posted was suspicious once i was aware he got married i backed off initially but he would come back around on off saying he was separating from his wife that was a lie we never lived in the same state so it made it easier to believe him i also think i had a weird i was here first sort of feeling about it it was a messed up situation but i eventually got myself out of it haven t spoken to him in a very long time
i was in love and not emotionally self aware mature enough to notice that i was attracted to unavailable people because they were unavailable eta it s an emotional survival mechanism if you re in love with someone who you deep down know is unavailable if they reject you you don t have to take it personally it s safer than having a real committed love plus the guy was very charming and for some time made me believe he was unhappy with his wife anyways and might leave her for me i didn t do it to get him to leave his wife but again at that point i was deeply madly in love and felt unable to say no to my desires the years after when i was not over him but also not in love anymore i said no every time he asked because i had stronger self worth and was more able to stand by my own principles
i m not the problem in that marriage and i am in no way obligated to keep your relationship in tact and there are a lot of unanswered questions here why are they cheating what is unfulfilling about their relationship now am i their excuse to end it
it s definitely the cheating partner s fault if the other person would feel so welcome sleeping with the cheating partner then it would be the cheating partner s fault because if not the other one would never feel to do so the other person doesn t have the responsibility to not do so they are not committed they are basically free you people need to chill about blaming the third party nobody is welcome if the others keep themselves close and committed victims know you re worth it and always be willing to walk away and also check yourself on a relationship sometimes you think like the only thing that can ruin the relationship is cheating without you even knowing that neglecting your partner s needs or being careless about emotions and disrespecting the boundaries and not validating or appreciating your partner would be also enough reason of the broken marriage check yourself before pointing out the other and if you re responsible and loving in the relationship then clearly be thankful and smart to walk away you re clearly too precious to be with your cheating partner not being able to grow together in a relationship would lead to each one of you where you meet your relationship with yourself marriage is not just about being in love and loving marriage is about respect willingness compromising serving and most of all work be very careful about choosing the person that you are willing to struggle with because life will always clap lessons love you beautiful people
i ll take my downvotes because cheaters are shit people and people who help people cheat are shit people it boils down to selfishness nobody matters but me attitudes
because we love each other
just trying to get my dong wet bro
because you usually don t think straight when you horny
i m not going to intentionally seduce a married person but at the end of the day their commitment is their business not mine situations can be complex it s not my business to uphold their morals and commitments for them
we all have different moral compasses surely a lot of people focus on themselves when making choices and don t consider others
lots of self esteem issues as well single people don t want them bad people all around
its crazy how people contrude this its not a hard question i did it because i thought i loved them and i would get them i didnt care as much about the bad or harm i was doing to their marriage the one i was after was talking to me i considered her consent the other male i was ignoring it i thought i had something special that was being disregarded i was caring about their feelings i even thought i loved them to the point i wanted a future with family etc etc but the moment i had those feelings it dawned on me she was never going to leave him i found out years later apart of it was my religous background i didnt follow it and i left just kinda went silent i sent him a message years later how wrong i was i apologized i co fessed everything to get it off my concience she messed me years later how pissed she was but she felt bad too she had been thinking about it and they divorced i wanted to pursue her and never did it was a mangled mess of feelings offenses whatever and that was intimate emotional cheating sexting imagry never had sex we met teice and talked we were peers as kids your feelings can lead you to do some dumb illogical shit
because i was head over heels for him that was years ago and we re still together he told his wife days after we met and finalised the divorce within a year we actually didn t sleep together until months after meeting so it wasn t for the sex
obligatory speaking hypothetically no happy marriage ever ended in cheating cheaters gonna cheat one way or another that ship is going down might as well go down on me too again speaking hypothetically
i slept with married women as they wanted to have sex with me and i was single i had no relationship concerns so was happy to
i had a thing with a married woman didnt know the husband all she did was bitch about him and she had some reasoning for not leaving i didnt care as far as i was concerned it was nice to have a fwb that wasn t going to try to get serious with me making me the bad guy when the feeling wasnt mutual
i ve been party to numerous affairs with different married women woman here btw i ll preface by saying that none of my reasons are right justified or worthy of sympathy they re just why i did it it made me feel wanted in a way that nothing else did i ve never seen myself as lovable childhood abuse and neglect despite a lifetime of loving relationships with available women it wasn t enough to just have a person that loved me i wanted someone who would do something as serious as risk losing their family for me that s what my mother did both parents cheated but she was did it all throughout our childhood whereas my father did it once and got the woman pregnant tldr i was a head case looking for mommy s love in other married women
i had a roommate that specifically only dated married men i always suspected it was because she was terrified of actual commitment she was able to get attention and sex but didn t need to be emotionally available she didn t want to be anyone s wife
i m down with opp
it s a basic moral thing you find in a wallet on the street no one is around do you pocket it now imagine you re really attracted to someone you know is married they re clearly willing to do it with you just like how the thought of that free is clouding your objective judgement the lust and illicit excitement of sleeping with that person is far more tempting in the moment after all you re not going to get found out right
i asked myself this a lot selfishness self centered sociopathic behavior i only cared if i got caught i couldnt believe i did what i did after i was got before that it was all fun and games thank christ i grew out of it i stepped away from myself and looked at myself from other peoples perspectives
my uncle always slept with married women said it was so he never had to worry about committing as they were already with someone
i did it because i was and horny his relationship was not my responsibility eta i am also not a good person and ok with that
in the words of a friend who used to do this a lot just because there s a goalkeeper doesn t mean i m not supposed to score not a defense just verbatim
cause they re pathetic and selfish please don t take him back
it s not your job to worry about somebody else s relationship if the person your fucking is married or in a relationship or whatever that is up to them to figure out it s doesn t have anything to do with you
slightly different situation here met a guy on an app he was being secretive but i was and never been in any type of relationship plus he had roommates and it made sense we met a few times at his place developed a sort of light relationship he admitted he was in an open relationship with one of the roommates and i was coming over while his boyfriend was at work because they had a don t ask don t tell policy i was being really dumb and just went with it well turns out his boyfriend thought they were monogamous i was already incredibly attached after a few weeks and i got the whole i m trying to break up with him but he won t let me spiel which actually was kinda true i grew to accept the situation for months he did eventually break up with him and we moved in together about months after we first met we lasted about years i learned a lot i m now and that is still the only relationship i ve ever been in except a tiny little friend fling that i thought might go somewhere but didn t to answer your question i think people do it a lot of times with guilt because they form an attachment and try to rationalize it i was introduced to the fact that i had intercepted a monogamous relationship after i had already become attached and thought there was a future i was given promises and all that which like i said actually became true but it was not a good relationship and i had to end it and ending your first ever relationship after years of being together is really rough i will never ever try to be with someone who is cheating ever again
the person who isn t married isn t breaking vows etc it s on the married person
i would never sleep with someone married but i don t see with bad eyes someone who does it unless he is friend with the person being cheated it was not them who broke the vows they are just having sex
isnt their relationship their responsibility
it s hot
hooked up once with someone that i knew was in a relationship not married never met his partner so that probably eased the guilt and was very young and dumb myself wouldn t dream of doing it again it was almost a decade ago but i m sure it had something to do with my low self esteem and feeling special because i was receiving attention from someone that other people the girlfriend had interest in i just remember not really caring or considering the consequences as a young adult it felt cool to break the rules growing older helps i don t generally believe it s the third party s job to prevent cheating but now i take several steps back if someone in a relationship even hints at being flirty to avoid crossing any lines
not me but i know a few i think loneliness was the trigger
it s not a situation with a single answer
i had a friend who had an affair with a married man she blamed the wife saying he wouldn t be with her if his wife was a good one this was about years ago we are still friends and she is full of remorse she was a young selfish asshole so was i i just didn t sleep with people who weren t available
i m going to assume it s because it isn t their relationship that s on the line they shouldn t have to worry about what s happening between the other parties because at the end of the day sex is a transaction and both parties are consenting to have sex because of sexual or physical attraction so in that moment it isn t about any outside prospects it s just pleasing or they just don t care if it s not their responsibility to honor the relationship of partners if said partner doesn t respect it themselves i m not a cheater i do think it s something i couldn t do but those are my conclusions
he promised her she promised him i didn t promise anything
it feels like none of the people this question was aimed at want to answer this speaking as another in the category of it s complicated but my so went ahead and started a relationship with someone else because we had differing opinions about our relationship status to her it wasn t cheating and to him it was her choice we were on friendly terms already and so we discussed it at length and his position was very plainly that it was my so s choice entirely and he took no moral responsibility for it at all now in fairness to both of them my so told me what was going on and how she was approaching it but as we were still living together it hit me like a sack of bricks the other guy wanted her badly and had been courting her for years he didn t care that she was so flippant with our relationship because he wanted her now he had her and that was that were i in the other position i have to say i d likely think the same i kind of was once her last boyfriend a lying manipulative emotionally abusive piece of garbage was someone that i spoke to on the regular and helped him work through the end of their relationship when i ended up with her instead the absurdity of the situation was not lost on me and when the situation came around again i couldn t help feeling like the middle link in a deranged chain but crucially i never made a move until i knew she was no longer in a relationship hard stop no complications i don t want to be the kind of person that causes someone else mental anguish even as an invited 3rd party i may not have a contracted obligation but i am still causing preventable harm i don t enjoy sex or people enough to violate my principles in that way
it is one of a handful of things i have done in my life that i can never atone for and in fact if and when i get cheated on in the future i know i will deserve it i would not recommend it
i don t understand it either around here they call those people home wreckers someone i know admitted she used to be the other woman more than once in her past and got mad that i called that being a home wrecker she said i never cheated on anyone and it takes two to tango i said yes and yes neither of those things changes the fact that the person is a home wrecker i m convinced she thinks if it s not her cheating then it s somehow ok she was also ok with that lifestyle as well as having fucked more guys than she can count but if any guy she s with watches porn she considers that cheating so basically some people do a lot of mental gymnastics to justify what they do
i tried to convince myself not to the fact they were married was not a strong enough reason to stop me the fact they had kids was not a strong enough reason to stop me ultimately i think i was picking up an undercurrent of unhappiness so i decided that i wasn t ruining anything obviously unfaithfulness will cause lots and lots of pain and deep hurt and sadness i do not recommend
i ve never done it but in my opinion being faithful is the job of the people who are married if a husband hooks up with someone who isn t married the husband cheated not his hookup
deleted
because he s going to be king someday
i had a friend who was sleeping with married women at the same time and the reasons were is hot is fit and the other pays for my groceries
had a coworker who was going out with my other coworkers whom was married with a kid she knew he was with someone she didn t care she eventually got pregnant he continued with his married life now has kids with his wife and a side child who his wife knows nothing about
i didn t care i was single so i wasn t cheating on anyone and i felt like it was my sex partner s responsibility to take care of their relationship in other words i didn t know their husband wife i had never seen them i didn t know the dynamic of their relationship i didn t know whether and to what extend the husband wife was ok with their significant other having sex with someone else above all though i felt it was my sex partner s decision what they should and should not do
i did it because i found them attractive what they do is on them as long as i m left out of it which is why i won t ever have sex with someone for longer than a couple of months longer is risky
getting away from your parents for the day making friends getting some different povs
the social interaction may be a bigger deal than you imagine learning to get along with colleagues with different values is a practiced skill also just not sharing the common school experience will always set you apart when the talk turns to school days
school helps you learn how to interact with different types of people and people with different points of view however you can still get that if you are involved in sports or other activities that let you spend time with people who are not your family
i m a teacher and hugely support school as the best place to learn for most kids but most is not all you are probably missing some elements of school but you re also gaining other things that may be particularly valuable for you here s what i think school generally does better than homeschooling your mileage may vary learning to adapt to a variety of authority figures and expectations opportunities to build relationships with peers and adults academic performance highly variable a curious and motivated student can thrive while homeschooled or a student whose parents are really on the ball about supervising schoolwork but mostly students who are homeschooled learn less specialized opportunities my school district has coding classes robotics video production cna courses and other professional certifications six languages up to level and dozens of other classes those are possible to get from home just hard i m not going to tell you that you re wrong for thinking homeschooling is right for you it absolutely could be i do think it s in your best interest to get into at least two activities jobs groups where you are regularly interacting in person with non family
this will depend on how you are homeschooled do you get to spend a lot of time with other kids your age
i was homeschooled from kindergarden through highschool only going to public school for first hour through high school my experience was that i didn t miss very much at all kids at school were mostly dicking around and being stupid there is a social element you would gain by spending time with a bunch of other people your age but it cuts both ways they re not always great to hang out with if you have friends and regular social interaction through other avenues such as neighborhood friends or church activities you ve probably got all the social connection you need to be well adjusted as long as your neighborhood church etc isn t some cult that tries to restrict people and make sure you only meet cult members your mileage may vary
not really social interaction is gonna be a big answer here but you re really not missing much good
my daughter was always homeschooled until 9th grade she wanted to try real high school she hates it she says all the kids are superficial and mean she likes her teachers but not the students she has barely made any friends and the food is terrible she also hates how early she has to get up and how much time she spends in school next year she is being homeschooled again i really wish she liked school but she has not enjoyed her experience
you re missing out on the exchange of ideas even if you are reading media from multiple sources you aren t discussing the articles with different people who have slightly different takes on the issue and then other people in another class with other takes on some other issue even something as innocuous as a movie your pool of perspectives is much smaller than a student who came through the public schools i hope you spend a lot of time listening to other people in groups when you get the chance
your personal autonomy your ability to understand complex geopolitical realities and empathy for people outside your in group are probably seriously lacking
bullying extracurriculars school shootings pretty much sums it up i was homeschooled for most of elementary school and it was pretty difficult to adjust socially when i switched but it appears to have been mostly a me problem as all my siblings adjusted fine
in the us shit you better off missing stuff it s dangerous out here school shootings is a major concern
sport socialization and bad bosses bad teachers are like bad bosses and it helps to be able to spot them quickly
the social aspect of public school is one thing that homeschooling may miss out on including opportunities to make friends and participate in extracurricular activities public schools may also offer a more structured curriculum and a wider range of courses as well as access to resources such as libraries labs and technology
indoctrination
my cousins were all homeschooled they re all awkward as fuck and can t understand anyone who doesn t see the world like they do i dunno if it s the homeschooling or the autism is strong with them but this guy might have a point
but mostly students who are homeschooled learn less do you mean they re undereducated on topics or do you mean that there s stuff they haven t even learned about or both
i do spend time with some on online in real life not so much after covid i quit getting out and became a but more kept to myself and i m not allowed to go anywhere alone because my mom doesn t trust me for stuff over the years and i m also in a very sketchy town as in there s been drive bys right next to my house in under a year sketchy my mom is wanting to go to a meetup or a group or something and really wants me to get some more friends though i m not really interested most of the time so i think i am missing out a bit on real life friends though i think this is more a me not branching out issue than a homeschooling issue
out of curiosity why can t you pull her out if she really doesn t like it what s preventing you from home schooling her again now instead of making her finish the year first
actually that s really similar for me in the fact that all if not most of the kids where assholes i just tried to keep to myself but it was hard when someone would throw your backpack full of textbooks in your face unprovoked that and adhd makes it impossible to concentrate when everyone is talking which is why i prefer online school
i ve listened to a lot of other people s takes on things and i do listen to what other people say about them and i have talked to people before and we have exchanged our own opinions i ve done this many times i spend a lot of time learning and i get to hear about plenty of different ideals depending on what it is at least
both homeschooling tends to be self paced or parent paced and that pace is usually slower than what would be done in a traditional school they also sometimes get a skewed curriculum with topics like evolution left out there are quite a few claims out there about homeschoolers getting higher test scores and college gpas but those are skewed because homeschooled kids are less likely to go to college in general and only around take the sat act in one of the few studies https://web.archive.org/web/20191124153433/http://www.tpcs.org:80/about-us/cardus-cardus_education_survey_phase_i_report.pdf) that used a random sample homeschooled students scored lower and were less likely to receive a college degree it s not a huge difference though and not everybody wants to or needs to go to college it s very possible that none of this applies to you and you re getting an excellent education it s probably a good idea for you to take a standardized test in the next year or two to make sure and consider taking a community college course to test the waters
so i m going to be very honest here as annoying as it can be to socialize sometimes often people who have been homeschooled the way you have struggle a lot when they have to get jobs as young adults because they don t have the experience of working with lots of different people the way public school people do i get safety concerns and that you may have eroded your family s trust in you but one of the major benefits of public school is that you are prepared for life as an adult where you are going to have to interact with many different people and those social skills are things that aren t learning right now chatting with folks online is cool but it s not teaching you the same skills that you will need if you are hoping to get a job when you get older
if you want to meet some friends go to a local sport place i met a lot of guys through random skateparks and still have those friends years later it really opens your eyes on others lives and the real world
i told her she had to do the whole year even if she didn t like it i don t want her to quit something just because she doesn t like it i also thought it would get better but the year is almost over
i m sure you have you are just several hundred to several thousand people short of the numbers you d be exposed to in public schools this will take some time to catch up on there will be some aspects of cultural literacy you ll gave a gap in or some facets of common experiences you ll have missed it s not an insurmountable deficit but it will exist for a while you ll figure it out though as you talk to co workers and socialize with peers in your early adulthood you ll have a few missteps and you ll learn it s just a bit later than students in public schools learned
they don t have the experience of working with lots of different people the way public school people do could you elaborate i m not the best at making friends but i ve never had difficulty talking to people especially strangers i am able to hold up a conversation and understand social cues and how someone might feel that part s never really been a struggle for me and i actually do quite enjoy talking to people i could definitely work with co workers i think i d only really have problems with like crowds of people but i don t think interacting with people at a job would be too difficult if at all for me though perhaps there s stuff i don t know about which is why i m asking specifically what social skills are needed specifically edit typos and a word
have you had to do a group project with other people before that s a specific type of skill that is hard to find outside of public school
like a school project not really but i have worked with people before on projects i did try to create a team of game developers when i was and got some people sadly didn t work out it s pretty hard for a year old with no funding and no idea how to manage a team to make it work lol i can definitely work together with people on things in fact i was helping a friend with some games he was making building some stuff for the map s i can definitely work with other people assuming they do their part too at least but yes i have done some group projects most smaller though edit there were other people working on the games besides me and my friend though they weren t too active working on them
a possible difference from those spontaneous group projects is that everyone is motivated and if they disagree on how to proceed with something they can just separate and each do their own stuff school projects like work projects might include people who don t carry their weight or who insist on doing things a different way but it s not like you can do both basically in a school setting you have to deal with more challenging people whether that prepares you to deal with them or just makes you fed up with them is another story

with the advent of social media we re now comparing ourselves to people other than those around us much more we rarely live up to the standards of what we see victimization is validation that that s not our fault
people love attention
because we ve had a pendulum swing from one extreme to another as a society it used to be suck it up the world doesn t care how you feel deal with it now it s words are violence i m offended and how dare you not care about it edit typos
because it s easier to be lazy pretend your the victim and ignore personal responsibility if a person is solely a product of their environment then they re not responsible for committing crimes or being a failure bring on the downvotes because facts don t care about feelings
if i say it the reddit community won t be too happy
it s a bit of a cliche but we re in the good times create weak people phase of this cycle hard times create strong people strong people create good times good times create weak people weak people create hard times
some of it is that minority groups who have traditionally been told to deal with oppression and punished for speaking out have started being more open about talking about oppression and discrimination they face however some of that is that you have people inspired by that to also think of themselves as being the victims of persecution when other people might say that they re exaggerating
you re not going to get a good answer on reddit
is the victim mentality in the room with us right now
the rise of social media and increased awareness of social justice issues may contribute to a culture of victimization people may feel pressure to present themselves as victims to gain sympathy or support trauma and mental health issues may also lead to a victim mentality
because some people are realizing they have been victimized
because people have been truly victimized which leaves the pain of a victim mentality when you re stuck in that mentality it s extremely gratifying to have that mentality validated which makes it harder to let go this has been further exacerbated by political rhetoric being used to directly appeal to victim mentalities we re also socialized by collectivism to believe that being a victim makes you powerful or special whenever an african american gets killed by a white cop people say rest in power that s how ingrained in our culture that being a victim makes you special we literally believe it gives the dead power
because people on the internet learned a new phrase and immediately commenced using it incorrectly
you simping for the snowflakes having to edit to make them happy
nope but i said it anyway because i don t care
lol nah just wanted to fix my spelling
theoretically yes
well think of it this way the power of your punch comes from the speed of your first and its rapid deceleration on the thing you are hitting let s assume you are punching something static like a punching bag so for a really powerful punch your fist needs to arrive at the impact point as fast as it can you can make this happen in many ways flex your arm whirl around cartwheel whatever floats your boat that said you should also ensure that as much of your body s energy is used for accelerating your fist and not wasted on any extra movement that isnt contributing to making your fist go faster in that vein a gymnastic style cartwheel probably isn t the most efficient thing to do
it is theoretically possible to increase the power of a right hand punch by incorporating a cartwheel into the motion but it would require significant practice and coordination to execute safely and effectively
honestly i was thinking about a cartwheel specifically because a cartwheel is essentially spinning your whole body right when you re at the handstand of the cartwheel your legs are at the top and they are heavy limbs so the motion from a handstand to standing position must have the highest momentum in a cartwheel if i do a punch along with the momentum of my spin it should be pretty strong right so originally i was thinking if this cartwheel punch could potentially be stronger than the punches that people do on those punching machines maybe even on par with a running punch
the camera is on a long pole the scene of the fly through ends when the camera has gone aa far as it could it s in the dvd commentary
it looks like it was mounted on a long boom and actually did exactly what you described you can see the rear window break so it was probably some kind of stunt glass the front windshield appears to be empty but it could be the same deal
the scene you re referring to in evil dead ii is known as the reverse zoom shot which was achieved by placing the camera on a wooden board and moving it through the car with the help of various rigs and supports the shot was a technical feat at the time and has since become a classic example of innovative cinematography the shot is also used in the movie to establish the interior and exterior of the car and to disorient the viewer which adds to the overall surreal and nightmarish atmosphere of the film
no
it s payment generally given for use of money if i take a loan i pay back the loan plus interest so a 10k loan becomes sah 12k in payments i am paying the bank for my use of their money to make a purchase or savings interest money in the bank depending on the account terms will generate interest because depositing at the bank gives them use of your money and they ll cut you a slice of the pie for that
extra money paid due to borrowing the money
let s say you borrow dollars from someone with a yearly interest after year of you haven t paid them back at all then you owe them dollars plus more dollars x bringing the total amount you owe them to it is how people banks that loan out money make money from doing it also generally speaking they add the interest once every month instead of once a year
you get charged for borrowing money so you pay back extra than what you borrowed the difference between the two numbers is interest
if you have a sitting around you could invest it or loan it to someone else if you invest it you might earn a return on the investment say or you might lose all your money if you loan the money you need to be compensated for the money you aren t earning by investing it so the borrower pays interest essentially paying you back for the lost investment income you aren t able to receive while they are borrowing your money
think of it as a price for lending out money let s say you ask me to borrow and i said you have a year to pay me back but i expect you to pay me that money back plus interest that means i m charging you i m not letting you borrow money from me for free so next year when you do pay me back you pay me
it s interesting to get interest its less interesting to pay interest basically a tax on money owed or borrowed
is this why when i load my digital pre paid debit card it says that they ll keep a small amount like i load the card with but then my account is missing is the the interest the bank took
so if you borrow you have to pay back and could you explain why is interest a thing if it s not too much trouble
why on money owned shouldn t your money be your money
no that s not interest that sounds more like a service charge you re paying the card company to use the card
yes that would be an example of interest interest is a thing because people can use money to make money if they borrow money they can invest it in such a way that will give them more back the interest is there so that the lender of the money can have a guaranteed profit with less risk than investing the money themselves
i ll give you an example i have a checking account and the more money i have in there the more they give me in interest basically they give me money for using my money whenever they want but you still have all of your money available to you
interest works both ways you can earn money on interest by lending your money to banks this is called investing if you are borrowing money then you have to pay the lender interest back
hmm so interest is a thing only for loans and investments
so it s a similar concept if i give you money you give me extra money cause i need to stay in business with interest there is typically a term being a time period associated with it your original amount of money is the principle the extra the bank gets kind of like a service fee but paid every month is interest so if you pay it off faster then you pay less overall because you end up paying less interest some contracts will give penalties if you pay it off too fast but that s unnecessary details at this point
some contracts will give penalties if you pay it off too fast i wanna say something bad but my post will be removed for rant
geographically it straddles both politically it s generally considered european because the vast majority of the population lives over in the west on the european side that s also the political epicenter of the country
yes
both russia is the largest country in the world and much of their land is in asia however most of the population lives in a small region on the very west side which is considered part of europe and the people there are culturally considered european
geographically it s in both politically it s in europe culturally it s on it s own
generally the ural mountain range is considered a divider between europe and asia it runs through russia
russian here it s both or neither depends on who you ask and what aspect do you mean geographically it s both i mean just look at the map most of its territory is in asia but most of the population is concentrated in the european part culturally i d say russia is it s own thing but europe adjacent obviously cultural ties with europe are much more close and profound than with any other part of the world however many russians don t consider themselves european and many europeans would agree
europe and asia are both part of russia putin probably
both
both but politically russia is considered a european country therefore they are or were due to war in european events like euro football championship european qualifiers of world cup and eurovision
culturally definitely european geographically both and most populance live in the part that is europe i wanna note that by culturally i mean like russian russains there are cultures within russia that are clearly asian
i asked a russian guy once and he said i m russian so it s russian
both culturally and ethnically mostly european significant mountain ranges block it from most of the rest of asia and european russia essentially conquered and depopulated the rest of modern russia in the late middle ages
from a young age i have failed to see the distinction between europe and asia
technically it s in both but since most of the population and the government is situated in the western non siberian part of the country in political and social contexts it s usually considered part of europe more than part of asia
yes most of the people are in europe and most of the land is in asia
it s both if you re curious the ural mountains are considered the border between europe and asia
eurasia https://www.britannica.com/place/eurasia)
aren t russians kinda descended from scandinavian peoples so they re kinda that too lol
russia straddles the accepted europe asia dividing boundary which is the ural mountains so both
some part of russia is geographically in europe but most isn t the geographical borders between europe and asia is the bosporus strait in turkey and the ural mountains in russia
turkey and russia are countries that straddle both continents
geologically they are one continent and considering continents are defined differently all around the world in parts of south america they are taught that north and south america are one continent which makes no sense to me you re going to get a different answer based on who you ask
depends which part
euroasia
both and neither but at the end of the day it does not matter at all europe and asia are just concepts
russia is actually cut in half by the europe asia line wherever it is lmao
both europe and asia being separate continents is dumb imo
yes
both
i thought the balkan regions were considered their own area both culturally and geographically
it s the only country to be in two continents
asia because it will piss putin off that i said asia
both
da
russia without siberia is in europe siberia is in asia i believe the continental border is a mountain range i don t remember if it s the urals or the caucasus
depends on which side of the ural mountains you re standing on
it s the ultimate transcontinental country in that it s the largest country on both continents by far
it s both eurasia they have military in the pacific arctic and atlantic oceans
russia is eurasia it is on both continents freaking time zones
this
just say both it s not funny anymore
i would not say that the european part of russia is a small region it is just of the total with of the population but that is larger than every other country in europe
culturally it s on it s own not really every country has its unique cultural elements and unique history so no two places are ever going to be culturally identical but to say that slavic russians have nothing in common culturally with slavs in serbia ukraine bulgaria amongst others isn t true arguably russia s political isolation right now is far bigger than culturally where they are pretty similar to other orthodox ex socialist european countries the idea of russia and russians as some mystical exotic enigma and nothing like us civilised europeans is a relic of the cold war additionally there s big cultural differences within russia itself between tatars siberians slavs chechens and many others culturally speaking russia isn t one homogenous people
i mean azerbaijan kazakhstan and israel are in the european football federation and australia takes part in eurovision so the rules of entry are bendable but for the most part yes
there probably was some inter marriage and migration of scandinavians into rus but the majority of russians are descended from the balto slavic tribes that were already living there when the vikings set up their confederation so in general they re slavic not scandinavian there are also millions of people from turkic persian mongolic chechen siberian and hundreds of other native ethnic groups within russia not just slavic russians
not entirely the first lord was invited to rule from scandinvia and there were conquests coming from these nordic territories i guess they did mix with the locals back then but it happened like what over years ago im afraid that s irrelevant
and kazakhstan and arguably armenia and azerbaijan
i know some people who even consider central america it s own continent pretty sure there just idiots though as they are american and we are not taught that
russia is not part of the balkans
no there are like and that s only counting the ones that are continuously in continents so no islands and all
it won t he ll never learn you existed
no u
kazakhstan and azerbaijan also count as politically european due to eastern border definition meanwhile israel is a special case if they don t show up in european events they have to go to asia where half the continent wants to kill them
cool i love this stuff history is great
history and ethnic nationality are never irrelevant in europe given that kyivan rus state years ago is one of putin s justifications for invading ukraine it matters
it s interesting to say the least whether or not you find it relevant
i remember one teacher in elementary school tried to sell that every other teacher i had taught the two separate continents
where there you go i just don t know my geography that well period
his agents are everywhere on the internet
modern smoke detector systems are linked in some way so that if one goes off they all go off doesn t do you any good in a big house if the living room lights up and you don t hear the detector until ten minutes later as to why they went off it s possible one of them is getting dusty or dirty inside which could cause a false detection
they want to be tested or battery needs to be replaced this literally happened to me last night
could be carbon monoxide which you would notice but the sensor would assuming they are also carbon monoxide detectors that s probably not what happened since it hasn t continued it was just a thought
did they all stop at the same time or did you have to reset them individually
high power gamma burst from space
one or more could have a bad battery even though the connected systems typically rin through the a c wiring they usually have a battery for backup and if a battery goes bad they go off
assuming they are also carbon monoxide detectors they are not afaik started living here recently
stopped at the same time on their own
i asked him about it and he said he doesn t feel emasculated end of story
you are doing great if your boyfriend likes what you are doing don t stop doing it just because it doesn t conform with the fragile masculinity of a random bystander your relationship only belongs to you both communicate about what you like and then do exactly that no one else s opinion is relevant
who cares your boyfriend doesn t seem to do you want him to be more masculine do you think you or him were happier if you two put on a show for others to make him appear more masculine than he yearns to be
you already know the answer to this
not necessarily depends on how your boyfriend feels about it really and since you asked him you have your answer if it s still bugging you you may want to consider doing things like asking him what kinds of gifts he prefers or where he d like to go on dates since your boyfriend said he likes the flowers and the spa dates don t stop those but you may want to add some more ideas to your repertoire and finally ignore his friend because he doesn t know your boyfriend nearly as well as he thinks he does
emotional connections are different for everyone the important thing here is you have a strong emotional connection with your partner how you get that connection isn t really important my wife has bought me flowers before and all it did was tell me she loves me but i never felt like it emasculated me
sorry the friend has issues and insecurities
i wish more women were like you his friends are dickbags so long as he isn t coasting on your hospitality and reciprocates every so often you don t need a man baby
depending on the man these could be seen as emasculation for example it would be emasculation if he didn t like to get flowers and gifts but you got them anyway and made him display the gifts it would be emasculation if he wanted to go to the football game but you always forced him to go to the spa instead it would also be emasculation if you dragged him to the football game when he wanted to go to the spa it would be emasculation if you used kisses and cuddles to train your boyfriend to behave a certain way
you re not being emasculating your boyfriend s buddy has some weird insecurities though that s a him problem
that dude aint your boyfriend he gets no say its not his place to set standards in other words he can f right off
your bf sounds like a cool guy with stupid friends continue doing what you are doing and ignore his friends like you said yourself your bf loves how you treat him
first off if your bf enjoys doing the things you listed then there is not a problem between you and him only because you asked the question i will offer up the following there is a chance he told you he likes those things because he thinks being truthful about the feminine stuff would mean he gets less sex or is less likely to start getting sex in the future even if he is truthful in his feelings it may cost him some social capital humans are a social species and departing from the social norms does often come with a cost attached whether either of you give a shit about this cost is up to you but being aware of it is probably a good idea
yes and no emasculating is technically the correct term but it s charged and implies something negative it is technically true that you are doing things that men typically do in relationships more than women and that as a result places your boyfriend in a more feminine position but that s not necessarily a bad thing do what works for your relationship
men don t want flowers from girlfriends you watch too much tv or are listening to the wrong people those date ideas are fine every once and a while but how about doing something he enjoys or that is less feminine go to sporting event do some physical activity that doesn t involve him having to take his shirt off in public take him to dave and busters and play video games with him go to a concert i don t know your age but i m guessing you are a teenager or early s
you are and he is what matters is whether you both are aware stay at home dads are well aware and the role reversal wife is comfortable with the lifestyle that s not the situation for you two yet however you re moving in that direction both parties need accept this role reversal sounds like he has and you were blithely unaware you need to decide if traditional role reversal is for you my study buddy from law school married an outdoorsman who cooks and cleans not a full reversal but nontraditional the situation works if both persons know the consequences people comment like the recent event you must decide he has if the comments pose a problem if not you can be happy in the dual approved role reversal couple
this is an interesting case the friend has certain expectations of how a man should be initially my thought was but isn t the whole idea of conforming to the norm solely to attract a partner with fear of being different making you not attractive so what s the problem is he concerned that he s not going to be able to attract a partner by spending time with someone who he considers emasculated initially that felt silly but maybe it s true because there s no reason why you should change for your partner should you change for his friend absolutely not should he change based on my experiences yes but who knows what he thinks maybe if you find him a partner then he ll get over his own insecurities or maybe he just has some deeply entrenched ideas that he will not change it s all a question of his conception of life that s what we re really talking about after all this friend not you or your boyfriend
i don t think what you re doing is emasculating but i see so e places it could be considered inconsiderate i think pda especially constant draping yourself all over him is going to annoy a lot of people if they are single and want a relationship draping yourself all over it s like look at us we re so happy and you re not it s just irritating to watch for a lot of people
one of his friends said i emasculate him all the time he is not a friend he gave you information that you cannot really use you asked your boyfriend and he s happy i d limit your contact with the friend as he s up to no good
a woman that takes care of her man i need to get me one of those my body is beat to shit wish a woman would take me to a spa and get me clothes so i don t have to go to a mall full off teens
sounds like deion sanders dream no one would ever accuse him of being effeminate
nah your bf s friend is so insecure it s painful
your bfs friend should probably shut the fk up and let your bf handle his own business just saying
as a guy if my partner were doing this kind of stuff for with me i d be very fucking happy about it what dumb and insecure thing for that other guy to say sounds like you re a great partner and y all have a great relationship
next time you re driving open the door to let him in the passenger side and slap his ass as he gets in
i give my boyfriend flowers and clothes as gifts if he likes clothes and flowers then it is not emasculating our dates are usually somewhere feminine like spa s shopping and swimming if he genuinely likes going to those places then it is not emasculating i always seem i m more like the man in the relationship relationship dynamics change from couple to couple it doesn t matter who is the man of the relationship as long as they feel their choices and decisions respected by their partner that i hold him and kiss him too much like the above depends on the person and relationship x200b if your bf is fine with the relationship as it is and no one is being hurt or emotionally manipulated then it is generally none of they damn business
does it fucking matter you asked him about it he likes it end of story after that thinking about his friend s input is unnecessary
no i m and i can tell you all that stuff like going to a spa may not be seen as typically manly and as long as you are both really enjoying it it doesn t matter but what emasculation is is embarrassing and or belittling a guy especially in front of others to interrupt him when he s speaking to dismiss his points of view or to say something like your opinions are stupid to openly flirt with other men in front of him all these things are disrespectful of him as a man and of his character i ve held my gfs purse at times have gone out to get her feminine products and none of that has anything to do with how much man i am to be a man is to be noble and do the right thing often at one s own expense i ve seen fads n fashions come n go and they are only the flavor of the day support your guy and make him feel good this is what we do for each other because that s what s good for us as ppl and as a couple cheers
yesterday one of his friends said i emasculate him all the time all that s happened is that you ve uncovered who is the chud in the friend group and he s having a big sad that no one brings him flowers
first you really shouldn t ask the internet questions like this you should ask someone you know and trust do you have a dad ask that dad or uncle or teacher or trusted person masculinity is a thing it is not toxic to want to be masculine and it is entirely possible for a man to be emasculated without realizing it ask your trusted friend don t listen to us
nah that friend probably wouldn t enjoy those activities and so thinks you force your boyfriend to take part you asked your bf and he said he still feels like a real boy so there s your answer
that s true it s just still bugging me i guess i didn t really feel like it was that strange to others so i was more so wondering if in general that s what people think
yes with one caveat flowers
thank you i was just bugged by it i guess i also didn t know if it was a cultural difference as i m not from america and haven t lived in america for super long i was just confused at the difference of views i think
i certainly don t lol i don t like overly masculine guys i think we re good as we are it was just bugging me
he always reciprocates often as a thank you he ll get me gifts or cook for me actually he cooks way more than i do or we cook together lol he also takes me on dates or we have dates at our houses he s also just as affectionate to me if not a little more
this is a difficult topic to discuss because the toxic masculinity you re describing is subtle and insidious i look masculine i enjoy some activities defined as highly masculine but i often don t like the company those activities bring often it s full of boorish men with their boy s club attitudes defending their heterosexual house of cards i end up being in conflict with these men
i don t understand what you mean and i also don t really think he would lie about it i don t understand how him not being masculine would cost him some social capital i don t know what that means of why being aware is a good idea
the idea that men are mainly motivated by sex is also very damaging a guy likes something you like too then there are exactly two options either he actually likes it or he wants to emotionally manipulate you into fucking him
he loves flowers he hates sports more than i do lol he loves our dates and he s actually the one who chose swimming since he used to swim a lot i think that would be a super fun date idea but he likes to watch me play video games not actually playing them himself and he hates really loud environments i don t think any of the artists we listen to come to our area maybe taylor swift but i haven t looked at her tours
i want flowers
he s extremely loving to me i m not going to just sit there and were only like that in our own homes we re very toned down in public or at other people s homes i don t feel like they should take it that personal
lol i think so many men would enjoy a bit of pampering but just haven t had the chance for instance i often sit on my boyfriends lap and do his skincare and facials even touch up his eyebrows he really enjoys it lol
if i tried explaining the whole situation to my dad he d be more stuck on why americans have such a odd social dynamic i know masculinity is a thing and obviously it s not toxic to be masculine but i don t understand that last part maybe i just don t understand your meaning wouldn t that be up to the persons feeling i prefer to ask the internet because they other people i could ask are from my culture who most likely won t understand the problem if there is one which i don t think there is and i m not bothered by the situation anymore i would not ask the guy who brought it up because to be honest he s kind of a dick edit also i think asking the internet things is the point of this sub right
the stigma for guys is that they have to be hard and emotionless and can t show weakness if your boyfriend doesn t conform to that then that is valuable and strong by itself he can open up in your presence because he trusts you everyone who finds that weird or strange is just too blind to see how beautiful it is
there is a certain type of person who is extremely threatened by witnessing emasculating acts directed toward someone else particular if the target themselves isn t bothered by it it goes something like this person a ss witnesses an emasculating act directed at person b oyfriend b does not appear threatened by this person a regards b as masculine and concludes b should feel threatened now person a has some serious cognitive dissonance because either they are wrong about the act or wrong about person b s masculinity either way calls into question a s understanding of what masculinity is which is extremely threatening to their identity basically the problem is that the friend is insecure in their own identity and is lashing out at others to reassure themselves
your boyfriend sounds like a man who knows his identity is not tied to arbitrary standards set upon him by others dare i say he is a leader and a man that defines himself by his terms his friend is jealous
you bf s friends feel that ideal masculinity is at risk and they feel threatened if they studied history they d know that masculinity and femininity have presented differently across the millennia and the way your bf presents himself and spends his time is perfectly acceptable in one sense he s actually more secure in his masculinity than them because it s balanced and comes from within as long as he is enjoying himself his friends opinions aren t necessarily useful or warranted
the guy who said it may have a toxic definition of masculine also he may be jealous
no people don t think that a single insecure jackass that has issues for some reason thought that whoever told you that is gonna raise a screwed up son one day
friend could just be jealous
my husband loves getting flowers
tbh you were probably meant to be bugged about it men resenting other men s relationships or feeling threatened when one of them chooses to hang with a mere girl well it s nothing new
that friend might just have a backwards idea of masculinity or maybe he worries that your boyfriend is making himself a target for ridicule from others with a backward idea of masculinity if anything should bug you it is not whether or not the way you treat your boyfriend is emasculating but rather it is the attitude of certain people that all men need to be masculine and such nonsense
fuck yeah his friends can shit in their hands and clap with their mouths open i love this relationship
yea but that is the humanity we are people can argue against it fight to help people grow encourage more accepting behavior etc but this is not something we are likely to ever fully change it is definitely not going to change from people tweeting about toxic masculinity and such if you are the type to want to get these guys to grow then your best bet is to stay in contact understand it will be a long road and slowly find opportunities to plant seeds
i am not trying to argue or claim in any way that he is lying it is a thing some men do though so it is on the list of possibilities the point about social capital is basically an acknowledgement that you and him do not live in a vacuum you both interact with friends people from work neighbors etc many of these people will be attached to the social norm of men behaving manly if they didn t then by definition it would not be the norm whenever you break a social norm for any reason it is going to change other people s opinion of you here is an example involving your bf the group of men in his office are all on a team and sometimes they get together for poker night and cigars this event is mostly just for entertainment but it also serves as a networking opportunity for all of the men involved these men will bond during these activities and will be more likely to get promotions if the boss is involved or once one of them becomes a boss he will be more likely to promote the others if these men see your bf as girly they are less likely to invite him which means he isn t one of the in crowd which means less likely to get promotions and or rises etc i am not here to defend any of this as the right way or the good way or anything of the sort i am stating that is often the way it is in reality whether we like it or not and being aware of this might help you navigate that headwind
i am not trying to say men as a whole are motivated by sex i am stating an observation of reality that some men do in fact lie about shit to get laid it sucks you are correct that it isn t a good way to be and it can be damaging if you make that assumption about every man you meet being aware of the possibility is not the same thing as assuming it is true about her bf
replace get laid with keep gf replace accepts flower s graciously to replying with even gentle refusal and consequently gf not liking him as much or starting argument or feeling sad or breaking up with them now consider what happens if op asked her bf if her ass is too fat in these clothes the premise isn t whether the bf is motivated by being laid or not that s just the framework excuse the real problem is he s presented with no real choice and a loaded statement op just started date their bf they aren t established yet we should acknowledge that sometimes you re presenting no choice at all and loaded entrapment situations op is asking the right questions and being reflective about what they do that is a good thing what should op do date their bf learn and explore their interests make sure it isn t purely one sided find out actual compatibility ideally show passion and interest in what their bf has to say think and enjoys or at least empathy patience and understanding its fine to do things that are considered feminine but if its one sidedly on op s taste scale its not actual dating when you aren t finding about the other person rather than gender warfare here there is a more fundamental issue of partner balance and dating you re missing the forest for the trees it isn t about sex per se but actually conflict of interest when presenting a loaded statement and the dilemma resulting from it if op bf wants to stay in ops good graces they have to respond positively whether genuine or not especially as the relationship hasn t been established yet what op needs to do is to start building good communication and relationship dynamics she started with good first step self reflection and next is pursuing her bfs interests with glee
i d enjoy spending time with you if i got treated like that would of wifed you up already
yep i find the good men within these groups i encourage their emotional availability when i interact with the kids within these groups i make no attempt to hide my different expression of masculinity young impressionable boys and adolescent males can see that there s another way to be masculine without all the alpha male misogyny then some of them might walk a path like mine i would say that it probably does cost me some social capital in these groups but it don t care i don t want the prize i would win by putting on that hyper masculine facade at i really don t gaf what other men expect of me many have crashed and burned trying to superimpose their ideas of what men should do onto me they mistake my ignoring their bluster with some sort of supplication on my part but they don t see that they ve met with an immovable object in trying to move me ratcheting up their toxic masculinity they expose that their power over others wasn t real then down they fall in op s bf s friend s case he has been trying to mould bf into a real man whatever tf that is hopefully op will just continue to hold the space for bf so they can just live their happy life together doing the stuff they like and embracing each other s strengths
i hope people read your comments carefully the tyranny of toxic masculinity and the power that the most toxic hold over normal people makes lots of men s lives difficult
we only just started dating but have been basically dating for a really really long time i actually learned he liked getting flowers as gifts when we were teens he said he always thought flowers were pretty and he wished girls would get him some we used to celebrate valentine s together not as a couple ofc and i got him flowers the first time and his face lit up it was so adorable lol i even have a special mix of flowers that he told me are his favorite we do a equal amount of each other s interests but we just happen to like very similar things we both like the spa we both like shopping he loves swimming and it s growing on me too he suggested the swimming dates first we cook together as an activity though he seems to enjoy cooking for me a bit more lol if he didn t like these things he would tell me he s very straight forward about what he does and doesn t like and i always will listen to him though he has had very little complaints luckily relationships never should be one sided and my definitely isn t i was just lucky enough to find someone who fits well with me
lol if me and him weren t so young i would of already asked for his hand in marriage i could get used to our lifestyle being my forever
people get what they get out of things
good for you two that s proper reciprocity
never too young or too old when you know it you know it
attacking supply lines or production is difficult when there s a line of men in trenches with maxims in the way waiting for you strategic areas were targeted but again men with machine guns really bogged things down
there is a great youtube channel it s called the great war and he covers the whole war from
it wasn t so much that they agreed to it but that s how it happened in the first months of war in france there were no trenches the germans were making good progress towards paris then the french caught the germans turning towards paris in a less than perfect way and so the french counterattacked this counterattack completely halted the germans and pushed them back the germans not wanting to lose all the territory they gained started to dig trenches to create a defense line and half the advancing french seeing that the germans were digging in the french had to dig in as well to avoid counterattacks at this point the trenches were not that big but both sides realized that the enemy could go around their trenches so both countries expanded their trench to avoid flanking this was called the race to the sea this is what created the massive trench network the trenches stretched from switzerland all the way to the english channel the entire front was a trench network once they were locked into that trench system it was really hard to break free of it
they did try strategic attacks that s exactly what they did to start but then the enemy realized that they could better defend against attacks by setting up trenches with machine guns so every built trenches around the vital strategic areas early in the war so then you had to try and maneuver and attack around those defensive hard points that were suicide to attack but to keep the enemy from doing that you also expanded your own trenches wider so the enemy couldn t just go around yours and cut you off from behind so the trenches grew and grew and grew until there was a like of them from the alps to the north atlantic
the supply lines and production facilities were behind the trenches the strategic land points were defended by trenches
i think part of the reason was they found themselves in a situation that they really didn t know how to get out of wwi was the first major ground war in europe since the franco prussian war that ended in according to some historians i read one thing that happened was that military technology and lethality had improved tremendously in the years between the wars but the generals and military leaders had not developed new strategies so they were using strategies against weaponry and that was one reason why there was such carnage
in that era it was the most effective means of gaining and controlling territory
trench warfare just was very effective until ww1 being inside a trench gave such huge advantages that not being inside one seemed irresponsible it s easy to say in hindsight that generals should have known better but they were taught how to use trenches and would have to throw out all their knowledge and education and the only way to beat a trench was to either shell it into oblivion or to rush the trench with enough manpower that you can overwhelm the defender something that could be done if the defender had weapons prior to ww1 because range accuracy and rate of fire were significantly worse than with weapons utilized during ww1 x200b at the same time certain equipment especially tanks and armored vehicles were extremely new and not fully understood so coming up with the concept of blitzkrieg isn t as obvious as it is to us now especially since these vehicles suffered from a lot of reliability issues and weren t as fast as their counterparts in the 40s cars just really became a thing after ww1 in the 20s
trench warfare emerged in world war i as a response to a complex set of factors including the nature of the weapons and tactics of the time the strategic goals of the major powers and the challenges of terrain and logistics on the western front while it may seem like a highly ineffective and brutal form of warfare to us now at the time it was seen as the best option for achieving strategic goals in a highly complex and challenging conflict
i can t imagine how someone didn t change the idea of battle both sides did your description isn t really accurate and the war in looked very different from the war in what started with calvary charges ended with tank and air assaults early on in there were offensive maneuvers by both sides but this led to heavy casualties by the attacking force each side responded by repeatedly trying to flank the other and you get the race to the sea which is what led to the western front both sides then buckled down for winter then waited for spring in the germans had a two front war and just tried to hold the line on the western front the britidh and french launched offensives the action in had been with relatively small forces as neither side had fully mobilized it was thought with larger assaults with more men a better outcome could be achieved this proved disastrous and little progress was made once again they hunkered down for winter in the use of chemical weapons to break the stalemate increased both sides escalated tunneling operations to try to blow up their enemy and the british introduced the tank the british also got the idea at the somme to heavily bombard the enemy prior to the assault a week long artillery barrage the largest that has occured in human history was attempted it didn t work and the first day of the somme is still the bloodiest day in the history of the british army by neither was really attacking the french were facing mutiny and the british were exhausted both were just waiting for the americans to arrive the germans were wrapping up the russian front by you get movement for the first time since the german spring offensive using creeping artillery and small unut tactics pushed the front back dozens of kilometers ultimately the offensive stalled though and with the arrival of the americans the front traveled back in the other direction the allies also were using rudimentary combined arms tactics orchestrating infantry armor and air assaults in concert to move the enemy combined arms as a doctrine still exists in and it was born in ww1 weeks before the end of the war the allies breached the hindenburg line and began pushing towards germany
i think they would just have ambulance on stand by and help those who need and try to evacuate the area everyone not much u can do to a ghost
a lot depends on how they interact with it are they getting calls from around the city country world or is it localized and something they re only getting calls from in a small area the latter is more interesting to me i then break it into the question are they getting calls about it or witnessing it if they re getting calls about it they start by treating it like a hoax or bad batch of drugs if they re witnessing it that s way more interesting it depends a lot on the individual leo that is witnessing it they d have a wildly varied set of reactions from shitting their pants and running to shooting wildly to dropping to their knees and praying to believing it s it a hoax etc etc any number of things could happen at the time of contact after that first contact once it s confirmed that it s real then they apply doctrine they make a department of magic affairs or some such hire some mages and demons to fight magic crime cool novels have already been based on that concept edit to circle back to the the first line if they re getting calls about it from all around the world they skip right to the making a task force about it without the more interesting do we believe it s real step
prolly yell its got a gun then shoot at it
i guess secure the scene and wait for the paranormal specialists whoever they are to come and deal with the situation it really depends on what the phenomena is how frequent it is how it affects the world and if there is any need or way to neutralize it i would image they would get training and gear for determining what is and isn t supernatural phenomenon as well
let s just say it s in a small town and the neighbors daughter is spinning her head all the way around screaming something unflattering about your lovely mother and fukinn throwing things n people around with her mind the family asks you for help and obviously u say jesus christ idfk and call the cops the cops now see this girl crab walking moonwalking doing the worm the fucking works do you think they would just shoot her put faith in the priest keep it quit send her to an asylum
maybe they just wanted you to think they lost after all we put up christmas trees go trick o treating and give each other candy on st valentines day but none of that has anything to with abrahamic religion
once the romans adopted christianity as their official state religion they began spreading the good word throughout the empire at the point of a sword when rome fizzled out charlemagne finished the job in europe his favorite party trick was to ride into a village and whack the heads off anybody not interested in the love o jesus later christians got a little less murdery about it and resorted instead to trickery bribery and other shifty methods as to the other abrahamic religions judaism just stubbornly refused to die out despite the best efforts of christians and muslims had their own day of spreading the faith through conquest
the rise of abrahamic religions and decline of pagan religions can be attributed to factors such as monotheism political power conversion tactics and social organization abrahamic religions had a sense of unity due to their belief in one god gained political power and suppressed pagan religions had tactics to convert people and had a more organized and hierarchical structure
the leaders of abrahamic religions need to learn how to read that puts them at a huge advantage
no no if it lost it wouldn t exist it won trust me friend any religion still alive today that is almost free of abrahamic influence won that fight because those mfers tried to purge everyone
lots of pagans out there happily doing their thing since time immemorial
it was an accident of history
but they lost the majority of the religious share all men were pagans till abraham so why did the abrahamic religions destroy the pagan beliefs of millions of people that were around for many thousands of years since humanity first gathered around fires and told stories
the religions didn t kill the beliefs the religious people killed the believers but not all or even most of them
when there are no more clean socks underwear or workout clothes

loads a week people s clothes and linens
once maybe twice a month it s just me though and all i basically do is work and we wear a uniform different pieces obviously
not often enough
so like every days
congratulations
there are still some artists out there there s just a big industry that manufactures country for lowest common denominator types like every other style of music
it still exists many current alternative country artists have outlaw vibes sturgill simpson tyler childers jason isbell edit those dudes are all pretty progressive too
the chicks spoke out against the government and much of the industry sided with the government others are afraid of losing their livelihood most of the musicians getting arrested now are rappers pedophiles or both it wouldn t necessarily cross over but lil nas x did manage one hit
insofar as music scenes have ideology country music has always been fairly politically conservative it originated in the deep south and along with square dancing sometimes was marketed in some places as a wholesome alternative to filthy music like jazz and rock n roll associated with urban negros its whole image as being rustic and rural portrays a kind of folksy wholesomeness like it comes from a simple peasant lineage outlaw country only really started in the 1960s and that was just part and parcel of the increasing rebelliousness of all music scenes nothing special about country in particular if country has values its values have always been backward not anti authoritarian
there s a show on appletv called my kind of country with some good outlaw country singer songwriters
charlie daniels got weird like brain damage weird

over time the term outlaw became associated more with a traditional and conservative worldview rather than an anti authoritarian one as country music became more mainstream and commercially successful in the 1980s and 1990s the industry began to promote a more sanitized and polished image of the genre which often aligned with conservative values today country music is often criticized for promoting stereotypes and perpetuating conservative values such as traditional gender roles and religious conservatism however there are still artists within the genre who push back against these trends and continue to embrace the rebellious spirit of outlaw country in terms of the specific example of charlie daniels it s worth noting that artists can evolve and change over time it s possible that daniels political views and musical style shifted as he got older and as the country music industry evolved

well they might want to ensure the contest is won by their fans and the distance requirement will make it more likely it s a fan that wins it
well for the nfl specifically miles was always the teams market area from the old tv blackout rules maybe it has something to do with the team s market area just a guess based on that one piece of data i have never seen that restriction for other sports sweepstakes
sports contest rules requiring the winner to reside within a certain distance of the sports arena are often used to ensure that the prize is awarded to someone who is a fan of the team and likely to attend the games by limiting the contest to people who live within a certain distance of the arena the organizers can ensure that the winner is someone who is likely to use the prize and have a vested interest in the team
great point bummer for transplant fans should they attempt to enter their contests
i used the nfl as just an example but when you google sweepstake rules within miles radius various sports such as nba and nhl come up too
i think you are right about that it probably has to do with the antitrust laws the sportscasting act of
they protect the hooves wild horses don t carry riders pull loads or walk on manmade surfaces like tarmac or concrete
wild horses don t walk on hard surfaces as much as well proper shedding of hoof material requires cycles of hydration and drying and wear that happen in nature but won t necessarily happen in a horse that is in captivity that said wild horse can develop hoof disorders anyway they aren t always in perfect hoof health
wild horses don t spend a lot of time on hard surfaces so don t require protection for their hooves working horses spend lots of time doing heavy work on hard surfaces which wears their hooves down faster than they can regrow
wild horses aren t doing what captive horses do humans utilize them as draft animals or for carrying loads including a human so the shoes help protect their hooves by better distributing the weight also in the wild any hoof issues lead to early death which farmers and horse owners want to avoid
wild horses don t have to walk on paved roads
everyone else has done a good job discussing the different environmental conditions and even the selective breeding that would necessitate shoes for a domestic horse i wanted to add that a wild horse s lifetime is roughly half of that https://www.petmd.com/horse/how-long-do-horses-live) of a domestic horse s due in part to the hoof care it receives for example a hoof abcess could lame a wild horse and make it susceptible to preditors the stress of the abcess alone could lead to a horse developing ulcers or other gastrointestinal issues i e colic that could eventually kill it horse shoes can be used to prevent abcesses also not all domestic horses need shoes some have exceptionally good feet my horse was a thoroughbred the breed typically used for racing and that breed is notorious for having brittle feet when i was riding her more frequently i had shoes on her as she got older and i rode her less she was barefoot
wild horses don t carry people
what is the purpose of houses if humans used to live lifetimes without them quality of life
wild horses have to travel for food and water the act of traveling over multiple types of terrain also keeps the hooves worn down to a fairly healthy length we keep horses in small areas and bring food and water to them we also breed for beauty and performance and not for survival domestic horses don t always have great hooves because of our selective breeding there s a lot more to it than just how we ride or use domestic horses great question though
wild horses don t walk on the terrains we make horses walk on it s like you wearing shoes you don t need them if you are in the correct terrain but they can be pretty handy for other terrains
wild horses don t have an overweight sack of potatoes hanging off a metal bar in their mouth kicking and whipping them to jump shit and run in circles also wild horses just die out if they have shit feet
for good luck lol
most people don t shoe their horses unless they re going to be pulling a cart or riding them on the road
for those saying tarmac asphalt concrete you re forgetting that we ve been shoeing horses long before most places had anything but dirt roads
a person who died at age from a foot infection because he had no shoes lived a lifetime as well technically
run on concrete with bare feet at full speed for an hour
whats the point if shoes if we have the soles of our feet
that kind of like asking why what the purpose of cutting your fingernails is when they d naturally wear down or rip off
wild horses typically live their life on soft ground and don t carry additional loads or pull loads
hard surfaces like roads are bad for hooves horses evolved to walk mostly on softer soil based ground in fields
to protect their hooves
to protect their hooves
well undomesticated horses don t have people riding them and aren t pulling carts both of which adds unnatural stress on limbs
the purpose of horseshoes is to protect domesticated horses hooves from excessive wear and tear caused by man made surfaces like roads and pavement wild horses live and move around in natural environments like grassy plains and forests which do not cause as much damage to their hooves as man made surfaces
concrete hard as shit dawggy
or live as long
that makes sense thank you
they couldn t drag me away either
nice response thanks
dirt roads tend to be packed harder than natural grasslands plus people have been paving roads with stones since at least bc
before most places had anything but dirt roads this might be true but the places where people started shoeing horses very much did have paved roads the oldest known horse shoes were found in an etruscan tomb from around bc a lot of places might not have had paved roads at that time but the etruscans definitely did
those times it was used for protection from naturally hard surfaces like rocky steppes and mountains
yup
i have but not for that long if the temps aren t freezing i m barefoot but i don t walk on my toenails
horses have hoves which are keratin the same as our fingernails i go barefoot when it isn t freezing fyi
as someone else pointed out people were shoeing horses when towns only had dirt roads
people were shoeing horses long before concrete and paved roads
thank you
domesticated horses can live up to twice as long as a wild horse it s literally years tops vs it s almost like domesticated horses have people taking care of them or something
which is why i said before most places had anything but dirt roads
wasn t trying to be abrasive just remembering a time i was playing tag when i was little and tore most of the skin off the bottom of my big toe i generally don t think most animals have evolved to move at high speeds on man made surfaces
thank you darth balls
cobble stone hard as shit dawggy
i m not sure we were shoeing horses before bc
how often do horses run at full speed on man made surfaces
you re welcome have a nice day
i m talking dirt roads
there s definitely a difference but it might take a refined and trained palate to fully appreciate the difference it s mainly about off flavors in the wine some people are insensitive to many of the off flavors and never have to pay over for a bottle of wine anyone can recognize that a bottle nice as it may be can be improved upon there are definitely charlatans who will put a price tag on a wine for the suckers or a fine wine may have been improperly stored never judge a wine by its price
no
hey y all she has super sexy vids and nude pics on her page i m sure you ll like what you see
the average consumer generally cannot taste the difference between a bottle of wine and a bottle a lot of it comes down to expectations there are differences though and there certainly are people who can taste the difference
unless you re wine connoisseur you probably will not be able to tell the difference in quality
here s your confirmation https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/the_most_infamous_study_on_wine_tasting.html
i can t do cheap wine like the for a huge bottle type is the minimum i have had some bottle wine a few times before and it was glorious it was worth the money for me
i hate to admit it but yes there is a difference between a bottle and a i have poor sense of taste and smell and even i can tell the difference but i also drink a fair amount of wine i was fortunate enough to enjoy a bottle and it actually tasted different i hate that it s true edit to add but of course there will always be fabulous cheap wines and super shitty expensive ones too
i can taste the difference between good wine and bad wine and while there is a general correlation between price and quality it is not a strict relationship wine pricing is greatly affected by reputation and demand in addition to quality i have been to plenty of tastings where they served wines ranging from to and the wine was not close to being the best but neither was the but there are notable differences in structure fruit balance finish and more between lower quality wine and higher quality there are also expectations of quality i might taste a wine and think oh this is good for a bottle of wine and it might be fine with a meal but it would still not be the equivalent of a more expensive bottle right now there are so many good drinkable wines in the dollar range that i find it difficult any more to justify paying more even if it is better actually i ve gotten to the point where i rarely go outside of spanish portuguese and italian wines
how do you train your tongue no sex jokes lol
there are wine tasting classes everywhere some are offered by wine sellers https://www.winehouse.com/product-category/classesevents/).our local parks and recreation and senior centers have wine tasting classes too

if you nap too long your body thinks it s going to sleep and gets into sleep mode so it s offended that you woke up instead
fenders i believe but from now on it s pushy things from here on out
fenders i believe

pack it up everyone op just answered their own question
because some people have interests passions they d like to learn more about and potentially make into a job and biologists are in plenty of demand especially since we re coming out of a global pandemic
if you in particular are perfectly happy pursuing a trade then do so but that s not a life path that everyone wants to pursue and some careers paths will require a college education
if you are comfortable performing the job duties for which a trade school will prepare then do it college isn t for everyone and trade schools aren t for everyone
jobs that require academia usually are white collar meaning it s not as much of a wear and tear on your body though it is in other ways which is probably why you get advised to pursue that path from older people like parents and relatives being an electrician when you re in your 20s awesome being an electrician in your 50s maybe not as much to each their own some people can t stand sitting infront of a computer all day
if you haven t already talk to a few people that are actually in the trade that you are interested in there is a lot of misinformation about the quality of life that a trade will get you and you need to have a realistic idea
i have a phd in biology i would probably be making more money as an electrician but i m glad i went to school for years because i like school and i like learning about biology i was not motivated by money
it depends on what type of life you want you certainly can make good money in the trades but you have to budget and plan for your future trades generally include hard physical labor it can be hard on the body college can also be a good choice but you need to have realistic expectations about your degree a bachelors degree teaches you to think analytically and how to communicate effectively this may get you in the door but doesn t always lead to high salary right out of the gate some degrees are more valuable than others think about how you want to spend your time at work honestly look at any talents you might have and investigate the job market for different professions finally make connections in most cases getting a job is not always about what you know it s about who you know good luck
people ask these questions without true consideration of facts college anyone and their grandma can get in to a college if they will pay the money trade school must submit application must have references must like doing physical work must be willing and able to be an apprentice for a few years must pass tests and do some class work must then get licensed and be good at following procedures and safety protocols some trade schools are very competitive there may be hundreds of applications and only openings for the year so you have to compete for those slots and try again next year it s not a free for all and they take every person who walks through the door there s a lot of investments on both side they invest in teaching you the trade and they pay you while doing so you get to learn while on a pay schedule with the union however you have to pass the exams put in the hours and track everything i m not saying college isn t hard but tbf you kinda just sit there most of the time and can eat twinkies while studying the trade school people are waking up super early in the morning performing hard labor at times getting dirty working hour shifts or seasonally more or less and having to take a toll on their physical bodies so not everyone is cut out for trade school just like not everyone is cut out for college some people go into trades and their bodies deteriorate after years so they get out more or less some people go to college and they hate studying so they drop out after years at the end of the day money is not everything and you have to make the best overall life decision that you are able to live with if you have bad knees from working trade at 35yo so be it if you have a useless art degree at so be it you have to like and enjoy what you are doing to a certain point or your life can just suck this whole trade vs college debate is comparing apples to oranges in my humble opinion
go to trade school first and get a job in whatever trade you want then go to college part time to study what you are interested in learning
i have done both the trade school and the year degree i m in much more debt from the trade school and it didn t get me a job that said plenty of the guys i went to trade school with wound up in the trade and make more money than me i chose to go into teaching after i got my degree so that is partly to blame
i m a retired physician there is an interesting article i read right when i retired comparing being a plumber to being a doctor they basically showed that it takes a good years or more to break even with a plumber compared to being a doctor i m retired and still paying off student loans if i were starting over i m not sure i d do the college and md route again especially given the grossly inflated tuition prices most universities are charging these days absolutely nothing wrong with being a plumber electrician or other lucrative trade if my kids decide to go this route i will definitely support them
because some people go to college for reasons other than employment they could have a passion for the field and have the cash time to spare
it s up to you what you want to do with your life
depends what you re good at and what you want to do you can t become a doctor or a lawyer by going to trade school
nothing is stopping you but there are advantages and disadvantages to both college and trade schools you just have to weigh those out and do what works best for you
follow your dreams
no reason just a couple considerations physical jobs do wear out your body faster so you will have to gauge your health vs retirement carefully do you enjoy working with your hands if not you may hate it
college isn t necessary
i m a computational physicist i would be bored to tears as an electrician that s why i went to college your mileage of course may vary
in some trades you still have to go to school
there s nothing wrong with getting a trade if that s what floats your boat but if you become an electrician you can pretty much work as an electrician but if you take any degree employers from a huge variety will know that you have self discipline intelligence and the ability to learn new stuff so if you take a biology degree you can work in a lot of different fields or you could find you love biology and are really good at it and continue on getting a masters etc
depends on what you want to do and your circumstances i m in part time online university even though i probably don t need to at this point i want to learn computer science in a university setting although i plan to go for it support soon when i receive my certification at my own pace it makes a difference when you pay as you go for each module per semester as i work full time it will open opportunities for me in certain tech sectors despite trades are in demand where i live they re very hard to get in unless youre in high school especially when it s required to be in school full time for at least months i can t afford that sponsorships i learned are hard to get as well
you can obviously do what you want but trades are extremely draining and hard on your body you re going to come home too tired to do anything if you aren t careful and you ll need to transfer to a more managerial role if you want to save your body ergonomics and kneepads can only go so far in general as you get older it s a lot more fun to use your brain than your body when it comes to work the other reason and this is more woo compared to the practicality your question s based on is that the act of learning and being exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking grows your interior world who you are is something you carry with you and there s a lot of value to that you can pursue that outside of college but i think the depth and breadth of a formal education is much better my job is more trades based or at least physical and given the chance i definitely would have gone to college but i also realize debt fucking sucks and it s predatory as hell i don t think there s an easy or clean answer
one of my favorite bloggers the slacktivist tackled the issue thus why did shack get a college education he s already wealthy and successful because unlike the modern discourse says college isn t supposed to be about correlation to high salaries it s supposed to teach you critical thinking and expand your worldview anyone who has been to college can tell you that your first day on the job will have you questioning just what the hell did all those classes prepare you for
pay for trade jobs tends to shoot up early then plateau while pay for jobs requiring higher education tends to be low for some time then shoot up higher than for trades so it depends on if you want short term or long term benefits
it s not like people who study biology only become biologists it s opens up a lot more doors than that
but why does there so much pressure to go to college and get higher education i want to study what i find interesting like biology but i also don t want to live in poverty
well i have a lot of interest in biology but being able to make money off my interest would be optimal are they really guess i ll have to research myself i mean will they still be in such high demand in ten years
and most any trade requires almost the same amount of education as well it s not like you re going to get to work on day i worked in welding diesel and even after years there was still more i was learning
i think you re underestimating the jobs you can get related to biology
you re grossly mistaken if you think a biology degree is a one way ticket to poverty
i got my degree in criminal justice my coworker got their degree in a animal sciences we both work in tech our bosses didn t hire us because of our major they wanted people with college degrees of any discipline if nothing else you have proof that you can be taught new concepts the value in an education is being able to learn other things like deeper analytical thinking and how to apply knowledge from other areas to concepts you re dealing with
im not sure exactly what it is you re asking you say you want to study biology so why does it matter if there s pressure to do what you already want to do what s the issue for you regarding cost getting a degree doesn t mean you have to go out of state to a year private school costing 200k yeah college for sure is more expensive than it used to be and that sucks but if you re just concerned about getting an education there s cheaper options like state school or doing years at community college first i did both spent maybe 25k total on my higher education including books and everything on the other hand if you think becoming an electrician is the key to a fulfilling successful life then do that not everyone wants to be a tradesman or sees college purely as a way to advance their income earning potential so again i m not really sure what the issue for you is here
college is a business
at some point the college jobs were in intense demand they aren t now no point to go to college
there are jobs out there with just a biology degree lots in research and having coding computer knowledge will probably help but they re more around the 60k 80k range as far as im seeing idk if people are getting 100k jobs from trade schools out the gate or if that s after a few years but i m sure you could get there too
probably it s a common route to med school there are plenty of doctors around
your question should be how do i make money from the major i m interested in lots of people would assume an english bachelors and a library sciences masters wouldn t make any money but the person i know with those degrees makes a shitload as a project manager at an editing company
biology majors can always go into medicine or they can potentially help with developing new medicines some areas like conservation may not be as lucrative though
also a biology degree doesnt just get you a job to biology job source a biology degree holder in a non bio degree job many jobs just ask for a year degree
eh i d say they still are in demand but many don t offer enough compensation to justify the educational price tag i guess you can call that not intense enough demand though
many jobs just ask for a year degree it filters out all of the applicants that don t like to think too hard
that s exactly what servers don t want to happen because going from tips to a fixed wage would result in a significant drop in their income
servers already make minimum wage servers don t want a flat wage and consumers want good service so it stays
due to the fair labor standards act if a tipped employee does not make enough in tips plus hr to equal minimum wage the company is required to make up the difference they are guaranteed at least minimum wage while many others are stuck at exactly that day in and day out this is a federal law so restaurants aren t going to fight something so easy to prove overall it s not that hard to make a few bucks an hour in tips to reach minimum wage on a weekly basis if someone just has tables an hour with only tips each that would mean they would be making hr a lot higher than any minimum wage
yes and they d probably make less money
don t think so look at canada our servers make min wage set to go up to on june 1st and restaurant credit card machines still have the tip option built into it suggesting as the lowest option
but muh capitalism
what part of that stops them asking for and accepting tips
sure nicer places would have to pay more than min wage and tons mediocre places would close i m sure some great places would end up forced out as well but this is the solution
yeah and just raising the minimum wage in general that s basically why there s a so much emphasis on tips
not just restaurants but sure there really isn t enough pressure to change the system nationally at least not yet it has happened in a few places if it happens in more cities or states and people are happy with the change then maybe maybe the federal law might change
no many states already do that minimum wage by default before tip and many canadian provinces too but it didn t help actually suggested tip percentages and average tip percentages paid increased also all servers in canada and the us are guaranteed minimum wage after tip and that doesn t help reduce tip either
it works for many other countries
some restaurants already pay their servers minimum wage and they get tips on top of that
restaurants need to pay above minimum wage pay their workers the way fast food pays theirs no tipping in fast food
no servers are paid minimum wage or more hr here in california and are still tipped
yeah the only way this would work is if minimum wage for servers was higher than the general minimum
they should be given pay that they can live with so customers dont have to tip for good service here in finland tipping required expected and good service wether you tip or dont they have a living wage
do you think that s a result of canada justifying it because it s so prevalent in the us
that s not what tipping culture means it s whether or not it s expected needed to subsidize wages
i mean anyone can ask for a tip but only servers regularly receive them to compensate for being paid a fraction of the minimum wage
servers in the us earn more money than finnish servers can even dream of they don t want that to change
i just think that even if you earn min wage you can barely afford anything so tipping still persists even though is a ridiculous concept imo
this is the point many people don t understand serving is one of the most lucrative short term careers for many young people it s not uncommon at all for servers in the us to make figures a year hr
yes of course you have to go through canada the road is now paved all the way too and considerably shorter than it used to be https://lazytrips.com/blog/can-you-drive-to-alaska-from-the-united-states
yes canada is solid ground
yes it s a hour drive from seattle wa to anchorage ak along the alaska highway
yes have to go through canada though
yes but you have to drive through canada
not from hawaii
yes whether your vehicle will survive the journey or not is less certain
haha yeah canada isn t imaginary alaska s metros are actually pretty far from canada though juneau isn t actually very big
yes and then canoe to russia
no the floor is lava in all of canada
yep done it myself travel up west coast through british columbia flip off yukon territory go see some moose
alaska dips south quite a way although there doesn t seem to be much there you can drive from bellingham washington to mud bay alaska in hours through canada https://goo.gl/maps/smtzkmqvpovyutul6)
sure you ok to get into canada
yes
yeah if you don t wanna fly or take a ferry you can drive through canada
yes it was specifically a major project to get a highway built during wwii
not every part if alaska some cities are not connected to the outside by road
that depends where in alaska
depends on where you re starting from not from japan
i ve done it you go through canada pretty drive and not terribly long
yes you drive through canada if you don t want to drive through canada you can put your car on a ferry in washington state and float to alaska
nope canada actually isn t real so you would have to drive through the ocean
that s honestly a good question i m in southern california but i m going to try this weekend and i ll let you know wish me luck
quick google map search 2d 10hour drive to fairbanks alaska from socal
no i have reddit
al can highway
not to the capital
yes i ve done it twice takes about days unless you have someone with you to drive while you sleep and you have to drive through canada
yes beside the route through alberta british columbia yukon you could also drive to prince rupert and take the alaska state marine ferry system either up the panhandle or all the way over to anchorage also probably not in an electric car yet
yeah
ask canada they re closer
not from hawaii
i m impressed that so many americans want to show their guns all of the places they go
possible yes but once you get healthcare in canada would you leave
just follow the only road
well it s like paved there s always a stretch between white horse and tok that s perpetually under construction
can you bring your guns through canada to alaska
i don t believe you
get to drive through canada
oh yeah prove it
you should see some of the shitboxes i ve driven the al can in any modern car in reasonably good condition will likely survive the trip these days it s not the arduous overland excursion it was years ago
i don t think you can drive to juneau i was told there are no roads into or out of the city one must take a boat or fly
just for reference it s miles from the al can border crossing to fairbanks and it s miles to anchorage
can you bring your guns through canada to alaska
the question is why you returned
isn t it like hours at a bare minimum from border to border
i thought you said hours minutes wanted to see what car you were driving
most hunting rifles and shotguns may be brought through canada with a basic declaration at customs restricted firearms including many times of handguns and automatic rifles may be transported with special federal provincial permits but it s probably just easier to ship them up there
depends on the gun most hunting rifles and shotguns are able to be brought into canada provided you declare them at the border restricted firearms require you to submit an att permit in advance
i m canadian and can confirm canada isn t solid ground trend carefully op
eh
blub blub blub
correct there s roads there but they re not connected to other roads outside the local area fly or arrive by barge
pretty sure that requires a permit or something or it counts as gun running but i m from california so never really considered it
i live in ak now so i didn t
the shortest main route travel is from sumas wa to the border crossing between skagway and fraser which is about 24ish hours of driving
if you speed maybe
badum cha
you wouldn t call that terribly long
i m used to being stuck in traffic in a dense city even a hour drive feels better than an hour or two of traffic to me
they re not just generated during sex one partner carries it and it can be spread to the other partner during sex some of them have other ways that they can be spread babies can get certain stis during pregnancy or birth for example the reason you generally hear about it in regards to non virgins is that sexual contact is how they get spread so most people who haven t had sexual contact haven t been in a situation where they would contract it im not sure how exactly that sounds like spontaneous generation

there s other ways of catching some stds kissing blood or body fluids as i said some not all so some virgins can already have an std but this is of course very rare they re not made by sex but sex is the best way to get them simply because all possible ways to get them are put together
it s god s punishment for our sin
stds are spread during sex but don t always show symptoms so you could sleep with someone neither know one has one then spread it
transmitted
stds are caused by bacteria viruses or parasites that can be transmitted through sexual contact these organisms can be present in bodily fluids like blood semen vaginal fluids and breast milk when a person with an std has sex with someone else they can pass on the infection through contact with these fluids it is true that people who have had sex with multiple partners are at a higher risk of getting an std because they have had more opportunities for exposure however it is also possible for a person to get an std from their very first sexual encounter if their partner is infected when two virgins have sex for the first time they can still transmit an std if one or both of them is already infected with the organism causing the infection some stds like herpes and hpv can be transmitted even when there are no visible symptoms
a virgin could have gotten a disease that may not be thought of as an std such as hepatitis or hiv through drug use or a needlestick too however they are transmitted through body fluids so sex is also a way they could be spread
so the way it works is if person a and b want to have sex with each other and both are complete virgins and telling the truth about their history and have not received stis from their mother during pregnancy or birth they can still carry stds with without symptoms it feels like a no brainer but i never see warnings about stds for two virgin partners only about pregnancy
they said no stupid questions
the kissing ones would be herpes of the mouth right does that mean if you get a sore near your mouth you can give a partner genital herpes by having sex oral even when you don t have sores
god invents sex god invents diseases caused by having sex that ll get em
i understand that but does that mean they can be spread by virgins carried by virgins
that s why i mentioned blood exposures needlesticks are considered an exposure to blood
stds are viruses bacteria and sometimes parasites like most diseases if you don t catch them you can t spread them they are spread most usually through sex but that s not the only way most are curable
there are some that can spread from toilet seats or shared towels
no if neither of them has an sti before hand they can t transmit it during sex the only way they can be carriers is if it was transmitted to them at some point sex from a birth parent blood exposures could be routes of transmission if they had any of that and got exposed to the sti they could have it if they ve had zero exposure they won t be carrying it
no oral sex can lead to std in the mouth
yes labial herpes can be spread to genitalia through oral but very rarely the other way around this is the only potential std that i know of that can be given through kissing i know oral is also a way you can catch hpv but it s not through saliva like both genital fluids have to come into contact with one of them already being infected of course
some yes a mother can pass on hiv to her newborn
i thought the toilet seat thing was a myth i mean provided you re not placing your genitalia directly onto the seat instead of your ass thighs
ok thank you that makes more sense
oh ok
there s no such thing as a in the mouth std you can very much get stds through oral sex though
ok thank you
it s not likely you d have to be rather sloppy or have a scratch cut
copied what stds show up in the mouth stis commonly caught through oral sex are gonorrhoea genital herpes syphilis infections less frequently passed on through oral sex include chlamydia hiv hepatitis a hepatitis b and hepatitis c genital warts pubic lice https://www.nhs.uk sexual health what infections can i catch through oral sex nhs you can also then pass them on too how long does oral std last treatment even though oropharyngeal gonorrhea does not usually cause any symptoms it is still important that you get treated oropharyngeal gonorrhea can last for months if left untreated so people can unwittingly infect their sexual partners for months sep https://ro.co health guide oral g oral oropharyngeal gonorrhea what it is and how it s treated
can be in the mouth in the throat infected tonsils it can create sores or even have no symptoms and last for months during which time it is contagious
okay right that makes more sense
yeah i actually know most of this but thanks i guess you didn t understand what i wrote and i didn t get your comment because you re very cut to the chase i thought you were saying people could not get stds through oral because of the word std what i meant is people don t believe that you can get stds through oral but you very much can that it doesn t matter that there s sexual in the name for genital herpes specifically it s hard to give that to someone through oral like oral herpes will spread to genitalia easily it s harder the other way but this is only herpes and i very carefully didn t speak about any other stds than the ones i know the most about to not sprout dumb shit
the word sexual still applies though it s oral sex sex is in the name of it
agreed but some people honestly believe that if it s not piv there s no risks at all and that people are just dumb to believe myths like i ve had the very unfortunate experience more than once with one offs who didn t get why i wanted to know if they were up to date on their std checks because they d be wearing condoms or we d just stick to oral
if they weren t up to date you wound stick to oral
no i stuck to doing nothing with them
because nato is a defence treaty that requires all nations to defend each other if one of them gets attacked they make all decisions by consensus all member countries have to agree to all decisions it s not simple majority
admitting new countries members is by unanimous decision
because it s not a democratic club it s a defense treaty think of it like this you and some of your best friends agree that no matter what you ll defend each other with your life should anyone in your group get attacked a new person wants to join your pact but you don t like them for whatever reason will you agree to defend them with your life will someone else who also doesn t agree to their admittance be expected to defend the new person with their life tldr it has to be admittance by unanimous consent because if it wasn t built that way it would be ineffective
the whole point of nato is that turkey is required to go war for sweden so of course they have a say in it
article of the nato treaty https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/history_pdf/20161122_e1-founding-treaty-original-treaty_nn-en.pdf) requires unanimous agreement of all members when admitting a new member
when nato was formed the world was a very different place we had just gotten through a world war and years prior a different world war had begun almost exclusively because of a system of alliances and in that war some members of the alliance decided not to honor the agreement because countries were getting brought into these agreements that people had opposed joining becoming a member of nato requires every single country to individually ratify the inclusion of that country in the alliance in order to maintain the integrity and sovereignty of each membership the worry was that the anglo members us britain canada would allow members in that align better with their geopolitical interests rather than the protection of europe from godless communism there was even a worry that colonies like hawaii puerto rico french guyana and ceuta could trigger a war so those were actually excluded from the alliance because of this every single member of nato gets a veto on new members joining the alliance has grown from members to so anglo nations are now the weaker voting members of the alliance but usually the process for joining nato is a lot longer it took albania and croatia years to join nato and nato forced them into a bunch of programs to bring up their standards and this process called map happened for all but of the current member states finland and sweden are unique they re being invited without having any kind of organizational preparation both of these nations agreed to be neutral for a long time and now with russian aggression on the rise they re looking to become members the heads at nato decided to structure this process without considering the relationship issues that some countries had with others just to give you an idea of how fast this is going it took years for turkey to join nato turkey has control of the black sea and has been nato s second most important ally after the us in stopping russia and it took four years to agree to let them in in order for turkey to join nato they had to send troops to korea to assist the us after they did this the us did a campaign around europe convincing their other allies that turkey would be a valuable ally and that s actually how turkey has treated nato since since the only way for them to get into nato was through negotiations and giving in to other s demands they used the process as a means of getting things from other countries but this stuff all happened behind closed doors in the map program now it s happening in the public and doesn t look good the other thing i think is that nato ascension isn t that popular in finland and sweden of fins and of swedes want to join nato according to latest polls that s a majority but not a lot of wiggle room that s also all time highs so finland has enough political wiggle room to give in to turkey but sweden doesn t and nato high command know this they know if these countries are made to go through that ten year process other countries went through they d never agree to join
because they have rules they follow if they accept sweden without turkeys approval then turkey might not feel obligated to help if sweden is attacked or vice versa that would defeat the point of the alliance
it has to be unanimous you don t get get into an alliance where you are bound to shed blood for them if called for if you didn t agree to join in the first place
i believe nato s rules require unanimous consent to admit a new member
i asked my uncle who s a retired doctor of political science here s his response nato requires all members to agree to adding any new member turkey may agree after their election right now in turkey being tough on sweden appeals to the nationalists who think sweden is harboring kurdish extremists
according to turkey sweden has taken a strong position towards pkk a separatist group in turkey who have resorted to terrorist attacks in the past several countries recognize they are a terrorist group sweden denies this allegation nevertheless sweden joining nato means turkey has to go fight anyone who attacks them it s kind of hard to start defending a guy whose been digging your grave if that s what you believe they have been doing that s the reasoning but if you ask me erdogan is being the emotional attention lover autocrat he has always been elections are coming up in turkey and this is how he stays in power unfortunately declaring him a dictator is not straightforward turks have chosen his rule over and over
basically that s how the nato bilaws are written every current member has to agree to allow a new member in
because treaties have rules and one of nato s is unanimous consent when letting someone new in it s an annoying rule at the moment because erdogan stinks but it s still one of the rules bigger picture it s not hard to understand why the rule exist though when you think about the implications of article
when nato was set up it was set up with rules and one of those rules was that new memberships must be unanimously approved
each country in nato needs to agree to new members
from my understanding the only reason that sweden is unable to enter nato is due to erdoan being a salty dictator x200b yeah you understand nothing that s not about erdogan or dictating at all every turkish citizen literally supports the decision of blocking sweden till sweden stops supporting terrorist pkk pyd ypg and feto findland agreed to fight againist those terrorist groups and turkey instantly let them in and aprooved it i remember years ago our president said dear sweden you re supporting terrorist now with no coincidences but someday you will need us and those terrorist will be your problem
think strategically not politically
they re still trying to put their ikea bookshelf together
nato rules require unanimous agreement to allow new members in
in order for a country to gain membership all members united must agree
i ll be brief every country in nato is forced to defend every other member of the alliance but you can t just force a country to defend another one at most all the countries that want to can make separated defence pacts with sweden also turkey is very important without it nato looses what s probably the most strategically valuable ally against russia on top of loosing the second largest first in europe and probably one of the best armies in the organization
now that finland is apart of nato doesn t matter plus being part of eu already puts sweden in a defensive partnership with the other eu members sweden has a very small land border with russia as i remember it might be nothing as it stands any russia aggression will now face nato or all european union members despite this would still be good for sweden to join nato to improve military standards for them and have protection from like minded nations canada usa uk
nobody would sign up to a defensive treaty if they couldn t veto new entries otherwise you could be sucked into a war you don t care about if turkey doesn t want to go to war to protect sweden they shouldn t promise otherwise
it all started when king charles xii asked the ottomans for asylum and then they gave him to the russians later they still beefin s
because that s what all the parties that signed the treaty agreed to when you have to go to war to protect someone you should get a veto over who that is that doesn t mean what turkey is doing is right in this circumstance but the principal is valid
who is more advantageous an ally sweden or turikye who has better resources who is more help in an actual fight who has the better strategic location
fuck you that s why
yes he is being a dickhead and tries to promote his agenda because he can nato doesn t allow anyone unless every member agrees and turkey has a massive army much larger and better than the tiny underfunded europian ones so they are actually important to have in nato
the big question is why were eu countries so stupid to make such an alliance with turkey which is culturally very different
you ever tried to mess with turkey they all claws and beaks and gobble gobble and shit
because its an alliance not a democracy turkey will have to send troops in if an allied member gets attacked so they have to agree to that x200b erdoan being a salty dictator its more complicated than that erdogan is putin s buddy an alliance that may get disrupted if there are hostilities
probably the same reason russia is the presidency of the united nations security council because they can
the rules are written that way so no larger country with significant influence like the us can bully a much smaller country like latvia into doing something that they don t want to do unfortunately this is an easy system to abuse as you have pointed out but that s how it is
my brain inserted a the before turkey and i was very confused about the role of fowl in international politics
the voting process of nato is democratic where unanimity wins which makes sense based on the purpose and obligations of nato if a fellow nato country is attacked you are obligated to support them likely by but not necessarily or limited to sending your own soldiers to die for them i think that every country that has this obligation has the right to veto their own obligation
turkey is denying sweden membership in nato to elevate his international importance as a means of propping up his illegitimate regime
for a country to join nato the decision has to be unanimous meaning all nato countries have to agree
entry requires the unanimous support from all other nato countries and turkey has a beef with some right wing assholes in sweden for burning copies of the qur an
turkey are just posturing and grabbing some limelight for erdogans pathetic ego they will drop their objections when it becomes a condition of the f35 deal with the usa
it won t last keep in mind russia has invaded both turkey and hungary numerous times so this is a game to pretend friendly relations and extract some favorable treatment from russia and simultaneously the eu and us they can pretend to be friendly to russia but let s face the facts russia is a serious threat to both turkish and hungarian security and they both know it the other problem is the longer both countries continue to piss off the us and eu the stronger the consequences will be the reputational damage has already occurred both are viewed as unreliable allies and if it continues it will affect all aspects of foreign relations with those countries and eventually damage their economy as well do you think western companies want to invest in an unreliable country so eventually they will relent after they have taken a pound of flesh which will just make them look even more petty and unreliable outside of the context of the ukrainian war things would look different but in this context it just looks selfish opportunistic and unreliable
every single existing nato member has to say yes salty much
also its trkiye officially now they stopped wanting to be associated with the bird last year
all the genocide loving turkish nationalists are about to crash this thread
but doesn t turkey bend rules when it comes to deals with russia
answer negotiations erdogan is going to play hardball to get something he wants in exchange for everyone else wanting to let sweden in
they ll get in
as an armenian i can t tell you they have experience in denying things
it would be really nice if world leaders weren t fucking assholes that treat everything like a pissing contest
another question would they be able to say they want sweden and kick turkey out if all the others agree
shouldn t the overwhelming desire to have sweden join overwrite the dictators single salty no is the process of nato voting not democratic where majority wins or what did i miss the nato has some special rules to their democratic voting processes some things need to be decided with yes and for some other things a few countries have the right to veto erdoan being a salty dictator and saying no it s probably less because he is salty and more because he is a traitor nato really has a strong desire to get sweden in because their geography is valuable in a possible conflict with russia erdogan has no own problems with sweden that i know of but turkey under erdogan is getting more closer towards relationships with russia than with the eu so it wouldn t surprise me if erdogan is just blocking it to help putin
reading this title i immediately thought of how we used to draw turkeys by tracing a single hand in elementary school
the real question is why turkey is allowed to be part of nato when it s obvious they re accepting putins money
the real question is why a non democratic country is part of europe and why it have so much decision power
hungary also have agreed
that s what veto is
one of the issues with nato though is that the more countries get added the harder it will be for new countries to join because the chance of one country vetoing it goes up
cause that s the rules
the decision has to be unanimous right now the process is delayed so erdogan does not loose face but make no mistake sweden will join they know it the rest of nato knows it and even turkey knows it everyone knows it from the beginning because even if erdogan has been flirting a bit with putin these last years he can not afford to lose the us support so they delay the process a bit erdogan can act all mighty and then they will get in and turkey will have earn nothing but symbolical prestige points
turkey doesn t deserve our or nato s protection there should be a vote and if all members vote to give turkey the boot it will make the whole alliance better and stronger x200b another good question is why is russia in the united nations let them a belarus start their own
it is not about being a salty dictator at all which news channels are you reading this from the gist of it is is that there are criminals in sweden who are complicit in violent crimes in turkey and turkey wants them back also pkk who is recognized as a terrorist organization read it as bombing schools is also participating in drug crimes in europe and sweden is quite complicit about it keep in mind finland easily made the cut in a few weeks so the barrier for entry is quite achievable they are nato members now three countries signed an anti terror treaty a few months ago finland completed the terms she agreed to sweden is dragging her feet around simple as that also lets be honest here turkeys army is quite strong so if a nato russia war breaks out turkey can really help sweden we saw a small demonstration of that in ukraine war this is not an erdogan thing turkish citizens are quite united behind this
i m not an expert in geopolitics but i m sure they have a reason
they are being a bunch of gobblers
cus turkey are assholes
trade turkey for sweden
it might be for the best honestly having to change your policies so a shitty dictatorship can keep on doing genocide on kurdish people is just insane kurds who fought isis tooth and nail btw fuck turkey staying outside of that alliance is better for the freedom of speech anyway that way we can still act as diplomats and call out war crimes committed by states like turkey or america
democracy isn t what it used to be in turkey which had real leaders in the past their leaders are more like well like ours
i too would like to know
i guess they should have done it after wwii certainly before turkey was admitted yikes
my question is why is turkey part of the north atlantic trade organization they are certainly not in the north atlantic
is turkey the dominant cold cut ham might be close but i think it s turkey
its not a democratic majority it needs to be unanimous which is exactly why hes abusing that fact to make demands while being a salty bitch and a corrupt dictator
because instead of ejecting authoritarian shitholes we give them a vote in whether or not we protect other countries from authoritarian shitholes
turkey are just being petty little bi ches
turkey is allied with russia too
sweden shouldn t enter nato in the first fucking place a haphazard decision made in the final breath of the previous administration before they left in shame i never agreed to it
simple solution all the european countries that want to include sweden form a new alliance treaty that s just like nato include ukraine and anyone else but not turkey keep nato in place
because they are not good christians
fuck turkey it still amazes me that they got no retaliation after their diplomatic team attacked us citizens when their dictator visited the us a few years ago his protection detail physically attacked us citizens who weren t even a threat and they got no punishment for doing so people just forgot about it part of the reason nato is a joke we let shitheads like them in yet sweden gets denied
cause it s even more than a defense treaty it s a defense pact every nation needs to fight as if it were their own nation being attacked it is not a democratic institution
the problem with a unanimous vote is that it s hard to get anything done between people with differing interests
because that s how a defence pact should work i think you are confusing nato with how eu works currently turkey is demanding things sweden can t constitutionally comply with so here we are
they can but geopolitics is extremely complicated what seems like an obvious answer is rarely the answer chosen you sometimes even act in your own worst interest because months down the road you ll eventually benefit from it
they have a very nice position at the bosporus controlling everything going in and out of there
nato likes turkey this week until this ukraine thing is over we need turkey to be on nato s side and be against ussr
because it is such a strong alliance with very high obligations mainly the mutual defense in article the vote to admit anyone has to be unanimous in that way any member can block a new member joining but thats true for everyone turkey doesn t have a special veto of note norway and if they join sweden will also be voting on if new members can join after this and you can see why however much majority vote makes sense how would you feel if your country was suddenly at war because some other country in a dangerous region was attacked and other nations said you ll help defend them obviously nato is an amazing thing and should be expanded but hopefully this helps explain why all members have to agree to bring new ones in
every current member has to approve a new membership essentially turkey is currently a member it s like the freemasons
unfortunately in this case nato is like the un security council and has granted every member veto powers over who is able to join the club in this case turkeys government is being petty due to their general elections coming up but it is these powers that stopped nato as a whole from being dragged into the second war in iraq also that the americans couldn t extend the justification that had been used for afghanistan
all nations must agree turkey was balking at first but it could have been any nato country
what you missed was that sweden harbour kurdish people who are classified as terrorists by turkey and won t redress the issue in erdogan s eyes also a kurd burnt the koran recently and erdogan is seriously salty about the whole situation
like the eu all existing nato members have to approve any new members
it s a defensive pact think of it this way you and your neighbors enter a pact to defend with your life if necessary each other if any other neighbor tries to break in to one of your homes new guy says they want to join but he s tried to assault your kids so you say no but everyone else says yes fast forward a year and someone tries to break into his house and you are forced to now risk your life to proteat him even though you d rather see him suffer makes sense it has to be unanimous instead of majority it ll only get harder the more countries join
turkey does not have the sole power to prevent sweden s entry into nato as each member state has an equal vote however turkey has previously blocked nato s cooperation with non nato countries including sweden due to political disagreements nato operates on consensus meaning all member states must agree on decisions which can lead to situations where one member state can block decisions
erdoan being a salty dictator please please do not repeat the us propaganda anyone that is against the us is a dictator and must go the do things but pure evil they are part of the axis evil stocking up wmd it is more nuanced a few of those nuances trkiye is in the esternmost part of europe and would be the first to suffer from a war with russian together with poland finland and the baltics trkiye is negotiating with russia to be a new hub for natural gas transport that will allow them to have the handle of europe energy security so they want to maintain equilibrium between the civilized west and russia trkiye is mostly muslim and has been denied entry into the european union so there is an underlying feeling in the turkish population that europe wants them to be cannon fodder but do not consider trkiye one of them trkiye is an old civilization as successors of the ottoman empire they want to have their own foreign policy not being the caddie of the department of state or brussels the us staged a coup d etat against endorgan and was saved by russian fsb intelligence he is with nato by convenience not by love
yup they have a duty to respond with military force if any of the other members is attacked that s not a minor promise
does anyone know why turkey didn t want sweden to enter but the rest did
in saying that all they need is to retaliate like they did with hungary already
i m curious what happens if one nato nation no longer feels comfortable defending another would one need to leave i thought it may be the one basically refusing the defend the other
turkey has a presidential election coming up i suspect that after the election the decision will change either because erdoan doesn t have to pander to the radical conservatives anymore or the new president approves the deal for sweden
can nato drop a country i mean it would make sense as to if we could
un pour tous tous pour un
a bacteria can eat release waste and reproduce with itself or other similar bacteria viruses can t do any of that viruses need to infect a host cell like in a human and use the cell to make new virus copies we can use different drugs to disrupt the lifecycle of a bacteria or to disrupt their cell wall viruses don t operate the same way we need to block them from reproducing or try to destroy the structure of the virus which is a lot easier outside the body this is a bit oversimplified but i hope you get the concept
viruses can only live and replicate inside living cells of an organism bacteria on the hand can live and replicate on all kinds of substances the treatments are different because they have different biological structures different ways of replicating and different ways of impacting a host etc accordingly they have different vulnerabilities here s a link you might find helpful https://imb.uq.edu.au/article/2020/04/difference-between-bacteria-and-viruses
they re very different biologically more different than animals and plants are bacteria is a broad term for many kinds of single celled living organisms that can often work together in large groups but which are still individual organisms viruses aren t considered to be alive by most scientists and are just bundles of genetic information that can hijack cells of other creatures to produce more copies of the virus as they work very differently it makes sense that treatments for issues caused by each would be different
size shape debated if viruses are living or not etc
a bacteria is a living cell it contains dna organelles etc everything a living cell needs to live a virus is a strand of dna or rna inside a sort of capsule it needs to insert itself into a living cell to make copies of itself treatments are different because they re different with bacteria you have a lot of things you can do to them from destroying their cell walls to stopping them from reproducing it s harder with viruses because there s just not much to them that we can do and on top of that once they infect you they reproduce like fucking crazy
german cars they don t age well do yourself a favor and find a japanese car they run forever except for nissan
a rebuilt engine just means it had a major issue formerly and instead of trashing it they took the whole thing apart and fixed it do with that as you will
google all the places they put the vin and make sure they all match if the car has multiple vins it used to be multiple totalled cars
few people rebuild their own engines these days my neighbor lately pulled his and took it to a chain parts house and traded the old engine as a core for a rebuilt engine wanna say it cost his core around rebuilt means they ve checked replaced many of the moving parts rebuilt engines are generally ok but one might wonder what happened to the original engine astronomical number of miles shoddy maintenance coulda been a manufacturers defect that happens if it sounds good and runs good it s probably ok but the car shouldn t be priced top dollar
multiple previous owners
a broken one
i ve bought two used cars and never felt very sure about it you can check the history of a given model to see if it requires lots of repairs or has a known problem consumer reports used to have this and you could view that in a public library one point i found was if you don t have a mechanic who can check it out to drive in tight slow circles and listen for expensive noises last used vehicle i bought i got from hertz used car sales while the mileage is higher than average the maintenance is really good there s also no price negotiation i hate that stuff
a rebuilt engine means just that the engine has been taken apart and rebuilt that could have been done well or it could have been done on the cheap some manufacturers have approved engine rebuilders these are generally good but if it s been done by some guy in his shed then it s a gamble always test drive a car and reject any which make unexpected noises drive it normally and drive it gently listening all the time for anything which sounds odd do turns on full lock in both directions
ran when parked
i avoid high mileage compared to age of the vehicle if a vehicle is only years old but has 100k miles on it that is a huge red flag for me i prefer to find a vehicle that has an average of about 10k to 15k in mileage per year of age so a vehicle that is years old should have between 50k to 75k in mileage anything higher and i avoid it right now i own a ford that will hit 90k in mileage soon i bought it in with only 67k in mileage on it for me that was like winning the lottery to find a vehicle with extremely low mileage for the age and yes i verified that it hadn t been rolled back i got a great deal and the van is still running great the age of the vehicle means you get a great price the low mileage means there is still some life left in the vehicle and it increases the chances that you will have the vehicle for several more years when doing this watch for rust on the underbody and make sure to have your mechanic check it out i am not overly concerned with terms like rebuilt motor or transmission because things happen and when it has been rebuilt that usually means you are going to have a long time span before something that major happens again i would be more concerned about who did the rebuild was it done by a reputable shop or by someone in their backyard

i have never heard of this where did you get this from
the whole point of marriage is to wait until you re married before sex the concept of waiting until your after you have a career and a house and can afford a 100k wedding is something very new and mostly promoted by eugenicists feminists promoted the idea of waiting until your because women would be married as young as and go from being the property of her father to her husband so now that women are no longer their husbands slaves and we re no longer trying to kill off poor people through attrition many groups especially religious groups are promoting teenage marriage technically they ve been practicing child marriage for a long time it varies by state but some states have been allowing adults to marry children as young as with parental consent
yeah not sure what you re talking about it is illegal for a child to be married those that did are in prison there are documentaries on netflix about this very thing
i ve heard two arguments for it the first is that getting married young is common among certain religious groups and they should be allowed to continue that tradition the second is that teens can get pregnant so they should be allowed to get married if they get pregnant both basically boil down to religious reasons and completely ignore that it s often teen girls getting married to adult men within religious communities marrying an indoctrinated teen girl off to an older man should be considered abuse
it s common in the midwest and northwest x200b there s been many attempts to shut it down but republicans always block them https://www.newsweek.com/wyoming-ending-child-marriage-sparks-republican-outrage-1780501](https://www.newsweek.com/wyoming-ending-child-marriage-sparks-republican-outrage-1780501) https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-to-ban-child-marriage-in-west-virginia-defeated-by-republicans\_n\_6409fd91e4b09c5c6d6d569d** x200b to answer op s question basically a lot of religious extremists and hardcore conservatives believe children are effectively property until they re so they re free for the parent to sell off into marriage in exchange for favors or just to help out a lonely guy in the same church they go to it s always young girls never underage boys they re trying to remove child labor laws so they can send boys to workplaces rather than school
west virginia comes to mind first idaho as well it seems that every time a bill comes up that would ban marrying children under the age of some group of people always opposes it always the same people
in multiple states its legal for a underage person to marry with parental permission
sounds exactly on point thank you for your input
in states specifically
even so that is not anything common and if you are correct that won t last for long no sane parents offer up children for marriage if you are wanting to come here to find some child bride look elsewhere whoever said that its common is not telling you the truth
ignorance must be bliss eh
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/01/child-marriage-is-rare-in-the-u-s-though-this-varies-by-state/ so it s not common but it s also too damn much and texas and west virginia specifically should get their shit together rare isn t enough it needs to be illegal
agreed siting stats that are a decade old does not prove your point and i m not saying that it doesn t exist my point is that it is no where near as common as you are assuming
op said it s not common and rare isn t enough it needs to be illegal this does not appear to represent child marriage as common practice why do you think they assume it is common
don t let your parents use your name to borrow money and open credit cards

maybe the song is bad
it could be due to the rhythm or the tone of the voice
it s called timbre or tone color picture a cheap guitar with cheap wood and cheap strings yea it s playing a a major but it just sounds hallow now picture an excellent guitar etc it s amazing so they both have the same fundamental frequencies say hz for argument sake but the overtone series will be different eli5 biggest sound wave is the fundamental wave smaller waves on top of that give each instrument signer etc their distinct tone color timbre

finding the right number
their end game is a classic romance scam they seduce the victim and make them feel an emotional connection and then they manipulate that emotional connection to extract money from them in various ways for example my mother needs urgent surgery can you help it s a long con not a quick buck it s unlikely you re the target mark for such a scam they know their hit rate is going to be low but the victims they do ensnare are valuable them and make up for the low success rate they take their time because they know this results in better outcomes for them and conversely worse for the victims sadly if anything they want people like you to realise early that it s a scam because they don t want to waste their time with the type of people who won t ultimately fall for it
lures the person into a conversation and hopefully getting
maybe they want to blackmail you when you send a dick pic
could be zero day malware probably not but could be but they don t need to go on a lengthy convo if that was their goal blackmail then maybe or maybe they re just bored
also i will advise to not respond and just delete it because as soon as you respond than it confirms a valid number and they quadruple in amount ask me how i know
i m sure there are lots of angles but one i encountered started talking about how well her crypto investments were doing and would probably have asked me to send money so she could invest it for me
lol
this is it this is the answer i was looking for ty
yes obviously they ll try to get my money i m curious how unlike some other scammers these ones take a long time to get to the point
actually when i got sexual she told me off and like definitely wanted to steer the conversation away from that that was of course something i did because fuck them they re a scammer
the last one actually asked me to install the telegram app but it s not malware seems mainstream now she s chatting with me on there for whatever reason she prefers not to use sms for scamming
you re welcome glad i could be of assistance
they quickly escalate the conversation to exchanging nudes or doing cam sessions as some people can get pretty desperate the might strip easily that s when the scammers will take a video recording and threaten to send it to all their friends unless they pay a certain amount of money one tried pulling the same stunt on me in my early 20s
do not do that sir
this last one really adamantly wanted a selfie i think she was going for blackmail in this case ultimately when i sent her a stock photo of a fat guy she said i looked young lmaooooo
i mean i googled it and found it on the app store but yeah still probably not a risk i should take uninstalling now for good measure
telegram is perfectly safe by the way hundreds of millions of people use it every day for completely legitimate reasons unfortunately scammers can use such platforms too of course

when people don t have access to other methods of status competition career intellectual etc they often turn towards consumer consumption as a method for status competition within a consumer society people often see themselves as the brands they consume being cool is the brands you either choose or choose not to consume even the act of opting out is still a mechanism of consumer choice taken to an extreme the consumption of consumer goods can even be made to be a moral choice a good person is a person who consumes the right brands

you can develop a taste for it i didn t like beer until my early 20s and a single beer especially if you don t drink much provides just a little relaxation it s nice
most people don t drink to get drunk
not everyone hates the taste of beer in fact many people really enjoy the taste of beer that s the point of drinking beer for many people
it s an acquired taste
some people like me prefer the taste of beer over hard alcohol or cocktails
i like the taste i m not in any hurry to get drunk but i do enjoy the slight buzz after drinks i have responsibilities so being obliterated is no longer something i look forward to if i m going to have whiskey it s one or two and then i m going someplace where i can settle down for the night if i want to enjoy more
with no experience on beer i think it s peer pressure as a teen then getting addicted like it s coffe to relieve pain or pressure for fun i have no experience with beer so idk
some people like beer
there is a good amount of people enjoy beer and how it tastes i don t think most people drink to get blasted a nice steady buzz seems pretty good people drink for all sorts of reasons
if your objective is to get as drunk as possible beer is probably not the first thing you should reach for people legitimately enjoy the taste of beer and various types
it tastes good is refreshing and has a reasonable amount of alcohol so you don t get drunk
i don t like to get drunk but i like a buzz every now and again beer is good at that i do not like all beer i hate guinness and its ilk i can tolerate heineken i really like wheat beer blue moon hefeweiens some people learn to like all or most beers some people never like any beer and that s all fine too
a good drink is a good drink enjoy a good drink i m assuming you haven t tried a variety but there s a lot of different flavors and tastes change as you grow through life beer taste is like wine taste doesn t matter if its a bottle or a 5k bottle what matters is what you enjoy i used to enjoy ipas but now a dark stout is almost i go for now
it also depends heavily on your natural and built tolerance levels it is extremely cost prohibitive for me to get drunk with most beers when i m a consistent drinker it s still unwise to do so when i haven t drank in months my natural tolerance for alcohol is infuriatingly high on the other hand if you re like my brother it s way better to drink something you enjoy he can get absolutely smashed of just or beers the downside for him is that it s very easy for him to overshoot how drunk he intends to be the only benefit to a high tolerance is that it s much easier to stop where you want and maintain that level of drunk luckily i enjoy whiskey most people that have a high tolerance for alcohol will do something similar to what i do use a hard liquor you enjoy to get drunk then drink something weaker to stay at that level
beer is easier to drink and more enjoyable in some aspects than hard liquor alcohol buzz is sometimes also better with a slow buildup also as you get older drinking becomes less about getting drunk and more about stress relief relaxation and social lubricant
beer is a great way to limit yourself liquor can led to over consumption much easier
this comment yes sir accurate there s pretty strong brands of beer out there that don t cost alot and don t taste half bad imo given some ppl do drink for the taste and not so much to get drunk that s when it gets more expensive and quite counter productive to me
yeah this give it a few years op
i dislike it but my mom is from wisconsin must be a matter of time
absolutely not you should watch them all
if you watch different episodes then you ve watched too many
no oh just one more thing what cha pay for those shoes
touches forehead no sir i don t think so
it s only an issue if you start reading too much columbo fanfiction
if you like columbo you might like a modern twist called poker face on peacock great show
shit i m way past that and he probably would be able to deduct it from the begining of my investigation focusing on my alibi for not watching the latest episode to catch me at the end with a copy of my watch history on the roku server located in california all that because his peugeot broke down in front of the data center that held a copy of my data
oh and one more thing
to call them a fucking idiot maybe throw some pennies back at them really hard
i m jewish by birth and kind of anti semitic to be honest i m not a huge fan of going to bat for other people groups that aren t even present at the moment i think this is why the term virtue signaling came into the current lexicon i think the above situation depends on your personal relationship with the other kids without knowing those details it s hard to say because the only advice one can give without any other info is advice on how to stand up for a group that isn t even there at the moment i d be giving you instructions on how to virtue signal if jews get made fun of and a jew isn t around to witness it and they never find out about it and nothing else happens does it even fucking matter no it does not matter as a jew i am sick of the sentiment that we need some sort of protection or something jews should stand on their own two feet like everyone else i think a lot of jews don t feel the same way as me and that s why i don t like a lot of jews to be perfectly honest if you want to consider jews a disadvantaged group fine you have my permission to go to bat for jews as much as you go to bat for other disadvantaged groups since you re not a jew yourself if you don t speak up when kids at school pull on their eyes to make fun of asians or when a guy is mean to a girl he s flirting with i d prefer you don t speak up when people make fun of jews
tell the teacher so she can give a lesson on religious tolerance
i d ask them to bring bigger denominations next time
they are biologically the father no more and no less one of the points of a sperm bank is that you re contributing genetic material at arm s length not involved in the raising or knowledge of a child i kind of wish i had donated some sperm before i got snipped in retrospect are the men involved in the sperm banks ever sought after for child support if they went through a reputable and legal sperm bank no does a men that give semen ever allowed to meet and be a part of the childs life what about gaining custody if they went through a reputable and legal sperm bank no though there can be occasional exceptions how does a man involved in that program get clearance to figure out who his sperm went to typically you don t there can be exceptions
men who donate semen to sperm banks are not considered legal fathers to any resulting children and are typically anonymous they are not sought after for child support and have no legal rights or responsibilities towards the child donors may choose to be identified or have contact with the child once they reach but this is rare if a donor and mother get together as a family later on the donor would need to establish legal paternity and reach an agreement with the mother regarding custody and visitation
i would imagine the last point would be considered a hippa violation you can t give out medical information i would assume that under hippa protection the patient person bearing the embryo would be safe from the biological donor from ever finding out i have no idea if there are special laws regarding sperm donation but by guess is that it would be very illegal for the donor to try and find out if he s sired a child

maybe the us and mexico would have been better off if we hadn t stolen texas
corruption is everywhere even in the us
looking at how well we did after we took over cuba no
some people argue that if the us had taken over mexico during the 1800s it could have led to greater economic and political stability as well as modernization and improved social institutions resulting in a higher standard of living for many mexicans others argue that us rule could have been detrimental to mexico s national identity and sovereignty and may have marginalized and exploited minority groups while it is unclear whether us rule would have eliminated corruption and social problems or simply replaced them with different forms of oppression and injustice
in the greater scheme of things what impact would have it really made though
definitely but mexico is worse
i don t know i was more just challenging your assumptions about mexico you can t just take a snapshot of a country today and judge its entire history
would still be the same imo those who run the cartel will still be running the cartel just with the us government instead of the mexican government
do you feel normal about min after waking up if so i think you re just fine
yeah i wake up normal but just the whole situation is kinda weird
there are free therapists there are free support groups there are libraries with access to free self help books
look for trauma workbooks that are based on cognitive behavioral therapy cbt and are written by mental health professionals as opposed to self help experts or whatever
sometimes volunteering helps when you help those who need help soup kitchen food pantries etc you get a sense of accomplishment a feeling that you are needed and helpful and good though it won t wipe your trauma away it may help ease the pain
childhood trauma should really be dealt with in partnership with an adept professional you trust a lot of emotions come up and it s tough to have insight on yourself it s easier to gain insight when a professional challenges you and it helps to have someone else shoulder the weight of the emotions and help you through it that being said you could check out the book getting through the day or related books just be careful to take a break if it starts getting intense it s easy to get way too into it once you get started and find yourself overwhelmed raw and a bit out of control take it slow
maybe treat yourself to a new perspective on life while i didn t have any childhood trauma i ve gained a lot of peace from teachings i ve heard from the secular buddhist podcast https://secularbuddhism.com/). maybe seeing the word in a slightly different way will help you out don t think that you have to convert to buddhism in order to get something out of it the host starts every episode with this quote _ don t use what you learn from buddhism to be a buddhist use it to be a better whatever you already are _
sorry for my ignorance but how can i find free therapists i m from europe and i didn t know that was a thing in my country we have free healthcare however it s impossible to get an appointment because a lot of people are suffering due to war economic situations etc so i don t know if you re referring to that or some people who work for free also i d like to know if you could recommend me a good self help books i d read two and i found them pretty useless
i m in the us we have different facilities in different states some are offered by the government some are charitable some are for profit facilities that offer sliding scale fees based on income or abliity to pay any of these can be free i have no idea what kind of trauma you want to recover from how it has affected you nor do i know what resources your local library has available in my experience the librarians that work in my local library are super aware of the books they have the books they can borrow from other systems and the online resources that they have access to just pop in or call your local library and ask them but you may need to give them some detail about what you are looking for start with a goal if that helps if your trauma causes you to be mistrustful of others you may want to learn to trust more if you feel insecure or timid then you may want to build confidence if you have an idea what changes you d like to make see if you can work from that angle
you are not alone the housing market really sucks nowadays and not just in america in the uk young adults live with their parents the highest percentage in the last few decades nearly million adults were living with their parents in a per cent increase from and the highest figure ever recorded the number has increased across all ages although the largest increase was for those aged to years
no never be ashamed for doing what works for you i secretly want to go back home lol
no and if your parents are ok with it then better to save money about independence discuss with your parents and agree on some boundaries
no i was when i moved out both me and my now wife lived separately with our own parents we used as much time to save while living at home so that we can afford a place together it wouldn t make much financial sense to rent and try to save for a downpayment also we re both asian so it s culturally accepted to live with parents until you re married anyways i never got why americans like to kick their kids out right at when they aren t ready financially or prepared
not shameful but not preferable either
i wouldn t say shameful but it is a bit odd if you ve never lived anywhere else i feel like by people should have some idea of how to take care of themselves housing bills doing laundry meals etc
nope not at all what s shameful is how the banks etc charge interest for student loans sorry i had to throw my two cents in
i don t think it s shameful if you re doing all that you can
i had a friend who was making nearly 100k year for years and lived with his mom this was so that he could actually save money to buy a house and has since purchased a house but paying landlord rent saving for a down payment and supporting a family is not easy even for a well paid individual now his mortgage payments just went up month or yr
it isn t shameful the unfortunate thing is them treating you like a child and that isn t your fault i hope you get out for your own sanity but know you aren t doing anything wrong or shameful there s no wrong timeline for life and my god times are tough right now
it s a complicated question i was living with my parents at because i was lazy af and playing wow all day pretty shameful i lived with them again for a time in my late 30s because i needed to save for a down payment on a home which i don t consider shameful
it completely depends upon your individual situation and since you re still in school it may not be time yet but you do have a job so that s great usually people move out in increments maybe start looking around to see what kind of roommate situations are available in your area then you can get an idea of what your next step could be even though roommate situations can be a pain in the behind they teach you quite a lot about living with others and this can help prepare you if you eventually want a significant other
if you are actively working toward a goal as it seems you are then it is not shameful you should talk to your parents about being treated like a kid if you have not already done this perhaps you could pay rent or share expenses in exchange for being treated like a tenant vs a child even then you will need to go by their rules since it is their home
the global economy is pretty fucked at the moment i think it used to be symbolic of someone who wanted to avoiding growing up but i don t think that s the case anymore there are lots of people still living at home in their kid 20s now even a decade ago when i was in my mid 20s i had a bunch of friends my age still living at home so no i don t think it s shameful and i don t think you should be ashamed it sucks your parents treat you like a kid still though i hope you re able to move soon
i lived with my parents until i was when i had enough saved to buy a house did it sometimes suck when all my friends had cool apartments in the city yes but now i m a homeowner with no debt besides a mortgage and none of my friends are homeowners much less have much saved it was worth it in my opinion
shame is a cultural concept so this is different depending were are you from for latin cultures it is prety common to live with your parents at even s italians for example have the word mammone mama s boy for those guys living with their parents at their twienties or thirdtiees please some italian can correct me if i m wrong
frankly i think i m an oddity for any number of reasons my oldest has had to come back home a few times i ve never been happier than when i had her and my grandbabies living with us yes it was crowded but i like having my family around even now i have my mom and my youngest who is technically an adult still at home i don t think it s shameful i think in a lot of situations it s actually practical i d hate to be trying to start out on my own in this economy and political climate
not shameful anymore
the main problem with adult children living with their parents is the extra money they have this allows for high spending habits and a reduced desire to save for moving out eating out and car ownership can clean you out and this can be an ongoing problem
not shameful at all housing education and health insurance is hella expensive and wages are crap i m sorry you want to get away from them but can t hoping you can save and the right place comes around soon
this is common in some cultures but i think you have to unpack what you think you mean by shameful
wait till you graduate and get a job trust me this is the way even if it s irritating now bank any money you are able to save you re not paying rent or for food or utilities i m guessing might not seem like it but they re doing you a huge favor source parent
the era of affordable housing is over there haven t been this many somethings living with their parents since the great depression https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/ft_2020-09-04_livingwithparents_02/).
i will tell you the same thing i tell everyone else tiny towns have no worj and tend to be expensive large cities are expensive because they can be get to a small town where things are cheap and work is plenty work is there you may not like the work but it pays well enough to love on your own
many countries around the world have adults children living with parents living alone is hard to afford nowadays
stick with it keep saving money like actually saving like really saving don t start throwing away your money on renting a shitty apartment save and buy and build that equity you ll be glad you did it s not shameful to take steps to set yourself up for success sorry to hear if they treat you like a kid but maybe have a convo with them about it depending on how bad it is though just remember how difficult it will be to save and pay rent in this insane market good luck my dude
no is not it could be if you don t at least save some money every month and or don t help wih the house
in this economy living with your parents at is pretty much expected
no i lived with my parents until i was i finished my degree and got engaged so i needed my own place for us to live you don t pay a month in rent and utilities just to call yourself a man you do it to take care of yourself and your family if you need the space for yourself do it but if you and your family are comfortable with the arrangement save the money
i don t think so if there is a legitimate reason my oldest son is a stage technician for a company that provides outdoor stages for concerts and music festivals he is on the road touring months a year it makes absolutely no sense financially for him to have his own apartment or house he s never home he could do it financially since he makes more money than me and his mom combined but why currently he s young single traveling the world making a shit ton of money and saving up for his future and putting the maximum he can away for retirement he does pay us a minimal amount for rent but it basically covers his portion of the car insurance since he s still on our policy we know this on the road lifestyle won t last forever so he s more than welcome to stay with us as long as he needs
dude it s fine don t think too much about what other ppl say you pay some of your parents bills and take care about your stuff from what you wrote it s a very good situation for you and your parents i wish i could just go back in time and be in your situation i m a married man lol
its just really expensive
adding on as clarification preferable in a lifestyle question sense like living in the city vs rural towns people often prefer one and have bad stereotypes about the other but there s nothing inherently to be ashamed of for the preference
yeah i help my parents with that i pay for the electric bill and tv and i also do my own laundry
america is a joke of a country
housing and rent prices are pretty shameful too it should be a great shame on any society that its young people aren t able to achieve the independence their parents have
how did his payment go up does he have a balloon rate instead of a fixed rate
the reason i ask this question is because all my friends in my circle have moved out and i come from a very prudent family i just feel like the odd one out i want to move out but i feel dependent on them i just dont know
i think it is smart to live at home and pay no rent or less rent than living alone now if you were living with a significant other that would be different but just moving out for adulthood s sake currently that is not a good decision
ah yeah thats good so no i don t consider it a problem to live with parents while finishing up college
well there are worse countries
yeah it was a variable rate which was good when they were low but now that they jumped so yeah
the dependency is the part that people will criticize if you re living at home but working saving and still having a life then a lot of people will recognize that if you re in an apartment but your parents are bailing you out on rent or you re taking your laundry home for mom to do they ll look down on that
there sure are but that s not exactly what i said the us finally has some competition for biggest joke of a country after brexit though
all alcohol is exempt from nutritional information this in the us stems from being covered by the atf and not the fda which regulates all other food products this happened after prohibition
currently the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau ttb of the united states department of the treasury does not require alcoholic beverages including wine to provide nutritional information including calorie counts some wine companies have chosen to include calorie information on their labels voluntarily but this is not yet the norm the reasons for this vary but some wine companies may be hesitant to include calorie information because they believe it could be seen as promoting the idea that alcohol is a low calorie beverage when in fact alcohol itself is high in calories additionally there may be concerns about the cost of testing and labeling products with nutritional information
there s no legal requirement to since they aren t regulated by the fda
super interesting i mainly drink coors light or other largely produced beers which have calorie information but it makes sense that smaller ones might not i guess i just never really thought about it
is beer
also not
in general bigger animals move more slowly than smaller ones because it takes more energy to move their body especially if we re not talking about absolute speed but just the speed they can move their limbs think of how fast a little insect can skitter around when it s taking such tiny little steps that s way faster than any mammal can move its limbs so it would stand to reason that if any gigantic creature like godzilla existed it would move around at a fairly lumbering pace because it takes a lot of effort to move its big limbs compare a big creature like an elephant or a giraffe to a small one like a rabbit both mammals similar body types four legged i mean but rabbits are way faster and more agile or compare a gorilla to a monkey again similar body types and behavior gorillas are way slower way less graceful and agile than a scampering little spider monkey
there are a couple of factors first the square cube law teaches that weight grows faster than strength as you scale a body up so muscles take more time to get the body in motion there s also nerve conduction that takes longer in a larger body
it s just a movie trope that s how you can tell they re giant
good question let me get back to you on that
love this answer thanks
the gays have called dibs on ya so you have to be gay now sorry those are the rules
women are way less likely to reveal their feelings especially to new acquaintances so take the compliment at the least it means you are put together enough and not gross
maybe you re intimidatingly handsome i know for me personally i would never comment on someone s appearance that is way out of my league in my mind while also knowing that most in the lgbtq community live on an open basis of truth in their life and will most definitely tell an attractive person that they re attractive
women sometimes don t feel safe or at least aren t socialized to compliment mens looks so the answer is you don t know
means you look gay
that depends do the gay guys find you attractive because you look like a submissive twink because most women aren t into that
fuck i feel like i m in the same boat as op too
are you gay yourself or another member of the community because your last sentence is not a blanket statement you can apply to the lgbt community as a whole or even a majority
really
how does someone look gay
wdym a submissive twink lol
jesus christ yes mama i said most i said most from my experience anyway
no i was joking
with a gay look
if you re in the queer community you pick up on various subtle fashion choices and cultural things like quick tell me what does owning a big stuffed shark tell you about someone s identity if you re one of us you know exactly what i m talking about otherwise it s just a stuffed shark
you would probably get a better idea of that from google images
even so your experience is not universal and most certainly doesn t reflect that of every letter of the community so i d say that s a gross over generalization maybe it s true of the g not my experience to comment on but to use my own anecdotal evidence it s the exact opposite for the l and fem aligned bs
you can tell it s an aspen by the way it is
oh nah what the fuck did i just look up
lol well you have an expanded vocabulary now
how do you people survive like this lmao you can t handle a few naked dudes
i would think bulk would be your main issue most traffic cones are bigger than a carry on can fit
say you need it for religious reasons and it s your personal support cone
i don t think it would be an issue but i m curious why lol
if it won t fit in an overhead it s not getting on the plane
there s nothing illegal about it but it may be too large for overhead you may have to check it in at the oversize baggage counter
it will need to count as your carry on or personal item and fit in the dimensions your airline dictates i don t think there will be a problem with it being prohibited because it is a traffic cone your problem will be with figuring out how you are going to justify or pay for a piece of luggage or personal material that is as large as a traffic cone
it s illegal if you stole it yes why don t you just box it and ship home
can i ask you what possessed you to want to take a traffic cone in the first place
you could try to wear it as a hat they ll definitely look at you funny
plot twist it s stuck in his butt
just do it what s the worst that could happen they say no and make you check a cone
you ll need to ask the air traffic cone control
what for buy one in toronto
don t you mean cone trol nyuk
blackrock buys up real estate they re specifically known for buying single family homes and turning them into rental properties they artificially inflate the market and take as much as they can from the lower and middle class they are the poster child for being a reverse robin hood a company that steals from the poor to give to the rich without providing any meaningful value to society if you were protesting for working middle lower class rights they would be a logical target
blackrock is a very large investment firm headquartered in new york city it is the world s largest asset manager with over trillion of assets under management french protests have been raging in response to the french government s decision to increase the official retirement age from to blackrock is a symbol of capitalism and the world of asset owners the protestors are largely representing the workers of france the raiding of the blackrock office is symbolic of their stated struggle
it s an investment fund who sells pension plans and therefore lobbies the french government to set up pension plan in france french unions want to retire without relying on capitalism so they oppose black rock
they re specifically known for buying single family homes and turning them into rental properties they artificially inflate the market and take as much as they can from the lower and middle class tried to verify this info but according to this report private equity companies own less than of the houses can anyone explain how that works www vox com platform amp wall street housing market blackrock bubble https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/blackrock-ruining-us-housing-market/619224/
black rock doesnt do only that they are the private army too but i agree the rioting was about real estate
you re thinking of blackwater but to be fair blackrock has all types of assets
oh my facepalm thank you for correcting me
i m not sure but i think a lot of time it means that at least one person in the relationship wasn t prioritizing a romantic relationship at the time for example maybe they were focusing on a career that involved a lot of travel
that it was the right moment in their personal lives to have a happy successful relationship there could be any number of factors as to why the timing was wrong that doesn t change their feelings towards each other
it s mostly used as a blanket statement to avoid placing fault on anyone my partner and i got back together yrs after having our 1st go of it we both had fucked up lives and living situations seprate from each other and it was too much to maintain a fair relationship at the time it s going to be different for everyone though
some people mature faster or for example are on a career path sooner while the other is putting that off to have fun this difference becomes a problem and they break up later the second person begins focusing on the career path and matures etc and would be a better match for the first but by then they ve both moved on saying their timing was off is an over simplification but kinda makes sense since they are both decent people but on different arcs while together
when i was in my 20s i wanted a serious relationship eventually but i also wanted to travel and have all the single people experiences to i think it s common for a lot of people in their s to feel that way and the timing starts to work better as you get older took me awhile to learn but the best way to prevent this is to be open about your relationship goals very early on these conversations can be uncomfortable so many couples avoid them too long
um we still hunt them down
we used to hunt them for food yeah but now we kill or remove most of every wild species that comes into contact with us because they re vermin or pests or nuisances or dangers or threats or rather moles squirrels racoons deer and bears we ve never stopped being enormously dangerous to the animals around us
in exactly years months days hours minutes seconds
there are deer in national parks that aren t afraid of people anymore
uhmm wut
they used to hunt us too we just conquered them
animals fear animals that are an actual or perceived threat it s not that non human animals inherently fear humans because of hunting it s that prey fears predators for example whales were widely hunted by humans almost to extinction but show little fear around humans contrast that with skinks who are not particularly common hunting prey of humans but will quickly drop their tails and scurry away as fast as possible if you try to pick one up so how many years not many at all for animals that have no reason to fear predation and an indeterminate number of years for those that do
we don t
not the same extent we used to chase them down for miles and now your average human probably can t even run for a minute
yeah but your average lion still can t open a locked door
no now we shoot them with assault rifles they should definitely still be fearing humans and just to be clear i was speaking generally i don t own a gun or hunt
i think you might be confusing love with the spark of attraction the spark will fade for most people and if you don t like what you see when its gone it s not love
love is wonderful
yes
meet someone you think you like develop a crush on them by imaging they will make you feel loved begin a relationship and form expectations after a while realize they don t live up to your expectations and become disappointed try to force them to do stuff that will make you feel like they love you when you still don t feel loved resent them for their failure demonstrate your displeasure until they resent you too and break it off rinse repeat
in english we use the word love to mean many things most of the time when people are talking about falling in love or out of love they are talking about that fuzzy feeling they get at the beginning sometimes they mean something deeper but it s not lasting love the love that makes marriages last from what i have seen grandparents married years parents married for and still going is a choice it is choosing to love your partner even when you don t feel like it it is doing the right thing even if they mess up for instance i love my son i change his diaper and feed him even when he is kicking and screaming because i love him now don t mistake that for saying you should stay with an abusive partner who kicks and screams my son is but the principal holds i do loving things for him even when it is hard and i m upset and tired and he s being difficult i don t always succeed but i try another example my mom is so patient with my dad i love them both so much but my dad can be a little particular sometimes and when he s being a little ridiculous my mom just nods and smiles she ll hold her ground and they have respectful conversations about important things but if it isn t important she just lets it go as another part to this my dad completely recognizes and appreciated how patient mom is he regularly refers to her as a saint it s really cute because he blushes a little when he says it anyway they are continually giving to each other and recognizing when they were the ones out of line and they apologize and move on because they choose to continue to love each other love isn t just a feeling it is an act that must be repeated and reciprocated in a constant loop until the end
this is so perfectly said
some people like being near people without having to interact other people go with the hope of interacting some people just go to get drunk and not be at home more still just don t give a fuck and are unconcerned about what others think
i don t drink at home i don t keep alcohol in my place that s one of the ways i choose to deal with all the alcoholics i saw growing up i go out for the social interaction the bartender the other folks in the bar the people who come and go like me i may just spend an hour or two there but i choose to do that rather than staying home alone i don t enjoy video games i don t enjoy watching sports i d much rather take a couple hours outside and enjoy the random encounters of folks from the neighborhood or random strangers
some people might want to escape from home for a while
sometimes its just nice to be out i do all sorts of other activities in public by myself i could easily get takeout from mcdonalds but i d rather dine in and be out and about for a while bar is no difference other then the added expense cheap local bar isn t all that expensive
its better than being alone drinking by themselves at least before smart phones you used to talk to other random drunks and have random drunk conversations that sometimes made sense today that doesn t happen as much
that s where the liquor is
i go there alone to read book and drink cocktail beer on tap
some people just go to get drunk and not be at home i think that one might be key avoiding the spouse and kids probably plays strongly into that

see if there is career assistance in your area someone to help with resumes and job searches many colleges have career counselors some will meet and help people who aren t students there but some won t you ll just have to ask it sounds like you ve jumped around to different things if you really want to move up then you may need ro pick up something and start building up your skills in that area maybe get a certificate
i am here for the answers to your questions
i m not saying this will work but it might be fun to see if chatgpt can help you i needed a letter of complaint but couldn t get myself to write it so i asked it to write me a sample letter of complaint that included my details
if you like coding join a boot camp the really good ones have job placement and they usully teach you more than your avg comp sci degree as they focus on individual projects
thank you for this information sounds like a good place to start
not gonna lie i ve been thinking about something along those lines as well nice to hear someone has tried it out
the power of ai
practice more
alcohol and weed can both make you less anxious maybe when you re sober you re just worried about sounding bad or drawing the wrong thing one trick i use to get around that is a sketch book where i will freely write down every single idea that comes into my head especially the stupid awful ones i d never tell anyone about it s gotten me in the habit of letting ideas flow without trying to self censor then i can sort through them later and see if there s any good ones also sometimes an idea that seemed useless at the time actually works really well in a different context that i just hadn t thought of yet
that sounds like a lovely idea i ll definitely try that out thank you
no you are an introvert a lot of good ideas come out of introspection people like you get their energy or satisfaction out of it it s the opposite for extraverts
personally i feel the same way but i also try to at least engage with the people i know a little bit regardless of if it makes me uncomfortable because i know most other people need social engagement to feel happy even if i don t necessarily have the same needs as them
yeah i left out that my parents guilt trip me my mom sometimes asks me if i don t love her anymore and it may seem like she s saying it jokingly but i know she s likely legitimately asking
yeah that makes sense i feel my energy drain when i socialize but i guess a bit of talking won t kill me
well dude don t ignore you mom i thought you meant random people
yeah that s my thought as well i have to put myself in uncomfortable social situations sometimes because at the end of the day it s not about what i m getting out of it it s what other people are getting out of it for the record i m just like you i find it hard to socialize for extended periods of time before i feel totally drained and start struggling to hold a conversation
you re good i just meant like everyone i feel at peace when i m alone
because at the end of the day it s not about what i m getting out of it it s what other people are getting out of it you feel obligated to socialize to make other people happy even though it makes you uncomfortable and totally drained and you feel they need socializing with you in order to be happy genuinely curious what are your making other people happy hard limits
well so people are social animals you are interacting with random strangers in the internet true you might like to be alone most of the time but try to balance it out with friends and family a bit
i simply get nervous that other people feel like i m avoiding them if i don t show up or talk with them l and i worry that will make them feel inadequate or insecure in order to avoid this i sometimes will go out of my way to be present in their lives i m still for the most part a recluse but i still try to put in effort to be better for the people around me even if some people might not see it that way it s hard for me to do this because i have a mental disorder that makes me difficult to be around
i appreciate that thank you
life uh finds a way
population decline has been a topic for decades
population decline has been a topic for years if not decades everyone was talking about it but covid made the progress worse due to forcing many people into early retirement so the effects of population decline are now felt stronger than expected
it s a mix of it s always been a topic and maybe you just haven t been noticing it s one of elon musks favorite issues and as one of the richest men in the world with a major audience especially on twitter where he forces everyone to see his tweets we are thinking more about whatever he wants us to fuck musk
so societies do this really neat thing where experts predict a disaster years before it happens but the people in power find it inconvenient to avert and insist the next generation will handle it i remember reading predictions of demographic collapse in china in the 90s i have never believed social security will be there for me when i m old enough and it probably won t and plan my retirement accordingly we knew we just didn t do anything
it very much depends on the cohort you re talking about amongst many in the scientific community this has been an ongoing and deeply topical conversation got the better part of the last decades if you re referring to the general population then i would suggest the answer is as simple as this the most disruptive pandemic since has been raging globally for years the media cycle has in the last months finally moved onto other topics one of which is the demographic transition much like climate change the demographic transition is something that happens slowly in the scheme of human life but incredibly quickly in the scheme of humanity as a species accordingly there is a fair degree of cognitive dissonance when it comes to the demographic transition it is something that even though we know it happening and will continue to happen it s a future us problem in people s minds this is why the scientific community gets so frustrated because no matter how much warning they give how much they signal what is coming people don t really start caring until they see feel and experience the impacts to them personally
this is unfortunately not new but the pandemic definitely gave those types of people more fuel for their fire
the media choose what s the talked about subject of the moment with things that don t really change they just rotate them to every few months population decline has been an ongoing subject for decades in france we literally study the rebound effect of the 2nd world war baby boom when we re like add to that climate change societal changes like gender equality and money inequality and population decline is obvious
demographic decline and population issues have been studied and discussed for many years by demographers economists and policymakers it is possible that these issues have gained more attention in recent months due to various factors such as the ongoing covid pandemic which has had a significant impact on birth rates and migration patterns in many countries as well as increasing concerns about the sustainability of current population trends some governments and organizations have recently started to emphasize the importance of addressing demographic decline and population issues which may have contributed to an increase in public discourse on the topic
i personally don t accept that sort of language in my company
yes it s misogynistic which as you mention is not exclusively male behavior
in my social circles who you re calling some gender specific insult really matters
generally speaking i judge men like this they re saying misogynistic things to me it doesn t matter what they call themselves their everyday actions and words are what matter it really ultimately depends on who says it how they say it how it s used and who they re saying it to
i think distaste sums up what i d think idk if you re a misogynist or not but i don t need to think you are one to find it distasteful
i mean i know it probably doesn t make me seem any better but i m cognizant of people s boundaries and am careful about what i say about certain people so assuming that i pick up on your vibe i probably wouldn t say it around you at all in real life and you probably wouldn t know because i don t say it like on social media that s tied to my name or anything
see that doesn t rectify it for me like does occasionally saying something misogynistic mean that the person is actually misogynistic i don t think so and i think you would have to have a very convincing argument to convince me
i don t really use it as an insult just every once in a blue moon i substitute it for woman
honestly i don t care if you don t do that in front of me but why do you have to do something you have to be so careful about and make so many excuses
why do you think it is so unfair to judge someone by their words and actions thing is misogyny isn t a curse it doesn t define you and hopefully you grow out of it
like does occasionally saying something misogynistic mean that the person is actually misogynistic it doesn t have to for me it doesn t matter whether they re actually misogynistic if they re saying misogynistic shit i dislike them and will assume unless otherwise convinced they are misogynistic why should i assume they aren t when they ve given me reason to think they are i don t like when people do misogynistic things let s put it that way
well it s because i don t think it s really that bad to be perfectly honest but i understand that other people have different opinions on what s bad than me so i will make concessions i don t want to specifically offend anyone or push their boundaries so if i know that a certain topic is outside of their acceptance i will avoid it even if i disagree because it s not always about taking a stance and trying to convince someone about something sometimes you just got to take a step back and go you know what i know you don t like this even though i don t really care or maybe disagree that doesn t mean i need to push it with you
i don t think it s unfair to judge someone about their words or actions actually i think that s entirely fair i just think that certain actions maybe aren t as horrible as certain people will think and that s okay if everybody agreed with each other i think the world would be so boring i would kill myself personally i think that certain words or actions don t entirely describe somebody on their own i think that you have to look at their overall words and actions as well as try to discern their intentions as best as you can and put that all together to formulate if you want someone if someone else thinks one little thing said completely describes their entire personality and beliefs entirely then fine they are perfectly welcome to believe that
well i think you re looking at this maybe from a not fully contextual angle like yes if you ve only interacted with the person once or twice and they ve said messed up or able to be misinterpreted as messed up stuff then you may just not like them but like i don t go around saying bitch willy nilly all the time typically before i ever even curse at all in front of anybody i have interacted with them more than a handful of times even if they curse in front of me hypothetically if we were to meet most likely by the time i ever even said it if i ever did which i don t all the time you would have already probably interact with me a bunch of times and have already decided that you wanted to continue to interact with me because i wouldn t say it until we ve already been interacting for a while
you re absolutely right that one word or action doesn t describe you entirely however it does describe you just not entirely
well i think you re looking at this maybe from a not fully contextual angle i m looking at it at exactly the right angle i need to i don t owe anybody my friendship or admiration if they say things that are shitty and misogynistic i will not like them there s no other context needed no amount of excuses will make me forget they said it in an offensive way you assume that my statement doesn t include what i assumed was obvious which is that there are thousands of ways to use the word and it s obviously going to be a personal judgement call each time i ever even said it if i ever did which i don t all the time you would have already probably interact with me a bunch of times and have already decided that you wanted to continue to interact with me because i wouldn t say it until we ve already been interacting for a while so you ll pretend to be a respectful person then feel like when you get your claws into people you take the mask off you sound great yeah it doesn t matter to me i have cut friends off for the way they talked about women it s not literally the very first time they say the words it happens over time if i find that you re not the person i thought you were then i will re evaluate the friendship entirely
okay so maybe we re more on the same page on this particular topic than i thought i will say this though i don t think it s necessary to eliminate every single thing you say or believe that could be interpreted as misogynistic homophobic or whatever ic or ist i think it s okay if sometimes you say things that could be interpreted as bigoted in some way it s all right anybody has an issue they can talk to you and you can sit down and have a conversation and find what s up
so i have no issue with anything you said except for one i don t believe that you owe me friendship or that anybody does also the part about sinking claws in and pretending to be respectful i think is a little bit of an exaggeration same with pretending to be respectful don t think i pretend to be respectful i attempt to my fullest to be as respectful as i can it could be that i m not always respectful but i don t pretend to be i don t claim to be anything i just attempt to do my best have a good day
don t think i pretend to be respectful well you admit to waiting until you have a safety net of social credit with somebody before you start calling women bitches so they don t drop you seems fake to me
so i have no issue with anything you said except for one proceeds to disagree with everything i said itt op asks women for their opinion so he can tell each one why they re wrong for having their opinion
a personal flying machine for less than dollars of course
for sure
i m quite happy with my e bike i think e scooters are a little too dangerous for me also i don t think they worked on water in bttf

the last time i was on a regular skateboard i tripped and fell off it and sprained my wrist the last time i went ice skating i tripped and fell on the ice and sprained my ankle maybe modes of transportation that aren t car plane walking just aren t meant for me
the law specifically pertains to wearing them while doing a sexual public performance or something like that so in general just cross dressing should be fine anyways the constitution stops them from enforcing it for cross dressing anyways it is protected under free speech expression the first queen they arrest will be their last
we know two things texans are a holes and they don t care about laws
what is going on this is insane are you serious
i mean most people in dfw kind of do what they want for the most part anyways and i see females wearing men s clothes at a decent rate you should be good
as a tomboy in texas no one cares if you wear masculine or feminine clothing
you re overthinking this wear what you want you ll be fine besides if some nutbag is offended the most they ll do is angrily stare at you ignore them
wearing pants isn t considered a male thing anymore like it was in the 60s nobody will accuse you of cross dressing for wearing pants if you wear fake facial hair fake phalic bulge or a male muscular torso suit distinguishable by the absence of breast then if they consider that you re before an audience they can arrest you using this law you can afterward get the supreme court to cancel this law because it violates the first amendment
i think you will be fine modern society has generally been accepting of women wearing more masculine clothing even before transgender stuff became mainstream its usually only men wearing feminine clothing that people get worked up about
you know somebody is going to do a citizen s arrest on santa if he puts on red rouge on his cheeks and nose and does happy dance
what law the new drag law no it specifically pertains to drag performances for children its not a blanket ban on dressing as the opposite gender x200b as for is it a first amendment violation i m not a lawyer it will certainly be challenged given how controversial it is its tricky because it doesn t make the shows illegal it defunds libraries where such shows take place not funding something could be argued to be different than banning something under criminal penalty
lol my goodness
well the law itself is pretty vague and can be read as cross dressing in general is no good never mind the fact that it supposedly only targets drag queens and stuff despite the wording giving you the ability to call out anyone s gender nonconforming dress if you so decide to pursue it that s kind of the point of those laws to be open enough for biased judges to make their biased judgements x200b that being said whether it s enforced or not is a different story
it s so fuckin humid in texas i wouldn t even bother visiting
media makes this a thing in reality no one gives a fuck someone that lives in reality
what s the law you re referring to
based on your replies to other comments i have to ask why even ask this question if you have such a strong opinion on it what do we have to show or prove to convince you that you are being paranoid
don t look in to this shit too far it s old people doing old people things i m a right leaning leftest is that a thing i don t give two fucks what you do just don t harm people most people don t care what you wear
but it includes a male wearing female things and a female wearing male things as sexual and yeah it has to break the freedom of expression thing but if it does why would they pass it at all
they made a law banning drag but it says men can t wear feminine things and women can t wear masculine things in public where a child might reasonably see i can t imagine this bans me from wearing pants and a tshirt in an entire state but idk how else to read it https://www.reddit.com/r/whitepeopletwitter/comments/12dmj2x/american_taliban/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
hopefully you re right but you re definitely not allowed on tv at the very least
then why make it a law if it s fine and yeah i wasn t going to go to texas anyway i already lived in the mojave i don t think i need another taste of desert in my life time
clothing makeup or other similar physical markers it would include men s pants
it doesn t matter what the public thinks the law lists it women wearing men s clothing as well
santa had it coming watching us in our sleep all these years
it says anywhere public that could be reasonably viewed by a child that s everywhere in public so it s a ban of public drag which is what i essentially do since most of my wardrobe is men s clothes at a time in a place in a manner that could be expected to reasonably be viewed by a child is the wording in the law
it defines a sexual performance as a woman dressed as a man and performing and it says performing can be anything or doesn t actually specify what performing is as it leaves it opened ended so it does apply to cross dressing in general as far as i can tell
i ve lived in the mojave i m not going back to the south west again lol pnw is my home lol
if no one cares why is it a law
from what i ve seen it does not there is an additional component above and beyond just wearing things that are male female mainly to do with the specific way you dress express as for why to win points with their electorate it doesn t especially matter that the law is unenforceable for the most part all people will remember is that they did it it was the same for abortion laws for a while the act of appearing to do something is what s important
i think they re talking about performers not the general public
don t get your legal advice from shitty twitter screenshots the law applies only to owners of commercial or public establishments in any case so even if your reading of it was correct you are still in the clear unless you are opening a shop in texas
trust me no one cares i m a professional driver who wears graphic t shirts and sweats or bucee s pants i ve only once confused an older woman when i went to the women s restroom but she shrugged it off quickly afterwards
because here in texas we have a bunch of morons that get elected and enjoy not having a real job for as long as their dipshit constituents will vote for them
pants aren t considered gendered anymore most women wear pants more often than dresses nowadays
unless you ve heard of women getting arrested for wearing blue jeans and a flannel i don t think you have anything to worry about
is your question now can you do a drag show in front of children in texas the answer to that is no under the new law
yeah it s really open to interpretation but again it may be the law but whether it s enforced or not is a different story cops let people off for a lot since they don t actually need to study up on the law
a lot of states still have a law that bans any sex that isn t missionary you think everyone cares and abides by that
it sort of implies you need to be performing so hypothetically as long as i don t do a spin in a public park or do any magic tricks i d be fine i think it also says lipsyncing counts so you can t mouth the words to a song legally as a tomboy in texas
one of the ways they define a sexual performance is men dressed as women and women dressed as men performing which can include anything as it says or otherwise performing before an audience which is just everywhere outside that could be seen by a child
so id have to wear a dress if i owned or worked in a store in texas that still seems fucked up
if no one cares who wrote the bill lol
there s no way that s true that would require conservatives to agree things can change which means they think men can wear skirts
you should worry about the law before that happens not after i don t think the law is that old
the question is more would my existence count as a drag show since it says the public is in front of children and women dressed like men are now sexual performers
that doesn t happen in public i m dressed in men s clothes almost exclusively in public i wear pajamas at home if wearing pajamas was illegal i d be less worried because who s gonna know
if by sort of implies you mean directly states and adds the requirement that it must be before an audience people are over stating the reach of this law it s awful enough on its own without people adding to it either way it is inconstitional and no more enforceable than texas s sodomy laws were for a while
this is all really scary just the fact that i feel like what you re saying could be accurate is just bizarre i just never thought these kinds of things could ever become law here
no but you seem to insist on reading an intent into the law that isn t there
someone who is stupid lots of bills are written every day but it doesn t mean they go into effect or are really prosecuted on the average common texan will not care
anywhere but your home has an audience and it doesn t state what performing means the wording makes it sound like dressing as a man is performing
and harry styles for instance will be cuffed on stage
so then the law bans nothing at all if it doesn t ban it commercially or personally who does it ban
is it not passed and do texans really not care that the government wants to tell them how to dress that sounds like something you guys would hate
except that it does not since it specifically lists dressing in addition to performing being the violation implying performing is separate from the mere act of dressing and further spells out examples of acts which would be performing and you would have a hard time convincing any judge that randos on the street with you constitute an audience unless you are performing for them and they are paying attention to you
that s another issue even if you read it very positively to only mean staged events infront of crowds this bans essentially all theater and concerts not to mention news casters and presumably women on tv would be forced to wear dresses
the first section of the law spells out its intent its targeting drag shows performed for kids
personally i don t know i m just a lesbian woman living in texas doing my thing i have heard of bills that propose stupid or illogical things that were then never used and only heard of to make fun of the state
sec certain sexually oriented performances prohibited a in this section sexually oriented performance means a visual performance that features a a performer who is nude as defined by section business commerce code or b a male performer exhibiting as a female or a female performer exhibiting as a male who uses clothing makeup or other similar physical markers and who sings lip syncs dances or otherwise performs before an audience this says according to the law a sexually oriented performance means if you re a female exhibiting as a male which would include me wearing pants and a tshirt its made even more vauge by the or otherwise performs before an audience especially when the audience can be just the public where children could reasonably be they count exhibiting as a man as a sexually oriented performance
but it includes the public for kids and women dressed like men as performers so texas as a whole is a drag show like all tomboys are doing drag that s what drag means banning drag bans women wearing pants every woman who s ever worn a man s hoodie has done drag
this is law the symantics are important b a male performer exhibiting as a female or a female performer exhibiting as a male who uses clothing makeup or other similar physical markers and who sings lip syncs dances or otherwise performs before an audience that and implies both states are necessary for an action to be a violation the law is more than awful enough without us making it worse
we are going in circles here if you really think you might be operating outside the law you should contact a lawyer and ask them
it would be easier if it defined performance usually i think laws define their terms but i can t find what they mean by it or otherwise performs makes the and worthless because they could say that means anything and even then it says the woman dressed like a man is a performer already also yeah you re right because even in your very forgiving read of the law if i wore pants and lipped the words to a song i m listening to on the bus i d be committing a crime
i m not in texas so they d probably say i didn t pass the bar in texas
now i am not sure but the most logical explanation would be that both parties agree on a sum from the beginning there s different payment depending on the production i imagine indie films get less money than blockbusters and that s that keeping track of which movie is more successful than other probably only helps in deciding future investments giving payment for each person who views sounds difficult
it is dependent on the contract all of the above and even more could be true
actually there s no limit to the number of members the house of lords can have of the are hereditary lords and are lords spiritual and those numbers are more or less fixed the vast majority of members are life peers people who are granted at the request of the prime minister a barony that expires on their death this began as a way of curtailing the power such as it still was of hereditary lords and excessive though it may seem has continued in the absence of more meaningful reforms to the house every sitting member of the house is entitled to a vote they do not represent any constitutents of the united kingdom though most are members of political parties and vote along the party line

this is the answer
stupid people don t ask questions you asked a question thus making you not stupid

stupid doesn t learn no matter how much you try to teach them you acknowledged understanding there s a lot of acronyms out there fair question you re not stupid
this is the way
as someone who actually has worked at call centers it s likely that the rep in question had to consult with a supervisor throughout the call asking permission to offer a better rate and generally discussing possible tactics to get you to stay on as their customer to anyone here saying you re on hold in the hopes you ll hang up or taking an inordinate amount of time to come back on the line you don t know what you re talking about every single second of your shift has to be accounted for in these places and time wasted on trying to convince you to stay when you intend not to can be better spent on the dozens of other people on hold instead as a rep you do not have the authorization to just throw discounts at callers to see if any of it sticks and i d be willing to bet you refused the best offer the supervisor authorized so after the minute runaround the supervisor had them carry out your cancellation request just to free up the rep take another call
yes it takes minutes for her to take another call while she makes you wait she s been told to do that in the hope you ll hang up
they do that because some people will take a deal and others will hang up without canceling the trick is to start off by saying you re going to cancel and you understand that they re supposed to try to convince you to stay but you ve made up your mind and nothing they tell you will change your mind then reiterate that you would like to cancel that way you ve made yourself completely clear and they re covered if management asks them why they didn t try to convince you to stay
no its all part of the scam hopefully you just give up or you take the discount whatever they can do to not get you to cancel the service the worst was discover card i spent two hours on the phone cancelling their piece of crap card in and vowed never to do business with them again
i was definitely prepared i had my phone plugged in so it wouldn t run out of battery and planned it on a day where i went in to work late i had to tell her about times that i hadn t watched the tv in over a month and it was a waste of money if you cancel you re internet bill will go up yeah but i ll still be saving s
if you don t like it and don t want to finish it just don t it s probably not worth your time
i ve given up on a book just a few pages in
i give it minutes if it s a writing style issue i ll ditch it early that doesn t change if it s a slow plot uninterested i ll something look at the start of the wiki plot summary or search for reddit book title slow start does it get better or similar to see if it does get more interesting later on
it depends what you don t like about it if it s the writing style you can give up within just a few pages because that s not going to change if the events in the story are boring at the beginning i d maybe get of the way through the book before deciding i don t care what happens also no reason you can t skip ahead in the book to see if there might be anything ahead that piques your interest you can skip to a later chapter and skim around seeing if it s generally more interesting or not
if you re not feeling it don t finish it i have a problem with leaving books unfinished so i force myself to finish them lol
for me almost instantly but i still give every book a chance usually i know going in if it s going to be good or bad there s value to reading bad books in a way and sometimes you might even still be entertained

looks like you need to talk to this op https://www.reddit.com/r/nostupidquestions/comments/12e3v79/what_is_home_schooling_like/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
it varies widely in the united states where i m assuming you re from because homeschooling isn t very common elsewhere there s usually a lot more rigidity and structure to a public school education you have a set schedule of when you need to be at school and once you hit middle school jr high school you are on a set schedule of what classes you attend where you will move from classroom to classroom throughout the day in general you are not supposed to be talking in class when the teacher is talking or when the teacher is trying to have everyone focus on doing their work some teachers are more lenient and loose about letting kids talk some teachers are a lot harsher and try to make everyone be silent unless the teacher is asking them a question or having them make a presentation a good portion of going to public school is learning how to work in groups and how to handle social situations with lots of different people you might have to work with classmates on delivering a report about a book you ve all been assigned or do a science presentation together one major difference that you have when going to a public school is that you have to be good at following rules there s often a lot of them
it varies a lot day to day but depending on what specific couress you have it s about an hour or so of homework a day a math worksheet and a novel chapter to read or something like that most classes don t give regular day to day worksheets out so the next night it will be a short essay on the dangers of smoking or something like that throughout the semester there s spikes like if you have a group project you do a little bit of extra work up front and then takes a few days for everyone to get through giving presentations it s not crazy in my experience as for no talking your teachers are giving a presentation and it s rude to not pay attention and or to cause a disruption it s not every day and not every class but you get plenty of times where the teacher doesn t have much else to say and you re free to work on homework early or chat with friends for a few minutes before the class ends you also get about minutes between classes that s frequently used for socializing and regular lunch periods you have a certain amount of work you have to do in a day so it s probably not the case you lose or gain time compared to home schooling you just don t have the freedom to shift things around at will
there are rules and as normal human teenagers it is our job to break the rules the smoother you break the rules the more ready you are for real life real life is not about how you follow the rules but how you ride the rules and bend it for you and your love one advantages realized or not admit it or not it is the fact

dogs have a scent acuity that humans have trouble even imagining what to you and i smells like a nasty piece of poop to them it contains many different layers of information it the dog is sniffing a post or hydrant or something they are not just sniffing the last dog that marked they are getting information about a number of dogs and what kind of dog their personality etc fire hydrants are like doggie facebook a chance to catch up on what s been going on in the neighborhood there is a plant in a neighbor s yard about houses from ours that my dog stops to sniff and mark every time we go past it there are plants exactly like it right there but he only stops at that one there is another part of our network of paths that we might only pass once every weeks on one side is a woods and he stops and sniffs at the same little tree every time they experience a completely different world then humans when we are occupying the same space
i don t think the dog analyzes the smell as we would think things would be its probably an emotional response and i ve seen you sniff the air when there are cinnamon buns nearby
love it s not just a romantic word people love their dogs
in the english language love is like a dumping ground for all kinds of expressions of closeness bonding attraction and affection there really need to be more words for all the different kinds of love i say i love pizza i love my mom i love my significant other its actually kind of weird

yes there is a term to describe the feeling of loving someone more than a friend but not in a romantic or familial sense that term is platonic love or platonic relationship platonic love is a type of love that is non sexual and non romantic but still involves deep emotional and intellectual connections it is often used to describe close friendships or relationships where there is a strong bond between two people that is not based on physical attraction or romantic feelings another term that may be used to describe this type of love is soulmate while the term is often associated with romantic love it can also be used to describe a deep connection with someone that is not romantic or sexual in nature ultimately the term or expression used to describe this feeling may depend on personal preference and the specific nature of the relationship

sister from another mister

damn how could i have missed that one lol but yes that fits too
uh basically say what you just said be honest i know that the feeling of possibly losing someone by being a burden can make it feel like you need to shelter yourself or them by lying or hiding information but this is not constructive you want a true and honest relationship with this person right one that s based around your own strengths and weaknesses and appreciation for each other as individuals step one of that is being honest and that means about your weaknesses too but like also you gotta treat it man if it s bad enough that you recognize it s a potential barrier to a healthy relationship then there is no shame to admitting that nor any loss in moving forward with honesty and integrity maybe she can help you find treatment if she knows two pairs of eyes can cover a lot more ground idk
literally just show her this post then ask her what she d like you to do from here
first step admitting you ve got emotions that you have difficulty controlling 2nd step understanding why you have difficulty controlling these emotions what are the triggers your gf knows already but she still needs to hear it from you you gotta find a professional who understands you ignore people who feel they have some kind of right to judge you they don t
i was in similar shoes finally decided to stop making excuses and to get help what we did was abuse and that toxicity spreads don t be surprised when she starts dishing it back to you i m working hard to do a lot of healing in my relationship it s hard work i wish i had started sooner
when cats were wild they had to balance between spending enough energy to get food without burning so much energy they starve domestic cats are still like that despite having plenty of food not only that life for an indoor cat is boring
my cat is fat and orange
cause they spend their waking non eating moments plotting our demise it s tiring stuff
it takes a lot of energy to push a drinking glass off a counter
i love your cat
maybe our demise is really easy stuff so they have lots of time to relax
this stuff happens from time to time everyone dogpiles on for no good reason its just cult behavior
they cannot snoop someone s device because you re connected to their wifi network unless there s some massive security hole in your device they can monitor network traffic from your device however and even then if you re visiting encrypted websites will gain them limited information
so it was the specific wording that people were laughing at i feel like that s a nuance that most people wouldn t know
i don t even know what the viral video you re referring about it to be honest i don t use any platform like tiktok i m just refuting your claim that being connected to an open wifi network means they can see the data on your device
i see so i am misunderstanding the reason i m taught to avoid public wifi the video in question https://youtu.be/ihveu-6bnrm
i don t see how this is embarrassing he is asking a legitimate question
okay just watched the clip it s a pretty poorly worded question he asked if it accesses the wifi network which obviously yes it does because if you re connected to your home wifi it needs to in order to access the internet his follow up is a more valid question if tiktok tries to connect to other devices on the network because tiktok wouldn t have any valid reason to do so also it s not necessarily a bad idea to be cautious around unsecure networks because like i said they can snoop your internet traffic especially if you re accessing resources that aren t encrypted most modern web service are encrypted however so the most they ll see is what sites you re visiting but not the actual content you re seeing
interesting the consensus is that the guy is out of touch but the first question feels like a leading question for the second for the record that said devices are more secure nowadays than i gave them credit for still won t be connecting to mcdonald s wifi
i can see how he may have intended it to be a leading question i also know questions in legal speak can be needlessly specific for example maybe he still had to establish for a fact that it accesses the wifi network even though it s common sense before he could ask the follow up which is what he really wanted an answer to
