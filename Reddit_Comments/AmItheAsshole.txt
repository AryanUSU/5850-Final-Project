is there anything that can be done to make this sub less you aren t obligated to xyz and legally you are judgement i can t stand those replies because they miss the fucking point
i get the idea behind the rule but i think in practice it s a failure if taken at face value e g the point of posting should not be to solicit advice everyone is giving advice to the point where many top comments are pure advice followed by nta or some similar acronym and even many of the top posts are more about advice seeking than judgment seeking i view this more as we don t want this to get too similar to the other subs so we have the rule it s more something to fall back on if things stray too far from the plot
this sub is great but it needs another judgement option icbs i call bullshit over the last year there have been more and more posts that just seem completely absurd and or made up an icbs option might help minimize those
til that people apparently have passover cookouts and if your fundamentalist uncle brings the chili and you don t inquire about it having pork in it yta just before rosh hashanah i learned that if you re assumed to be jewish and in a thoroughly secular setting someone warns you that a dish has pork in it and you express disinterest puzzlement yta you the jew needs to express gratitude for the warning even though you ve eaten pork your entire life while the passover post was taken down quickly it had already created an active set of comments confidently asserting what jewish custom and practice is completely unanchored to actual knowledge i would like to believe this isn t anti semitic trolling but i m finding it hard to convince myself
hate to ask but do posts that center around minors jacking off break the no sexualising minors rule the post itself goes into just a gross amount of detail and i hate it lmao eta it s just been removed under that rule so that s my question answered
i don t know if it s ever been brought up but i m starting to think am convinced that there s an adoption troll
i just want to share my thoughts about all of the alleged panic attacks people have because i never see any one else mention them is anyone believing all of these people who post about their panic attacks are true panic attacks even really that common i have an anxiety disorder and i ve only ever had one real panic attack due to medication i think a majority of people think getting really upset panic attacks and it bothers me because i feel like most people think of panic attacks as a situation they can t control which it is for the most part so it justifies anything they do during that time in reality i think it s more of people not controlling their emotions and thinking that qualifies as an actual panic attack it does not edit when i say most people and majority i mean a majority of people that claim to have them
i d love if we could do something about the hyperfixation on specific phrasing or wording used by op seems like every thread has a highly voted comment that goes notice how he said miscalculation instead of mistake he s trying to gaslight everyone and is probably cheating on her theres some genuinely interesting topics that have been completely derailed because everyone started arguing about which synonym op should have used to describe their emotional state while getting a customer s order wrong or whatever oh he shouted at his wife now if he yelled or screamed that would be different but he typed shouted now prepare for my multi paragraph analysis where i lay out an entire psychological profile based on a single word choice made while typing out an entire story
man i am finding that i disagree with the top comments in many posts like all of them when it has to do with parenting i don t know what to do with that information other than accept that i guess i m old and either y all are better parents than me or i m missing something my kids seem fine
why do people pretend alcohol is a truth serum do they don t not drink that whole in vino veritas quote is bullshit if it was true people would use alcohol to interrogate prisoners there s a reason why a judge doesn t just give you a bottle of bourbon and ask you questions
it s really frustrating when people refuse to call someone an asshole because they re the woobie https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thewoobie) caution tv tropes link it skews top level judgments constantly if you re not comfortable using the term asshole to refer to the person in the wrong why comment here to begin with i truly cannot think of a way to prevent this outside of requiring top level comments include a judgment or info request
why was the post about a 13yo girl who wrote a name of an actor on a note with a heart removed because of sexualizing minors she wrote his name how is that sexual or was there something in the comments am i missing something
does the thing you did that might make you an asshole have to be something you do to someone like yelling at someone because many interesting posts are about an op doing or not doing something not to anyone but just living their life and then someone gets annoyed at that and calls them an asshole for example bringing a dog into a park without a leash having a child free wedding not owning a coffee maker
is there a subreddit similar to this except where i can ask advice regarding intra reddit drama
psa stop calling posts fake in the comments i will report you every time for being uncivil if you believe a post is fake report it and or downvote most nothing in my life actually happened if i had to go off what commenters think is fake or not
what ever happened to the best of awards weren t those polls supposed to close by mid february
removed
why is this the only post i m seeing
we need polls on every post that have all of voting guide options
hi can i talk to a mod i need a mod to pm me not the one who s being rude and callous though edit thanks to the other kind mod for replying and saying i wasn t fucking entitled to talk to a mod you guys are on a fucking power trip and made me feel very unsafe in this sub you did in fact engage in pm s don t try that the mods i talked to broke rules they were supposed to set your mods are here to help not fucking harass me how the fuck did i get banned i said you did pm me though
hold up rule is never go anywhere without a knife lol
thank you
is it just me or does it seem that lately there s been a lot a lot a lot a lot of relationship problems revolving around young people getting married or having kids in their early 20s is getting married that young a thing again it just seems odd that so many young people s are having unexpected pregnancies i can understand the emotional and behavioral issues because people in their 20s are not fully mature but safe sex exists if you re not willing to deal with the issues that come along with a pregnancy and or a child don t have one
is it possible to find out what was said to be banned it was my first comment so i m not certain i understand the wording it s nonspecific so i don t know what not to do there are so many mean posts out there by commenters just wondering
why can t i post my question
what counts as civil because i was just muted for reasons rule but not specified why it was broken can any mods explain pls christ stop downvoting me i have fucking autism and asked for an explanation and everyone is being aggressive i asked for an explanation to turn it into a learning experience not to get roasted take it easy stop replying to this i get it i literally get it
we should also get rid of the no covid rule because a lot of people s home situations were affected by it but god forbid we say the c word if it s briefly mentioned in a post because it s relevant
with all due respect what is up with the word violation i feel some stories are in too much depth and people need to get their frustration out as much as possible
this is the spiciest thread i read tonight also loving the detailed explanations of rules
there was a post yesterday where the op was the asshole but the conflict was with her two sons who were being misogynists op punished one of them in an insane way the majority of the comments included some variation of the phrase it s no wonder he hates women it s not the first post i ve seen like that either there was a similar one a few months ago again with a mother poorly dealing with her son s misogyny it was the exact same are these types of comments allowed i find it disgusting that it s normal to say no wonder these people have awful beliefs about x group after having two or three bad encounters
unfortunately a huge sector of society has in fact decided that there is no issue of morality beyond is it legal am i obligated to or even do i want to these are the same people who think anything goes in terms of a response when another person is rude careless selfish annoying etc
not now but hoping any such better scheme in future or soon in upcoming times
they miss the fucking point more than that it s usually pretty shitty advice
downvote and replying spreading the word it might get you a handful of downvotes or a whole lot of upvotes but some people need to be told that hey just because you re not required doesn t mean you re not ta for not doing so a memorable meme for this is the walter sobchak rule taken from the big lebowski quote you re not wrong walter you re just an asshole one problem is that readers are selfish and love revenge but the more people who downvote bad comments and upvote more valid comments the less it s a problem
you are going to be so miserable in this sub
generally nta stands for no trolls allowed but is a reddit post which is funny possible to go without trolls
that actually existed a couple years ago it was shp or shitpost why they removed it i have no clue
there used to be a rule judgment like that and it was discontinued
just report shitposts the judgment i jokingly wish we had is ncby nobody cares but you
there already is in the form of the report button we took a deep dive on this subject https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/) in february s open forum
it s called the report button
ppl have been asking for a justified ah vote for the longest time so i ll doubt the mods will include this unfortunately
my icbs triggers are validation seeking posts which the mods here categorically got rid of as a rule violation since anything can happen anywhere all at once so it s not our place to say
icbs is still not there but downvotes can be great alternative like more the number of down votes can be a hint to mods for removal of post
i still wish we had justified asshole or similar even though it would probably get overused
you see the problem was that person mentioned they are jewish the trick to get a nta judgement is to say one of the following i have a eating disorder i have a special diet i am a picky eater i am vegan vegetarian by using one these simple tricks not only you will be nta but you will be showered with love and encouragement x200b on a serious note it is indeed unfortunate
if you can gather links to a few of the posts you think are related send them in a modmail and see what the mods think
interesting do you have any links there s a troll for most things but not sure i ve noticed that one
i want to mention here that anxiety and panic are different things i have both anxiety and panic attacks an anxiety spike is stressful but it s not the same as a panic attack i also want to echo below i think what we re seeing people referring to is moving into an extreme state of emotional disregulation for some of them that might be panic disorder for some it might be other things
i think we re seeing emotional dysregulation as a whole it s incredibly common and can go hand in hand with anxiety and panic disorder and in time it can be helped but it s sure difficult when you ve never faced an experience where it s happening but i m also not a big fan of asserting that x isn t really a panic attack because it s not helpful great it s not a panic attack it s still an overwhelming sense of irritability or impending doom or a post stress trigger etc
i am also wondering about it like in real life i have never seen someone but everyone is getting panic attack every single day
i don t know how that could be enforced though but i agree that some people cling to single words or phrases and over analyse what really makes the difference to me is wether or not the context the whole story supports the interpretation or not because phrasing can say something about the person typing but on the other hand we can t expect people to weigh every word they use and know all meaning that every person would assign to that word especially when an op is not a native english speaker
lol some commenters love to take an inch and run a mile someone was talking about them and their partner disagreeing about their child and at some point the op said my son and the commenters jumped on that as you only think of him as your son like no it s pretty normal to refer to your child as your child when you re telling a story he doesn t have to keep clarifying that it s his and his wife s child we already know that
a while ago there was a post where the op mentiones she finally got her husbands permission to get a dog the comments latched on the word and assumed he was controlling when in reality he probably just didn t want a dog and op pestered him until he caved
guilty as charged blame my law degree but i place great importance on word choice i once based a judgment on the fact that the op referred to someone as their partner s ex when in fact it was their deceased spouse the couple didn t divorce and then one party pass away one spouse passed away while the couple was still happily married i don t remember the situation maybe displaying pictures of their partner s ex in the house but to me it made a huge difference the word they used
by my judgment roughly of the posts on this sub should be esh so you definitely aren t alone in often disagreeing with top comments
i think sometimes people do say things drunk that they d been feeling for awhile but just hadn t said but i think you re right a majority of the time the liquor just makes you behave in ways that aren t true to how you actually think and feel
people do frequently complain that the sub is full of teens with no life experience because a lot of their knowledge seems to come from shows and movies like no just because grandpa willed you a million dollars doesn t mean you re getting a million dollars you might be lucky to get even half that once debts and taxes are settled
removed
i think i m out of the loop what s wrong with tv tropes links
some people are extremely comfortable calling asshole others while others start acting as they have seen dinosaur
not sure about the post but surely something could have been there in comments like some p do doing shitty comment or hater of actor
i m not aware of the post you re talking about but it could be any number of things including comments
i feel like it would go case by case but you could argue things like an unleashed dog are being done to everyone else at the park i guess no coffee is something you do to your guests i didn t read that one
r amithebuttface
can we talk about people making up stories to make a minority group look bad though i see way too many troll posts that are just ragebait so people in the comments can go on rants about how annoying autistic fat trans vegan etc people are and what s scary is that then weeks later i ll see comments that say oh i read a story here where a trans person did this so yeah trans people actually are that bad or my least favorite has anyone noticed how entitled pregnant women have become because they saw the dozens of threads that are about a likely fake pregnant women doing something annoying that s absolutely troubling considering pregnant women have a drastically higher likelihood of being abused or murdered while pregnant we do not need to increase the perception of them being entitled at all astroturfing like this is a huge problem on this sub and it s frustrating that whenever i report obvious ragebait debate threads they re almost never taken down and yes i ve heard the report queue too long excuse i see it as an urgent problem because it seems like it s affecting people s beliefs in real life they re adopting these stories into their politics and using them to be less tolerant towards minority people just because they read an online story that made them annoyed
lmao thank you i see this constantly on another sub i m in and it s exhausting especially given the absolutely wild reasoning they give most of the time
yes thanks for this i try so hard to ignore all the this is so fake comments if you think it s fake just stop reading
thanks for those reports because we ll keep removing these every time we see them too
removed
here they are https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/1041a4g/aita_best_of_2022_masster_post/)!
we have a few in the sidebar but they re all non english speaking ones r suisjeletroudeballe r eusouobabaca r binichdasarschloch r benikdeeikel r akobayunggago
reddit glitch check from a different browser or app and see if it works better
kinda glitch or some technical incosistency try any other device browser if possible
we d love to do that but it s just not feasible at the moment polls are created by the poster and we have no way to ensure that every post has all the necessary options
we do not engage via pm under any circumstances i looked at your message and many mods were engaged you re not entitled to your preferred response and insisting you are will often be met with a cool down period
what s rule number do people still go with knife in world full of guns
if you were able to leave this comment you haven t been banned
if you had been banned you could message the mods to ask about the details i don t think it s possible to cover every possible infliction anyone could ever make though so i m afraid it ll be hard to find a satisfying answer about a theoretical ban
use the modmail link in your removal message
from the civility faq derogatory or dehumanizing language including insults violates this rule this includes stripping someone down to a body part i e you re just a hole for him to stick it in you re not special just because you let someone cum inside you or calling someone a breeder autism doesn t not preclude a person from recognizing crass impersonal language it does not stop people from realizing the person doing the creampie is as much at fault as the person receiving it s awful of you to blame it on autism when millions of your peers can present their ideas with a modicum of class and civility
was it the sarcastic congrats in getting creampied comment cause yeah that s not civil lmao i m not a mod tho
saying the word covid or briefly mentioning it in a post does not result in a post getting removed instead our automod is much more fine tuned than that almost exclusively removing the posts that violate rule there s the occasional false positive and our removal message has directions users can follow to message us to discuss you can read more about that rule in last september s open forum https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/x399by/aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2022/)
personally i m in favor of a slight reduction to the character limit but we ve left it at as that seems to be the sweet spot this is not a rant sub nor is it for someone to give their entire life story an interpersonal conflict should be able to be summed up in a succinct manner presenting the conflict and ideally enough info about both parties for the sub to decide who the asshole was we ve seen some submission attempts that are 10x longer than the character limit that s just too much detail and almost every time so much of it is really not necessary for the conflict to be adequately presented
there s a lot of you don t owe anyone anything here yes that s true but sometimes it makes you an asshole
anyone who posts only your wedding your house your child your rules falls into that sure you can legally make whatever rules you want but that doesn t mean you aren t an asshole for doing that also any not your x not your responsibility sure you aren t legally responsible for someone else s kid but if your sibling has an emergency and they ask you to watch their kid when you re chilling at home you d still be an asshole because you couldn t help a loved one in need
one thing to always remember when you think of taking major relation advice from the internet people who love crafting up elaborate retaliation plots because they aren t the ones who have to deal with the consequences
there are two types of people in world first one are those who really cares about down vote up vote and they should be concerned about down vote but on other hand there are some people who do not even think of count in this
shp existed as a judgment option for roughly weeks total before the team recognized it was rewarding shitposters to leave their posts up and we wanted to focus on discouraging trolls instead that was a little over years ago we took a deep dive on trolls and best practices with them in february s open forum you can find here https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/)
shp for shitposting but it can be funny lol actually i follow some serious shit posting accounts on other social media platforms and they are funny as hell in some leagues
are you aware of the authority which discontinued like some mods or reddit higher authorities have taken that decision
i feel this
or it can be iiamfy which stand for internet is a mistake for you can be short upto imfy
report button is additional task for mods to first review then make a decision
um yeah it s not our place to say because everyone s situation can feel unique to them and it can be hard to see something when you re in the middle of it i always kind of thought the same how can someone not see what seems to be so obvious until our family was in a situation that is painfully obvious now looking at it from the other side but it certainly wasn t obvious during if something reads as validation seeking to you just close the thread and move on to the next post there s bound to be something that ll tickle your fancy
some people are picky eaters due to disorders though like some foods i physically will not be able to eat because of sensory issues or i will projectile vomit but fuck me for being picky
you have an interesting idea of love and encouragement because every time i see a post about picky eating on this sub people always seem to bash the picky eater in question including name calling declaring their hatred toward picky eaters and other niceties
you can generate links or mention if possible to certain posts comments
i appreciate your thoughts on it i definitely would never tell anyone specifically they aren t really experiencing a panic attack because i have no way of knowing it s the amount of posters who claim to have panic attacks a lot of times it s teenagers at school who think being in an uncomfortable situation and not knowing how to handle it is automatically the same thing or a girlfriend who s having a bad day and wants her boyfriend to stay home from work to be with her and thinks by acting more hysterical and saying it s a panic attack he might be more likely to stay x200b it s just a pet peeve of mine i guess you can say it s one of those things where you want people to be able to talk about it so you take the risk of there being a lot of people who are not being honest but the dishonest people also make it really hard to spot the people who are actually suffering
with that specific case there should be two yes s in terms of getting a pet one no is automatic veto i don t think people realize the seriousness of owning a pet
ah yes finally a subreddit for my daily grass related assholery stories
can t post anything there says title doesn t meet sub guidelines but there aren t any edit lol figured it out post title has to be wibt g instead of wibta
excellent now r amitheasshole can focus soley on posts about people not getting invited to weddings
next addition r amithemasshole for discussions centered around either massachusetts or astrophysics or both
will this be for all plant related lawn grievances it will be nice if i can get all of my tree law assholes in one place i need a daily fix of apiarist related asshole stories
this is likely a joke but i d read that subreddit
tree law
how general is the word grass can old hippies complain about new fangled dispensaries or crappy plugs is artificial turf okay or is it a strictly sod sub

inb4 treelaw
i like this one bestestest of all
i love this
i m so here for suburban dad lawn wars
does this new subreddit now include cannabis discussion lol
finally i get to say what assholes my neighbors are for not mowing their grass to a specified height
i was gonna check to see if r amithemasshole exists for road rage related moral dilemmas seems like it was banned for inactivity
i want a r aitabreakups page where when the advice is break up we get an update if they stay together or not
what about a subreddit dedicated to weddings feels like every other post is about messing up a wedding
i figured it would be about weed related aholery but this works too
ah kiss my grass
when you said sister sub i thought it was going to be girl drama like gossip girl reddit edition
no i m afraid that my internet is already full
nice try guys but we know it s april fool s day
yta

now i have the perfect place to find out if i am the grass hole for eating a massive supply of canned beans i found buried under my lawn a few years ago
hoping i can post my community garden disputes there hey dude don t hog the water all day with your wacky irrigation system
ok this is funny x200b the people who don t get it those were pretty funny too
mods will there be a separate sub for the children everyone and under crowd
is this satire
we need that step x family where we can see all related stepfamily with inheritance
i really thought this was going to be a sub about hey man my bro came over that s spotted me hundreds of times i just got some awesome strain and he asked if he could hit it as well but i didn t want to share even though i ve smoked more of his grass than my own am i the grasshole
lol who s asking for this
i m so thankful my husband will finally find the answers and support he needs from others with lawn care moral dilemmas nothing keeps him up at night like trying to decide which pattern he should be cutting the grass diagonally or horizontal this debate has been ongoing for years and i hope he finds some answers
grassholery
there s so many places to add those sub guidelines i think i have it updated the title requirement is the same as here post must start with aitg or wibtg
and whether or not it s ok to not accept your step parents and step siblings
that s what r amithebridezilla is for
or if it s okay to cancel a child or spouse s birthday party
everyone in massachusetts is a masshole what a silly question
as someone on the ma ny border i appreciate this sentiment
i actually interpreted this as a space related before i finished reading the sentence now i kinda really want to see it
don t forget about r amitheblowhole for all the marine mammal conflicts
am i the beehole
absolutely those are allowed as well
r amithecloaca started the same way and it s still going strong
today is april fools welcome to reddit
tree law tree law
that s a good question seems like a great way to let the votes decide i know we had thoughts with r amithebuttface but gave opportunity for the community to guide those choices of what they wanted to see i feel like some of the cannabis angled ones might be a bit harder to keep fun and light and instead leaning into anything yard related would be the way to spread rock gardens and all
okay boomer
crying always yes
as a former new englander that last one made me laugh way too hard
make it happen
i love tree law stuff
baby got vent
absolutely there s tree posts already
the mouth to asshole pipeline
as is tradition the joke is that it doesn t have to just be a joke i expected r amithecloaca to die out april 2nd but it s still going stronger than ever
really it comes up on virtually every thread i ve been waiting so long for a dedicated forum for lawncare disputes
check the calendar my friend
this was posted on april 1st think about it
i didnt ask for it i demanded it
pretty sure folks from the fore won commission requested it
r treelaw probably
who doesn t need this in their life lawn care is essential to keeping one s house looking good
every single person who unwillingly deals with an hoa lol
rand paul s neighbor
it seems like a wedding related sub is in higher demand
me as a native lawn adherent my neighbors just hate it because it s in transition eventually it will look pretty normal w a little more color but not til after like yrs of undulating tufty long spots and she keeps hers in a constant state of butched almost too short to grow i get a lot of side eye
omg how do you get that flair
what do you mean that s the whole reason i created an account
watch out the vertical camp may find the post and then hubby is really in for it
they really need a aita for all blended family issues so tired of them
yes
it was mentioned on a popular post sometime last year and started growing really fast
which is why my first sentence is literally this is likely a joke
the cannabis angled ones might be a bit harder to keep fun and light ok so fun is subjective etc etc fair enough but you can definitely light cannabis
i m just glad that all of those grass related questions will be funneled elsewhere they were really clogging up my front page
my neighbors have a massive fucking hackberry tree that s fixing to fall ft to the lot behind them i was ready to take this seriously lmao
i also was thinking the same happy april fool s day
thanks for reminding me why i stayed off the internet that day
it s real dude and brilliant the timing was a coincidence
underrated reply
it took me a moment to realize it was hindsight is you re right i m on this way too much to not get the joke
they were really clogging up my front lawn speaking of that
be civil https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/about/rules/). please review our faq https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq) if you re unsure what that means plenty of you are managing really eloquent breakdowns without insulting anyone use those people as an example instead of resorting to name calling this sticky is your warning rule breaking comments left after this point will result in a ban
yta without any evidence you accused her of something terrible you were wrong why on earth would she want to be chummy with someone like you you seriously think anyone reasonable would think she is the asshole here her derisive comment was still more polite than you deserved
you re a prior service officer and couldn t think of any reasons why someone would either not want or otherwise not be able to talk about what they did while they were in sounds about right yta
i immediately felt suspicious about this claim as i said j is very demure and she doesn t really have the bravado that is required in the military environment at least i feel like a certain amount of bravado is required what an asshole you know bob ross was in the military right yta
yta thousands of military personnel do not want to talk about their service
former veteran service officer here a lot of women who served in the military are sexually assaulted and don t want to talk about certain aspects of their time in the service also veterans are people who have widely varying personalities outside the military yta
yta and i m guessing being a veteran is of your personality
yta women veterans and active duty get accused of this shit all the time i ve seen clips of women getting accosted by men because they don t believe them you didn t think that she had ptsd or that she just didn t want to entertain you or maybe she s shy instead of just humoring her which is still shitty you went and gossiped about her you just added to that one of my nephews has a mother who is a combat veteran did her tours of service for years in the middle east she is extremely soft spoken shy and turns red as a beet over the silliest things you can t judge people based off of bravado
of course yta and you already know this you interrogated her because she didn t fit your misogynistic views of what a service person should be she literally said this was a bad time in her life and you tried to force it ah
obvious yta and it sounds like you re also sexist so that s fun
yta i m a female marine veteran and don t talk about it much because of the constant sexual harassment i faced and memories of helping too many friends deal with sexual assault a lot of women don t like to dwell on their service and the fact that you don t know that tells me you didn t bother getting to know many female marines
put the crayons down and go apologize of course yta
yta many of us did things we still cannot discuss even with jarheads some of those things plague us a decade later think exceptionally grave consequence need to know and secure discussion area get it
yta oh you did the thing that makes me so special i m gonna make you feel like shit so i m the only special one that s what you did
yta instead of offering an apology you wanted to pretend it didn t happen stand up and apologize
i tried to act chummy towards her and make up for accusing her of being a liar what does this mean did you swallow your pride put your ego aside and plainly apologize
yta yta for suspecting her based on your perception of her demeanour for pushing it when she said she didn t want to talk about it for telling other people she s a liar and for trying to act chummy and make up for accusing her when what you should have done was apologise profusely and admit your wrongdoing you should be ashamed that you even have to ask if you re the arsehole
yta you took her don t want to talk about it as her lying about her service she doesn t fit your idea of how someone who had been in the military would present so of course she was lying not only could you not accept that someone who didn t seem military enough for you could have served but you couldn t accept that not everyone has the same experience or that at j may not want to have the whole rest of her life defined by her military service her experience and reactions to it were not the same as yours and therefore could not have been real
so not only did you call her a liar and make a whole bunch of negative assumptions based on her personality you decided to badmouth her to your school s veteran s affairs organization uhh yeah yta
yta obviosuly doesn t really have the bravado that is required in the military environment
yta and seriously seek the therapy none of this is remotely normal behavior
yta you decided that she was lying based on an antiquated idea of what a veteran should behave like and you were a jerk
wait you re a marine because every single marine male or female i ve met has been a man up and admit your mistake person and you didn t just walk up and admit you were wrong and apologize yeah you re the asshole
yta she didn t have to prove anything to you some people can be in the military and not make it their entire personality
marine you fucked up if only we could imagine why a female veteran would not want to discuss her service i wonder why that would be all of the potential answers are none of your damn business i m on team pound sand apologize like you mean it and leave your fellow veteran alone yta
holy shit yta why are you asking the internet if i did this i d be changing my identity and moving states and starting a new life out of embarrassment
yta you re not the fucking stolen valor police and your reasons were judgmental bs
yta you re not entitled to know the details of her service she doesn t owe you an explanation so her not giving you one isn t an excuse for you to accuse her of lying
yta you straight up called her a liar to her face and couldn t even man up and admit you were wrong when you found out the truth
the next time i met j before our class started i tried to act chummy towards her and make up for accusing her of being a liar she laughed in my face and told me to pound sand poolee and for those of you who don t know yes she was being derisive here do you know what an apology is op contrition explaining your actions and promising you ll do better you fucked up here you re in the wrong and instead of trying to make it right you re trying to paper over this situation by pretending you re friends yta get over yourself and learn basic human decency too bad they never taught you that in the military
yta everyone doesn t need to share every detail of their experiences or answer all of the questions you deem necessary if i tell you ive been to the dentist i shouldn t have provide a list of procedures and show before and after pictures to provide evidence stolen valor is not nearly as common as youre making it out to be
yta as a barely ft tall woman marine veteran i m so ashamed of you people always assume i m not a veteran because of my size and i m an introvert there are many reasons people don t talk about their service first it is none of your business second as a female maybe her service was not as pleasant as yours was think about mst and i can think of a lot worse things she could call you but poolee is pretty good
yta she might be quiet and unassuming because of ptsd or things she has seen women throughout time have been underestimated yta 10xs over learn to apologize rather than act chummy
i love being a senior nco calling a captain an ah so here we are you re a certified ah i enjoyed my time in but some simply don t like talking about it
yta in what reality are you not the asshole
yta for whatever reason she didn t want to share her experience with you she probably didn t want to share it with you because you were acting patronizing because you didn t think that she had been in service
having been a surface warfare officer myself there is nothing wrong with j wanting to keep to herself about her life in the military and majority of former swos especially ones who did not make the military a career would agree it was not a good period in our lives especially since we re on a ship being blamed for everything your sailors do even if they are on shore and out on their own and having to salute narcissists and martinets who would happily throw you under a bus to advance their careers you called her a liar with nothing to go on that judgement other than your own bias more importantly you offered no apology whatsoever she was right to tell you to pound sand yta
yta not all vets are outspoken and loud hell i rarely speak about my time in
yta my father served and he never talked about it never i didn t even see some of his army pictures until after he passed and we found them while going through his things and then you tried to act chummy with her did you actually apologize you are just the ah all the way around
i thought officers were supposed to be like better yta
yta
no question yta ever think she just didn t want to talk about her service which she admitted wasn t a good times especially with some random dude firing questions at her then you don t even have the decency to apologize just gloss over it
yta the liars are almost always the loud ones
so because she didn t fit your ideal type as to what military personnel is she s a liar and then you had the unmitigated gall not even apologize for being an ass and jumping to conclusions i m glad she laughed in your face yta dude
yta just come out and say you don t think women belong in the military your post pretty much screams that
i have a hard time believing you actually served especially at the rank of captain this post smacks of stolen valor you write like a civilian who pretends to know things about the military please stop lying and go back to call of duty modern warfare thanks for lying about your service yta here s a dollop
yes absolutely yta and you know that because you tried to make up for accusing her of being a liar you don t know about her life or experience and all you did was make assumptions about her and judge her
yta it s not your job to police people s personal stories whatever they are
yta genuinely don t get what kind of response your trying to find from posting that i get you prbly have come across people who ve lied about serving but you assumed no snooping you had no proof and just accused her then when you realized you were wrong you acted like nothing happened like were you expecting a different response you re dense man and she should ve been more harsh
yta i ve had this happen to me as a disabled vet it turns out the person that was accusing me was lying about their own service in the end
yta whoops you were a catty gossipy snob to this other officer so much for that bravado
yta she didn t act military enough for you who do you think you are you started to act chummy around her to make up for calling her a liar you didn t even apologize to her you just decided after calling her a liar and realizing you were wrong now you want to hang with her accusing someone of stolen valor right is a big deal and especially when you have no evidence other than the feeling that she s not military you suck learn how to give a real apology and learn how to hold your tongue until you know the facts
yta look i ve never served but i have family friends coworkers that have or are currently and i get stolen valor is a pretty big deal as it should be but maybe you should ve gathered a bit more information before bluntly accusing her of that of course now that you know you re in the wrong you need to actually apologize and hope she ll accept it which she might since she understands stolen valor but you also have to come to terms with the fact that she may not accept your apology and you ve already burned that bridge anything short of an actual apology like trying to be chummy isn t going to cut it look at it this way if a coworker accused you of stolen valor would you be so willing and ready to forgive them if they just tried to sweep it under the rug without apologizing eta the way you make up accusing her for being a liar is to apologize for accusing her of being a liar simple as that
fckin male marines just never change yeah yta you have no clue what she went through a lot of it was probably dealing with numbnuts like you and she didn t want to deal with it again and that s guessing on the innocuous side i had several fellow marines whose lives were ruined by much worse than that and that wasn t enough you went and reported her to your veterans organization at your school because she didn t want to talk about her service with you like that information doesn t have to be verified and then tried to be all chummy after you pulled this shit pound sand poolee is a hell of a lot nicer than i would have been
yta she may look demure but she operated the most advanced fleet of ships
why did you even bother to ask yta
yes yta god nothing is worse than someone who thinks they re better than others because they chose a certain job maybe cut down on the crayons and you ll realize she is probably times the soldier you ever were
so you tried to act chummy but not apologize way to be a grown up female veterans get enough crap w out jar heads like you piling on did it occur to you that she worked in a sap couldn t talk about it ndas are forever
yta lol and you got served
yta and pound sand
yta its not women do serve in the armed forces educate yourself and get rid of the sexism and preconceived notions and you won t lose any of your manhood by being a decent human being and apologizing
yta so instead of apologizing you were patronizing her and playing chummy yta does the military not teach the big strong bravado men to own up to their mistakes and btw do you seriously not know the statistics of what bravado men sometimes to do many women in the military yeah yta
so glad we have such a top notch valor detective like you on the beat baselessly accusing people then getting pissed when they re rightfully pissed by your disrespect insert every ounce of sarcasm possible here yta and pound sand poolee
yta and obviously a sexist just because you thought going the crayon eating route was right for you doesn t mean you know everything about all the different branches of the military people don t owe you shit about their time in service congratulations on making a fool of yourself
yta just because she didn t want to talk about her time served did not mean she didn t serve it just means she didn t want to serve you got called out on being an ass and tried to play it off so double yta
i know your instruction manuals were written with bright colored crayons but you shouldn t need anyone to tell you that you re the ah here
lol obviously yta you re also sexist
you know yta
yta hope you enjoy being ostracized once everyone finds out what you did you are a sad small person
i can t believe you have to ask yta you know you re the asshole and instead of acting chummy you should have apologized
yta not once in anything you said have you mentioned apologizing to j try it mean it
ahahahaha yta not everyone wants to go into details of what they did or where they were not every one is proud of what we as service members have to do think about what her job title was youre also incredibly rude about her soft spoken attitude the military is about diversity im glad youre not active my friends are dealing with enough shit senior enlisted and officers
omg you re the person who gives veterans a bad name so many people don t want to share details of their experience it doesn t make them a phony or their experience any less valid yta and take this as a lesson for your future dealings with people
yta haven t you heard of ptsd and a lot of women have gotten sa d in the military she is blacking out parts because it was too painful to remember what you did to her was awful and then expecting her to forgive and forget by being chummy i see why she told you to pound sand
the military accepts people with all different kinds of personalities we don t all have this aura of bravado and arrogance of swinging our dicks around i noticed you didn t even mention apologizing to her you just tried to be all chummy like wtf how many crayons did you eat during service yta
yta and good luck with your transition to civilian life mba or no mba many organizations will walk a condescending asshole to the door it s time to man up apologize and learn some fucking empathy and humility
so let me get this straight you were trying to show off by bragging about your military career and the girl actually tried engaging with you in shared military service you aghast that such a little lady could do such a thing spent the entire conversation trying to discredit her and then not only accuse her but went into full gossip girl mode when proven wrong you don t even have the dignity or respect to apologize you just expect her to be cool you need help yta
yta such an ah you didn t believe her a woman who served with honor and distinction but you believed it when a man told you so just admit you re a sexist and don t like it when feminine presenting women have achievements similar to your own oh and pound sand poolee
yta maybe she couldn t discuss her service with others even other veterans regardless why does she have to prove anything to you
yta not everyone who served wants to talk about it to anyone much less strangers my grandfather spoke about ww2 once in his life and it was to me and one of my cousins my grandma stopped crocheting and stared my father went to an academy and is covered in medals and awards and won t talk about it to anyone unless it s family and they ask and even then he won t tell the whole story the military scars a lot of people and they aren t up to swapping war stories
you might want to consider your communication style as you re coming across as insufferable and a sexist ah bravado ffs get over yourself and then you still humored her followed by gossiping about her jesus yta
yta i will venture that j enlisted with service in mind and you just get off on wearing the uniform i know who i d want by my side in battle and it s not you you sound like the kind of guy who d hide behind a wall
notice you also didn t apologize after making a complete fool of yourself you tried to just brush it off yta
yta i think you re awfully sexist what does this bravado you speak of look like and do you think this woman doesn t display it because she s a quiet person and on top of that a woman get your head out of your ass and apologise if you don t then i would think that you never served in the military because you clearly lack the bravado to admit when you re wrong
way to make a ton of assumptions based on a stereotype yta i bet when you tried to make up you didn t actually apologize for how you treated her either not that she d need to accept your apology
yta not exactly doing much to dispel the image of marines as sexist meatheads are we
yta did you offer an apology or just tried to pass off your assholiness as a joke and get chummy spit polish your judgemental bravado and apologize yta
yta if someone doesn t want to talk about their past don t try to force it then call their bluff when you have no idea what you re talking about many people have bad recollections from the days they served their country not to mention navy personnel sometimes go on covert or secret missions that are highly classified cannot be discussed without being accused of treason or espionage
oof imagine being such a disgrace to the corps
yta toxic masculinity misogyny semper fu
hahaha yta
so you rudely dismissed her and then acted like her best friend the next time you saw her of course yta and a massive one at that
absolutely yta there are so many reasons that someone may not wish to divulge that information she could have had to leave due to something that threatened her safety due to an external or military service or personnel related traumatic event and so on as i m sure you re aware people leaving the military can suffer from ptsd it s quite possible that she has genuine reasons not to want to discuss this with you for her health s sake even if that s not the case it s none of your business and she doesn t owe you answers it s entitled and very probably sexist of you to demand this information from her because you judged a book by its cover and decided the cover didn t fit the image you held in your head
yta this is so insignificant who cares even if they were lying it doesn t matter
yta veterans very commonly don t talk about their service often the more action they saw the less they want to talk about it not to mention female service members are subject to extra harassment and abuse with terrifying frequency if you want to know who is faking or exaggerating their service it s the clowns with bravado you know she deserves an apology so why haven t you given her one being extra chummy with her is the worst thing you could have done as if she would want to be friends with someone who was an asshole towards her the last time you spoke
yta you got proof you were proven wrong and you owe her an apology better yet just leave her the hell alone
yta you fucked around you found out thank you for your service
yta this is basically the definition of toxic masculinity just because this woman isn t as loud or bossy as you because she s smaller than you you not only assumed she couldn t do the job you also assumed she was a liar you really need to work on that
yta you know that don t know why you would post this here
yta pound sand ya sponge you have no clue why she might not want to discuss her time in service

i have a feeling the boyfriend will be around a lot more often ie move in unofficially if you were to remove your food items nta
nta kyle doesn t live there if his allergies are so severe he probably shouldn t be putting himself in harms way by coming to your apartment
is he on the lease and paying rent no then nta you are you live there you have a right to live there with your food and belongings i think it s great you re trying your best to be considerate of his allergies in your cooking but that should be the limit
nta kyle s not on the lease and this wasn t part of the arrangement you made when you and layla decided to live together a reasonable ask would be to not eat or allow the allergens in the living room or layla s bedroom so kyle has a safe space when he comes over i m not saying that even if you refused that you would be an asshole but at least to ask is reasonable to tell you what you can and cannot eat or even have in the house whether or not he s there is overstepping he doesn t live there and he s not on the lease surely kyle lives somewhere why can t layla and he hang out at his place instead of yours and avoid the danger entirely
nta kyle doesn t even live there if he feels endangered by the ingredients you keep in your cupboard then he shouldn t come over you didn t sign a lease to live with kyle i think the fact that you were adjusting what you d cook when you knew he was coming over shows your willingness to compromise layla and kyle are clearly not interested in a compromise they only want things their way
nta layla would tell me that kyle was coming over well easy solution he _shouldn t_ your environment is incompatible with his needs someone who doesn t even live here beginning and end of this as far as i m concerned
nta he doesn t live there it might be time for layla to move out and find somewhere that will accommodate
nta this is crazy he doesn t even live there if someone has a severe allergy it is their responsibility to manage that not yours a grocery store won t hide all their peanuts when he walks in the door i don t know why they think you should have to change anything the fact that you would change your cooking is beyond nice in my opinion usually people with sensitivities bring their own food containers whatever they need to make it safe for them
nta you re paying the rent he s not it s your home not his i won t allow people to tell me what i can or can t eat or cook in my own home if it s such a problem for him he can just stop coming doesn t he have a home too your roommate can go to his place and they can both stop boss you around in yours
nta you ve accommodated enough especially when he doesn t live there and he s not your boyfriend if the contents of my cabinet make him uncomfortable he doesn t need to be near my things at all this is exactly right he shouldn t be rifling through your things
you know where kyle would be safe kyle s place do you live at kyle s place no then nta
nta does kyle not go grocery shopping what about fast food does he travel in a bubble in case he walks by someone eating a dq buster bar if the allergies are bad to the extent that a girlfriends roommate can t even have these food items simply exist in their own home it sounds like kyle s allergies are probably really cutting into his quality of life and i d that s the case what is in your kitchen shouldn t be the priority also most of those foods are a great sources of protein also so are you just supposed to not get that edit rewording for clarity my brain be a mess sometimes
info how often does he come over nta though a warning before he comes over is really all you need
nta if kyle feels uncomfortable he can just leave
nta kyle doesn t pay rent and can therefore pound sand time to find a new roommate
nta you are reasonably accommodating if they are concerned she can go to his place
nta you pay to live there and are on the lease and he is not they can spend time at his place if they re that worried about the closed contents of your cupboard
you pay rent he doesn t nta though i expect you re going to need to find a new roommate or a place to live as this is not going to end unless they break up
do they think you ll kill him with your selfishness or shellfishness alright i ll see myself to the door thank you
nope nope nope i m anaphalactic to tree nuts and this is not how it works i don t get to go over to a friend s house and demand they get rid of their nutella don t cook with it when he s over i think that s a fair normal compromise and make sure you wipe down the counters just to be safe but anything beyond that isn t really a fair expectation
nta you re the one paying rent not him layla could always go to kyle s if they re so worried
nta they should hang out at his nut free house this is your home that you pay for and if this wasn t agreed upon when you first moved in together they are the ones who need to make other accommodations you tried to be accommodating but now they are acting entitled he s aware there are possible allergens there and it s up to him to be responsible for his own wellbeing
nta you pay rent and he doesn t
nta he does not pay rent he does not live there you do not need to make extreme accommodations for him you already did enough to be nice this is asking too much
nta its your home too you shouldn t have to adjust your living space for her boyfriend that does not live there allergies suck but again he does not live there you should be able to eat and cook however you like in your own home she s the one being inconsiderate if shes so mad about it she can pay the money to get outta the lease and go live with her boyfriend edit also he could ya know not come over like would it be that hard for them to go somewhere else
nta you pay rent there and kyle doesn t you do you
he doesn t live there he is not on the lease if he can t be in a space that has nuts then she needs to go to his place instead you have just as much right to eat cook and live how you want nta
nta you ve already accommodated him to a reasonable extent and them expecting you to never have any of those items in the space you pay to live in is ridiculous especially since he doesn t life there if they re really that concerned they can go spend time at his place
nta his name is not on the lease the reason his name isn t on the lease is that you didn t agree to have him as a roommate you eat there every day as expected he certainly shouldn t be read your lease and see if there are any clause s regarding having as house guest over too frequently he s had these allergy s all his life one of his number one rules must be stay out of other people s kitchens fridges cupboards
nta not at all people with allergies are allowed to expect people they re around regularly to make reasonable accommodations for them but they aren t entitled to force everybody else they encounter to radically change their full time diets for them if he is so allergic that he doesn t want to even be around those ingredients then he has the choice to limit his exposure to the rest of the world he does not have the right to force the world to adopt his dietary restrictions
nta your roommate should recognize that you shouldn t have to accommodate her boyfriend if she wants the house to be allergen free she should at least prepare to make you an offer like buying and preparing all your foods from now on then at least you are compromising
nta he doesn t live there so you don t have to be considerate of him if she has an issue she can move in with him let your landlord know what s going on as well
he sounds nuts and rather shellfish
nta it s your home not his he doesn t have to be there they can meet at his place or out in public
nta they seem like they re really overreacting
nta like you said he doesn t live there he is not entitled to anything in your home unless you say so
nta maybe the way you expressed yourself was a little hard but my guess is they have been nagging you over and over kyle and your roommate can hangout in his free nut place
i have life threatening allergies and have had to use my epipens on multiple occasions i m on a bucket load of steroids to try to stop my constant reactions and my life is completely dominated by this nonsense so i feel entitled to an opinion this is not your problem if he s worried she can go to his place you are not dating him if you were dating him then it becomes your problem because you re likely to kill him with a kiss but you re not he knows where the door is and should make use of it if he s genuinely concerned nta edited to add obvious verdict which was so obvious i forgot it
so why can t she spend more time at his place you pay half the rent that entitles you to half the livable space
by your roommate s and her bf s logic he can t be in grocery stores because of his allergies or in most restaurants just say that you re nta
overwhelmingly nta of course i just want to add that it s nice that you want to fix it with laylah so i just chime in with a suggestion of just apologizing for the i don t give a crap thing as you obviously do care and have shown it by being forthcoming in changing your cooking plans for the times he s around but that s honestly as far as your care can go show laylah that thread and that should set her right good luck
nta i have a severe food allergy and i don t allow it in my house or let my husband eat it in case he forgets to brush his teeth then kisses me has happened before but i don t tell people not to have that food in their house i warn people to not let it touch my stuff but they are welcome to have it since it s their food
nta he doesn t live there he doesn t need to go into your apartment at all problem solved
and in fact i would put up a sign on front door and in apartment that notifies guests that nuts and soy used in that location laminate etc let landlord know what s going on just so they can t claim deliberateness or carelessness if something were to happen
nta and i say that as someone with an anaphylaxis level allergy to shellfish those of us with food allergies pretty much the only place we can usually count on to be allergen free is our own homes he doesn t live there you are already being reasonably accommodating by not cooking allergens when you know he s coming over honestly for his own safety he probably just needs to stay out of your kitchen again he doesn t live there and he s not your guest so managing what foods are safe for him isn t your concern and he doesn t need to worry about what you do or don t have as someone with a life threatening allergy i know that when i go out in the world it s my job to protect myself i don t expect everyone else to change around my needs
why does the guy who doesn t live there and doesn t pay rent make the decisions nta it s a new relationship why don t they go to his place
i haven t looked at the comments so i may be off in thinking my opinion is unpopular but for me nta you pay half the rent for the apartment and are entitled to cook and eat what you want you have already been accommodating by not cooking with allergens when he s coming over and not eating food with allergens around him if layla wants an allergen free setting for her bf then she and him can find their own apartment your comments may have been a bit harsh but it seems like you ve been holding back for awhile and finally lost it
nta i know the intensity of allergies can vary but he should be able to deal with certain foods exiting in a place that he doesn t live my roommates cook shellfish and i have a shellfish allergy and it is okay they let me know when it s happening wash the dishes and cookware immediately they even let me know if they have recently microwaved or used the toaster oven i m not a doctor so maybe my opinion is ill informed but if you are keeping the food separate and all parties are being careful i think nta
nta at first layla would tell me that kyle was coming over and i would just adjust whatever i was planning on making this was the way this right here he isn t on the lease not gonna be on the lease so what is stored in your home is your business if he s that nervous then clean out cabinet that they can keep food in and tell them keep out of the rest as it is still your home and you pay rent to rest and store those things if she keeps pushing back i d talk to the landlord about a new roommate
nta but refrain from saying you don t give a fuck about the allergies tldr your friend and her bf shouldn t be dictators you shouldn t sound dismissive of something so severe but it s understandable why you said it my gf has severe allergies and this is a step too far but it s slowly escalated and now they want me to not keep any ingredient in the apartment that could cause him anaphylaxis even if i m not actively eating or cooking it while he s over speaking from personal experience having a clearly labelled packet that s properly sealed should be enough and it s very reasonable to not cook and aerosolise allergens when he s round communication is key and good i still personally eat eggs and nuts despite my girlfriend being allergic to them the main difference in our situation is that she s my girlfriend so if i eat something she can t have i have to make her aware of it and then don t kiss her etc until i ve cleaned my mouth out however since you re not in a relationship with your friend s bf you shouldn t have to worry about this sort of physical contact etc
nta kyle can go fuck himself and stay at his own house
nta natural selection states you roommates bf should not come to a place you pay rent for
they re laying the groundwork for him to permanently move in and you don t realize it yet
nta he does not live there nor does he pay rent if your food makes him that uneasy layla can go to his place instead
nta he doesn t pay rent so why does he get a say they could go hang out at his place or somewhere else
speaking as someone whose husband has a life threatening allergy to shrimp you are nta that is your home you pay a lot of money for it and have the right to live there as you like i understand you have to make some compromises with your roommate as she lives there as well however her boyfriend has no say as he s not paying the bills there it is up to the person with the allergy to manage it my husband and i are very careful about where we eat and what we order because of his allergy we have to go so far as to ask if the restaurant frys it s french fries in the same oil as the shrimp even though we are really careful we know things can happen so we have his epi pen as backup which luckily we have never had to use the world doesn t revolve around your roommate s boyfriend and his allergy it s his responsibility to manage it not yours
tell him to have his epipen ready or hang out where he actually pays rent
nta they are being unreasonable but in reality i don t think this roommates situation is going to work out she s not going to suddenly agree with you she s only going to resent you and your feelings of annoyance are only going to grow too i would try and figure something else out for the long term maybe those two can move out and she can sublet her room or you could move out and sublet yours to be clear you are totally in the right and they are ahs but just because you re right doesn t mean it s going to end in your favor y all are not compatible as roommates
they re being very dramatic and insisting i m gonna kill him with my shellfishness ftfy but in all seriousness nta
nta as long as you are doing what you can to ensure he doesn t get exposed to cross contamination you re doing everything fine you even adjusted your habits to ensure he didn t get exposed when you were cooking you giving a reasonable accommodations they re giving you an unreasonable expectation
nta he doesn t pay to live there he gets no say on what you can and can t have you were already being nice to adjust what you were cooking when your roommate said he was coming over if they need to fuck someone over that much they can fuck themselves at his place
nta you are nut the ah and i don t think you re being shellfish at all
nta does kyle live there and pay towards rent and utilities no he doesn t layla should go over to his place instead if the food you make is that dangerous for him to be around
dad with a son with severe food allergies x200b nta x200b all you should ever be asked to do is to not have things like bowls of nuts out that other people could eat then touch something that would cross contaminate or to put his allergens in food you re cooking for him but that doesn t mean you shouldn t be making whatever the hell you want for yourself whenever you want the correct answer here is difficult but if it s so threatening for her bf to be in the same house with allergens he shouldn t be coming over x200b doesn t he have a place
nta
nta stick to your guns if they want to have total control of the apartment and what people who live in it do and eat they can both rent theirs tell her that unless his name is on the lease and you re no longer supposed to pay rent he is her guest not a housemate whose needs must be accommodated
nta move out depending on where you live you can often break a lease without financial penalty if the landlord can rent the place out without undue hardship eg if it takes months to find new renters in vancouver there is a rental crisis so there would be a lineup out the door of new renters for example
nta technically but you really could kill him if his allergies are severe enough if she is serious about this guy then they need to move out to their own allergy free place
info how together is you and your housemates food storage and could it be kept more seperately
nta he is not a resident nor tenant if he has such an issue go to his place sheesh i am sorry you have to live with such a clueless roommate for the next months
nta he doesnt even live there he has no room to dictate what you keep in your pantry if hes so afraid of dying then maybe ur roommate can go to his place instead
nta he has the choice not to go over there he is exposing himself he is putting his own life at risk
the allergies are kyle s allergies he doesn t live there these conditions were not part of the agreement when you became roommates your roommate needs to make accommodations for kyle s allergies like going to kyle s place you do not nta
nta you re right kyle doesn t live there and isn t entitled to dictate what you eat or store in the kitchen you pay for your roommate was within her rights to ask but cannot demand that you not buy the food you like had she made this a requirement when you agreed to be her roommate you probably would have never moved in with her so she s crazy if she thinks she can demand this now your previous accommodations were reasonable and considerate but that s all they should expect from you if kyle cannot come over with your food in the cabinet then it sounds like kyle shouldn t come over anymore
what if it was cats their demands are unreasonable nta signed someone with severe allergies to soy and nuts
i guess this dude doesn t go to restaurants or parties if his allergies are that severe layla can go to kyle s place
he doesn t live there and doesn t pay bills there he gets no say over how you live in your own home that you do pay for she can go to his place or they can get their own together if he s so fragile hard nta
nta if kyle wants to have any say on what happens in your apartment he should start paying you rent
it takes a lot for me to side against the person with allergies because nine times out of ten someone is just blowing off their serious medical concerns this is not one of those times nta this guy isn t your roommate and you ve been more than accommodating with your previous concessions adjusting what you cook when he s coming over is pretty much the maximum they can reasonably expect you to do to make this guy comfortable and they should both be appreciative of it
as someone with severe allergies nta unfortunately the apt just isn t a safe environment for her bf and so he just shouldn t go over yes it sucks but it is what it is he s going to have to learn to be proactive with his safety and not expect it from acquaintances if y all were like family i could possibly go n a h just roommates nope he gotta go
info what s kyle s living and career situation given you showed you were willing to compromise and they abused that to push even further and try to make the apartment good for kyle to live in can t help but feel that if you cave on this kyle will be living at your place nta
not his house not his say and layla is being unreasonable expecting him to get special treatment in a house he doesn t live in
nta i would tell her that when you signed the lease there were no food restrictions tell her if there had been a food restriction you wouldn t have signed a lease with her as she s the one trying to amend the lease unofficially the cost is on her to move out
nta he doesn t live there
sounds like she s trying to move him in nta but i would see about options of getting out of your lease if it escalates maybe the landlord would allow kyle to take over your spot if that s what they are trying to do
well nta but that doesn t matter if you want to fix things it must be extremely hard for kyle i can t imagine going through life with allergies much less ones that are that severe you should probably speak to layla and kyle apologize and confirm there is absolutely nothing that will help the situation do you have a patio if you buy a strong cooler can you move items out there to prepare for kyles visit so technically not in the apartment what about vacuum sealing or keeping items in your private bedroom how does kyle visit restaurants or how did he handle it when he just started coming over let them know you definitely do not want to kill or harm anyone kyle included but that you are open to solutions that do not involve you discarding ingredients or just not eating foods you like can they stay at kyles for a week or weekend so you can nuts soy and shrimp that week but not the next now with all that said after your lease is up i absolutely would not speak to layla or kyle again they have no right to be aggressive or insist you are going to kill kyle it s over the top before they even tried to find alternatives
it is a shame he doesn t feel safe i guess he should not come over anymore nta
nta you said it yourself he doesn t live there he s in charge of his health needs where he goes not you
nta i can t be around meat that being cooked if it s fragrant so i just avoid eating meat and avoid being in a place where the smell would bother me and if i decide to stay there and get violently sick it s my own fault you are being more than accommodating by agreeing not to cook things that could cause him issues to be inhaled when he is coming over unless kyle is paying rent he has no say in what is in your pantry and even if he was living there on the lease it s still unacceptable i ve lived with people with the same kinds of allergies we just made sure to label food and separate cooking utensils to avoid cross contamination i agree with the person who said it sounds like she is trying to push you out and move kyle in on the existing lease don t let her
nta not what you signed up for your roommate needs to move out
nta kyle doesn t live there you do kyle isn t on the lease you are he is the guest of your roommate not your guest you already were being accommodating to ask you for more is selfish on layla s part
nta if he was a roommate i could understand and you are being accommodating but they want all or nothing
nta in any way shape or form
nta if they believe that his allergies are that dire the safest thing they can do is spend way less time in your home because your home has nuts and soy in it bf does not live there and you were already being incredibly accommodating of him before his demands escalated make it crystal clear you will not be changing your own diet to match his preferences they need to stop asking you to baby proof your house for a grown ass man your roommate is being ridiculous
why aren t they going to his place this is absolutely unreasonable nta
nta you should probably start looking at another apartment living situation and have someone take over your lease
nta if his allergies are that bad then he shouldn t come over she can go to his i don t see why this is a problem
absolutely nta he is not a resident and is free to leave your roommate is the one that needs to leave your place to accommodate him
you live there he doesn t you have made accommodations to not prepare food with his allergens when you know he is there you are doing a tremendous job nta if they are uncomfortable or worried they can get together at his place or a hotel or anywhere else they want to

nta i would make it clear that the use of your property and the furnishings were your donation to the cheerleading team as the fundraiser is no longer for this same team your donation is not applicable
nta this was a bait switch you agreed to having a fundraiser for the cheerleaders at your property not the football team
nta you were doing what you were for the cheerleaders they are massively screwing over the cheerleaders this should never have gone for another vote the perceived less important thing always gets screwed you were right that s exactly how the cheerleaders would feel let them find another venue you were doing this for the cheerleaders good for you
nta you agreed to host a fundraiser for the cheerleaders not the football team they changed the conditions and they can live with the consequences
deleted
nope and good for you you did all the work but the football players need it more was a disgraceful move by the coach and you don t have to go along with it your property your conditions nta force the idiots to reverse their decision and give the money where it belongs
nta they can hold the event at the school for free
nta you agreed to let them use your property for a fundraiser that would directly benefit school activities that your family is involved in it is completely delusional of others to think that you would continue to host the fundraiser when the fundraiser was altered to no longer benefit school activities that your family is involved in
nta they should hold a seperate event for the football team it s crappy that football is placed above any other activity in school
maybe they can have the fundraiser on the football field
nta you intended to host an event for cheerleading and not football now that the event priorities have changed your space is no longer available if they can change the reason for the fundraiser you can decide to back out of loaning your space
nta time to go commando and do a private fundraiser because they re just gonna keep pushing the cheerleaders aside for the sports
nta so they voted after they found out it was going to be a success how many cheerleaders verses the football players varsity and jv the cheerleaders would always lose the vote they also called for the vote after most of the work was done leaving them with very little to do male athletics have always gotten the majority of funds versus female athletics they ran a back door plan to get what they wanted at the expense of the cheerleaders so wrong of them doing that don t blame you a bit for refusing to have it on your property with the games they are playing
nta it s your house and you can rescind the invitation if that s what you want to do
nta you offered your home under the impression that they fostered that proceeds went to the team you actually have a vested interest in had they stopped to think op is donating use of their property because they have a child in cheer will they still if no money in going to cheer the obvious answer there is no or at least you would not be at fault for backing out it was on the pta to say we put it to a vote we want the football team to get the money can we still use your property we fully understand if you say no because the football team isn t what you signed up to help
it may look like an asshole move but it s not the agreement was fundraising for cheerleaders on your property free of cost pta knowingly took an vote to destroy the hopes of a team in favour of another that s bullying it s your property you can do as you please and no one has the right to judge you edit nta
nta it s like they did a bait and switch on the cheerleaders including your kid nothing wrong with you changing your mind since someone else changed their mind and moved football in from to the previously planned fundraiser for the cheerleaders
nta anyone who promised support has a right to withdraw that support for whatever reason and i don t see how it s true at all that anyone s work was thrown in the trash all they have to do is find another venue as you said or find another way to sell the crafts they made such as online also whoever sells anything has the right to do whatever they want with the money as long as they don t perpetrate any fraud on the buyer
nta you organized for a cheerleader fundraiser the football team can do their own fundraiser it was a bait and switch and these are the consequences for shady adults
nta but if bridges are burned and you are kicked off anyway i d be going nuclear with notifying the community of this shitty vote and not to support the fundraiser let the football team wash fucking cars
nta they changed the agreement you changed your contribution they don t have the right to volunteer your property
nta i do not understand why more people who contributed to the cheerleaders did not stand up with you over the bait switch changing the purpose of a fundraiser after months of planning is abhorrent
nta but if you really want to be petty say you will allow it for a hefty sum and donate that to the cheerleaders
nta and thank you for standing up to this it would be better if you held an event the same day for the cheerleaders and families on your property a picnic or something the bridge doesn t have to be burnt
nta you agreed to use your property and furnishings to raise money for cheerleader uniforms they changed the fundraiser to something you did not agree to to me they broke a contract which means you re no longer bound to your obligation
they said it was a vote and i was acting like a dictator that i can t overrule the will of the majority we voted to use your stuff so uh let us use your stuff for a reason other than what you agreed to you dictator nta
nta you can t change the rules in the middle of the game and they did it s misrepresentation at best fraud at worst you d do well to distance yourself from all if it they fafo sucks to be them they can deal with the consequences of your actions you offered your property with the understanding it was to benefit the cheerleaders it now is now and you no longer want to offer your property your decision and it doesn t make you an a hole to withdraw the offer
nta you agreed to use your property as a venue for a cheerleaders fundraiser not football if everything is subject to change in this instance the actual fundraiser then so can the venue moreso because its your property and its your decision
nta this is a disgusting trend that s all over the us schools put the majority of the extra funds into their football teams and leave other sports and those who don t play sports in the dust frankly fuck them you volunteered your property for the cheerleaders because they needed new uniforms instead they voted to give the money to the football teams which in all honesty probably receives the vast majority of funding in the first place
they can use your property if they pay rent donate rent to cheerleaders
nta my property is only available for the use of fundraising money for the cheerleaders new uniforms our agreement was made as such i never agreed to donate my property for the use of raising money for the football team i have a vested interest in the cheerleading team which is why i was willing to not only donate my property and furnish it but also my time for set up and clean up if you want a place to hold a fundraiser for the football team find somewhere else
nta it is do gross how much athletics and especially footballs gets placed above all at schools you never agreed to hosting a football fundraiser
nta your house can still be used for the cheerleader s drive it won t be used for the football drive if they ve changed the event they ve cancelled the contract not you
nta i would ve done the same you offered to rent your property free of charge on the basis that they would use it for new cheerleading outfits they ve now gone and screwed over all the hopeful kids by changing their side of the bargain and now they must pay the price
if only there was a large open area accessible to a football team where a fundraiser could be held for the football team nta
it was a vote and it is your private property though i d be sure that you should consider how it will affect your child football cities sometimes bully kids nta
nta and good for you girls need this kind of strong support
nta cheerleading is personal to you because of your child and because you know that many school programs take a back seat to funding when the football team has its hand up you donated the use of your home for a specific fundraiser and have every right not to donate to a different cause that doesn t mean as much to you
as someone who was in marching band and thus basically part of one of the least respected physical activities nta i would suggest doing a fundraiser completely separate from the pta that s how we always earned money for our uniforms and other needs
nta you agreed to help the cheerleaders not the football team i think it s fair to stick to the commitment you made and i hardly think the football team will go without funding you re also not overruling anything you just removed the location they can do what they like just not on your property
thank you for standing up for these girls
nta your property you get what to do with it what you want
nta they changed the scope so they get different resources end of frankly you and the others who wanted the cheerleader fundraising can just go ahead with a separate cheerleaders fundraising football has their own
nta this took an unexpected turn i was really looking forward to calling you a cheertator torrance i agree with other posters to make clear your donations were for cheerleading the school can revive the donations for the sport intended or receive nothing at all
nta is it spiteful maybe do i care not one bit it s your property you agreed to help your daughter and the cheerleaders but it was highjacked by some dillholes who realized that the event would make actual money and redirected it to the football team screw that if i was on the pta i would also pull out everything i had done the football team can make their own event
nta and you didn t screw over anyone the only people screwed over here are the cheerleaders who now know first hand the reality of female centred sports getting passed over in favour of male dominated sports
well this is one i m glad i read beyond the title because hoooooo boy i was a band nerd in high school and literally a similar thing happened to us we sold those stupid sausages and cheese and candies and did carwashes and everything because our band uniforms were like from the 1960s seriously i wore go go boots it was bad the football coach pulled the same line and literally every cent we raised went to buy new football pads because their stuff was gasp two whole years old clearly i never got over it lol so nta thank you for standing up
nta since the pta pulled a bait an switch and broke their word you are withdrawing your contribution it s a completely normal consequence to the pta s actions you wouldn t have offered your property if the fund raising was for football in the first place
the deal has changed nta let the football parents man up and host
figure out what new uniforms would cost and offer to rent them your locatuon for that price also nta
nta this is all too common unfortunately especially when it comes to male vs female sports my own high school took funds from the field hockey and winter guard teams at the last minute to buy new helmets and team swag for the football team this was over years ago and it still angers me because neither the field hockey nor winter guard team had that much funding to begin with and were always having to raise money on their own if they want to change the fundraiser s goal then it s perfectly reasonable for you to put your foot down here do not let up on this for the a holes
nta you agreed to donate your resources to the cheerleading team the pta doesn t have the right to vote how you want your resources used and as a person who wholeheartedly loves his football team and throws ridiculous amounts of money at it football teams don t need to take resources from other sports to get funds for new gear in most places they already get a portion of the schools budget for equipment replacement and facilities ticket revenue from games equipment fees charged to the player s parents booster dinners the equipment manufacturers themselves often have grants and discounts for football programs with financial issues you school football team should be using the resources they already have before going imperial and sucking funds away from other activities especially because the cheerleaders are at every football to support the team the coach should show a little support back
nta i m sorry but i see this s where i live too football always come first the cheerleaders are treated like an afterthought each and every time we had a similar situation where we raised money and worked hard for new uniforms and the league refused to contribute even a penny so cheerleader parents had to struggle to raise money but the football teams all received new equipment and uniforms the same year i may also mention the cheerleaders registration fees were twice as much as the football players and my child was not even given a set of pom poms parents had to buy their own for each child they were a lousy and the league didn t pay also cheerleaders were always required to be at every game and event but football players didn t have to go support the cheerleaders at their competitions or anything because they ve worked hard all year and they re tired that was my child s first and last year cheering i refused to contribute to an organization that made it clear that the cheerleaders weren t important or valued they just took our money
nta the pta is being ridiculous why don t they just host the event on the football field lots of room parking and seating
if the fundraiser would specifically for the cheerleading outfits why was football even brought into the conversation yeah that s not fair at all on the cheerleaders you ve stood your ground and rightly so
was it a dick move yes would i have made that same decision also yes you never agreed to host a football fundraiser on your property you agreed to host a cheerleading fundraiser just let them know when they have a cheerleading fundraiser your property is back open nta
info i m curious what grade level is why is the pta even involved most high school sports and activities have booster clubs that handle the fundraising and distribution of funds pta isn t even involved if the softball booster club plans and hosts a fundraiser and baseball needs money for uniforms they just can t take it from us
it s hardly dictatorial to rescind your property use donation when the fundraiser has materially changed nta let them hold it on the football field ps the focus on male football players and the fact that cheerleading is largely about fawning over them is one reason some us oppose the sport i know this is an unpopular opinion i d rather see girls actually competing in sports than cheering on the mostly boys teams but the overall point i m making is given the focus on football and on the boys this vote to change the fundraiser is not surprising cheerleading doesnt matter to them either because it s about the mostly girls
nta they changed the parameters you adjusted your involvement accordingly they have no right to expect you to maintain your involvement when it s not directed at the cause you signed up for any more you might have chosen to use your position as the owner of the venue to leverage some benefit for the cheerleaders alongside the football team but you were totally within your rights to just nope out and let them find their own damn venue
nta i would withdraw my financial donation as well seeing as it was for the cheerleading uniforms not the football team no offense to the football team but when i give money i intend it to go to what i give it to
nta now the pta can disappoint the cheerleaders and football
nta you signed on to do a fundraiser for the cheerleading team not the football team the individual teams need to be hosting their own fundraisers not stealing from the other teams
nta you agreed to provide your property for free for the cheerleaders you never agreed to provide property for a fundraiser for the football team you are under no obligation to hold up your end of the deal if they aren t going to hold up theirs end of story and for a little extra fun and pettiness maybe arrange like an overnight camping sleepover for the cheerleaders on your property maybe to help brighten their moods after the bad news
nta i love it when people think they can say all of us over here agree you have to act in this way so you have to do it it s literally your property what are they gonna do
nta thanks for sticking up for the cheerleaders maybe you can find a way to raise funds outside of the pta how to tell these young girls that they aren t important the parents that were okay with this switch should be ashamed of themselves let them use the football field for their fundraiser
nta we need to stop allowing women s sports to not get support my bf has two daughters who play volleyball and basketball this year the girls basketball team won state and hardly any students showed up they only posted once on the school social media but a week later when the boys hockey team started in the state playoffs there were three posts every day telling people to show up at their games and they didn t make it past the first round is a joke
if money time and property was donated for one purpose and the purpose changes isn t that fraud
nta burn down the patriarchy one dishonest fundraiser at a time
nta remind the pta that elections have consequences they voted so they can now live with their choice
did they even ask why i d be annoyed to hell if i d ordered a band of cheerleaders and a busload of footballers turned up good work nta
what the fuck isn t it fraud to raise money for a specific purpose and then just use it for something else nta
nta they didn t even ask if you would be alright to use your home for the footballers they just assumed they could use your house for whatever purpose
not only was this a textbook bait and switch tactic but it reeks of misogyny and discrimination it s not just the needs of a football team suddenly being prioritized over the needs of the cheerleaders it is a group of underserved people women in sports being robbed of a benefit so that a group of stereotypcially privileged people men in sports can benefit at many u s schools this would be grounds for a title ix grievance title ix being of course a federal law you are nta but more importantly you are a hero to those poor girls i would take this to the press
you didn t screw anyone over those who voted to replace football equipment instead of cheerleading outfits did you signed up your property for a cheerleading fundraiser not a football fundraiser you don t have to donate the use of your property to the football fundraiser the people who spend money for this fundraiser can always save those items for when an actual cheerleading fundraiser is held did the football coach also expect the cheerleaders to work on this fundraiser can you plan the same kind of fundraiser on a different day for cheerleading nta
nta i m a music band choir mom football always seems to come first with schools
nta you are right to be pissed if the football team needs funds let them organize their own fundraiser you have every right to remove your support and should
on behalf of women athletes everywhere thank you nta i can t tell you how many times we have gotten by while watching flat screens being installed in the football change room change has to start somewhere
nta as far as i m concerned they cancelled the thing you volunteered your property for also as a former high school football player we were required freshman jv and varsity so kids to do door to door fundraising and our parents were constantly harassed to join the football booster club and donate more money and time you would be named and shamed at practice if your parents didn t volunteer donate in addition to this every player s family had already paid equipment rental fees for the year and our athletics programs were pretty well funded by the district plus ticket sales brought in money the concessions were donated local businesses paid to advertise with signs at games and everyone working at a game who wasn t school staff was an unpaid volunteer my point being that football programs have way more opportunities to make money than cheerleading programs
nta
nta you offered the use of your property for reason a they changed it at the last minute that s on them
nta you volunteered your property for a fundraiser for the cheerleading team not for the football team
this was a slimy move by the football program and they should be ashamed of themselves nta it s your property and i think you made a nice show of support for your daughter s team
and shit like this is why i never volunteer for pta anymore nta they changed the plan last minute so you as a private citizen are free to change your plans last minute and if i were you i d resign effective immediately if you can because it will get worse
nta it s only a highschool but this could be classified as charity fraud as people had donated for cheerleading not football you can t just change what your raising funds for when people start donating money that is illegal it may be different in your area and if people haven t donated yet it s not a big deal but either way you don t have to use your house if you don t want to
nta anyone that supported the decision to take the fundraiser away from the cheerleaders after getting their hopes up should be ashamed of themselves
nta you agreed to allow your property to be used for the fundraising towards the cheerleaders uniforms they changed the fundraiser to be something you wouldn t have agreed to that s not fair the majority voted the the majority can afford a new benue or you can charge them the price of the cheerleaders uniform and then it s a win win
i need an update on this asap
nta and by the way hell yeah way to stand up for what s right that always comes with consequences
nta are some of the people who donated time and money pulling their donations as well because i surely would
nta the fundraiser was planned for the cheerleaders now they suddenly changed it vote or not doesn t matter with no regards of how the cheerleaders will feel about being a second choice again also feels a he ll loft of misogynistic tbh the conditions under which you offered your property has changed so they should have asked you first if you re still willing to have it there instead of being all pissy now obviously it ll be sad for those who spend lots of time money on it but that isn t really worse than the upset cheerleader kids is it
nta not only was it underhanded of the coach to suddenly need new football equipment it was misogynistic to assume that their need for equipment is more important than the cheerleaders who actually had to work for it if the pta can change their minds you can damn well too please stick to your guns
imagine a last minute vote that took the funds from a fundraiser from the football players and gave it to the cheerleaders yeah i can t imagine that ever being done nta tell them you re going to use your venue for a rummage sale in hope of raising enough funds that the cheerleaders won t feel completely devalued eta anyone that says you re a dictator tell them you vote they have the event in their property
nta so after all the work was already done the football coach suddenly noticed the team needed new equipment right this reeks of sexism the pta is telling the girls they are less important than the boys the work was bone to benefit the girls and suddenly the boys are going to reap the rewards how typical tell the board to shove it
nta you had no control over where the funding goes but since it s your property you sure af have control of one place is isn t held if the ones who voted to change where the fundraiser money goes are mad they can open up their properties and host the fundraiser absolutely nta i hate schools like this our football team was legit the worst one in our region maybe won games a year i was in marching band we dominated show after show after show in our region and got top marks in almost all aspects all the time until nationals but every year the crappy football got new equipment and our band teachers had to buy field paint to mark football field lines around the school grounds so we had somewhere to practice when football team was also practicing don t ask how old our uniforms were it s a touchy subject eta it s sad we prioritize teaching kids how to cuncuss themselves throwing balls around oversized fields over literally anything else in school
nta you absolutely get to rescind the offer when things fundamentally change for example charity we re buying food for starving homeless children will you donate money to the cause you yes charity we changed the plan instead of feeding homeless kids we re now throwing a pizza party for wall street investment bankers hand over the donation you promised you no charity you re a dictator
nta the cheer leaders should strike and refuse to play for a team that stold from them those girls need to get a spine unless it is texas then they need to get out
nta fuck football
nta can definitely tell who is all for football in these comments though
nta you agreed to host an event to raise money for cheerleading uniforms the event was fundamentally changed

nta i m really sorry to hear that the blame for this is being placed on you it must be weighing very heavy on your conscience but in my opinion i don t think you are to blame at all i think you are well within your right to have your own little space while you share your room i think nearly every person on earth would put on headphones at night in that situation including the people who are blaming you for it who s the person who turned off the light the kids were supposed to have on no one s blaming them no plus people can t just bounce responsibility of their kids off onto somebody else without even explicitly asking first it s not like your were asked and given instructions on precautions to take with the kids sucks what happened to the little one but at the end of the day shit happens kids get hurt and like my granny always said it ll be gone before their wedding day
nta you weren t babysitting relatives dumped their kids in your room and expected you to take care of them it was just an accident anyway if they want to point fingers they can go home and take responsibility for their own kids also if you are supposed to be babysitting tell your uncle what your rates are and double them since they have you on duty overnight
nta you weren t babysitting you were being forced to share space the best thing would have been for the kids to stay with their parents regardless they have no one to blame but themselves for what happened as did they just expect you to sit and do nothing all night
nta you have been forced to share your room with the visiting children no one discussed the concept of you babysitting said children so there s no reason to expect you to have taken any special level of responsibility for said children you are in your own room living your life as close to normally as you can in the situation it s unreasonable of them to have expected you to just fully think about any possible implications and assume responsibility for other people in general but you sound like you re a teenager ergo still a kid yourself and it s even less understandable to assume another child would just innately assume responsibility over everyone else in the room without a discussion about it and there s no valid reason why you shouldn t be able to listen to stuff on your headphones like you normally would _unless _ you had explicitly been asked to and then agreed to act as a semi sitter for those kids not on you it s an unfortunate accident and i d suggest the only reason anyone is even blaming you at all is that it s really natural to look to blame someone something when an accident happens it s not the girl s fault she was scared or trying to get your attention it s not gravity s fault for pulling stuff down so by process of elimination this means it has to somehow be your fault except it s not and that s all just a string of fallacious thinking this isn t anyone s fault it s a freakin accident
nta why the f can t this aunt and this uncle let them sleep in their own room what s their responsibility they too lazy to fkin care about their own kids it s not your responsibility they forced you into this they didn t give a heck about your opinion the real idiots here was who the heck turned off the bathroom light and who the heck didn t tell you these kids had issues with the dark it s not fair to you buddy don t worry
nta it wasn t your responsibility considering you weren t told to babysit and i m sure you didn t even think about such a thing happening they re lucky you re even cool with sharing your room in the first place i don t think you re to blame and they should have calmly had a conversation with you after the fact to ask you not to wear them again instead of ganging up on you
nta you weren t babysitting them though they were sleeping in your room that s all if they needed to be watched all night they should have been in a different room
nta fuck that noise they can care for their own kids
nta you are right and should let them know you were not the babysitter if the kids need that much assistance at night then they should be with their parents
this was a random accident they are giant ah for trying to guilt you you were not on babysitting duty when it happened and could not be expected to be listening as you were not in charge of the kids nta
nta you weren t babysitting and the kids are the responsibility of their parents i feel bad for your cousin but it was an accident if they wanted you to babysit that should have been made clear there were other adults in the home who should have been listening for their kids
info what brand of noise canceling headphones are so good that you can t hear a screaming kid i seriously need a pair that good oh and nta
nta you were never asked to babysit they can t put this on you if these children are so young that going to the bathroom in an unfamiliar house scares them they should be staying in the room with their parents edited typo from can to can t
nta whoever switched off the light and didn t make sure there was a nightlight there you weren t told you needed to be there to supervise and you were being polite by wearing your headphones however next time if there is a next time maybe you should ask for a torch in your room as a backup for the littles incase the light issue happens again
info what brand of noise canceling headphones are these they seem very effective info what kind of namby pamby kids are these ok some kids are too short to teach the light switch but cannot climb a ladder come on babies too young to walk can climb a ladder
nta family can be for sure they are most likely upset with the events that gathered them and this unfortunate accident could ve made them tip over the edge if nobody stated you were supposed to be looking after these kids while they slept in your room then it s on them to make sure the children are safe and sound they didn t want to deal with little tantrums or find a damn flashlight or nightlight for the kids to sleep with their parents that s on them it is sorry that someone got hurt but in absolutely no way was it your fault that kid couldn t go pee because big scary dark bathroom but not big scary ladder kinda odd but sure kids are weird everyone needs to calm down a bit think about what was said and prepare better for next time i hope someone steps up for you this is the most i can do
nta you were not asked to babysit them they were not your responsibility
what headphones do you use i ve never heard of one that could block a kid screaming out
nta they are blaming you for them forcing you to babysit while they get a free night not your children not your fault not your responsibility did they inform you that you were supposed to be babysitting were you supposed to assume that you would know that is why you were forced to have them all in your room not your fault
i wonder how old this kid is that she couldn t figure out how to use the bathroom in the dark if you hadn t been playing games with headphones you d have been asleep and the kid still would have climbed up to get you
nta if you were supposed to mind them someone should ve mentioned it to you
nta the kids all should have been placed on air mattresses with their own parents it is ridiculous to expect that you would supervise five children who are not yours it was their parents job to supervise their own children not yours
nta you weren t babysitting it s not your responsibility they re just mad at their failures and are projecting it onto you your family uncle especially should be ashamed
nta these kids weren t your responsibility they were their parents and we all know damn well they dumped the kids in your room so they wouldn t have to deal with them
nta i would be asking where my babysitting was if they were expecting you to stay up all night to watch them especially with an upcoming funeral where i assume being the young ones usually comes with pole barring duty at funerals it was an accident these things happen and honestly if little one was that scared at night she should have been staying with mom and dad sounds like tensions are also high since it s also a funeral everyone is here for and a dislocated arm now isn t helping the stress uncle needs to chill but i assume it s his daughter so he s frustrated again should have made her stay with you dad bucko this will pass just give a general i m sorry i didn t realize i was on babysitting duty honestly just to get this dumb drama over with but you aren t in the wrong or an asshole
info how much were they paying you to babysit their kids
nta it s not your fault everyone of those kids have parents it s the neglectful parents fault it s because of their own selfish reasons they have a hurt child you are an easy skapegoat to blame
nta you re not the babysitter this is on the parents if their kids aren t able to sleep and use the restroom on their own they should be sleeping with their parents
nta if you have a kid who can t turn on a light and or pee alone you keep them within reach hearing distance especially in someone else s home nta at all i would still say this if it was my own kid hurt
nta if the kids need that close of supervision then the parents should keep them nearby or at least mention it to you maybe a hotel would have been better for their needs
info what brand of magical noise cancelling headphones are these that work so well that you can t hear a kid literally climbing on the bed you re in and screaming for you i ve never heard of a pair that good
nta i wouldn t let them stay at my home any longer your home and you did use your head by having headphones in
nta parents need to stop expecting free childcare from others not my circus not my monkey
nta were you being paid to babysit no were you asked to babysit did anyone actually demand you babysit no then you are not the babysitter hate to break it to you but floor space isn t the only reason the kids were out in your room the unspoken expectation is that you would watch them all night every night you did not turn the light off you took steps to ensure you would not disturb the sleeping children it would be different if you were asked told to babysit but you weren t
nta but i wanna know the brand of those nose cancelling headphones for my next flight
nta they re blaming you for their negligence if they expected you to watch their children they should have asked you to you can t see the future and shouldn t be expected to know when children are going to suddenly need you when you had no idea they were your responsibility
nta but more importantly what kind of noise canceling headphones do you have i would love to own a pair that would cancel out the kid falling off a ladder dislocating shoulder type noise
info what is the brand of headphones cause if they block out the sound of children screaming i definitely need them
nta they are not your responsibility they have two parents and you aren t one of them it s unfortunate that someone was injured but you were sleeping not babysitting
completely not your fault family sucks bro dont feel guilty at all
pretty sure the parents would have been mad at you for not wearing headphones while playing video games in your own room after their childrens bedtime one of those damned if you do damned if you don t situations you re nta the parents should have been responsible for their own children i probably would have complained about having little kids sleeping in my room and requested that i get the guest room the parents of the kids can also sleep on air mattresses in your room and the other adults can have the couches in the living room why would they put small children in a room where they could potentially get hurt i feel like it was inevitable that someone would try to climb up to your loft bed
nta this is so not your fault and it s crappy that the adults in your family are placing the blame on you if these kids are so little that they re scared to get up to pee they should have been sleeping with their parents and not in your room
nta they are the ah for dumping their kids on you your room and expect you to take care of them without even informing you also why do they blame you when it is an accident and again not your responsibility
nta they re all little kids little kids often need someone in the night whether that s help finding the bathroom or they re scared because they had a bad dream or they need yet another drink of water or wet themselves or whatever the parents of these kids know this their job as parents was to make sure there was someone in earshot yeah that should probably have been you but they d actually need to ask you to do this and not just assume that you d be responding to their children s needs in fairness to them they probably didn t guess that you habitually used noise cancelling headphones that would block out the sound of a child calling your name but they still should have asked you rather than just assuming that you were listening out for them
nta their children are not your responsibility they were trying to dump their kids on you for the night well they f cked around and found out they won t do it again if they try remind them about this time and that their children are not your responsibility and you will be wearing noise cancelling headphones again
nta your uncle should use his head and know his kids need him in the night so should sleep in his room
nta i d always make sure can hear my kids and if they need a light it s on but that s cause i m the mother i don t expect a teenager wanting peace to be the same
nta if a child isn t old enough to be able to navigate the bathroom on their own that child needs to be sleeping in the room with their parents
nta but damn i need to know what headset your wearing that you didn t hear a screaming child not that it s your fault i just want to block out my partners snoring lol
nta if they re little enough that they can t go to the bathroom alone they should be sleeping with their parents and not a teenager who has not been asked or even been informed she s expected to babysit
nta at all but share what headphones you use because i need a pair toddlers can scream hecka loud and shrill
nta and i would wear headphones if they were my kids or would ve just left them in that room by themselves i would never let my 16yo son or nephew be responsible for kids under the age of that ridiculous
nta why wasn t a night light put in the bathroom and bedroom of a strange house for kids in kindergarten and under seems irresponsible of the adults involved your parents and the aunt uncle
nta if my brother said something like that to one of my kids i d escort him to the curb them using your room was a big imposition them expecting you to watch a roomful of kids was not acceptable their children could have slept with them the sleeping arrangements were convenient for the adults your uncle needs to grow up and take a parenting class
nta they didn t particularly ask you to watch them plus youre not their parent nor caregiver i feel horrible for the kid bc she dislocated her arm but i dont think that it was your fault
nta im so sorry youre dealing with this
nta if the kids are so young scared of hallways and doors and the dark they should have been with their parents shame on them they are blaming you because they were being bad parents it s truly ironic that your uncle said you should have used your head when he clearly didn t use his
nta you aren t responsible for a hoard of children parents need to watch their own kids or pay a babysitter other kids are not free labor
nta fuck your uncle to
nta i ll never understand the obsession people have with making the older kids babysit for free

nta it s their kids they could at least pay you to babysit that many kids at once if they insist you babysit but that s just my opinion
nta they re just looking for someone to blame it was an accident and it s not your fault if it s anyone s fault it s whoever was supposed to leave the light on or whoever forgot to tell you you were babysitting or whoever thought it was a good idea for tiny kids to sleep separate from their parents in a strange house
info what size is your lofted bed i ask because if it s larger than a twin then your aunt and uncle should have probably been sleeping there while you slept wherever it is that they were sleeping instead
info what noise canceling headphones do you have that can completely drown out a screaming child
nta it isn t fair to blame to blame you at all and they probably know it deep down i m guessing they feel guilt on top of the grief assuming they loved the deceased which might explain why they re being such assholes they owe you an apology
nta because you weren t supposed to be responsible for everyone else s kids but i d like to know what headphones you use because those are impressive
not the asshole you weren t told you were supposed to babysit and if their kids are that young anyway they should ve been sleeping in the guest room with them you did nothing wrong your aunt and uncle are the assholes for blaming you you re not these kids parents and i love your dad for standing up for you and what s right also i m sorry for your family s loss
nta their parents were in the house and you re not their babysitter
nta like your dad said it was not your fault or responsibility why the hell didn t the parents keep their kids with them they can wake up and take their kid to the bathroom if it s necessary not you tell your father what your uncle said to you maybe he ll kick them out of the house
nta the are just for assuming you were babysitting there kids are their own responsibility good dad
nta and i d say you re right i m an a h i guess next time we just won t put all the kids in my room since i m so irresponsible putting the kids in your room made it easier for the parents except when it wasn t
nta your uncle is a dumbass
nta coming from a parent of two teens this is on the parents for putting their kids in the room with you and expecting you to watch them
nta x10000 as a mom i don t assume anyone else is responsible for my kids unless i have explicitly spoken to them about it i have preschoolers so i only let adults watch them because that s a lot for a teenager i also always try to brief my children when they re going to be in a new environment including who to ask for help where everything is etc hopefully they ll learn in time to run this mental checklist on their own there s many many little things you try to teach your children so they can be safe clever respectful and resourceful the adults in this scenario did none of those things and assumed you would babysit you literally couldn t say no where else were you going to sleep no no the adults are responsible and need to act like it
depending on the state you probably could not even legally be left with the care of so many children under the age of this was wildly irresponsible of the parents nta
nta you were not babysitting these kids end of story
nta you weren t officially babysitting they never asked you and it was just the night where you re supposed to sleep nobody asked you to stay awake in case of emergency it s incredibly stupid of them to just decide that the kids sleep with you they could have had their kids in their rooms or even same bed when i was younger and we visited me and my sister often shared bed with my parents
nta you were not being paid to babysit them the parents are responsible for their own children
nta kids are noisy and the parent s should be available accessible and clear on the rules if their children are very afraid to sleep in halls or of the dark they could ve asked to switch rooms for restroom access or squeezed into the guest room and had a parent sleep in the hall area with them they really shouldn t be in a room with a ladder because even without headphones you could be sleeping or in the bathroom yourself if you babysitting was the excuse they should have paid you x5
what kind of parent is your uncle going to be if bullying his nephew is his go to for his own parenting mistake everyone is probably on edge and upset they did not think through the sleeping arrangements or the affects that sleeping in a strange place would have on young kids mistakes happen aggressively laying the blame on someone else has so many red flags i hope the little cousin s arm is better and the uncle can reel his anger back a bit to get through event
nah you weren t aware that you were supposed to be babysitting your cousins no one told you that so you did what any teenager would do put on headphones and did your own thing it super sucks that your cousin hurt themselves trying to get your attention but that could have happened anyway the world is random
nta parents need to actually parent their kids
nta completely not your fault
nta
nta wtf unless they tell u hey while they re in ur room ur responsible for babysitting them then u have no responsibility to that like i hope the kid is ok but their kid their problem
nta you are allowing them to sleep in your room and have not been hired to babysit if you were babysitting then you would be getting paid no changing hands means no babysit and absolutely it does not mean you are on pee patrol
nta you were never asked to babysit they can t put that responsibility on you when you never agreed to it this was an accident and you shouldn t be blamed for it like you wanted it to happen they should ve figured out some other arrangement for the kids cause forcing them on you was just stupid idk what word to use but you get my point
nta it really sucks for the little girl but you just didn t know and weren t told you were babysitting
nta you were not babysitting tell your uncle he needs to learn to take out his wallet if he expects you to be in charge of the kids
nta kid was stupid and did stupid stuff cuz kids do stupid stuff and hurt her arm she s gonna be fine parents are stupid for leaving little kids who are in an unfamiliar environment and are known to be stupid about decisions cause they are little the parents are the assholes here you were not babysitting they are not your responsibility send your uncle this thread
of course nta
nta you weren t babysitting if they wanted you to be responsible for the kids rather than just sharing your room they needed to ask and pay you unless they hire someone to babysit they are responsible for their own children
nta not once were you even asked to watch the kids not once did they offer payment for babysitting it s not your issue that someone turned off thier life nobody informed you that they were afraid of the dark the only ah s here are the parents who think they can foist thier kids on a teenager and not give the teenager any type of information
nta if no one stated assumptions or gasp asked of what they expected you to do to care for their children then no hell i m and will wear them when traveling with people who snore so i don t have to hear them it s your room it s not your job to babysit them when you were never asked to do so
nta you are not their free babysitter
your uncle needs to learn how to speak to you what an ass nta
nta
nta i don t get it why didn t the kids sleep in the rooms with their parents i have kids and we always share a room with them even with family so as to not disrupt people s normal routines we are fine with it even when we are offered other rooms someone else has to move out of their room we don t take it

now this is absolutely the most interesting post i ve seen here in a while i am forever jealous of your cheetah friend out of curiosity does your zoo pair them with a pup
nta for all the y t a let us put it in perspective an ambulance is carrying a patient from one hospital to another the patient is stable for now but that can quickly change you must transport the patient as swiftly and safely as possible you are driving the other two emts are somewhat new the patient suddenly defecates and urinates himself it stinks terribly the others want to hurl do you pull over or continue do you pull over and do you wait to air out the cabin the patient could suddenly have a severe medical issue and die what do you do any emts what would you do
this seems like part of the job i think it should have been made clear beforehand that this is a risk but this is sortof like a refuse collector complaining about the smell it s understandable but maybe you should be a sommelier not a zookeeper time nta
nta i ve done animal transports freezing wet smelling horribly the animals come first there is no waiting you make it as short and as least stressful as possible for the animal people can deal with it awesome that you stopped for them to hurl i woulda passed them a bucket all the y t a s coming from people who have never worked with non domesticated animals
the bigger issue for me is her trying to get you to stay to air out the truck sure fine she had to puke and you pulled over but that can be considered an emergency stop letting the truck with two highly poachable animals inside air out for another hour not a chance i don t work with animals but it doesn t surprise me that someone may throw up the first time when they re really hit with a smell like that however if that s what they want to do professionally she needs to learn to soldier through it she s not gonna be able to air out the truck whenever there s a bad smell nta
nta the smell is part of the job she ll get used to it in time
nta it s too bad megan was sick but the cheetahs were in cages and likely ill and terrified they needed to reach their destination as soon as possible had megan really been too ill to continue she could have stayed at the gas station and alternate transportation for her could have been arranged making the animals suffer extra should not have been seen as an option and she is surely in the wrong line of work
nta you re zookeepers animals are going to do what animals are going to do this sounds like a normal part of a job that is sometimes stinky sounds like megan and perhaps seth should find a different career
nta animals poop and pee it does not smell good that s the reality of the job
nta animals come first in that industry even stopping for minutes could add much unneeded stress on those animals who are already known to be very anxious not everyone is cut to be in that industry for a reason just like how not everyone can be a surgeon people saying to forget the animals are putting aside the biggest factor in this question
nta that s life of transporting an animal she has to know this i m a population ecologist and i ve definitely just forced myself to deal with all the awful smells of animals i would not wait to pull over i would not just sit there for an hour while it airs out this position does not work for her
nta she chose a job involving large animals with bodily functions and accepted the overtime for the trip the cheetahs needed to be moved expediently and with as little shipping stress to the animals as possible so they didn t become ill op was being a good steward of the animals they were entrusted to move longer time in the holding cages more stress on the animal and the possibility of it injuring itself or falling ill due to stress lowered immunity it sounds like megan isn t cut out to work with large animals if she couldn t handle the smell of normal big cat bodily functions without becoming ill perhaps she will grow into the role but unpleasant smells getting pissed shat and thrown up on are all a part of working with animals as well as the possibility of getting clawed bitten nipped or kicked stomped and occasionally helping deliver young animal work is smelly dirty and often dangerous but the welfare of the animals must always come first or a very close second to a handler s physical safety
info is the intent for megan to work with big cats at all if so i thought this was something all big cat keepers had to go through haha i know i threw up times my first week working with lions but they never gave me any breaks or help enduring it and said eventually i d acclimate if i stuck with it finally i did sort of but whoof it took some time i ll tell you that if not then ywbta don t put people through that smell who don t need to deal with it as part of their jobs
you transported cheetahs not house cats having to transfer them outside of a controlled environment such as a zoo could also make them anxious i would imagine like get some emu bags for your van and like vicks vapo rub i hear it can help with strong odors edit on the i don t know how to strike out but i read in a comment down that you can t use this so i take that back like i m sorry she got sick it s no fun but this wasn t a transport that was meant to stop and move an animal from one cage to another so you could clean the cage in question nta note i have no zoo experience but this screams she was just so unprepared for what to expect edit to ask we re they sedated in any way i imagine that their dosing takes their weight species and length of trip into account when dosing them if they were wouldn t it be best to ensure they complete the trip while still at ease
i don t know enough to judge but this post does make me more happy to know that some african countries apparently use cheetah poop to punish convicted captured cheetah poachers
nta i ve worked with animals all my life the priority here was transporting the animals as quickly and safely as possible as harsh as it sounds she s gonna have to get used to smelling horrible smells
nta if she can t handle the heat she needs to stay out of the kitchen all the people voting y t a don t seem to understand that a wild animal being transported in a crate needs to be in that crate for a little time as possible
info what is company policy for pulling over with an animal
former keeper here you are definitely nta i would have gotten into the far right lane told her to puke out the window and kept driving animals are the priority over our comfort
nta this is such a weird niche task in a very specific career field that i would definitely side with an experienced professional zookeeper is it a thing everyone can do no is she a bad person for not being able to tolerate this part of zookeeping of course not it just means she needs to get used to the very specified requirements or rethink her career choice
i m going with nah i get that megan seemingly wasn t prepared for the smell and as someone with a sensitive stomach in that sense i definitely empathise with her after a certain point you really can t force yourself not to throw up if you definitely are going to so in that respect her needing some air and whatnot is reasonable she can t control her body s reaction and presumably she didn t know how bad it could smell in a confined space and that she d react that extremely so i get it but animals gets stressed sometimes easily as i m sure you know better than i or most people do being confined for hours and being driven for hours must be stressful to them and it was important to get them to your zoo as soon as possible so you can get them in and settled delaying it by another hour or so isn t in the animals best interests which is pretty much you guys job i think it s unfair of megan to treat you differently or blame you for putting the animals needs first since stress in animals can be a big deal but maybe she doesn t blame you maybe she feels embarrassed or something even
nta in cases like this animals first
i grew up on a farm got shoved over by animals onto a floor that was an inch or more thick with manure they need to accept that this is part of the job and it is gross but it comes with the territory
nta i work in the industry too and for our rescues we literally only stop for gas and to pee because we do long trips sometimes and you switch sleeping on and off with your colleagues you live with the smells and if there is people waiting back to unload you can t really mess with time too much cheetah poop is definitely one of the more wretched smelling poops i will say
info i m scared to ask but is cheetah crap really that much worse than a housecat s i mean it s a cat but bigger right i m surprised even seth was retching i would think zookeepers are pretty desensitized to this stuff
nta but maybe keep some barf bags in the vehicle for this very reason
nta animals are stressed during travel but next time get some masks with p100 organic particulate filters i use those when cleaning chicken coops and it makes a world of difference
nta i read a post a few months ago about a zookeeper having difficulty keeping relationships because of the smell they carry on them and their clothes many zookeepers chimed in and agreed it s hard to date outside the field so it sounds like a smelly job megan will have to get used to it it sounds like you went well out of your way for them keep some masks and vapor rub for under the nose for the next newb you bring on a ride along
i can t believe it is within your procedures that you can just pull over and start moving and cleaning cheetah crates surely that adds an unnecessary risk to the transport not least of which is the risk of escape or injury so nta for refusing but i think you are that you ended up giving in
info was it impossible for her to say stick her head out the window or have anything to put under her nose to help peppermint chapstick etc i think it does come down to whether or not she knew what she was getting herself into and whether or not there was any other way for things to deescalate
nta it comes with the work honey
nta i might have voted differently but several experts in the field explained everything very well and i get it
nta she better get used to the smell or find a different vocation
not disagreeing with thr nta judgement but i don t understand everyone saying megan should find another career she s new and probably still learning can t we allow people some time to adjust to new challenges before we give up on them i especially don t understand blaming her for throwing up which is human reaction out of her control
nta this is such a common thing if you can t deal with the animal smells don t work at a zoo some animals came smell even worse then the shit coming out of them like fox s they piss on absolutely everything it s just apart of the job
nta the yta people obviously have zero animal experience in anyways it s unfortunate she got sick but it happens she isn t the first and won t be the last and assuming the animals are sedated in some respect time is a factor
nta
megan vomited inside the van why couldn t she roll down the window and vomit outside if something smells really bad then you pinch your nose and breathe through your mouth don t know why she didn t do that
my understanding is that smells are simply something that those choosing to work with zoo animals must endure if your chosen career is to work with animals you have to realize that comes with poop even having a house pet keeping an eye on feces as indicators for health or illness is needed that s gross but we do it for our furry friends now multiply that level of grossness by a lot to get to large zoo animal poop issues if a zoo worker can t hack poop they may need to reconsider some things
nta cheetahs are nervous animals at the best of times and the poor things could not have been having a good day getting them to the zoo was the priority
nta wild cheetahs i probably would have kept driving if i could handle it tbh i m assuming there are windows stick your head out you re not a dog catcher here
i used to work in a nursing home some jobs require you to be acclimated to bad smells
you are zookeepers this really comes across to me as part of the job the animal comes first nta
nta don t cheetahs get like anxiety and stuff seems to me going as directly as possible makes the most sense for especially anxious animals i m sure it stank real bad and i feel for your coworkers but it seems like a smelly job overall so
megan is in the wrong line of work nta

nta getting the animals back sooner rather than later was more important than your co workers delicate senses yes they smell very strong but come on these are zoo workers they need to learn to deal
nta why should the cheetahs be forced to stay in the crates longer than expected or required when you take a job that involves animals you can t just stop doing your job because it smells and eat away at the company s money you have to do the job and if you can t handle the smell then that may not be the job for you
nta
i mean i feel like you could have pulled over for a minute for her actively vomiting but otherwise i can see how it s to be expected in this field
nta stinky messes are just a thing you need to get used to if you re working with animals
info was she aware that animals poop i m honestly not sure she know nta
nah honestly i don t think anyone is on the wrong side here you do what you have to do for the animals and deal with the smells as best you can the problem is that for some people that smell is way more overwhelming than it is for others so i understand the vomiting and the being standoffishness too i think it s just one of those things where people learn their limits for some folks that will be plowing on through and for others it will be getting out the van vomitting and never coming back to that role again
nta animal smells kind of go hand in hand with animals yeah it s unpleasant but that s kind of comes with the job she might look back fondly on cheetah smell when she needs to clean snake poop
definitely nta weren t you guys on the clock too i can t imagine your zoo would have been too happy with you racking up overtime hours waiting for your new coworker to be okay and extending the time the cheetahs were in the transport the animals always come first they re already so stressed out being wild animals and not knowing what s happening to them maybe this just isn t the job for megan
nta this wasn t an emergency the less time the animals spend in the crate the better wild to me that they d work with animals and be that sensitive to their smells
nta because this is part of the job but if she s new you could have chosen to go with the potty break which you say is common practice ahead of this and possibly avoided this i agree seth and megan need to get used to the aromas around zoo animals but it can be a lot i m sure when you re new
nta unfortunate but this is something better for her to find out sooner rather than later
nta but tell them to do what other people who have to deal with horrible smells such as decaying bodies do keep a jar of vick s vap o rub handy put a thick blob of it under each nostril i worked in a hospice for the elderly when i was in grad school and i used that trick sometimes when i had a bad mess to clean up it won t eliminate the smell but it will definitely make it more bearable
nta if megan can t take the good and bad of working with animals she should find another field of work to go into if i m correct in my assumptions these cats were put to sleep in order to handle them why would you extend the time that the animals are out as i m almost sure that the longer they are knocked out on meds it s not good for them op will know not to let megan ride along next time
nta you weren t trying to make her sick and what happened sounds like part of the job it doesn t sound like an easy job she might not be a great match for the cheetahs and need a different type of animal to start with
i cannot fathom wanting to be in that line of work and not having a strong enough stomach like don t they go hand in hand nta
nta how long did they want to keep these animals in a cage in the vehicle that isn t good for the animals and while i do feel for them both that they were so affected by the smell it s part of the job and they shouldn t be angry at you for it
nta
nta not a keeper but i d think you d need to deal with a lot of smells feces urine and other unsavory things when working with animals good learning experience for how grueling the job must be
nta sounds like megan needs another job this one is definitely not for her i am actually angry that she expected you to put the animals welfare aside and cater to her make sure the next person she has to interact with is aware of her sensitive nose and stomach but she sounds like even if she had a to office job she d still find something to complain about
nta this seems part of the job to me i did a hour drive with domestic cats half way one had an accident luckily they are domestic cats and i had put them in a harness before the transport cages it was still the most tense few minutes in a motorway service station trying to keep the cat calm clean them up and the cage i can only image this was incredibly amplified on all counts with a cheetah but as i said i assume that s the job maybe get some sick bags and febreze for the newbies from now on
nta transportation is all about the animal and keep them as low stressed as possible stopping and waiting and forcing them to wait longer in a crate isn t good for them these two coworkers were not a good pick for this run plain and simple i feel sorry for them sure but shit and it s smell is part of working with animals pro tip keep a bottle of vicks vapo rub in the trucks to rub under your nose then wear masks over it it doesn t stop the smell but it sure helps
nta i ve done animal transport dogs cats birds goats beavers nothing large like this tho i ve been sprayed pooped peed skunked etc i ve damn near pissed or shit myself on longer ones the animal is priority not the people it sucks for sure but it is what it is
nta she needs to learn that working in zoo medicine or zoo anything is not for the faint of heart smells comes with the job
nta i can t imagine you can just wait around with cheetahs bad smells are expected to come with the job i recommend wearing a mask with a few dabs of friars balsam or compound benzoin tincture on the outside near where your nose sits that s what we use in the operating theatre for bad smells like fournier s gangrene or necrotising fasciitis we had a horrid abscess on a lady last week that when they started to drain it smelt horrific friars balsam did the trick i would be interested to know if it works against anal gland funk when the vet squeezed my dogs anal glands i started retching that or fourniers necrosis is the worst thing i have ever smelt
honestly happy with how different this post is i don t normally see posts from zookeepers so this was pretty cool and i am so jealous i d love to grt into this type of career and work with these types of animals but i d likely get fired within the first seconds of my first shift because i had to pet one of them nta anyone that works in a zoo or has looked into will be saying nta the animal s come first travelling is stressful for humans imagine how it would be to be an animal stuck in a cage for hours in end with barely any room to stretch and move around animals poop they make messes yes the smell is atrocious but stopping to let a van air out for hours on end with two very large cats stuck in a crate or on a leash is literally a recipe for disaster and beyond cruel to those animals if megan can t handle putting the animal over herself then this may not be the field for her it s like parents that can t stand baby vomit or poop y all made a choice deal with it lol
i feel unqualified to judge so i m just gonna say i m so happy i live in a city and work in an office that is not the life for me
nta animals are the priority maybe keep some gas masks in the van for next time
nta but i do think the best thing you could ve done was wait to leave until you were sure they d relieved themselves you d be getting back late anyway what s it matter if it s slightly later
nta ywbta if you subjected the cheetahs to extra crate time entirely for the comfort of your colleague
nta part of the job really
nta wtf did these people think they were signing up for
while i can sympathize with megan i definitely think you re nta you needed to get the animals from point a to point b as quickly and as stress free as possible for their sake megan should get used to situations like this if she wants to have a future in your industry and with big cats
nta you were prioritizing the animals cheetahs are super prone to anxiety as well so the journey would have already been stressful for them and making it longer by the woman barfing didn t help also seth is kind of dumb saying they could wait to leave until they went before leaving as if these wildcats are potty trained
i used to work on a farm animals smell and they shit and then once you clean the shit they shit again i ve transported animals and it was always get them in the cage and go straight there no stopping for anything get it over with asap you are nta and i would suggest alternative careers for the other two people transporting animals is not a good fit for them
nta megan should pick a different profession
nta the animals are the priority always either talk with her about it gently ofc to say you didn t mean to upset antagonize her but the animals are a priority and this is something she ll get used to with time sometimes it takes someone putting things into perspective for us to understand we were being unreasonable even if we didn t mean to or just let her cool off and things will sort themselves out with time but you weren t ta at all you re seasoned at your job and you did exactly what you had to do animals come first always
nta sounds like megan needs to find a new job
i m confused how would you make a cheetah pee on command you would just load up the animal when it s time to go and go on your way i m assuming the animals weren t on exhibit that day to prepare for transport so it seems unlikely you could get an animal to urinate when you wanted hey cheetah pee right now before input you in this crate good boy
info could she have rolled down the window for air and to puke outside the vehicle
nta megan sounds selfish the animals should come first
yeah she might need a new gig i work in post mortem tox if the smell bothered me i d quit not complain nta
nah from what i have seen from other zoo people is that this is normal and a part of animal transport however you should go talk to her and explain that you said yourself she is new to the field and is probably not used to it she probably feels hurt that the animals feelings discomfort came before her rightly so in this situation you as a higher up should have a chat with her about the experience and ask her if this is really the career she wants to work in no matter what you are doing working with animals is a hard job she will have to deal with bad smells illness harm in some cases and death if she s going in a bad mood over something like that then she perhaps should look into another line of work
nta stressing out the animals for an extra hour because they smell terribly would be cruel and unsafe she needs to get used to the smell of animal shit and piss they can reek the animals come first she might want to consider another line of work if she can t deal with shit piss and occasionally blood
nta when one works with animals one needs to deal with what animals do the eliminate and they spray when stressed as you said healthy cheetah poo the best thing to do with the animals is to get the transport over as fast as possible so they can start getting into their new home sometimes that means dealing with the stink left by the animals in the vehicle if your colleague can t handle the smells left by animals maybe they are in the wrong line of work and should do some job counseling
nta when you have animals in transport or care they come first it sucks that this happened but shit literally happens and there is nothing you can do about it you could have waited for them to go before you put them in their crates for transit but anyone who works with animals knows that s no guarantee entirely possible they could have gone potty at the zoo and then again in the crate in which case you would be out even more time than before maybe consider keeping some nose plugs in the transit van
nta animal welfare comes first with non domesticated animals it s literally part of the job
well megan that s what happens when you have a cheetah crated in a van instead of it s natural habitat perhaps science isn t the best field for you to be in
mostly nta since bad smells are part of being a zookeeper and the animals needs come first however i do find it a little problematic that when your female coworker is complaining you just seem to think she s being dramatic and annoying but the second your male coworker complains about the smell it s suddenly a valid problem that you have to deal with right away of course this one random situation might not be reflective of the way you usually deal with women in your day to day life but if these sorts of issues come up frequently you might want to reconsider the way you view and interact with women
if they can t handle the job then they shouldn t be doing the job i mean your going to get all kinds of stuff like that from the animals and you need to suck it up and deal with it because you signed up for the job so you got to put up with what comes with it
i don t think you re an asshole that s part of the job and one she knowingly signed up for plus you were already working late
nta i do rescue transports there isn t much stinkier than sick pelican shit or cormorant those critters come first if you re going to work with animals get used to the smells i would have rolled the window down and told her to puke out the window we aren t stopping and yes i d have helped clean the dried puke off the van later the critters come first
she should be happy it wasn t an elephant nta

how could you not laugh at her inability to see the irony nta your grandparents are awesome nat and your father are the a h nat s kids are victims like you are but i m sure their mother will ingratiate the three of them into another household soon
nta you don t have any control over what your grandparents decide to do anyway she s basically angry at you for existing when she should ve at loved you like family or at least included you as family i m sorry for your loss op
nta it s your grandparents estate and they can decide who gets what or anything for that matter
sorry for your loss nta the only thing i ll add is that her kids are not responsible for her behavior and they did lose a father figure however it s ironic that no one sees the similarity between you and nat s two kids be as angry as you want at her but don t direct it at her kids unless they earn it
nta wait wait wait so she called your dad childless and then says he s the only father her kids ever known lol
nta she ostracized you and your grandparents reacted badly to it sow the wind reap the whirlwind
nta next time laugh while calling the cops on her for showing up to your work to harass you
nta nat is it serves her right that she got kicked to the curb with absolutely nothing and you laughing in her face keep laughing she deserves the back the cruel medicine she s been dishing out at you btw sorry for your loss
nta sounds like a modern version of a fairytale to me
nta kudos to your grandparents for seeing who she really is do not feel bad for her she reaped what she sowed
you can t give what you don t own your grandparent own the property it is theirs to do with as they wish if we re sticking with her logic her kids are no more his then you right so they aren t entitled to anything
nta was it a bit petty to laugh maybe but it was certainly well deserved and you are definitely not an ah for it also i can only imagine how cathartic it felt good on your grandparents for doing the right thing i love that nat f ed around and doesn t like what she found out xd
nta she was and is an evil mean person your dad raised you and she got in between thankfully your grandparents wouldn t take it let her rot
should you not have laughed to not upset the other kids that lost their dad i can agree with that but the key here is that you weren t laughing at them you were laughing at her she got what she deserved and screwed those other kids out of anything by keeping them away due to being a b about things i m going with nta on this
not unusual to laugh when presented with unexpected comical statements in a socially awkward situation nat ambushed you at work probably the nicest thing you could do was laugh at her ludicrous ideas while walking away from her you d have been t a if you engaged further with her nta
ah well in a perfect world you wouldn t have laughed but you had a lot of pent up anger nta
nta she deserves it
nta the friend of your father should have just walked away kept their mouth shut and not said anything to you
aren t you the same to your late father as nat s kids they re not biological his so how can she talk about blood relations nta edit i would talk with your grandparents about what nat is saying and doing
nta sorry for your loss your father should ve protected you more glad your grandparents did i d call her 1x a day and laugh then hang up
nta ppl are always so shocked when karma bites them in the as for their own actions
nta tell her they are not his kids apparently that s really important to her
so nat has children who like you are not the biological children of your father but essentially the only father they have known ask nat is she has ever heard of the word hypocrisy sucks for those kids but you are nta
how dare she refer to her kids having your dad as the only father they ever had that was your exact situation when she made your life awful she treated you terribly bc you weren t blood related to your dad and now she s upset that her kids are missing out wow nta your dad s friend should mind his own business unless he s been in a similar situation
nta the kids weren t there and you weren t laughing at them nat made her bed and now she s laying it and frankly it s funny
nta after the way she treated you she got what she deserved
nta she ruined any kindness you may have had or affection to the kids had she embraced you rather than ruin your relationship with your dad she likely did pay your dad any rent so the free ride is over
nta your grandparents did what they wanted as for nat s kids they hadn t seen your grandparents in years if the kids cared they should have stayed in touch
nta i d imagine you would have some choice words for her so laughing was probably the best option i know if i was in your shoes it would be hard not to tell her how i really feel
nta this isn t even your dad s property but your grandparents if they don t want nat and her kids to have their property then that s an issue for them to deal with
nta good nat got what she fucking deserved
i don t believe in tolerating or trying to be tactful with entitlement besides that she has no empathy for what happened to you never shown any empathy for your entire life story yet it is the exact same fate that has befallen her own children i don t think a person like that deserves anything not to mention the only father you ve known allowed you to be treated this way regardless of all this it s your grandparent s stuff it s their money and their decision so nta you didn t do anything wrong your reaction nothing
nta maybe laughing at her wasn t the best move but she definitely earned your scorn as others have said remember that she brought all this on and the kids are innocent victims obviously if you want to do anything for them it should be on your terms and under your control
nta she sowed hatred and reaped the same edit spelling
nta your dad was a good dad until nat showed up kudos to your grandparents for not letting a little thing like biology get in the way of making you feel welcome also this part got me her kids who lost the only father they ever had yeah and what about you you lost the only father you ever had too
nta he was her husband and became thier father and they are getting his assets she estranged them from you and his parents you grandparents and therfore she is not getting the grandparent s assets this is entirely her own making she spited and cut off the people w the power money she bet on the wrong horse
nta stress can make you laugh heck i often laugh at the side of my own blood not like on purpose or anything just oh hey that hurts i m glad your grandparents are doing the right thing they sound awesome
nta sounds like she tried to prospect in a mine who belonged to someone else than she expected
nta oooh the irony
nta she wanted her kids to count with their new non bio dad but didn t want the existing kid to count she then proceeded to estrange the grandparents who owned the property as is so often said the owner of the property is free to dispose of it as they see fit too bad for her she didn t try to cultivate an active familial relationship with them to back up her property expectations if she had played her cards right she might have managed to cut her kids in for equal shares bit she didn t even try instead she did her best to be a wedge and reaped what she sowed
very much nta i would have been tempted to bring up all the irony in her statements in order to throw them back in her face just reading through the way she treated you made me irked enough that if i had been in a similar situation i m not sure i could have stopped myself from really twisting the knife she s lucky all she got from you was a laugh she ruined the relationship you had with your father and yes he was your father no matter what she said i m sorry that he listened to her and put distance between the two of you because of what she was saying people do stupid shit sometimes and it often doesn t make any sense keep being better than her hold your head high show lots of love to your grandparents and live your life don t let her make you doubt yourself you don t have to prove anything at all to her and you don t owe her a single thing
obviously not the arsehole she earned it but i think you are making a mistake by engaging with her at all as understandable as it is because she sounds like the worst kind of bitch it is not healthy to take pleasure in the misery of others no matter how terrible they are that s not me judging you because i get why you laughed at her but it sounds like you could do with talking to someone about this stuff because you don t want to carry this anger and resentment around with you not for her benefit for yours in the mean time cut her out of your life completely there is no reason for you to have anything to do with her anymore
nta
nta
nta i probably would ve done more than laugh as walking away i am proud of the way you handled it and your grandiose have the legal right to take back property that belongs to them the fact that she never considered the possibility of losing everything bc of her behavior is on her
nta
nta you were and continue to be a victim of her selfishness and insecurity laugh all the way to the bank
nta she got her comeuppance
i love stories like this nta good for you and congrats on the new house kick them to the curb and don t look back
nta you know she and your late father could have been putting an amount in the bank each month since they didn t have to pay rent and then he could have left that sum to his wife and her children they chose to take and not save and that is no one s fault but their own your grandparents were gracious to allow them to live rent free for years no one is owed anything in life
nta i would have laughed at nasty nat too
justified technically an asshole move but justified enough i m ruling nta
nta she is abusive to you glad your grandparents stuck by your side she is envious and jealous so she s lashing out for the wheel in this link just change gender to fit yourself https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/power-and-control/
classic fafo you re nta heal well
nta screw them
nta the mother is the ahole her kids are collateral of her behavior its not op s fault she denigrated him for years and her husbands parents hated her due to her own behavior
nta it s good to know that she got what she desserves
nta she said you were not family so treat her and her kids as such
nta and don t share your grandparents made their decision and you should respect and honor their choice
nta she got her karmic overdraft repaid for years of petty malice and from your perspective seeing it was probably very funny if she tries to force contact or attempts any further harassment at your workplace file a police report to keep her away she is ta hopefully her children are not entitled or vicious like their mother enjoy getting the last laugh on her as you move forward with your life and build yourself a happy future as your late grandparents wanted you to good luck
nta it was your grandparent s assets to do with what they wished the fact that your father s wife comes after you about it and gives you grief imo makes your reaction justified she treated you like shit your entire life and now expects something from you now that you hold the assets please sucks that the kids are victims to the years long tension between the adults but perhaps treating you with respect and compassion could have gone a long way
you lost the only father you ever knew as well except you lost yours far too early because of her also if your dad wasn t paying rent i would assume he should have had some savings to leave his other kids nat is just being greedy i would have done far worse than laugh nta
nta her actions had consequences she did not foresee blided by greed and jealousy usually does that she has also been blided by the fact that the circumstances surrounding your lives are similar technically neither her nor her children are owed anything since nothing really belonged to her husband everything belonged to his parents who she disrespected by mistreating you the son he raised as his own until she came into the picture however even though your fathers views may have changed his parents never did laughing may not have been the smart move because the children might grow up being told you were laughing at them and their new situation however walking away from her instead of giving her the time of day was being the better person that she apparently never learned how to be
nta she behaved appallingly you can t treat someone tat way and expect anything
i am sorry for nat s children to lose their stepfather loss is loss that said finances are finances nat is likely entitled to any assets her husband had she is not entitled to assets he did not own she made a point to drive a wedge between the op and his guardian stepfather of years as well as her husband and his parents it is not the op s decision but the owners of the property she made a financial decision when she disregarded the op s grandparents feelings and her anger will not change that was laughing mature not especially but to show up at the op s place of business is also not mature and op kept it together nta
nta sorry for your loss also i now dub her name is now gnat
nta i have stepchildren and bio child i have children
nta and it s incredibly hypocritical of her her kids aren t his bio kids either and we see how she feels about non bio kids being treated like human beings
i m so sorry for your loss and for the estrangement from your father it must have hurt a great deal i m so glad that your grandparents stuck by you i hope that someday you can be at peace about your father in my own life the people that have hurt me most have invariably been weak it doesn t make me forgive them i don t know if i can forgive but at least i can pity them and that makes it feel better than carrying bitterness maybe your father was weak too and that s why nat had such a hold on him i hope that you can treasure the years before nat entered the picture because it sounds like that s how he truly felt about you nat sounds vile she sounds like poison her children are innocent but if your late father didn t have anything to leave to them then that s that i m sorry for their loss as well it sounds like they never enjoyed the relationship with your grandparents that you have therefore your grandparents don t feel the need to provide for them that makes sense as for their relationship with your late father that relationship doesn t entitle them to anything from your grandparents even though the blood ties are similar the relationship ties are not i would usually not condone laughing but i think that this was a stress reaction and laughing at her is better than screaming at her i can t imagine the gall to hunt you down to demand that you share what your grandparents gave to you she sounds desperate and spiteful nta i m so glad that you have people in your life whom you love and who love you i know what it s like to be in a tiny family treasure them as long as you can
nta i think laughing at her was the probably the nicest most polite reaction you could have had honestly you re a way bigger person than i am and i m you seem very smart and emotionally together despite all you ve been through to me it sounds like everyone else is allowed to act as terribly as they want to but you somehow should be held to a completely different standard well f that muh boy you re allowed to have your feelings and reactions too personally i think you re amazing and i m proud of you even tho i don t even know you i m very sorry for your losses both before he died and after ps she s the most gigantic of ah s not you pps how dare she try to manipulate you with her kids they are her responsibility not yours she straight up robbed you of your father and now she has to face those consequences you are just honoring your grandparents wishes
nta what a horrid woman
nta
nta
sorry for your loss op and i honestly would have laughed at her unmitigated gall too after the way she treated you
nta ignore her she should neve have bullied you and took you from your dad
info how old were you when you and your dad became estranged and how old were you when he passed just curious on the timeline
nta
nope definitely nta nat was pushing you out from day one screw her and her offspring
nta you didn t react like this in front of her kids unlike her you aren t trying to make her kids feel bad her kids won t even be aware of your reaction unless she intentionally hurts them by telling them given how horribly she treated you ruined your relationship with your father she shouldn t expect anything you do not owe her or her children anything
nta he said at the end of the day her kids were dad s kids too and to think about them and how much this must suck for them at least that is true what you may or may not want to do for them is for you to decide but treating children with kindness during a difficult time is never a bad thing
nta nat sounds like a real piece of work i m a bit surprised that you legally inherited anything generally the deceased s property goes to their spouse your dad must have either never updated his will or everything was originally owned by your grandparents or he was never legally married to nat and never legally adopted her kids i partially agreed with the old friend nat s kids are the real losers here but i would never trust nat to give anything of real value to get kids either if you have the means to put things in something like a trust and gift it to them when they go to college or whatever you may want to consider that
nta but her kids are your dad s kids too just something to consider because they are innocents in this
nta but the kids are not responsible for their mother acts they lost a father figure don t take ur anger out on them
esh your father s friend is right nat is a huge asshole you already explained why and she got what she deserved you on the other hand are less of an asshole but still one for how you handled things you might be right but you are still an asshole according to the question you posed how would your grandparents feel if they had seen this interaction they probably would be disappointed in you but still feel somewhat justified about their decision to exclude nat the whole situation would probably bother them bottom line listen to your dad s friend be humble about the situation and don t escalate things with nat
absolute nta but i d like you to think about those innocent children don t direct your anger on them because of nat
yta you could have handled the confrontation better laughing was that really necessary i get that you are bitter for what had transpired but the way you have handled it makes you the a hole you should have took the high road and offered her to contact your lawyer for any grievances or something instead
nta obviously but i would urge you to consider if your siblings need you or want to be in your life in the future whether you would want that sounds like their mom is a piece of work and they may need support
nta but your father s friend is not wrong nat s kids are innocent in this and your father was the only father they knew just like you perhaps there is a way to help them while leaving nat out of it because she deserves nothing from you
nta however i would consider doing an education fund or something like that for your step siblings none of this is their fault
esh you mother for basically abondoning you the loss of a child is unimaginable but she had another child who still needed his mother nat for all the horrible things she did to you your father for not defending you against his new wife and becoming estranged from you your grandparents for choosing one grandchild over the other you for laughing at someone who just lost her husband and ignoring your two siblings the only ones who are nta are your siblings they did nothing to deserve any of this they were simply born and have now lost their father
yta there was no need to laugh you had already won no point in rubbing it in
esh i get why you laughed
esh nat sucks you shouldn t have laughed at her seems weird to be gleeful about this one upmanship when your siblings are homeless and the man you claim you saw as your father is dead your grandparents suck because they know their son would be devastated at this only people that don t suck are those poor kids none of the adults involved seem pleasant or well adjusted
nta but don t be like her don t punish the kids if needed ask your grandparents for help about how you can help the kids without letting her exploit that help for herself
yta big time
yeah you really are an asshole wow

nta your brother began dating and married the mother of his daughter s school bully isn t this the plot of a 90s horror movie
nta he shoved aside his daughter s feelings for his own personal happiness i think it s incredibly gross he even started being friends with the parent of his daughter s bully much less dating and then marrying her did they tell this lovely how they met story at the wedding he s probably permanently damaged his relationship with his daughter and your brother is the one who brought it up you didn t just say this out of nowhere if it wasn t your business then maybe he shouldn t have been talking about it with you he s just mad you called out his bullshit
nta oh my god poor piper
nta so many people imagine that if they construct a fantasy it will become a reality just because they want it to my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life he gets to dictate hers but he s not prepared to show her any consideration at all he told me it was none of my business and i was overstepping and just his little sister why did he talk to you about it what he really means is what didn t you tell me what i wanted to hear
nta your brother sucks and needed to hear it being sisters will mend the rift is the kind of bullshit rationalization people make when they don t want to face how disgusting it is that they are bringing piper s bully into her home into her family my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life ugh yeah god forbid a parent be expected to prioritize their child s wellbeing or anything what your brother needs to realize is that sure he can refuse to give a shit about his teenage daughter but piper is fast approaching the age of legal adulthood when he can no longer dictate her life i think he ll be in for a rude awakening when his daughter drops him just as coldly as he s dropped her
this is going to come full circle when piper goes low no contact once she is old enough to leave home people do not magically embrace their unapologetic bullies because their parents decided to shack up and force them into a sibling style relationship this whole dynamic is probably a nightmare come true for piper you are right on all fronts but there s very little he can do now to mend the situation which he massively fumbled so i understand why he would rather play dumb nta
he didn t like what you said because you were right and he knows that nta
nta literal nightmare having your own bully as a step sibling i would try to move out as fast as possible poor girl you re in every right to criticize your brother in that aspect
nta your brother put his needs before his daughter and didn t care what this would mean going forward i think you re absolutely right
nta brother is an idiot who alienated his daughter by falling for her bully s mom at first sight no surprise he s also a jerk
nta you were definitely in the right to tell him what was true remember she s your niece as well as his daughter who he isn t treating well if he s not taking care of her it is absolutely your business
nta i m sorry but if that was my dad i would view it as the ultimate betrayal and would be counting down the days till i hit to move out and never look back
bad parents when they re faced with constructive criticism sh0uld i let my child dictate h0w i live my life then nta
both of the adult are delusional that a victim of bully would ever trust their perpetrator worse he failed his daughter by allowing her safe space to be invaded by her bully and being in her home and life on a daily basis he expected a piece of paper to mean something to his child when that piece of paper means nothing to some adults
it s not completely clear what the timeline is here as i understand it nancy starts teasing piper photo gets ripped up nancy s mom and piper s dad get married so they ve been married about years the really thought piper and nancy would be sisters and would be close by now is after them living together for years
nta you brother trampled over all his daughter s feelings he betrayed his daughter s trust the moment he brought perceived danger her bully into her home he even feels entitled to the bully and the victim becoming friends just to make him happy and it s you who overstepped he deserves to be arrested for disrespecting all his daughter s reasonable boundaries in my opinion edited for grammar
nta your brother is being ridiculous he put on his rose colored glasses and expected everything to be hunky dory he ll be wondering why piper goes low to no contact when she turns be as supportive as you can be for her and be a safe space for her if you can piper deserves better and she deserved better when your brother decided to marry her bully s mother
op i would encourage you to talk to piper about this she clearly needs someone she can trust and a strong woman figure in her life and maybe you can help her not feel so alone being a teenager is tough being a young woman with no mom is unimaginably hard please try to support her and let her know someone has her back
nta thank you for having your nieces back your brother is thinking only of himself and his own needs he probably thought that the teasing was just a little bit of fun and hasn t realized in all these years later the lasting impact its had on his daughter why has he allowed the situation to go on for so many years without any attempt to rectify it does he enjoy watching his daughter suffer does he want to erase his late wife s memory so is just waiting for piper to get out of his life so he can enjoy his happy new family
has nancy actually been nice to piper
tell him he can t be mad at you you re siblings that should mend the rift
wait wait wait your brother married the mother of his daughter s bully without the bully ever apologizing the mother of a bully who does not even make their kid apologize did the mother ever apologize being sisters would mend the rift um no you have now forced this girl to live in a hostile environment you know this instance was far from the first time nancy bullied piper i highly doubt it was the last either piper should be his priority she is his daughter he should have backed up with the mom when piper began pulling away thankfully she has you she needs that adult who will stand up for her nta
nta piper prob feels as if her dad has abandoned her and gone to make house with her bully replacing her mother to boot i hope she gets all the therapy she needs your brother shouldn t have asked you if he didn t want to hear opinions he doesn t like it must be very tough to hear the truth of what he s done but nowhere near as tough as piper has had it all this time
nta your brother was impulsive
nta be ready to be the cool aunt for the next years
nancy sounds like a sneaky sh t and may be torturing that poor girl in private your brother is definitely the ah and should have absolutely put his daughter above any relationship you re nta here your niece could use your love and attention and i m sure she d appreciate you being a sounding board
nta he brought it up so it s not like you jumped in with an opinion out of the blue i hope piper knows she can talk to you it sounds like nobody in her own home is on her side
nta he asked for your opinion and when he didn t like it decided it was none of your business he should know by now not to ask questions if he s not prepared to hear the answer as for your niece does she still have the pieces of the ripped picture if she does there may be a way to scan it and digitally repair photoshop it it obviously won t be the same but she deserves to have as many pictures of her mum as possible or r photoshoprequest would probably be able to put niece as she is now into a photo with her mum if that s something you think she would like
nta it is infuriating when parents make massive changes to the whole families lives and don t bother to be concerned by how it affects everyone no piper doesn t get to dictate his entire life but yeah she does need to be taken into consideration when merging families with someone else that s not dictating that s being a responsible parent your brother is an idiot on many levels he doesn t get to bring up a topic like this and then tell you it s none of your business because he doesn t like your response he married the mother of his daughters bully while doing nothing to resolve any of the underlying issues between the girls it wasn t some random woman with a kid he met the kids had a bad history to put it mildly and he just ignored that
can piper stay with op
nta your brother is so selfish it s unbelievable his daughter was and still is suffering not only from the death of her mother but also from being bullied at school by nancy and he thought that marrying her mother and moving them into the family home within a year would magically fix things wow my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life i say this as someone who neither has nor wants children when you have kids they fucking do dictate your life if you re not putting your kids needs first you re being a shit parent and it certainly doesn t take a genius to work out that what your brother did was probably the worst decision he could ve made for piper s wellbeing that poor girl it sounds like you re the only person fighting her corner so don t back down just because your brother is throwing a tantrum he s more than old enough to be told straight that he s going to lose his daughter forever unless he starts giving a shit about her
nta shouldn t have come to you to whine about the situation it s great that your niece had someone who stands up for her
nta he s defensive because he knows that you re right
nta i can t imagine my living parent marrying the mother of a child that tore up one of my most precious possessions the fact that her dad doesn t even care that she s upset is just awful poor piper
does he usually dismiss and belittle you like that when you tell him a truth he doesn t like doesn t bode so well
nta honestly his relationship with piper will never recover i m sure he knew the discomfort she felt when he dated nancy s mom then he married her once she s of age she ll leave cut him off
nta it seems like a pretty fair and obvious assessment your brother probably responded to you in an upset way because there s just not much he can do about it now and it s effectively made the family dynamic completely lame for piper it s too bad he is not taking accountability for what he did even if he did have the best intentions which is probably why he doesn t feel wrong kids can definitely internalize a need to apologize for years and years and an apology is all it would take to mend a rift if you or your brother can keep encouraging nancy to apologize i think it could make a difference
nta is nancy still bullying piper or did she stop it when their parents married doesn t affect my judgment i just feel so sad for piper and i m hoping for the less bad option here
nta quite apart from anything else it sounds like your brother raised the topic then tried to claim it was none of your business when you told him something he didn t want to hear that s always annoying
nta you re right and your brother is a massive ah his poor daughter lost her mother gets bullied for over a year then he moved said bully into the house and expects them all the play happy families with new sister and mother what an absolute betrayal then have the cheek to say his life shouldn t revolve around his daughter it absolutely should that s exactly what you sign up for when having a child their well being and happiness comes first especially a child who s lost their mother and has no one else he s a terrible father and shouldn t be surprised if in a couple of years time his daughter moves away and stops speaking to them at all make sure she knows you re there she ll need some family that care about her
nta imagine being the child who had been bullied for a year and had one of her most treasured possessions ripped up being told that said bully is now going to be living with you as a sister your brother was and still is clueless about his daughter insensitive doesn t even come close
nta your brother has clearly shown his daughters feelings do not matter and thinks because he is happy that his daughter should fall in line with his happiness he only continues to alienate his daughter
my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life i don t have children but isn t that what is supposed to happen wonder how any of your choice will impact your child and wonder if that s the best decision for your child before making it nta
my family did this with my grade school bully always inviting her over and trying to make her a part of the family to mend the rift the result she acted like a princess infront of the parental units and then at school would use all the ammo she accumulated from my family to not only bully me more but to get more friends to join her in bullying me i m i ve gone full no contact with my family that s not the only reason but it was a big one welcome to your future if you keep pushing the bully into her safe space
nta and he is a hypocrite for saying he can t let piper dictate his life but golly he sure has no problem doing it himself he is a shite parent and a failure please show him this thread and this post specifically
he ditched his daughter for her bully s mother his daughter who has one parent and needs him to be on her side that s what actually happened and now he s angry at his daughter because he helped re traumatize her and angry at you because you told the truth seems like an awful person op is nta
nta poor piper had an evil stepmom and stepsister before they even met your brother sucks
nta he must have known it all already because surely nobody can be that lacking in emotional intelligence but he just really didn t want to be called out on it he may have wanted to hear they ll figure it out but you are right there was no window of healing between nancy being piper s bully and nancy becoming piper s sister they just put themselves before either girl who meets their kids bully s mum to discuss them hurting their child and then starts up a relationship with her without making sure the rift is healing first honestly be there for the kid coz she is likely to need you
nta people are calling her a bully i say it goes further bullying is bad enough but what nancy did wasn t just bullying is was cruel and calculated torture your brother is an ah i just hope you are still there for piper when she refuses to see her father or his family
amazing you reap what you sow nta poor piper
he tried to cheat and take a shortcut and not put in the work to make it happen he now has to live with the consequences nta
nta he brought his daughters bully into the family wtf
sounds like he s a really shitty dad poor piper
nta your evaluation seems spot on
instead of protecting his daughter your brother moved her tormentor into her home because getting his dick wet was more important all he did was show her her feelings didn t matter and she can t trust him he is a shit parent nancy s mum is fucking delusional that being sisters will mend the rift her disciplining and correcting her daughters behaviour may have helped but it sounds like everyone just expected piper to suck it up and forgive keep being the supportive aunt because she will go no contact with your brother when she is and he deserves it you are nta your brother needs a wake up call
tell your brother that i don t think he deserves to parent piper if that is what he calls it cause it ain t what i would he sucks nta
nta tbh he probably realises you were right and was hurt my this realisation and lashed out at you
nta your brother only cares about himself too my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life i wow he really should have never had kids
i would never be friend with my bully sister well at least we chose our friends not our family
as someone much older in a situation similar to piper nta thank you for defending her corner when she probably feels like no one else is my father had an affair and my mother died soon after a month after her funeral began countless unwanted and forced interactions with ap and her family when we still had yet to process our grief my siblings and i always felt our dad put the desires of himself his gf and her kids first without taking any steps to confront and discuss the last few years they re engaged and her kids are up in arms that we maintain distance from them after all this he expects our issues with his affair partner to dissolve somehow and it s almost comical how he looks at us with a surprised pikachu face when we tell him we d rather spend holidays with our mom s relatives i think that like my father your brother prioritized a new romantic partner without wanting to acknowledge the direct offense he took against his daughter and do the emotional work needed to amend their relationship before the massive step of marriage the validity of a relationship does not and should not rely on a marriage license and there is little logical reason why he couldn t have waited longer to propose it s probably a tough pill to swallow when you find happiness at the expense of someone else but that s his daughter and he married the mother of her bully that she is now forced to live with to say that was a tone deaf move is an obscene understatement and all of piper s feelings are more than valid i really do feel for piper i hope she can heal from this and it s really wonderful you re in her corner
my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life well that s an interesting way of rephrasing the concept of taking your child s feelings comfort into account when starting to date again i m all for moving on and finding happiness again but i assumed children would be 1st priority especially at such a young developmental age nta sometimes people don t want to hear any truth that doesn t fit their narrative also if both sides of parents were involved why did nothing get resolved around the incident did they just forget why they were talking to one another you d think it d be easy to decide nancy was in the wrong and needed to apologize
nta your brother knows he screwed up which is why he got so defensive with you the whole am i supposed to let my daughter dictate my whole life yes she was when this happen when they got married she was still still dependent on her daddy and he severely let her down and made her grow up in an environment that she did not feel safe yes her feelings in this matter should have dictated his life choices with this specific mom he should have either taken it slow to allow friendship to blossom or shouldn t have even engaged with this mom your brother is selfish and a bad parent someday he ll complain piper wants nothing to do with him and wonder why
i hope piper finds another family member to go live with her dad is nothing but a little boy not even a man he has no business being a dad all he wants is a women for his bed and thinking he can force his abused daughter in building a relationship with her abuser you need to grow the fuck up she needs to be taken out of that household hope if any of pipers family reads this they go and get her out if there
can you provide some clarification on the timeline of events piper started getting bullied at by nancy was nancy also are they both now did the picturing tearing incident happen at what were their ages when piper s dad married nancy s mom
your brother is an idiot and chose to marry in a rush the enabler of his child s bully nta
piper s mom is dead nancy destroyed her pic and piper is never going to forget that just because he married nancy s mom doesn t mean piper will ever except his wife as a motherly figure or nancy as a step sister definitely nta he s upset because he knows you are right
nta but holy shit your brother very much is lots of things could be said about that but to distill it kids do dictate your life not in the sense that they can tell you what to do but when you bring a life into this world you do actually have the responsibility to orient yourself around what is best for them and that orientation does actually trump a pussy quest
nta your brother is wrong and the all need therapy i would never accept it if one of my parents married my bully bullying isn t something you just get over
my partners biological brother was his bully abuser they are in their 50s and he still wants nothing to do with his brother and still has ptsd from his childhood their parents just shrugged it off as boys being boys and how they would grow up and love each other my partner wouldn t piss on his brother if he was on fire this logic was insane and if he and his new wife didn t think enough about their kids to involve a counselor when blending these two families your brother deserves everything you re telling him he sounds like tah be there for your niece
nta i hope piper knows when she goes lc nc with her dad she at least has an aunt who cares and she can come to
wtf who starts dating the mom of the kid who is bullying their daughter over their dead mom i m hoping this is a made up post cause otherwise this is way too depressing nta if it is real
nta what you said was far more reasonable than what he did also what kind of crap dad with a little child to raise that is in pain throws around the whole dictate my life crap of course when you have a child you are asking for it to dictate your life if you neglect that duty you are irresponsible and selfish it s really really crappy what happened to piper a girl teases you about your deceased mother rips up a cherished photo and then your dad shows the ultimate disloyalty to that situation by making her family for his own selfish reasons
this hit my rage button my thoughts on your brother would get me banned please be there for piper when she decides to greyrock and go no contact my experiences with this that girl not the word i want but grr destroyed a probably irreplaceable photo of someone s dead mother this monster bullied her for her mother dying you expect me to believe good bad terrible sir that the bullying actually stopped and this isn t golden child getting a pass when parents don t see and a child not trusting the one person they should be able to in protecting them so they endure counting the days to escape cause that s not likely nta op and thank you for being a beacon of sanity
nta your brother completely betrayed his daughter he s a shit father you were rather polite on what you said he deserves much worse his daughter can t be safe in her own home she s going to leave and never come back the first chance she gets and that s still not as bad as he deserves he sacrificed his daughter for a new wife that s not just disrespectful to his daughter that s disrespectful to his dead wife eta what he did was worse than tearing up a picture of her dead mom what he did was piss all over her memory he tore up his old life and replaced his dead wife and her daughter he could use a good beating with a karma stick
nta you are absolutely right he s upset because he wanted to lament have you commiserate on how sad that is not inform him that this was mostly his his new wife s fault for just assuming a marriage would fix everything bc they were happy none of this was fair to piper he knows that somewhere deep down but he was not ready to hear it piper should be in therapy she should be his first priority he still can get her in therapy try to fix this if he s willing to admit he s a big part of the problem that s hard for people though it s easier to be mad at the person who is hurt for being difficult or whatever
nta it wasn t your business to say anything until he brought it up and when he didn t like what you said he got defensive your brother needs to realise that they didn t get closer or at least to be more like sisters than strangers because nancy never apologised and made an attempt to mend the hurt she s caused to piper she just acted like nothing happened
nta your brother is living in a dream land he clearly doesn t understand how children let alone humans operate he took the lazy approach and did nothing
nta but i m sure piper would have preferred if you were there for her when that happened info did any member of your family say anything or the family of her deceased mom because we are talking about stuff that happened like what years ago
nta sounds like a midday movie except there s someone usually crying in a darkly lit lounge room brandishing a gun
nta your brother only thought about himself poor piper
your brother is absolutely delusional if my dad married the mother of my school bully who had ripped a photo of my dead mother i d never see my dad again i certainly wouldnt see my bully as my sister i d just be counting down the days until i was and could leave that whole mess behind if i hadnt already spoken to either set of grandparents to move earlier your brother is lucky piper is only just not calling nancy her sibling they arent siblings they are related by marriage that s it
nta and your brother is a terrible father literally let a bully run over his daughter essentially all because he couldn t keep it in his pants way to show what he values
nta i dont get why people do this and then come running to their siblings about oh my kid doesnt like me anymore and then want to say your out of line for stating the obvious smh he knows hes wrong he knows why its not working bro just doesnt want to be accountable
your brother put his wants before his daughter s needs and unfortunately it is likely to cost him a close relationship with his daughter in the future you seem to have a good grasp of the situation but his attitude is what do you know well it seems a lot more than he does but there you go nta
nta he just wants to be right and doesn t wanna put the work in to fixing it correctly smh like trying to shove a square peg in a round hole and getting mad that it isn t working
another man putting getting his dick wet over his kids what an asshole did he ever stop to even consider that his poor daughter wouldn t want anything ever to do with the little brat that bullied her
not once did i see him acknowledge how his daughter is feeling or validating it all he cares about was how he felt feels not only did he not care about his daughters feelings but he allowed his dead wife to be disrespected then continued on to date the little girls mother that disrespected her then marry her a year later does he not realize how genuinely selfish he is i m honestly not even going to be surprised of when his daughter turns and goes no contact n pushes his words back into his face of dictating her life anymore
nta but it should be noted some people aren t close to biological siblings i didn t speak to one of my siblings for the first time until late march and still haven t spoken to the other sibling

my brother said i expected him to let piper dictate his life i said no not what i said i said if he wanted piper to be happy and embrace nancy as a sibling then he should have taken things more slowly to get that outcome he told me it was none of my business and i was overstepping and just his little sister so your brother talked to you about his business then said it was none of your business then he took the exact wrong conclusion from what you said is he normally this ummm immature
nta this has the same vibe as let s have a baby to save our marriage
nta but please be sure to be there to support your niece the moment she decide to run away from that crazy fu fantasy the other people share
can hear the i don t understand why my daughter never visits or calls
nta piper is going to go nc in years and he will be shocked pikachu face and say it s a complete surprise
there may never be a relationship to mend that was a photo of her mom that she never got to know and the girl tore it like it s nothing and now they re living under the same roof op daughter may never forgive her elementary beef sometimes stick with us forever especially for something that important for herself
nta piper is waiting to turn so she can leave we all know it he s in denial
nta honestly i hope your brother sees this post and realizes that he traded his relationship with his daughter just to get some ass what kind of stupid do you have to be to bang your child s bully s mom without even forcing the kid to apologize and to whine about it years later and instead of accepting criticism and maybe try mending a bridge he created he belittled the only person defending his daughter shame on him hope he realizes that piper is probably going lc or nc as soon as she turns
nta your brother had unrealistic expectations being bullied hurts we see it here on reddit all of the time someone in their 30s or 40s encounters their childhood bully and all of those emotions come rushing back he cannot expect his daughter s hurt and pain to vanish just because he s dating someone
nta and wow this sounds like a nightmare for piper i sense piper is on a fast track to nc with her father
thanks for the update and more importantly congratulations
congratulations a baby i m so happy for you both you sound like a great team and a great partner and i read your original post and thought the same don t worry about aunt doesn t sound like she was that invested to begin with i m glad your mom is making amends but definitely keep quiet about the baby for months since she may start groveling only for grandmother s rights
op i just want to say you sound like a good husband who is shouldering new responsibilities while trying to honor the old i wish you the very best and it sounds like you have the foundation of a relationship built around respect and communication
drinking before you re far enough along to know you re pregnant is no issue the placenta is what transmits alcohol to the baby and it doesn t develop until way later nothing to worry about
congratulations try not to punish mom forever she screwed up and knows it sorry about the aunt being what she is
congratulations and well done for stepping up to your frightful bigoted hate filled sour lemon of an aunt she is clearly a lost cause but the relationship with your mum sounds like it might have some eventual potential good luck with that i wonder how long it will be before the judgmental and critical horrors at your wedding start asking you or probably others about your new baby hmmm all the best to you both and please tell your wife not to stop dancing at the next family function it would be a good idea if you joined her imagine the outrage
she wasn t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that i won t repeat so that was an immediate end to that relationship if you don t mind my curiosity without asking for specific quotes was it condescending everyone who s not a stuck up christian prude like me is the devil types of things or super fucking racist types of things i ask because tone down the fiesta from the last post was less a racism red flag and more a small industrious nation whose chief export is racism red flags
congratulations on all counts totally on the right track just in time too your mothers apology is a pointer in the right direction best wishes for the exciting times ahead
thanks for the update and congrats once again communication is key
you handled this beautifully thanks for the update and congratulations
good for you i understand taking a breather from your mom her behavior was hurtful and damaging and people prefer to pretend that an apology erases damage instantly it does not a true apology may pave the way to repair but time is often needed congratulations on the baby
congrats my guy but i d say try not punish mom forver she atleast knows she messed up
okay best ending ever i m so happy for you guys that it brought a little tear to my eye because i want to badly to marry and have babies congratulations
i think you handled that wonderfully your wife danced joyfully and unreserved because she thought she was safe to joyfully be herself with the people surrounding her instead she received judgment and criticism from someone she went out of her way to ensure was invited and from her brand new mil i am very impressed with your handling of this entire situation because here on reddit that isn t what we normally see
seriously your mom apologized with a pretty good story you need to get over it unless she reoffends
congratulations i m glad you cut off your aunt i understand the impulse to go lc with your mom i know your mom has to earn trust back but given her apparent sincere regret and desire to make amends i hope you ll give her a real chance to do that
if it makes you feel any better i can t stop saying tone down the fesita to my toddler now
congratulations you re a good partner and you re going to be a great dad and it sounds like your wife is going to be a wonderful mother i m glad to see this update because my heart was so sad for your wife she was just enjoying her special day and she sounds like a blast to hang with lol
congratulations i m glad your wife is happier and and your marriage is going strong
congrats you did the right thing by confronting your mom and aunt sorry it did not go well with your aunt
congratulations what wonderful news
wow congratulations i m sorry you had to go through that with the aunt but your mom does sound sincere obviously actions will speak louder than words and this situation should give you insight as the kind of boundaries you want to set forth with family as you move forward thanks for the update
congratulations also no need to panic drink until it s pink plenty of people drink before finding out about being pregnant as it s too early to really send anything to little bean yet
unpopular opinion but all this nonsense about low contact no contact etc is bullshit i get it applying to legitimate circumstances but you re going low contact with your mom after talking to her and she apologized and offered to apologize to your wife seriously everybody on here needs a dose of reality if you re not willing to put in the work in relationships and have tough conversations then you should remain single and secluded you re all poisoning yourselves with this nonsense relationship and people take work not everything is always going to be easy again i completely understand real circumstances but things like this piss me off it s just an incredibly childlike way of operating the world
my mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into old habits she wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife but my wife and i have agreed on low contact for now wait why are you punishing your mom she not only apologized she apparently wants to make it up to her which to me says it s not just lip service maybe there s more to the story but i don t understand this leap
congratulations
thank you for the updates d i rmb reading this and feeling rly badly for yal very nah moment now happy for both u and ur wife
congratulations
congrats
congrats
you totally handled this situation like a rockstar i m also really happy that your mom is apologetic and has shown remorse it s really promising for her future relationship with your family i wish you and your wife and baby the best
congratulations what a lovely surprise in the midst of all this family drama you handled this beautifully and you and your wife are lucky to have each other here s to new beginnings with your growing family
what a fantastic update sorry not sorry in the slightest about the loss of your aunt in your life that s definitely a win enjoy the pregnancy i m stoked for you both
you handled your family well congratulations on your pregnancy you re both clearly going to be excellent parents
days into a marriage and already going to bat for your wife strong start
congratulations don t worry about the drinking almost everybody i know drank before we found out we were pregnant you find out so early these days it s going to be fine super excited for both of you i think your mom s going to be just fine especially if she feels that her sister could cause her to lose contact with you and your wife and now baby i think if she does keep contact with her sister she will definitely keep from letting her influence anything with you guys
congrats and yes you did the right thing your aunts intentions were bad and she s shown that by saying nasty things and letting you go i m so glad your mom has come around and seen the light i think over time the relationship will be good
congratulations on your wedding standing up for your wife and a new baby on the way you handled it all very well wishing you and your wife decades of happiness i hope your mom can prove she s sorry and get to be a wonderful grandma too
great update and congratulations i bet your wife really wants the both those grandmas so start small with your mother ie when ready for it to go public have her to dinner in a safe place for you and your wife maybe a restaurant so that if you need to get up and leave it s easy tell your mother maybe ask her to wait a week before telling anyone basically give her a few tests hurdles to prove she s listening to you and accepting your boundaries again congratulations ps the reason that medical professionals say there s no safe level on alcohol is because ethically they cannot do controlled trials so all their data is anecdotal
congratulations on the pregnancy and you did a great job of supporting your wife
no you are not the asshole i believe that you should take a chance with your mom not go low contact she made a mistake apologized for it and explained falling into bad habits around those that encourage those habits can be hard to resist give your mom a chance let your wife build that relationship with her your aunt bah pound sand
my wife is a wedding photographer and i assist at most weddings the brides that go hog wild dancing in a fun way tend be the best wives and happiest couples your aunt probably has a boring marriage and feels ugly
huge congrats op it s so heartwarming to see some positive results of this sub and it sounds like you handled this beautifully i hope this strengthens your relationship with your wife and wish both of you well massive w
best update
yta obviously your aunt is as well but it sounds like your mom was genuinely sorry and doing whatever she can to try to make up for her mistakes your punishment of her seems unjustified
tbh i m not sure why you re still so sour with your mum just forgive her and move on she seems genuinely sorry everyone makes mistakes and it takes some courage to admit wrong and attempt reparations
congratulations you are a lovely human
i m glad to hear you are both doing well
lovely you did this all with dignity and courage what a supportive way to start off your marriage good for you both i hope you can continue to heal that relationship
congrats and i m glad you are on the way to mending things with your mom the dynamics with older siblings can be tricky even as an adult you can fall back into bad shit when you are with family i m glad you are showing grace in this situation sounds like your mom got sucked into her sister s shitty beliefs that she was also brought up with and has realized that was a huge mistake
you re a great guy the way you re stepping up for your wife and your wife is really nice trying to avoid confrontation with your family to avoid any friction you re a wonderful couple congratulations on your wedding and congratulations on the baby
wonderful update
congratulations i think with the mother will work out she wants to meet her grandchildren i m sure
awesome update i m glad you were able to talk to your wife and came to the conclusion together that you needed to draw these boundaries congratulations and hope all goes well with the pregnancy
what a good update aside from aunt congrats to you both expecting a little one so exciting hope things continue to get better with your mom and she makes the right choices
congratulations you and your wife sound like lovely people who know how to productively talk about difficult things with love you ll be great parents
mom might have some relationship issues if she s willing to let her sis control her like that honestly it would be best to keep them two away from each other for moms well being
awesome and congrats 1q
congrats on the baby and what sounds like a good outcome thank you for the update
congratulations i hope your wife has a safe and easy pregnancy
op congrats on the positive outcome and congrats on the baby do not worry my wife realized that she was pregnant about weeks in and drank before it our kid turned out pretty damn great so don t stress to much about that
congratulations for the baby nd ur really a good husband ur wife is really lucky
congrats it sounds like the aunt rightfully got cut off she won t change don t be too hard on your mom and cut her off too long that the relationship is irreparable this would be contradictory to your wife s initial thoughts about being family your moms apology sounds sincere and as you said it she knew she messed up she didnt even try to defend herself or sister so she knows she was wrong and tried to make it right for a parent to do this says volumes gosh my mother has done 10x worse and would rather eat dirt than apologise i think had your aunt not been there your mom would never have given the dancing a second thought it sounds like your aunt can be manipulative and your mom let her guard down just being excited to see her sister i think given a chance your mom and wife could have a good relationship don t be too rash to write it off
this is a great update it s good to hear that your mom was appropriately ashamed and apologetic i think a lot of people sometimes don t even realize how much influence their older siblings have on them so i find her explanation believable and while it doesn t make her behavior okay at all i think it leaves room for a lot of hope that you guys can work things out in the future it s always great to read about someone who really has their partner s back and the way you both really listened to each other on this and talked it through makes me think you re off to a great start as spouses and parents best of luck on your new adventure
congratulations to you and your wife
congratulations has to be one of the best endings to an update wishing you your wife and future child ren all the best
and lo and behold she s pregnant upvoted for lo and behold without the w in low oh and congratulations
that s great congratulations in becoming new parents as for you aunt doesn t sound like she deserved to be in your life but she may come around for a baby as for your mom it doesn t sound like she meant to be hurtful and she went along with the aunt so as to not lose her sister kind of like those friendships where you just go along with the mean girl even if you don t agree because you dont want to lose your friends low contact is good but i wouldn t go too low and instead work on the relationship talk maybe have family therapy or do things together that show she didn t mean to hurt people i would also see if your wife is up to having small get togethers with your mom like lunch or picking out some new dishes or something this will help gage whether your mom is really sorry or just trying to sweep it under the rug you could definitely wait till after the 1st semester to say anything about the baby to see how she handles working on the relationship someone people go low contact and ignore attempts when people reach out i wouldn t ignore your mom as her reaching out shows that she s sorry and wants to be better to have a relationship and at least she is sorry and is trying to be better
so glad you talked and worked it out and congrats
happy wife happy life
this update is amazing congratulations hope it s triples just kidding
so many times we read about a person often a man who will always take his mother s side over his wife s and it s really sad good for you having your wife s back i m glad your mother apologised it gives some hope for the future your aunt is no loss and your wife will remember this
congrats on dealing with the situation going nc with the aunt and for the pregnancy i can only imagine how the aunt would react to the news pregnant during the wedding means it was conceived out of wedlock so she would most certainly disapprove of that hopefully you can get back to a point to where you have a better relationship with your mom because she sounds genuine
souds like you adventure is only getting better congrats with hte baby do lamaze classes they are the best and get you ready for the big event
oh my god op you love your wife really well and it is so beautiful i m crying happy tears for the three of you now thank you for being you you two will be able to figure it out as evidenced by how you responded to this situation keep it up y all ugh i love you
congratulations
congrats both on the marriage the baby the very successful communications and the mom who ate her crow her being ok with it not being ok is the biggest sign it ll be ok
bless you for reaching out your wife will forever love you for now standing by her side this has to be a lesson for so many people
yay congrats my dears thanks for the update
hell yeah bro you got this congrats
congratulations
congrats on the pregnancy it will all be fine
this is a good update hopefully your relationship with your mom can be repaired it sounds like your aunt is the toxic entity here and your mom sounds like she s cut her off too congrats on the pregnancy
well i never read the original post so i don t know the whole story but it sounds like you did the right thing congratulations on the pregnancy
love a happy ending no matter how old we get those lifelong sibling dynamics can always find their way to the surface i would try to cut your mom a break sounds like she is legitimately sorry
thanks for the update and congrats i m sure what your wife drank at the wedding and with it being early the baby is fine here s something to remember in utero human development doesn t happen all at once it happens over a week period more or less but you know what we mean and there are many contributing factors and while drinking at any stage of pregnancy should be avoided both the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists say harm from having a little alcohol before you knew you were pregnant is unlikely i linked the article for you https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant-first-3-weeks#next-steps
congratulations on the baby i m glad your mom saw the light and is apologizing hopefully she s being sincere
so there is the actual new family your wife was looking for congratulations hope you guys will be happy healthy and prosperous together for the rest of your lives
awesome update and congratulations
as a christian i find most other christians fukken embarrasing https://i.imgur.com/dyqtp2x.mp4
congrats i saw the original post so reading you re update feels like a resolution and closure i m glad you re a caring enough husband and put your foot down for your wife i wish you happiness with your new life new wife and new baby the mom is apologetic at least so low contact is good now give it some time the aunt is an ah so i m glad you cut her off
congrats nta op
fantastic and i m tentatively hopeful for your mom
update is much appreciated you two sound like a very strong couple best of luck working through the relationship with your mother i m sure you three will come out of it just fine in the end and above all else congratulations
congratulations i went to a friend s wedding before i knew i was pregnant and put away many many drinks i was also concerned my son is now and a stanford undergrad
congratulations and it is honestly so refreshing to see someone going to bat for their spouse against a controlling family the way you did i envision a long happy married life for you two and wish you all the best for the little one
congratulations
maybe not yet but i think you should eventually tell your mom about your wife s reaction to the suggestion that she might be grieving the loss of a big supportive family that she thought she was marrying into sometimes i think mothers of sons really worry about how their new daughters in law are going to pull their sons away from their families without really stopping to think about how those same daughters in law might be really excited to join their families this was certainly the case in the family i married into and it took me years even after being in a committed relationship with my husband since we were teenagers to convince my mil that this meant i was also committed to the rest of the family i think it might really be good for your mom and the relationship she s going to have to build with your wife to know how much it meant to your wife to be joining your family your whole family
happiest wishes to you two and congrats
congratulations and i m glad your mom was apologetic and ashamed of her behavior i hope she takes it to heart and respects the distance you and your wife have asked for so you have time to heal and think things through

nta this is weird behavior he s not missing out on this friendship he s missing out on the life he chose with you and the kids going overseas for extended vacations isn t something you do with a friend once a year let alone multiple times other people have mentioned the possibility of an affair and usually i give people the benefit of the doubt but this is weird as hell
nta his amount of travel is way too much i strongly suspect your husband is having an affair with his friend or using the friend as cover for an affair
there is nothing remotely reasonable about what your husband is doing i don t know who he s having an affair with and you carefully don t mention the friend s gender not that it would prove anything but you are feeling abandoned because you have been your husband spends months of the year away from you having fun and is going away overseas to places you would love to go for six weeks with his other partner please wake up
nta since he gets to take all these trips i think you should start taking trips and leave him home with the kids he gets a week trip then when he comes home you take a week trip tit for tat it s totally not fair for him to be taking all these trips without you
i don t believe he s traveling with a friend nta
sure looks like the friend is either a lover or a wingman and you re the safe fallback this goes well beyond any normal friendship it s been escalating and there s no reason to think it won t continue to escalate if you decide you want out you can very possibly twist things to your advantage tell him that instead of two week trips how about taking a single week trip because that would be less disruptive if he negotiates for a week trip great if he goes for that deal use the weeks to find a job a lawyer and a new place to live anyway you re his victim you re nta
you re nta but i do think you re not facing a harsh truth this dear friend is more than that he has a live in nanny and housekeeper who lets him to take off and travel whenever and to wherever at his leisure use his time away for a month to secure a job and nanny then file for divorce and custody i wish you well
nta have you met this friend are you sure he isn t having an affair
nta you don t make it sound like he s abandoning you and your children for weeks at a time that s exactly what he s doing he s going off and living his fun life while you do all of the work of raising the children
nta guess what you are a single parent with a part time dad in the picture they sound like more than friends
nta you have no social life you can t put in sick days you don t get to see those beautiful places he gets to go enjoy as a partner shouldn t he want a trip with you as a father shouldn t he want a trip with his family there s complete disregard for your personal desires you need to work something out here because months away is crazy he could cut that in half and give you and the kids months of travel dates time off or you could get a job hire a nanny and take the travel time for yourself ywnbta for asking him to shorten his vacation this isn t a fair situation and he needs to see that
nta but something is going on is he gay is he having an affair and someone is covering for him he is entitled to seeing beautiful things and so are you he is unbelievably selfish why are you putting up with this
schedule your own solo vacation travel for three weeks even if it s just to a hotel the next city over
nta very obviously you and your kids are not prioritsed by this man you call your husband i don t believe your husband is taking innocent trips
nta he s living life without you there are many many vacations my husband i postponed bc we had small children during those years he would take day trips with his friends as would i your husband on the other hand is gone a week or two out of every month and wants to be gone an additional six weeks on major vacations cancelling the three week european vacations is the least he should do he should also pare his semi monthly vacations down to once a month please point out to him that he s entirely gone weeks of the year you re not asking him to be be home because you re interested in robbing him of his time with his buddy you re asking that he behave as though he were a partner in your marriage he s being incredibly selfish and believes he s entitled to do whatever he wants he needs to be a full time dad and he can t do that when he s gone of the year
nta he is trying to gaslight you to make you feel guilty about being upset when you have every right to be you don t have a social life because he isn t there to help raise the children you made together while he spends months on trips and hangouts with his friend spending that much time solo with his friend is very odd and he is leaving you to pick up the slack with your children are you sure he s not romantically involved with this friend it sure sounds like it i would hire a p i cause there s definitely something up there
oh honey he s beaten you down so badly that now you re accepting scraps and putting pressure on yourself to smile while doing it my husband spends more time on average with me and the kids than your husband spends with you and mine is in the goddamn army i mean let that sink in there your husband spends less time with you than many people who are legally required to pull hour shifts and deploy at a moment s notice and for what to spend time with a friend yeah no his ass is cheating whether it s physical or not he s stealing time and money and emotional energy that rightfully ought to be directed towards his wife and children he s taking advantage of you and treating you like a live in nanny none of that is ok he deserves to see beautiful things oh hell no what do you and the kids not also deserve to see beautiful things are your time and your relationships completely fucking worthless what about your kids and their memories and their relationships are they also less important than this grown man s escapism fuck scaling back the trip he doesn t need yet another trip to go pretend that he s a childless bachelor what he needs is some priorities and if he refuses to get those in order then maybe it s time for you to go find a man who can be an actual partner in life edit nta obviously you ll only be ta if you tolerate this absolutely unacceptable behavior towards both yourself and your children
nta there s more to this no one with a family goes away that much to see a friend or goes on this many holidays with them how can he even take that much time off work to keep going away you need to start asking a lot more questions about all of this
nta he wants to live like he is single guys only or girls only trips should be once in a blue moon not regularly when you are married it s gaslighting that he s guilt tripping you about it exactly when were you supposed to take these kind of trips and leave him in sole charge of the kids sounds very unequal you have not had time alotted to you to keep up this level of living like a single childless person
have you met this friend or is it his second family
what this sounds like nonsense clearly your husband is involved in a relationship with another person open your eyes deary the red flags are waaaaaaving
i really need an update with what you find out nta
nta this kind of behavior from a married man with two young children is extremely suspicious it sounds like he is having an affair with someone
does the friend come over and visit at your house ever
nta this is not normal
nta you are in no way unreasonable or asking too much from him you can support his friendship without him going on months worth of trips with his friend the fact that he s chosen places you d previously discussed as a couple shows he either completely thoughtless or just doesn t care i m with the other commentators your hubby is having an affair might not be physical but unlikely but definitely emotional where the needs of his friend come first also have never known any good friend that would behave so selfishly
nta when s your vacation
nta i m sorry this man is the love of your life you deserve better
oof my ex used to use all of his vacation solo camping despite my requests to spend time with me or plan it around a time when i could take off of work and camp with him he was banging the neighbor s wife i hope that s not the case here but this friendship sounds really insanely demanding i would do a deep dive on that nta
hire a private investigator and prepare for divorce this tool is cheating on you
did you mean days every weeks or is he actually gone for the majority of each week one is too much one is way way too much this feels weird like something else is going on
nta if he really thinks it s reasonable for him to have these trips then he should see no reason for you to not have equally lavish solo trips full stop what he s doing is painfully neglectful of his family and honestly too friendly for any platonic friendship document these trips look at how he s spending money whiles he s off galavanting with this special buddy of his and keep it all should the day ever come he chooses his pal over his family
nta how is he able to take that much time off work how do your kids feel about dad disappearing for weeks at a time you and your family aren t his focus or really even on his radar i d recommend marriage counseling
nta sorry you re the third wheel in this three way
i am raging on your behalf and you re somehow asking if you re the asshole for wanting him to only leave for one week op you are a saint i also think you re victim to emotional abuse and isolation you deserve so much better couples counseling and ultimatums would be the nice way to go here i personally would go nuclear either way do not accept things as is you are his partner not his nanny
he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things lol what
info has there ever been more than a friendship between your husband and his friend has your husband taken or offered to take you on trips with or without your kids you said you started planning things with no follow through have you ever followed through what are his feelings about missing those major kid events and do your kids question why he s gone so much is your husband sympathetic to your wanting to travel
this isn t a marriage i would be looking for work and packing my bags but that s me you deserve so much more
nta sounds like he has a 2nd family
this person your husband is traveling with is not just a friend i would suggest either resigning yourself to your current situation or start preparing a very good exit strategy i sincerely hope you are not as naive as your post suggests this is not normal it sounds like he is gaslighting you
my question is why does he believe that you don t deserve to see beautiful things why is he fine leaving you so long and so often as a sahm with small children i would fee the same way when do you get to take a break take a trip when is he going to stay home with the kids so you have an opportunity to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things nta
nta maybe i m projecting but my father used to take trips like these with his best friends turns out those best friends was actually one person and it was his ap
nta how many vacations do you get to take
nta
nta the fact that he thinks nothing of spending so much time away from you and from the kids prioritizing himself and his friend over significant events in your kids lives is concerning to say the least have you ever met this friend you haven t alluded to having any suspicions that he s doing anything to betray you while he s gone but from an outside perspective my first thought was that he s going on these trips to engage in some type of illicit activity drugs or prostitutes come to mind in places where he can let off some steam and doesn t have to worry about getting caught or he and his friend are more than just friends i think you should consider that there is likely more to this than meets the eye try reflecting upon how he acts before during and after these trips be vigilant for any inconsistencies do you communicate daily while he s gone does he send you pictures tell you he misses you you re definitely not an ah for being upset you ve been more than accommodating and he keeps pushing for more something s not right sorry to say
so who is gonna tell her
nta i m the king of being away from my family to do things and i advocate that men need personal time but it is like hours a week not days at a time i have the ok for a yearly guys trip of a week but rarely do it i have a few friends that go hunting for a total of a month a year or skiing with buddies for about the same amount of time broken into smaller chunks that feels like a lot you need to come to an agreement for how much time is ok and then he needs to stick to it even if it was very little time you wouldn t be in the wrong to drive a discussion about it
nta he s acting like a single guy with no kids he doesn t need to give up friendships but this amount of time spent away from his family isn t okay
nta you sound so afraid to criticise him saying how wonderful he is when he is abandoning you and the kids on a regular basis the fact that he is the breadwinner right now does not give him the right to do whatever he wants your contribution to your family is as important don t devalue yourself did you per chance grow up with an absent or abusive parent you sound like you are making excuses for just existing and that you have no right to your very valid feelings if you think about it are there ways he puts you down and makes you feel crazy he is clearly having an affair or has a second family is there a discreet way you can investigate this relationship
i m glad you posted here i m sure all these comments are very difficult to read first do something nice for yourself then find the best divorce attorney in the state province territory you don t need to hire that attorney it s just good information to have other redditers have suggested a pi good advice too i think it would be wise to listen to the repeat comments here about his behaviour not being normal and or indicative to someone in a loving committed marriage please take care of yourself your children and your best interests
there s no way he can be gone that often and be a good involved father unless you re talking about him being a good father to other children somewhere else
nta i would also recommend that you check the financials with a fine tooth comb
nta my heart hurts for you after reading this you have children young children at that it s an all hands on deck situation when they are young and need constant supervision and a lot of love visiting days twice a month is already insane if his friend really cared about him they would be visiting him so he could still actively parent and be there for his family and if the friend has a family they could split the visits i already think weekends a month is a crazy amount of time to spend away from family especially if you re working full time these long vacations are a huge slap in the face
nta his behavior is outrageous what if there s an emergency he s more invested in his friend than he is in you and your family consider asking him if he wants a divorce so he can spend all his time with the person who matters most to him i m sincerely so sorry what he s doing to you is just terrible i wouldn t put up with it it isn t the amount of time that s at the heart of this it s his utter lack of loyalty to you
nta everyone is commenting that it s more than likely your husband is having an affair either with this friend or with someone else and his friend is in on keeping the secret i have to agree but even if there is no physical affair your husband is still going on all of these amazing trips you ve planned together with someone else and he s sure to let you know how important living his life is meanwhile your life is home with the kids and friendless i say this as a sahm with no social life your husband does not concern himself with your feelings or goals he s distancing himself more and more and hoping that you ll conveniently not notice this so he can continue frolicking with his friend in all the places he promised to take you i m sorry hun get a job even if it s something simple or online and lawyer up
please post an update i m sorry you had to find out this way don t be his doormat anymore i m so angry for you
friend you might want to look into this friend none of this is remotely normal
nta schedule a solo trip to the same place he is going a month before his trip live it up and do this every time he schedules a trip or just file for divorce i don t know what your husband is up to but it s not husbanding or fathering
nta this is not normal behavior for couples married with children yes friendships are important for both of you but normal friendships do not behave this way i think you need to figure out what is really going on here and move on
nta your so called partner is taking vacations with someone else to places you want to go to he s spending all of his vacation time from work with someone else he abandons you and the kids to spend roughly of the year with someone else look at the whole picture and it sure sounds like he s having an affair i hope he isn t and it is just a friend but either way this is unacceptable behavior you deserve far better than this please stand up for yourself i suggest seeing a therapist because somehow your husband has you believing you are t a for thinking this isn t ok i wish you all the best
info what is this friend s relationship status i m guessing single or divorced because no offense to you but i can t imagine anyone else tolerating this there is simply nothing remotely close to normal with his behavior the twice monthly weekend visits are over the top themselves then a day trips together a few times a year that first big trip was a test they loved it and you allowed it so now it s going to continue there s only one logical explanation for this and i think you know what that is
he s for sure cheating on you leave now
nta what he s doing is so out of line and so inappropriate i think visiting a friend hrs away several times a year would be the absolute limit an oversees trip once every few years but never at the expense of a trip w you why is this friend never coming to you guys reevaluate your marriage if things don t change after you speak w him he is likely having an affair that kind of frequency and effort in a friendship are not normal esp since he s married and no you would not be the asshole for asking him to scale back that trip but the problem on your hands is way bigger than that
nta count the vacation days yr he s taking months off to travel with his friend and going on long trips to places you planned on going together put your foot down and say no or divorce him because he s more committed to his friend than to raising the family you created together
days twice a week days a week
nta he s a father and needs to prioritize that over any friendship i think it s troubling he wouldn t rather spend more time with his kids
nta start some digging and find out what is really going on
nta planning to go where you had spoken of going without you that s an asshole move for sure
nta more than anything he owes you the truth about what is going on from there you can assess what is right for you and how things should look going forward i know a family with a not too different story and the husband has depression and anxiety and tries to run from it so i m not jumping to the conclusion that there is an affair but he s clearly fulfilling something that goes beyond wanting time with a friend
you are either a beard or the side chick but you are nta
nta how involved can he be if he s wanting to be away every other weekend week long vacations with his friend and now wanting to do two week vacations away i mean yeah he s choosing his friend over you and your children i m just curious as to if you guys can afford him going away for weeks why can t you two go on a small childfree vacation yourself
no no no this isn t a wonderful loving husband this is a man more loyal to his friend than to you more attached to his friend than to you and leading a more enjoyable life with his friend than with you and finds his friend a more satisfying travel companion than you why are you tolerating this given your apparent inability to see the weirdness or the truth of your situation i d suggest that you consider hiring a private detective i d also suggest that you get ahold of a copy of you tax return and look at the family accounts is your husband also helping to support his friend is he paying for their joint travel and maybe talk to a divorce attorney just informationally on the off chance that the reality of your husband s double life begins to strike you as intolerable
i have a wonderful loving husband involved father makes good money does housework when a post starts out like this i already know whats coming here comes the buuuuut and wow is it a doozy nta but your husband is traveling to places with his friend that you mentioned you wanted to go evil
nta what kind of job is he doing for having so much holidays it s selfish from him to go live his best life while you re at home taking care of the kids how will your children feels seeing their dad away and happy without you his family all this free time away from his family is weird
wowzer as a married woman with several young children i would never be ok with that much travel for my spouse when i didn t also get to partake also my feelings would be majorly hurt if my spouse planned all sorts of travel to places i d also enjoy going all while i got to stay home and play nanny i def think he s cheating and you re nta
info why is this friendship so important have you considered that it could be more than a friendship
nta if his friend is a man you re a beard and he s cheating on you if his friend is a woman he s still cheating on you
nta do you take trips like this also if not why does only him get to do fun things your husband is being extremely neglectful of both you and y all s children finally he may not be cheating on you but this is very suspect
i m sure you can see by now that the overwhelming comments are universally nta but shouldn t the main points that people are raising concern you even a little he s spending 3months every year but carefully spread apart and increasing in length vacationing with his friend and it doesn t make you question if a he is having an affair with friend b he actually has another family that he s going back to c he s using you and destroingbany sort of family life you are both supposedly working towards like why can t you plan family vacations or better yet insist on tagging along with without kids on his next honeymoon i mean holiday with friend
nta please take the blinders off and take a good long hard look at what is happening in your marriage he s love bombs you while he s there but then guilt trips and manipulates the narrative to get his way this isn t a marriage your a live in nanny chef housekeeper that shares his name while he gets to forget he s married with a family and responsibility and priorities at home not abroad with his good friend affair partner he s living a double life right under your nose start looking and digging there s so many red flags flying and i m surprised you can t see them
info have you met his friend before
nta a lot of people are going to say this friend is more than a friend and i think you should consider that possibility but even if they are just a friend this is still not ok or appropriate for a man with a wife and two young children he is abandoning you would it be ok for you to be gone months of the year how is this getting paid for my friend how are you supposed to manage a social life if your husband is always flouncing around and you never get time to yourself my very dear friend lives five hours away she s as important to me as a my partner i see her every months because our lives at home have to go on and they can t if we are always popping out of them
god above save me from men who do something crappy and then get all hurt and upset when you call them on it ugh he s deflecting he s also the ah and i m guessing he s romantically involved with his friend and living a cover up life of perfection with you you re quite handy to have around to take care of his house and kids so he can go off any time he wants to nta
nta and i think you re not really upset about the trips because alarms started blaring in my head when i read about the meaningful friendship part what friendship isn t meaningful girl his travel buddy is not just that get counseling truly get an objective third person to talk with both of you because your husband might not believe the internet lol even if we all come to the same conclusion you re probably stressed because you re facing the prospect of your comfortable life imploding if you push too hard on this be brave girl especially for the kids they don t deserve daddy swanning off every few weeks to scratch his itches jeez
nta op i ll say this as kindly as i can wake up this is not a friendship that your husband had cultivated it is an affair he is traveling and having meaningful friendships and seeing beautiful things with someone he is screwing op start planning your exit now your husband is envolved in an entanglement that he s been carrying on for a while it seems before you confront him get all of your marital financial information etc together and then call a divorce lawyer so that you can plan you and your children s exit once you ve done that hit him with divorce papers sn get a full std panel to protect yourself from possible illnesses i won t even touch on all your so s various extravagant vacation plans without you and his weak ass explanations as to why he deserves them and you as the mother of his children and their caregiver does not wow bruuuh
am i being unreasonable about this absolutely not i haven t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life i basically don t have one anymore yeah no shit you are raising the kids while he works and fucks off to go on a vacation when was the last time you had a full day as in work day hours of you time a day where the kids were his responsibility so you could do whatever you want so bonus wibta if i insisted he scale back the summer trip to week in my opinion you wouldn t even be ta if you insisted on the entire trip to be canceled i m not the first one to say this but the friend is not a friends there is a lot more going on there so look in to that and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself nta
there isn t enough info you are painting your husband in a horrible light despite your intro either you are extremely blind or you are leaving out valuable info no one would go on trips like this with just a friend either he s gay and in a relationship with this friend or he s having an affair with someone else it s like he has two families unless he just really doesn t want to be around you you wouldn t need this sub for validation with a husband acting like this so either add the other info that is left out or admit you already know he s with another person or this friend no one can be this blind and i don t think a loving husband would spend so much time away at this point this doesn t seem like an equal marriage or even a basic marriage from what you say he has no regard for you your kids or your marriage this relationship seems over to be honest
definitely nta he sounds like a part time father husband and a full time friend to said friend but maybe a little additional info might help is this friend m or f and have you ever met the person
info tell us more about the friend this sounds shady af if it s not shady it ain t right
this is throwing so many red flags i don t even know where to start this is completely unfair and one sided your feelings don t seem to matter to him at all no wife would be okay with this unless they hated their husband while he s gone for weeks i would find a divorce attorney and get a plan together for leaving him
think about it this way how would your husband feel if you took your equivalent share of vacation time and left him to deal with kids and household on his own would he find that reasonable nta
nta you are so far from being unreasonable your husband however his requests are so unreasonable it s ridiculous i never jump to cheating but there is not really any good reason a parent with kids needs deserves more than one solo trip per year per friend why are you never invited to travel together a solo trip with a friend every once in a while is fine but if you are never invited also do you ever get solo travel if you took off anywhere near as much as he does he would surely realize how unreasonable it is but he is one foot out the door so
nta why are you staying with him he put you and his kids last on his list does the friend come and stay with you too this makes no sense at all
double life girl open those eyes see the read flags you are nta but your husband sure is the mother should be able to have the same equal time away to as she pleases would he like being home with kids for that long with you on a trip so so many red flags run run run
nta i m sorry you feel that crumbs of a partnership are enough what was the point of getting married and having kids did only you want this life it seems that way best of luck
nta there is not one spouse on earth who would think this situation is reasonable acceptable or fair in any way like many others i suspect his friend is more than a friend but even if they are truly platonic i would divorce a partner who treated me and my children this way
nta as others have said he s either having an affair with his friend or using his friend as an accomplice to have an affair with someone else or he has a 2nd family something else jumped out to me you said you don t have a social life has he isolated you from former friends if so that sounds like narcissistic behaviour lots of red flags here
nta i am married and i wouldnt like my husband to take solo vacations thats why we are marrried he has travelled on his own for very particular reasons that have to do with his job funerals it really seems this friendship is very odd straight man dont spend all that much together thats more like a female thing to do my husbands has many friends he calls them sometimes he visits them with me or alone and thats it he doesnt go on trips with any of them unless it s a couples thing i dont even think thats something he d like to do i am very sorry to hear this but it really looks like this male friend is more than a friend or he is lying and he doesnt take trips with him but with a girlfriend be careful you are not wrong in your feelings something is off
nta but it sounds like you have bigger problems

my brother is on their side no shit he s the golden child and you re the scape goat welcome to the club sorry you ll have to pay for it like i did keep it small and within your budget if they start complaining that they want x more people tell them to pony up for those x more people or stfu best of luck congrats nta
nta no they aren t obligated to pay for your wedding but i completely understand why you are upset the good news is that you don t have to succumb to any of their wishes and you really don t even have to invite them have as nice a wedding as you can afford and limit contact with them this will save you years of perpetual disappointment
this is blatant favoritism it s easy to tell who the golden child is it s true they re not obligated to pay for any wedding but the imbalance here is massive you re nta for noticing and objecting to their double standards tell your parents that this is effectively your second wedding your first wedding was a beach house and you still have one paid wedding to go it won t work but it might give you some satisfaction to remind them of their own previous actions definitely don t invite your parents
nta don t invite them to the wedding and when they ask why tell them you ran out of money
nta while they aren t obligated to pay for weddings it is really bad that they have paid for for your brother and left you out when you do get married have someone else you are close to walk you down the aisle petty but might make the point
nta don t invite them to your wedding they obviously don t care about you
nta but is your name monica and is your brother s name ross
nta technically your parents are not obligated to pay for your wedding but given the circumstances and weddings for your brother i get why you re upset
i m not monica gellar guys i m truly not i just relate to her heavily about how my brother is the golden child
is this monica parents paid for your brothers wedding to his lesbian wife and then his british wife and then he got married a third time in vegas but your wedding fund is a beach house maybe they ll give you the porsche
this may sound really petty but if you decide on having a wedding and reception have your fianc s family or your friends go with you to select the venue dress shopping flower shop cake testing etc do not include your parents at all or invite any of their friends to the wedding limit your brother s invite to just him no plus one when you prepare the seating chart sit them far away at a table by themselves they are not required to pay for your wedding but given that they paid for of your brother s and surely helped him with other funds along the way you are not obligated to placate them as doting parents
monica everyone knows your brother is a medical marvel and your parents love him more nta for being annoyed but yta for thinking they ll change just cut your losses and cut contact
nta for being upset you already know they don t owe you a wedding this unfair treatment sucks i know because i am also always last on the list between my brother my sister and myself i was the first to get married and didn t get or expect a dime from anyone
nta because you re not expecting them to pay you are just disappointed that they are going back on a promise especially when their was no question about paying for your brother even if this is simply a friends knock off these types of things do happen figure out what s best for your own health knowing you can t trust or relie on your parents can you have a relationship with them without expectations if so do you want that
nta your parents suck
feck em elope to a beach and get married with just the two of you my wife and i did it years ago and we had the best wedding i ve ever been to
nta your parents are playing favorites and your obviously the child they love less
nta i m sorry i totally get this when one of my sisters was she was getting married a few months from her engagement her fiance s family had more money than ours and offered to help my dad would go on and on ranting to me about how he wished she would just wait a year because he could save and give her this amazing wedding and how he felt bad that he couldn t contribute more than some food and her veil fast forward a couple years and i m getting married about a year from engagement to wedding date i immediately talked to my dad and asked him if he thought he could help with this venue i found by wedding standards it was super cheap and included clean up decor a catering discount dj and a bunch of other stuff smaller town areas it was about 5k much less than what he was saying he wanted to do for her wedding i didn t want him to even pay the whole thing i just wanted to know if he could help and if so how much he thought he could he said it d be too expensive and that he could let me know the week before the wedding if i needed help still maybe he could get some more food for us if we didn t have it catered it really hurt because to me it felt like a slap in the face kids out of the house now more money than he d had years before and the time he d said he d need to do an extravagant wedding it made me feel like i was less of his kid or less important not even a veil or guaranteed food help her veil was like i ve no idea how much the food was that he helped with but he made it seem like a lot it was fine we ended up doing a vfw hall for super cheap some family and ourselves made most of the food i made my wedding cake an aunt made cupcakes too she s an amazing baker and used to cater events for friends my best friend s mom bought my dress for me we did a court house ceremony and then a reception at the v was it my dream no but it was doable without debt it was fun we were surrounded by people that really cared and i knew officially where i stood with which family members plus my uncle s potato salad is literally the best thing in the world and no catering could have topped that for me congrats on your engagement and please don t let this ruin it for you you re getting married for hopefully life that s the part to focus on your day will be beautiful no matter what because of that not because of flower arrangements
nta but your parents kind of are they can pay for three of your brother s weddings but not one of yours i would be angry too
nta because it is favoritism that ross gets a whole ass free ride for weddings and i saw in another comment they said they would when you were younger so i get being upset that they just decided to not stick to their word but no one owes anyone that kind of money either i think it might be a blessing in disguise if it s your money then you can do whatever you want it might not be the big thing you may want but you get free reign on every decision that s gotta be a good silver lining personally i think i would save a bit and then elope and not invite them a small ceremony in pretty place with those who actually love you and your soon to be so sounds like it d be well deserved edit autocorrect going nuts on me sorry
your parents clearly never had any intentions to pay for your wedding not now not ever if your brother decide to get marry a fourth time they ll found the money in an instant don t except a dime for themselves
nta you had expectations based on what you were told but to be honest you re not surprised this is how it shook out are you that said hey do you really want your parents and your brother at your future wedding people who treated you as less important your whole life the plus side with these power dynamics is without the financial aspect they don t have any strings to pull you by a common issue with children of a narcissistic parents is being unable to cut financial ties to them because they need it to survive i am sure as you can figure out your wedding but you don t have to invite them wedding should be filled with people who support you don t go in debt over a wedding
nta you should calmly ask your parents why they believe it is fair they paid for of your brother s weddings but are uninterested in yours don t let them make the conversation about you or your feelings keep directing them to share their feelings and rationale on treating you so differently than your brother in a best case scenario they ll realize they are assholes in the worst case scenario you ll realize they are assholes and decide lc nc is best
these comments about guess you ll just have to pay for it yourself are silly guys she knows it s not about that i know ya ll are still calling her family out but seriously she knows she will have to pay and she is not acting entitled
nta you have every right to be upset with them over this three weddings vs one totally unfair i d say it s time to go lc with them and since they re not funding the wedding they have no say in anything about it including if they are invited or not
nta parents should really set a we only pay for one wedding per kid rule
nta thank your parents for making the choice to invest in your brother as now it is abundantly clear he will be the one who will be responsible for caring for them emotionally and financially as they age
nta for having an expectation that was mentioned to you and given to your brother y t a for continuing to allow them to hurt you they obviously don t care as much about you as your brother so it s time to start returning that favor go nc as much as you can don t allow them into your life or wedding make it clear that they will not be part of your childrens lives nor will you be there for them as they age it hurts at first but sometimes pulling the bandaid off is easier than death by cuts
nta treat your kids equally or you re a shitty parent
nta for being upset and expecting the same treatment your brother got times married and divorced times by years if age with the last marriage lasting less than years is absurd save up some money have your wedding don t invite your parents or brother they made it clear who they care about so go along with it and be lc nc
nta frustrating to read all these other posts effectively telling you to grow up as if you re some kind of brat you are right to be upset at the blatantly unfair treatment and you told your parents as much you are not ta or entitled for calling out your parents on their favoritism
nta you are not ta for feeling this way it s disappointing that they did not feel the desire to keep those funds aside for your wedding a bit longer people are generally waiting later in life to get married anyway that said you should never expect someone to foot the bill for your wedding regardless of whether they paid for your sibling s at the end of the day it s their money and they can spend it however they choose the good news is that since they aren t paying for it they don t get to meddle in the planning which is often the case when parents pay good luck and i hope you and your fianc have a wonderful wedding
nta for being disappointed but push on and do your own thing maybe they ll come up with a nice monetary gift or contribution later which would just be a bonus in the end it s their money to do as they wish and apparently their wish was to waste it on two more marriages for your brother
nta i think the anti wedding bias of the average reddit is reflected in the esh comments here if we were talking about cars or college educations everyone would be able to sympathize with the op but because she is upset over wedding costs we are supposed to believe the op is an entitled brat that s nuts
nta your parents aren t obligated to pay for your wedding however you are completely ok with being upset given how differently they treat you and your brother honestly i would sit your parents down and explain how poorly they ve treated you compared to your brother further i would go low to no contact with them
your bro had wedding funds you have none not fair completely disrespectful and yes this does read like a friend s episode i don t understand why your parents think you re the ah they makes no sense i think they know they re wrong rather than apologize for it they re making you out to be the ah but you re nta
nta don t even bother inviting them to your wedding if they ask why just tell them you didn t have the budget for it if they ever ask you for money in the future just tell them to use your wedding funds oh wait sucks to suck
nta of course your brother is on their side he is sweeting them up for when he ll ask to pay for his fourth wedding
i d not invite any of them and say sorry money was tight we had to cut people
don t know if your brother has any children from his marriages but if he doesn t you may be having their only grandchildren you will need to protect them from your parents
nta and i wouldn t invite them while they re not obligated to pay for either kid s wedding the fact that they bent over backwards for your brother and spent your fund on themselves is a slap in the face and i don t think they re going to realize exactly how much they ve damaged their relationship with you unless you tell them they re not welcome at the ceremony your brother too if he insists on getting in the middle of this
nta if they refuse to pay for your wedding i would just save up so that way you can have your wedding but definitely i wouldn t recommend inviting your parents or your brother
nta you re not being treated equally by your parents they favor your brother
he s the golden child you re never going to win with them nta
nta no shit he s on their side cut off the parents invest some crazy money and get even crazier returns put it all into the wedding offer unlimited booze and food and make it a 24hr dance party in the white house or just have a simple wedding in a simple place that doesn t harm your finances much invite over people you love once the wedding is over start a barbecue party i would personally prefer the latter don t invite parents and brother in either case
nta your whole family sucks your brother is the golden child and you re the scapegoat feel free to cut them out of your life nobody needs that narcissistic bullshit
nta they had no obligation to fund your weddig but they did put up a fund for it and let you know about it not telling you previously about spending said fund is a dick move and funding three weddings for your brother adds insult to injury
nta your brother got married times you we re dating a guy but it didn t work out but yours parents bought a beach house instead of saving the money that s really unfair
nta but it does hurt that they paid for everyone elses but yours the way to perhaps look at this is do the wedding you can afford or elope and just dont invite them and when the screaming starts u just say i could only afford this much and had to limit invitations
throw a tiny wedding and tell them they can t come cause you don t have enough money for everyone then go on a nice honeymoon if possible and enjoy life with your soon to be husband and start a wedding fund for your future kids if you want fuck em all also hell no you are nta
nta i m wondering if there is a cultural component of preferring boys over girls your brother is the golden child who can do no wrong
nta they paid for of his weddings but not your you have every right to be upset they clearly favour him over you
nah it s their money not yours x200b pay for a small wedding don t invite them they want to play favorites play it right back find someone to walk you down the aisle other than you d
isn t this just the plot of friends when monica s parents spent the wedding money on a beach house
nta you aren t entitled to a paid for wedding but the fact that their favoritism is so obvious sucks and parents shouldn t be like that
honestly i would not invite them to the wedding and cut all contact with them your life would be better without them in it they literally paid for all of your brothers failed marriages but won t pay for one or yours
yeah this is a load of crap because it s the exact plot from friends monica s parents use her wedding fun to buy a beach house after she breaks up with richard who everyone thought she would marry after they helped to fun ross marriages good try though
they don t owe you a wedding but even with that if i were in your shoes i would be hurt
is this just me or does this seem like monica from friends either way nta not cool of them to do that and they re being hypocritical by paying for three weddings for him and none for you
i don t know how to pass judgement on this to be honest you shouldn t feel entitled to someone else s money but also your parents are clearly treating you and your brother unfairly even into adulthood no they don t owe you a wedding fund but if they paid for all weddings for your brother i could understand why you would expect something from them i would have the conversation with them that at this point it s not about the money but if they don t start treating you more fairly in comparison with your brother that they will have less and less roles in your life they have a choice to step up as better parents i would at least give that to them and if they don t start treating you equally i would go low or possibly no contact with them
ask chandler how much money he has saved for wedding scenario a
nta but i can see where to cut costs clearly removing people form the guest list and the first two should be your parents
nta they are not obligated to pay but wow was it ever unfair of them to do so for your brother times and you not at all they are not obligated to pay but you are not obligated to invite people who treat you like a lesser person than your brother
nta don t invite them to your wedding when they complain tell them you re working to a tight budget for the guest list and need to prioritise the people who care about you
nta but sadly it sounds like you come from a culture that values the male over the female child start your own fund and the wedding isn t the important thing but i get it be careful though i m sure your parents expect you to take care of them in their elderly years
nta this pisses me off
yta your parents have no obligation to fund your wedding and you re not entitled to their money it s their money and they do with it as they please now are tta for making differences between you and your brother absolutely but again if you want to get married you and your fiance can fund the wedding
wow your parent s only gave you to to get married and they paid for of your brother s weddings get married at the beach house
nta parents are over rated forget the proper date for them when the wedding invites come out
you wbta to yourself if you don t go low to no contact with them at this point
ywnb and you are nta for your feelings ever i know a way that can get you on your way to saving for a nice little wedding you could pare down the guest list by at least three your brother and your parents
your parents are ah lose contact with them
nta but wow the privilege in this post
nta they don t owe you this money but at the same time the way they re paying for your brother s multiple and ever failing weddings while not keeping a penny for you is really discriminatory
i really thought more of the comment section would be familiar with this particular storyline in friends fake but ty for the laugh
you are allowed to be upset but they don t have to pay for anything use this as a reason to have a simple wedding and pay for it yourselves
you technically aren t entitled to any wedding fund but that isn t the issue for any that don t realize this the problem is that they appear to favor op s brother and op you are absolutely nta for being upset about what appears to be blatant favoritism note that i say that there appears to be favoritism and i want to emphasize appears because i do have a double question that needs to be answered and can change the ruling of this dilemma how long have you been seeing your now fianc and how long have they known about the relationship if your family only recently found out about your relationship then that completely changes things if they have known about it for a while then my first paragraph remains true
eurgh i hate posts like this why don t people pay for their own damn weddings so much entitlement
deleted
lavish weddings are a waste of resources anyway get married and have a little party
i understand why you re hurt and they re bogus for their actions but they don t owe you a wedding fund if you want a fund you save for it
esh your parents clearly have shown some favorable actions towards your brother however at the end of the day it is their money you are an adult plan accordingly
nta but let your parents live in peace i can t imagine taking care my children in my late 60s
esh your parents are clearly unfair but you are also in your 30s i mean i would probably go low contact with them not bc of the actual money but bc of how little they seem to care about you vs your brother from the sounds of it esp when they spent all that money two years ago on his third wedding hardly inconceivable that you would get married in the future given you were still in your 20s not that 30s is even late but by some ppl s standards it could be culturally etc i m not sure if it s reddit or usa but ppl seem to get married crazy young compared to most ppl that i have known where late 20s to early to mid is the norm
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** this might be long sorry in advance i 30f have a brother 33m and my parents are 66f and 66m my parents have always put my brother c above me since i can remember my brother has been married times and my parents paid for all weddings and he s now single when i was mid s i started dating a guy and i thought we were going to get married but unfortunately our life plans didn t work out at that point my parents had a wedding fund for me because i was and in love today i found out that once we broke up they used my wedding fund to buy a beach house the problem i recently got engaged to my fianc k 30m and now i have no wedding fund incase anyone is wondering my brothers 3rd marriage was when he was and my parents footed the whole bill i told my parents i was upset that they didn t think about my future like they thought about my brothers and they called me an ah my brother is on their side aita for being upset over this i know it s sorta small but i was hoping to have some of a wedding fund considering how expensive they are and my family is well off i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta for being upset but the reality is that it s not their job to pay for your wedding while it would ve been nice and should ve been something they did considering they paid for for your brother it s not mandatory i would just plan something you can afford and just try to make the best of it you can choose to not invite them if you d like but that s your call
info are they saying they won t pay for your wedding or just that your fund from your 20s is gone i doubt they made a fund for your brother three times but they still managed to pay for everything did you get engaged and immediately blow up at them about not having a wedding fund anymore
nta
your parents suck for treating your brother differently from you but you re not entitled to your parents paying for your wedding esh
so no one told you life was gonna be this way
yta for thinking someone else should be paying for your dam wedding its called entitlement and you have a bit of it you marriage you bill life isn t fair and just because lil johnny got it don t mean you deserve it
nta your parents really play favorites and that sucks if it were me i d have a small intimate wedding and just invite friends and your new family my wish for you is that you get the mother and father you should have had in your new mil fil i hope they treasure and adore you
gross favoritism of one child over another is not a small thing and you have every reason to be disappointed and upset that said i think that to have a good life you need to move on have a small wedding that you and your fiance can afford or elope and afterwards have a massive party do not invite the parents who call you an asshole for being upset that your brother gets wedding and you get zero or the brother who things this is swell start your new life with your new husband surrounded by people who don t constantly disappoint you but who value you you and treat you as you deserve to be treated nta and i m so sorry about your awful family
nta
nta at all they don t need to give you money but considering the fact that you were expecting it and your brother could get money for weddings you have every right to be upset they re not good parents and not good people have whatever kind of wedding you can afford and go nc with them your brother because having them in your life is clearly not benefitting you
info before you told your parents that you are upset with them and accused them of not caring about your future and preferential treatment did your parents give an actual confirmation one way or the other whether or not they plan on paying for your wedding because idk if they had a fund that suddenly didn t have a purpose and had the means to recharge it later then using those funds for something else is a totally reasonable thing to do a fund sitting around gathering dust without a target payout date isn t doing anyone any good your parents have proven willing to take the initiative and pay for both of their children s weddings including yours i feel like you jumped to a conclusion out of jealousy for your brother and i think you shot yourself in the foot when you perceived unfair treatment instead of talking about whether or not they re planning on paying you took your lack of knowledge about their plans as them favoring your brother and accused them of not caring about your future that would be out of line you clearly aren t close to the details of how your parents plan their funds for things if you had no idea that they used the previous moneys for something else i find no reason to think they weren t planning on paying for your wedding yet you lashed out at them without them actually saying we will not be paying for your wedding hence info not enough info so not submitting judgement but i strongly suspect you jumped to conclusions out of jealousy for your brother and made an ass of yourself
deleted
yta nobody owes you a wedding
idk but your entire family are ah your parents are ah for shouldering your brother s marriages and don t give a damn about yours and yta for expecting your parents to pay for your wedding

info are you seriously going to marry someone just because your parents asked you to
info do you actually like your fiance or are you getting married out of obligation to your parents something feels off about this story i get that you d like to be protective of these children but with the whole it takes a village statement in mind why wouldn t you want her to take interest in the childrens lives it sounds like you don t want anyone to encroach on this family you have with your best friend and his kids even if it s someone you re about to marry and potentially have your own children with
info have you told your fiance you don t love her don t want children with her and that she ll always come second after your friend and his your children
yta and please don t marry this woman for her own sake
yta talking about you and the friend us we we re our talking about the fiancee she your dynamic is weird and that s fine but you shouldn t marry a woman you aren t in love with i almost wrote just to appease your parents after that but the advice is universal
info need more description of how she s trying to force her way in wanting to come along and taking part in an important part of her fiance s life doesn t seem egregious right now you re coming off as defensive eta yta you re purposefully going to ruin this woman s life so your parents leave you alone about marriage you both deserve better than what you re enforcing
yta it sounds like these kids are a big part of your life you mentioned in the comments you visit them times a week give or take a day or meaning some weeks you might be there everyday that s fantastic no issues there for you to expect your future wife to have no part of this large part of your life that s not reasonable would you rather she go the opposite direction and want you to cut these kids out of your life
all these years later and i d say we re both doing pretty well for ourselves i have a nice apartment he has a beautiful home on land that was given to him by his parents which is honestly where i spend a majority of my time and you re wondering why your fiancee wants to be a part of this also it sounds like you re already in a committed relationship with your friend it would be nice of you to let her know that you re not willing to share that part of your life so she can find someone whos available
yta you said in your comments that you spend about days a week with your friend and his kids you also said your first loyalty lies with them why are you even getting married your soon to be wife isn t allowed to be involved in one of the biggest parts of your life how do you think that s going to work when you re over there she just has to stay home i get why your friend doesn t want her to be a mother figure but why can t she just be a cool aunt who just loves the kids and supports them in any way she can if you truly believe it takes a village you should know that kids can never have too many people in their lives who love and support them
info how much of your time are you spending helping out with these children i ask because it may be a serious problem in a potential marriage to maintain what is basically a separate family that she is excluded from if you want to stay deeply involved in these children s day to day lives and they are not interested in having her in this picture have you asked or otherwise gotten an opinion from your friend about this you may not really be long term compatible with your fiance
info why does it bother your so much that she wants to come along and be involved with your best friend s kids if you re going to marry her she ll become like an aunt to them does your friend have an issue with her trying to be a part of all this with his kids i find it super bizarre that you don t want to be around them when you re set to marry her are you insecure that they ll like her better or something
info can you provide examples of how she infiltrates or is she just demanding to come along but not saying much or only repsonding to what shappening at the moment think we need more specifics on her exact behaviour edit yta she s trying to be included in one of the biggest parts of your life which i can imagine is disappointing when you tell her no it sounds like this family is your family and she should be included in major events if you actually like love her
info would you rather marry your bestie
yta for planning to marry a woman and continue your second platonic family unit with your best friend
yta it sounds like you re gatekeeping these kids from your fiance and it s so weird that you re doing that you have this whole other family that you keep your fiance away from you even have a sinister way of describing it infiltrating their lives she just wants to be apart of something so important to you i think you need to have a think about where your priority lies your fiance or a platonic friendship
yta you say these people are family to you yet you keep her separate from them the way you talk about her is like she is an accessory you went out and got because you parent thought it was a good idea and you wanted to appease them a fianc is supposed to be an integral part of your life and family she wants to be involved that s normal you need to think a little harder about what you actually want in your life it sounds like you want a family unit with your friend his kids and a fianc to shut down the parental nagging
can we just state the obvious you are married to your best friend you are marrying this woman as a beard to hide the fact that you are emotionally and spiritually married to another man there is nothing wrong with that but yta for involving an innocent woman in your relationship just marry your best friend already
just do this woman a favor and break off the engagement she deserves somebody who truly wants to marry her because they wait for it want to marry her yta
removed
yta marry your friend so your fiance can find someone who actually cares about her you spend the whole post talking about the kids and all your fiance gets is my parents want grandkids so now im engaged to someone who i usually get along with she can easily see how much of a part of these kids lives you are it s your priority as you have said so if she is becoming part of your life why can t she help with the kids she probably appreciates everything you re doing for them and wants to also help out and you re icing her out because idk i guess you re jealous that the kids might like her what s your problem op why are you part of the kids life to such a degree but she can t be
yta it s pretty clear that you have no interest to be in a serious committed relationship it s not weird that your fiance would want to be included in such an important part of your life you are being selfish you want to continue to have your family with your friend while getting your parents off your back that s not fair to your fiance she deserves better
yta oh just be with your friend already stop being dishonest with your fianc and youself it s not fair to her at all
yta you see these kids as part of your familial unit they may not call you dad but they most likely see you as a parental figure your fiance is about to formally join as part of your family it s not wrong for her to want to try to integrate herself into your family
info what s their dad s opinion of her
yta you already have a family why on earth are you marrying her
yta she is being pushy but you can t blame her she is trying to get close to the people you love and you care about and you snap at her i think you don t want to marry a person if you don t want them in your loved ones lives if that makes sense
yta marry your bestie and leave this woman alone so she can be with someone who truly loves and values her
yta let me get this straight you are at your friends house days a week on average give or take a day or two so to days a week thats the majority of your time at worst or about half of the time erring on more than your understanding fiance has no issue with this but she wants to be involved and help out she can t be an ah after being so understanding she has met them once and keeps trying to come along and you shoot it down and hold the meeting once against her already makes you an ah and toxic preventing her from becoming involved and blaming her for this is horrible you only started dating for your parents sake you never say you love your fiance you refer to your friends kids and him as ours in context and refer fo fiance as her contextually freely admitting your fiance isn t your family your friend is icing on the cake is you asked your friend about this and he doesn t want to introduce a new person to his kids that means your friend either doesn t want you to date doesn t plan on ever seeing her or is romantically interested in you all huge red flags on his part and you allow it now you and your boy friend are ahs you have the opposite of a bad partner you have a loving fiance who accepts this unusual relationship dynamic and wants to enrich it she doesn t complain you give so much time you are a major ah in summary you are either romantically in love with your friend or are a huge ah
yta if her tagging along to see the kid off to his school dance is the best example you can come up with of her overstepping and infiltrating then i think it s a you problem she wants to be in your life and your life includes these kids i think it s understandable given the way you ve described your dating history but you need to think about what being in a serious relationship actually looks like
let your fiance live her life wait out your homophobic parents and marry your boyfriend my guy yta
honest question do you love your fiance it truly seems like you are with her just for your parents you like spending time with her you say but you aren t inviting her into your life you aren t letting her join the family which is unfair she doesn t know the kids because you won t let her why ask her to marry you yta please just let her go
yta weird reaction there super defensive what s wrong with the kids having more love in their lives yet another member of the village to help them become wonderful and happy humans you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman and these kids are in it i am truly confused by your reaction as i suspect she is too maybe i m just missing something here but perhaps she just wants to be more involved in your life and by extension the kids
yta please stop stringing this woman along it s cruel it s one thing to wait to come out until your family is no longer around but don t ruin someone s life in a sham relationship
yta you are planning to marry this woman while also keeping her excluded from your family this is so fucked up
yta if you don t love your fiancee don t marry her if you want to be with your best friend it s probably best you say something sooner rather than later
sooooo you want her for a beard
i think you need to reword your question atia for proposing to a woman when i m in love with my best friend but can t admit that i m not straight
yta i hope your fiance leaves
yta because you didn t tell your fiancee she is suppose to be your beard not your wife
yta you kept referring to your fiance as an outsider or random person in regards to your friend s kids she is your fiance so not random if she s important to you which is doubtful then why don t you want her to be a part of their life i know you love these kids but they aren t actually your kids did you adopt them is there a legal guardianship happening what do they call you and be honest with yourself about your feelings towards your friend and your fiance then break off the engagement and live with the person kids you truly love
yta it s you and your buddy can just come out now
info needed does your fianc know you are having an emotional and possibly sexual affair with your best friend
ugh is this for real yta if it is you know once you marry her i hope not if this is your attitude it means you share your life with her including this cosy little family you ve cobbled together if you have a deeply personal connection with them why shouldn t she have the chance to try and build one with them why are you treating them like your secret family how dare you marry someone just because that s what your parents want
both of us have been operating like a little familial unit with no outside help other than from our own families you do understand your fiancee is going to be your actual family not just operating like a family please do this girl a favor and break up with her i don t know if you love your friend or not but you ve clearly created this family unit and see no place for your fiancee in it yta
one would think you d be happy she took an interest in the kids you are so proud of i find your behavior a bit jealous if you are to marry her and by your own words you spend most of your time at your friends property wouldn t it make sense for her to take interest into these people who you are close with yta
info does she know that you re using her to appease your parents and that you don t love her
based on the info you ve given so far yta if these kids are your family and you re going to marry her they need to know each other if your friend doesn t want her to take on a motherly role then that s a conversation he needs to have with your fianc but you can t just insist she doesn t even get to know them while you continue to spend a lot of time there or were you planning on disappearing to your friend s house early on christmas morning and leaving her alone
yta my parents told me to is one of the worst reasons to get married to someone i don t see her overstepping here these are people that are close to you she wants to be close to them as well you didn t describe her coming in to try and parent them or distance you from them even just go be a weird family with your best friend and let her live a happy life with someone who actually loves her
yta you re supposed to want your spouse to be involved with the most important people in your life not push her away from them
marry your best friend ditch the fiancee
yta please don t make a major life decision like marriage in order to please other people if you are happy with the life you ve created with your friend and their children then don t marry someone just to appease your parents do you truly think it s fair moral even to give someone the false impression that you actually want to marry them when in reality you re only doing it because someone else wants you to
yta so when you coming out
you re seriously doing this lady a disservice by stringing her along like this what s wrong with you also who goes out to find a wife just because mommy and daddy said so you don t sound terribly well adjusted for someone that talks about the future wife quite condescendingly it almost sounds like you are interested in the dad maybe you should bring him home to meet mommy and daddy and see if he meets their approval yta
weird
yta you should marry your best friend and continue your little family unit instead of being disrespectful to your fiancee
dude you re marrying the wrong person also yta obviously
so you acknowledge that it takes a village but when the woman you are bringing into your village tries to participate in said village it s a problem yta
just tell your friend you love him you re in love with him stop leading this girl on
i m not surprised why you didn t have luck in the romantic department before she isn t forcing herself onto these kids she s trying to tag along you spend so much time with them and consider them family but you don t want your future wife to be part of this yta
so you can play a second father figure but the woman you want to marry can t play a mother figure and you think that that s ok yta
this whole situation is bizarre yta set ber free so that she can find someone who doesn t already have a family
you didn t even mention your fianc until the end of the third paragraph even then you make it sound like you felt obligated to shack up lest disappointing your parents the woman in your life shares your interest in your family just as you do the correct reaction is gratitude your contempt makes me wonder what the actual dynamic is between you and your friend and if it s reciprocated yta
trying to force herself into the lives of children she doesn t know that s called getting to know people and forming relationships with them sounds like you don t want any competition for your friend s attentions yta
yta let this woman go so she can find someone who actually wants her in their lives because you obviously don t end of discussion
yta it sounds like you wanna be in a platonic relationship with your best friend and raise his children together and you e just dragged this lady in your life to appease your parents you describe your fianc as a nice lady you generally get along with are you ducking serious not only that but it s clear that these children mean a great deal to you it seems like she s trying to get to know them because they are important you not just because she s trying to force her way into their life this is weird you re an asshole please don t get married
yta your comments just show what an asshole you are you don t like this woman and don t want her to be family so why you with her for sex you selfish ass
just so we re clear you re gay right i don t mean that in a derogatory or mocking way i just want to make sure i honestly understand the situation before i render a judgment
yta you will soon be her spouse and you admittedly have more than a friendly connection with these children any worthwhile partner would see what a big role they play in your life and make the effort to get to know them the children are important to you so they are important to your partner if you are close to marrying this person why does she not have a personal connection with them yet x200b what did said snapping include i am betting a lot more than what you are letting on if you are engaged and have not spoken in days
it s the kids decision if the kids have no opinion either way i don t see why she shouldn t try to bond with them esp considering you re getting married
yta it s strange that she d want to be seen as a mother figure but it s even stranger that you re seemingly in love with your buddy and his family who are a huge part of your life but not your own future wife save her a lot of heart ache and misery and cut things off if you can t reconcile your relationships into something more harmonious
yta if you actually love this woman and truly want to marry her and have her become your immediate family and the most important person in your life you should want to have her get to know these kids that you re so close to if you want to marry her because she s a nice accessory that would please your parents but you want to maintain your family relationship with your friend and his kids completely separate and apart from her you should tell her that you don t really love her you don t want to build a family with her because you already have a family with this friend you need to be honest with her and set her free to find someone who will actually love her you do not sound like you do
yta from your post it doesn t seem like you love your wife and just married her for the sake of your parents seems like she is just trying to be a part of your life but you just don t want to let her in if you want your marriage to work you need to invest more in it or just spare her the emotional damage edit also are you sure you don t have any closeted feelings for your best friend
this is so sad it sounds like you are in love not with your fiancee but with your friend and if not him then at least the life you feel you have built together your fiancee clearly understands that these children are important to you and is trying to bond with and make time for them and you re not only shutting her out but making her out to be unreasonable i can t get over your use of the word infiltrate it is such an ungenerous and cruel way of viewing this this woman deserves to be with someone who loves and respects her and it doesn t sound like you feel either of these things i would suggest you break things off with her and have an honest conversation with your friend and your parents who really shouldn t be involved in your love life
yta because you seem to be in love with your friend and seem to be stringing her along otherwise it makes no sense why you wouldn t want her to get to know the kids you so affectionately speak about her logic makes total sense and you responded with unnecessary harshness and a jealousy quite frankly
yta please let this woman go and find happiness while you and your friend continue on with your lives and your kids i don t know if you live in a society that just isn t really accepting of your lifestyle but after reading through your comments to other people i cannot possibly find myself believing you don t pine for this other man in some way which despite what your society religion might say is actually okay
don t get married it won t work
this is so strange do you know how many people would kill to have a so want to be so involved nothing you said makes her sound like overstepping you sound weirdly protective yta
i feel so bad for your fiance you refuse to answer the question everyone is asking which pretty much answers it for us however do you actually love her if you cannot tell a bunch of strangers then you need to let this woman go regardless of what kind of relationship you have with your friend you have made it clear she is not a priority but he is marrying someone to please your parents is pathetic and cruel yta
yta besides the story you spend three paragraphs of your platonic best friend family and barely one about this lovely lady you supposedly want to marry and carry on with hmmmmm
yta
you ve got your self a nice little platonic family where does your fianc fit into this life does she really want to be a mother figure to these boys or does she want to be with you and your always with them if that s the case yta she s trying to fit into your life and your trying to exclude her she s not your side piece
yta these are your kids why wouldn t you let your fiance get to know them and be part of your life does she know she s just an accessory to keep your parents happy and you have no plans to integrate her into your day to day life if you want to play platonic life partners with your friend do so and dump your fiance don t tell some woman that you are building a family with her by getting engaged then shut her out of half your life do the kids hate her or do you just gate keep so she never gets a chance to know them
i kinda think of kids of any big commitment or interest obviously it s a big commitment and much more important then any other interest but in view it s parallel to having a collection obviously not the same but there similarities you made a commitment to something or someone you care for you spend time on it and so on my point is it s very obvious those kids are your interest they are a big part of your life your fiance aren t trying to force herself into some random kids lifes she s trying to take interest in your interest she does have connection to them they are a big part of her fianc life sure she need to understand what her role is more appropriate for her with input from the actual father but it s not unreasonable of her at all yta
yta for having a family unit that you don t allow your fiance to be part of you need to seriously consider why you haven t had other relationships if you are in love with your platonic friend and what you are going to do with yourself when these kids are grown and gone i have never seen a situation like this where two straight men spend years together raising children and not dating women it seems very off
yta oh look another troll story where a man patently in love with his best friend ruins the life of a woman and treats her like shit whoever is running this particular story factory has some serious serious issues that they need to work out
do you seriously want to marry her or are you just trying to get mom off your back
yta it truly takes a village as long as my fiance isn t part of it you re basically an uncle and you don t want her to be a part of your family my fiance basically raised his nephew and since i came into the picture his nephew absolutely loves me and my fiance teases that he thinks he love me more than him and my fiance couldn t be more happy that his nephew has me in his life
yta will never understand men who don t want their girlfriend to be part of their lives and family
yta i dont think she s trying to force her way in but you have a whole other life that you don t want her to be a part of you basically have a second family and want her to stay out of course she wants to be included it s great that you are basically coparenting your friend s kids if it works for you but is she going to sit home alone every night because you re with them please don t marry this woman to make your parents happy because it seems like your heart isn t in the relationship you can only hurt everyone this way
info do you like ur fianc yta as someone who doesn t have a mother i have a few women in my life i see as mother figures and they are very special to me i love having people who care about me enough to help me out you are a father figure to these children so i could see how your fiance could someday be like a mother figure also she said she could be like a mother figure she didn t say she was a mother figure
yta you re engaged she wants to be part of your life and you should let that being said i found it weird that she wants to be a mother figure to the kids i could understand wanting to be an aunt figure but the mother comment felt creepy
yta if you know your priority is your friend and his kids just stick with it when you start dating somsone its cuz you either want to bring them into the family dymanic or have the lives fully seperated it s not fair to look for a partner then chastise her for trying to fit in with people you care about most if you don t want anyone else involved with the kids don t bring people into it it just sends mixed messages to everyone involved plus if you get a partner then focus a huge chunk of your time with the kids and your friend it s definitly going to effect your romantic relationship and shape how people view your priorities
the kids are clearly incredibly important to you so let s think about it this way what are you teaching the children you helped to raise that it s okay to pretend to love someone that people exist as props for our lives so we can pretend to be something we re not that love is a finite resource and needs to be guarded i mean the poor woman is doing her best to be involved in what s important to you but you won t include her your babies are nearly grown up and in three or four years they ll have left home to live their own lives edited to add yta your parents are important but lying to them and destroying someone else s life to do it is just cruel
yta it isn t fair to this woman to marry her just to please your parents while you intend to have a separate and time consuming life with someone else where you don t want her involved
info why would you ever snap at a fiance
info is there an actual example of her overstepping as it stands you provided nothing of substance beyond a story that seems to show that you and your friend need to have a long and in depth discussion about your relationship
info op i am being completely open and honest here why wouldn t you want someone who shares their life with you interacting with something that s basically your family does she not treat them right or do you not feel the same way about her you feel about this best friend
yta bruh don t ruin this woman s life to appease your parents stay with love of your life and your children
yta op you are a coward afraid to live the life you want but that doesn t make you an asshole just sad and pitiable what makes you an asshole is your willingness to ruin another person s life because of your cowardice your fiance obviously doesn t know what she s getting into because she s pushing for the relationship with the kids if you had already explained to her that you don t want her to be a part of your existing family unit then i can t see a reason for her to push

one of my major annoyances with social media is so many staged videos and conten i agree should i just keep my mouth shut and pretend to laugh i pick my battles but i don t pretend to laugh but that s up to you the two longest minutes in the world are waiting on your left over pizzas to reheat watching a lame video while someone says hang on it s about to be funny
well it s a lot like this sub here r amitheasshole of what you see posted is transparently obvious fake stories posted for entertainment purposes you can go into every post and say this is fake which everyone already knows or you can treat the post like a what would you do if question basically you can just enjoy a funny video at face value or you can dissect it and suck all the fun out of it also this incident obviously never happened and your post is fake yta
it s fine for funny content but where it does matter is for political or scientific content in your own words you should have no issue with a silly video that s staged yta sometimes people just want to laugh
yta you already had an argument about this exact thing why are you about to do it again your boyfriend likes to laugh at funny videos regardless if they re real or not you re valuing being right over being kind let it go
i think this is a pretty low stakes issue but ywbta if you continued to tell him all these videos are fake i know that nerf paint video you re talking about and i also have my suspicions that it s fake and i also hate these staged prank videos just to get views but there is no harm in your bf getting some enjoyment out of them life is already a shit show we don t need to deprive him of the little pieces of joy just chuckle and move on as best you can lol
esh things can still be funny even if they aren t real you should let him have his fun refusing to accept reality is tedious to deal with he should accept that they aren t real and enjoy them anyway honestly i think you re being petty but i d really struggle with this too i d massively get the ick if i were in a relationship with someone who believed stupid things refused to accept they were wrong and got upset at being told so i don t find stupidity attractive i find actively choosing to remain stupid even less attractive having said that i d just not date someone stupid rather than try to fix their ignorance or cause them upset you re just incompatible so esh
nah just tell him it s fine if he likes that stuff but you don t really enjoy it because you re sick of all the fake crap out there i looked up the nerf video you re talking about and all the top comments on the reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpected/comments/12ao422/this_is_too_funny/) are complaining about how fake it is funny reading those and then looking at all the people over here calling you an asshole dichotomy of reddit i guess but while i m at it that video just isn t fucking funny it s an obvious fake but if it was real what are we supposed to be laughing at some kid being a dick i ve noticed a lot of these staged videos are low key mean spirited probably because they re made by people with basic ass senses of humor
nta people seem to be missing the fact that op isn t going out their way to rain on bf s parade bf is sending op these videos op you can tell your bf you don t find the videos entertaining if he continues to send them you ll be every bit justified in voicing your disinterest
going against the grain nta i was in a relationship with a guy who would say things that were objectively wrong tell me i was wrong for saying they were wrong and then be furious with me when i found proof that i was correct not sure why the internet wants you to cater to the mistaken beliefs of a year old man who tells you that you re wrong and gets mad when you defend yourself if it were a religious beliefs or something i would agree y t a but he s getting joy from other people s humiliation i don t know why you d be the villain for pointing out that these things are staged and if they weren t a lot of these pranks would be pretty malicious and the consequences really shitty for the pranked person anyway if this is one quirk of his fine but if he has a pattern of always needing to be right and not wanting you to have an opinion contrary to his own that may be worth taking note of i wish i had earlier in my relationship
i feel crazy reading these y t a comments how is you pointing out the video is fake taking the joy out of it like both these videos are about humiliation and pain and it s not funny unless it s real i d be more concerned that you pointing out that actually no those people weren t actually humiliated ruins the videos for him nta
nah it seems like the bigger issue might be that you re secretly embarrassed that your boyfriend is falling for these videos i get it one time getting confused isn t so bad but it shows a lack of awareness on your boyfriend s part if he can t tell the difference between real and fake and your boyfriend is maybe rightfully defensive about his intelligence after you called him out especially if he already revealed his hand with other friends this seems like a small issue in the bigger picture of a relationship but i don t think you re wrong for trying to steer your boyfriend in the right direction
nta to all these comments saying yta when is it appropriate to tell someone a funny video is staged never tbh i think there s people who can see through the illusions that staged funny videos portray and people who can t it s a skill issue it s a really annoying facet of social media these videos are obviously staged because people can t sit and think for more than seconds anymore btw i know what video you re referencing with the white paint and navy blue couch staged
nobody wants to be a buzzkill but so many people fall for misinformation that i think it s worth talking about there s no harm in not wondering if that fail video is real but he should definitely have some interest in fact checking other things he finds online it s so easy to fake videos and photos or show things out of context we should all be in the habit of questioning sources and thinking about the context of what we see and the potential agenda of the person sharing it nta
nah i don t think that either of you are assholes i don t like those videos either i fake laughs and all but you can only fake a laugh so many times it literally comes down to whether or not you like slapstick humor i personally would go nuts if someone kept showing me those and i had to keep faking laughs ik everyone in the comments is acting holier than thou but it gets exhausting like come on that s mind numbing don t act like it isn t people even if you insist on faking laughs eventually someone is going to get annoyed at the fakeness and then what awkward there are types of people those who show things to others that they think the other person would find funny and those that show things that only they find funny if someone is the latter and insists on hurting their own feelings by showing people videos that they wouldn t find funny i wouldn t know what to tell them seems a lot of ppl in the comments are a part of that group
yta if he doesn t care if they re real or fake he s just getting a laugh out of it nta if he believes these are real videos and makes real commentary on what he believes to be real this is comparable to the people when watching a movie go that s not possible the reality police can really ruin the enjoyment of a fun movie
i m gonna go against the crowd here and says nta i m a french librarian teacher part of my job is to teach students about internet awareness we live in an era of fake news and some people still think it s okay not to be aware of what is fake and what isn t that s frightening covid spread that much because of fake news oh but hose are funny videos those aren t as important really the first video was an ad that made bf laugh remember that ads are made to sell something teaching someone to understand that those emotions are given on purpose to make you spend money is important else bf is gonna be an easy target for any publicity that isn t fully disclosed as such like product placement the second video showed a boy using a nerf gun to shoot at a painting mother right see all those pranks that are flourishing because people think it s funny to annoy people well don t look for the reason any further of course when they re staged peeveryone laughs in the end when they re not you end up with upset and angry people or worse so yes it s important to teach about true and fake even in funny videos and to the people who say you need to choose between being right and being happy you re part of the problem people wo can t accept they can be wrong are the one who should reconsider not the one teaching them
why don t you just tell him you don t think it s funny and he can stop sending them to you it s just a difference in opinion
nah i also feel really cringe when i get the impression someone wants me to commiserate over something they themselves don t understand i usually just ignore it and move on but can see how with a partner or someone you need to engage authentically with this presents a dilemma i think the advise to just let the bf know this category if media just isn t your cup of tea is better than fact checking each one you might also find that there is an underlying value that maybe you want to be with someone with critical thinking skills who values real things over staged masquerading as real i know i couldn t be close to someone that constantly falls for scams and misinformation if you learn they don t care if it s staged or not maybe just indicate you care about your partner by communicating and trying to find some humor in whatever it is they share
nta if he wants to enjoy stupid shit he can but if he s going to send you fake stuff he doesn t get to complain that you point out it s fake
nta those videos are unfunny and annoying he can enjoy them if he wants but why would he keep sending that stuff to a person who doesn t share that feeling
it may be better now but youtube shorts used to be full of nothing but fake scripted videos what would annoy me more about your boyfriend is how does he not know they re fake i saw the paint nerf one and it s very obviously fake sometimes its fun sharing things with your partner you find funny sometimes you should fake laugh just to humour them but not with this it ain t that deep just tell him to stop sharing them with you nta
nta but i m biased by being in agreeance with your pov on it i d even go as far as to say it s not fine for funny content when the presentation of the content is that it is real to generate engagement as in the nerf gun painting mom example this is also a pretty big compatibility issue in my admittedly anecdotal experience someone sending you a bunch of stupid shit who genuinely believes it s real and acts incredulous or like you re not fun when you explain no that s clearly a setup why would there be a camera recording xyz thing in the first place and they literally land on a crash pad you can see the corner of it at or whatever gets pretty tiring after a while but even if you decide to bite your tongue to make them feel better over time it makes you start questioning their intelligence and sense of humor because of their lack of media literacy
interesting that this is so divided staged videos can still be funny even if you know they re staged i personally would point it out especially if it s corny af and not know how to pretend to laugh if my partner did this nta
nah i get that it s funny content and that some people think it s harmless if he believes it s real and i also understand that op understands that it s funny but would rather that their boyfriend be laughing knowing that it s not real the problem here is that if a person is viewing content always believing or always wanting to believe it s real they will often fall for more seriously deceptive content that could potentially actually cause harm the whole i trust that site poster so it must be real syndrome or worse the i believe everything i see on the internet syndrome op s approach though was just way too know it all just tell him it was funny because it probably was but that you think it was staged fake and let him look it up in his own time hopefully he doesn t fall for any serious scams in the future
nta i dunno why so many people would choose to be willfully ignorant if something they think is real which is a major part of what makes it funny is actually fake i will agree on the pick your battles comment so watching and not responding is fine and then when he says what you didn t think it was funny why not and then boom bc it s fucking dumb and fake if he gets mad at you for answering his question well then he s even dumber than he sounds he s just going to send fake videos to other people who will think he s an idiot bc they re smart enough to know they re fake
nta humour is a personal taste and people should be free to enjoy what tickles their funny bone however there shouldn t be an expectation that others will enjoy it as well no need to spoil it for the other person unless there is something quite offensive involved then maybe you can enjoy them privately or not
nah i find staged videos funny if they re funny but i can always pick out ones that are staged it doesn t take away from the funny but it does give a separation of i am enjoying fiction vs i am enjoying raw reality i also give people the side eye who can t see obvious staged content for what it is like it s you need to have some level of social media literacy for me to take you seriously as a human being he s not an asshole for being offended that you don t enjoy staged content and you re not an asshole for being shocked he does enjoy staged content without being able ti realize it s staged it s just an incompatibility but no inherent asshole essence necessarily
yta it doesn t matter if it s fake he thinks it s funny why take that away from him
nta i d be angry if my other half believed everything he saw on the internet plus i m never wrong and i like to prove that point sometimes so sue me
just tell him you d rather he not send you funny videos if it bothers you so much
nta my ex husband insisted this was largely before social media that the pictures in playboy etc were not air brushed or altered in any way and they never lied about their weight sure you are with enormous boobs and weight i of course had to seek out every bit of documentation i could find to prove him wrong i should have paid heed to the giant red flags waving everywhere
nta your bf is gonna end up with a tom selleck reverse mortgage and falling for every third scam online when he s older
nta if you were rubbing it in his face as shaming him fair enough but you had your suspicions and it was correct and i know the videos your on about they are fake there s no way that bullet could have caused that mum to fall
nta i disagree with everyone saying it s harmless i think that information literacy is too damn low already and the more we just let this sort of thing fly the more susceptible people are to believing fake bullshit having a well tuned bullshit meter is a crucial life skill and we have to work together to call out bullshit when we see it all that said obviously don t be an asshole about it it s possible to take this philosophy too far be respectful and don t act like you know everything either
nta fake videos are stupid and it s okay to tell this to people
please don t pretend to laugh if you don t find it funny there s nothing worse than laughing at something just because you re too worried you ll offend someone because you don t share their sense of humor and then having to spend the rest of your time with that person always pretending to be entertained by the same stuff if you don t find it funny just say you don t find it funny let him send the videos to his friends who are as equally unobservant as he is lol i find this content equally annoying reminds me of reality tv and youtube prank videos and the biggest offenders of them all lol facebook videos the bar is underground nowadays when it comes to entertainment
nta those types of videos are so amazingly stupid i honestly m couldnt date someone who found them amusing let alone got offended by the idea that they may be fake which should be blatantly obvious so he really doesnt sound very bright in general
i might be going against the grain here but honestly i d say nta maybe n h a you shouldn t have to fake laughter at something you don t think is funny you could choose to say to him in a nice way that you don t find these prank fake seeming type of videos funny and can only see how fake they seem and wont pretend they are real if they aren t and so if he wants to share his joy of these videos then he should keep sending them to his friends that do find them funny if he keeps showing them sending them to you after that then he should know what type of response he ll probably get
nta but it seems like you re intellectually incompatible with your boyfriend
your bf sounds like i did as a child when my parents told me wrestling was fake and staged i think he should as an adult know that this shit is fake but he can still find it funny i personally find this type of video annoying more than anything else when it is obviously fake but is it really any different from enjoying a film or a novel and wanting to share it with you probably not maybe just agree to disagree and ask that he doesn t send you funny videos anymore i don t think either of you are particularly ahish so it s a nah from me
some people come to aita believing everything they read here to be fake and a lot of it probably is but who cares it s more fun to let yourself believe it s all real practice some suspension of disbelief it makes life a lot more enjoyable yta
nta you told him the truth and you did it once i don t think it s necessary to keep telling him but don t fake laughing because dishonesty is almost always going to come back to bite you what you did wasn t enough to be ta but just be nice about it to him
nta it s important to educate people about what s fake and real
nta sounds like your boyfriend needs to grow up and think about the shit he watches for once
info would you think these videos were funny even if they were real they sound incredibly tedious to me
i would say esh you shouldn t be doing stuff he specifically asked you not to do but he shouldn t be so resistant to being corrected when i was a kid i used to tell funny stories and interesting facts without verifying them until i met my best friend who got offended whenever i carelessly told him something false from his point of view i didn t respect him enough to bother to make sure i was telling him the truth and imo he was right i ve been much more careful since and if i do slip up and spread misinformation then i make sure to apologize
nah just for the reason that i think you two have different senses of humor i know my sense of humor is a little bit more non sequitur than my husband so i will only send him videos memes of things i specifically think he will find funny and enjoy it sounds like the videos he sends you bother annoy you he should probably recognize that and not send them to you
hey i can laugh at fake videos as much as the next guy but i still will be curious if it is or isn t if a video like the first one you mentioned is obviously fake i know things like adverts are often extremely obvious then yeah i ll point it out personally i wouldn t care and do wonder why bf cares so much the phrasing i really hope it isn t is quite telling like he actually is sad a video he found funny is fake so what does he actually have an issue with the fact it s fake or you ruined his blissful ignorance because now he wants to willingly go back to that blissful ignorance i can see why people are saying ywbta if you keep doing it but at the same time bf is kinda pathetic imo
nta if he sends you fakes such as the paint one where she falls onto the couch with such straight legs that its so obvious you have the right to give your opinion if he takes a tantrum over it he needs to stop sending them to you
your boyfriend is a rube you could easily profit from it does he still believe wrestling is real but honestly people generally need to be on the same wavelength in a relationship like yeah i wouldn t spoil that if a colleague sent me videos at work i d just shrug and move on but if it was someone i was actively involved with then it d be different people here seem to be on his side but i ve gotta be honest your bf does sound like your typical redditor so that s no big surprise being able to think critically and express yourself openly in a relationship is important
nah but i would maybe pick your battles and only say it if you re watching it together live looking for proof talking about it hours after he sent it to you etc i could see as it becoming a bigger issue than it needs to be
nta
nah as long as it s harmless videos and not those god awful pranks or anything misogynistic let him have his fun however stay vigilant if he starts falling down q rabbit holes andrew gate podcast bros etc
nta if its fake then its fake who cares why should you be forced to pretend its not
nta maybe i m being a bra burner but it sounds like your boyfriend was affronted by you pointing out that he may have been fooled by a scripted piece of content attacks his sense of his own judgement and objectivity maybe if he explained i know it s fake but i still think it s funny and you did it again you d be ta but if his issue was that you felt the need to prove him wrong it sounds like he just didn t appreciate being proven wrong by a woman
nta fake or real media online aside your boyfriend shouldn t get mad at you for what you don t find funny if he s the one sending these videos if it s such a problem for him then he should just stop sending you videos
nta you re under absolutely no obligation to uphold other people s delusions
nta but i don t think you two have compatible tastes in humor and its going to breed resentment between you two i d personally be bothered by his statement about the lotion video too he wants someone to be humiliated and ridiculed across the internet he wants people to be in meetings like that and be traumatized i saw the first part of that video and it just made me uncomfortable and i turned it off the boy with the nerf gone also just pissed me off yeah its fake but i can imagine a kid thinking wow that s funny and some one is going to fall off a ladder and literally break their neck
nta so what if you point out it s fake if he thinks it s funny because it s unscripted true well burst his bubble if it s a comedy sketch it ought to be funny knowing it s a sketch
nta i have a friend that sends me content i ve said said multiple times is not my thing so now i just reply with a video of content i do like or random song
nta i mean every video on tiktok is as real as pro wrestling does he think wrestling is real too
nta you just have another kind of videos you like and that s okay he don t have to share those videos to you and even when you made clear you don t like them he send another one you can tell him you don t like those and move on and when he sends another one even though you told him you can ruin the sh t out of it
i get it i know you getting a few ytas here but the way i feel is that a couple should be able to communicate if the veracity of a video changes your opinion on whether you find something funny and if every time he shares a video with you to see if you find it funny you have to bite your tongue and not reveal whether you actually found it funny then what is the point of those interactions why do you have to be the one to lie about your feelings on something you re being directed to watch it s not about being contrarian which is how i feel some people take this sometimes videos are just so obviously fake to some people that to feel forced to pretend otherwise is stifling i m going with a soft nah
nta i also hate getting sent staged or fake videos they aren t funny i also think it s good for you to point that stuff out because it could help your boyfriend gain some misinformation literacy and be able to sus out fake stuff online better i ve done the same thing to my mom and while she was momentarily bummed out she got over it and got better at noticing when things are fake
nta this guy needs a wake up if he thinks half the crap he s sharing to you is real and a big lol to the y t a voters who thinks this bro s fragile feelings about being told he s wrong need to be protected
i m gonna say nta people need to realise how much is real fake propaganda or otherwise why does knowing it s a skit make it no longer funny
nta
nta he knows you re not amused by this fake shit so why does he keep sending it to you dear god we need more people calling all the fake and fabricated crap on the internet
nta i think it s hilarious that your bf can t tell that they are staged videos
nta it s not your fault he lives in fairytale land and isn t smart enough to notice the difference
nta what is she supposed to do act like a targeted porn site ad is hilarious and totally unscripted especially a lazy one that ripped its plotline off from real events no one is obligated to ensure that another adult has the inalienable right to remain ignorant
nta i have a partner that shares this sort of crap with me it s annoying and he ll share it even when i explicitly tell him i m not interested if he sends you this rubbish you are fully entitled to rip into it either he learns not to share it with you or he is shown it s a load of horseshit either way it s win win even if you aren t annoyed by him ramming it down your throat being annoyed by it being fake is also understandable showing to him that his videos are fake is a public duty these people saying yta would be the same folk who would in other contexts decry fake news and misinformation
nta it s fake i don t generally find it funny when fake content is being passed off as real it could be funny in a way or make me say something like oh wow can you imagine but it s not funny to me when people are so easily fooled
the nerf one is definitely fake acting is awful next he will be getting upset because santa isn t real not your fault he got upset at you pointing that out
nta there is a bigger issue at stake here if he can t tell if a comedy sketch is real or not how is he going to be able to tell if a news article is real or not disinformation is a very serious problem and funny videos are cool and all but a grown up should be able to tell its fake just because it s fake doesn t mean it can t also be funny the nerf gun and mom painting video was very clearly fake
nta there s nothing wrong with not finding something funny and being able to recognise staged bs you don t have to pretend to like it and it would be super disingenuous to do so the two of you have a different sense of humour there and that s fine he just needs to learn not to bring that stuff to you because it s not up your alley
nta i don t know why he s so upset by you telling him the videos are fake it s not like you re trying to hurt his feelings he needs to stop being so quick to believe all these videos are real
nta those videos are fucking dumb
ima go against the grain and say a soft nta i think you may not be two compatible people i m going to do a lot of over generalizing here so all you with your pitchforks calm down i get this are generalizations and aren t always true or false in my time i have noticed the people who repost these obviously faked videos laughing about how outrageous they are lack some intelligence they can still be funny but to lol rotflmao whoah dude is a bit much i have also noticed people i ve known to do that will also repost obviously fake shit about serious issues as you mentioned scientific political etc and claim them as proof etc and not understand that it s sadly dangerous to post crap like that because it gets other idiots on the bandwagon you re nta for feeling like you do but if you feel this strongly my over generalized opinion is you re not compatible and this side of him will show itself in many different ways along the road
i don t think this person is an ah i too don t find fake things funny no i won t point it out to the person showing me all i ll say is i ve seen that before because i don t laugh even if i haven t seen it before they re not an ah they are fed up with trivial bs
unpopular take but i m going to say nah some people don t care if a funny video is real or fake it made them laugh and that s all they care about some do care if it s real or fake because the fakeness ruins the joke for them neither are wrong they re just different it sounds like your bf wants to share videos he finds funny that you simply don t tomato tomahtoe
nah my mother s favourite funny video is of helium beer https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2876948118994895](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2876948118994895) it s hysterical except that s helium in your belly would not change your voice send link to your boyfriend and just stop ruining his groove tho if it really drives you crazy tell him not to send them to you anymore
you see tom cruise isn t actually ethan hunt he s an actor see how fucking annoying that is
yta my dad does this shit just enjoy the content and move on who cares if it s fake or photoshopped
i m going against the grain because i hate those scripted videos as well and would be annoyed at having to act like i believe the script also that video you mentioned is definitely scripted she didn t even have paint on the brush while painting
nta if your bf doesn t want to know it s fake don t show it you
the same people who think these videos are real and don t want to know it s fake are probably the same people who think the earth is flat and trans people are groomers people need to know that what they see on the internet is often bs nta
am i the asshole for telling him it s fake and ruining it should i just keep my mouth shut and pretend to laugh nta just unusual you have a talent for spotting stagecraft and get a thrill out of solving the mystery oh well
well what a delightful person you are s yta why is it so hard to let your bf be happy
honestly who cares if they re real or not i think you have to ask yourself why you feel the need to be right and prove him wrong it doesn t sound like he thinks they re real he just thinks they re funny so what if you have different senses of humour calm down i m not going to rate you this sounds like a non issue masking a deeper issue
not an asshole situation your boyfriend is stupid set him and yourself free if this is a problem for you otherwise reconcile yourself to the idea that you re going to be biting your tongue an awful lot in the coming years honestly it could be well worth it if he s a really good guy there are plenty of very intelligent assholes out there good luck either way
yta sure it might not be real but he still finds it funny no reason to rain on his parade if its not harming anyone just say you don t like them as much as he does different stroke for different folks and all that
yeah i m thinking that ywbta here so what if it s fake along with a bunch of other content on the web it makes him laugh i d rather look at stuff that makes me laugh no matter what it is it s great escapism
door number two some people just do not like it when someone points out the fakery ps if he is a wrestling fan then absolutely do not say its fake it s the stories and the acrobatics that are the real substance of the entertainment not whether some of the stunts would injure someone if they were not partly faked think of the videos the same way they are for entertainment your comments might be taken to imply he isnt smart enough to tell the difference yes you are probably right but you get no points for saying so
ywbta if you keep determining if every silly video he sends you is fake or not and then telling him if he finds them funny just let it go scripted or not it s something that makes him smile which is good
yta they re just videos that make him laugh stop being such a buzzkill fake or not he s just having a good time and trying to share with you something that made him laugh
yta why do you feel the need to tell him that it is fake pretty sure in the back of his mind he already knows that and doesnt need you to shut down his fun i d be asking myself why you have to tell him doesn t matter what other people think is real you need to give your bf credit and know he also knows they are staged are you feeling like you re smarter coz thats how its coming off yes shut it and just tell him it wasn t amusing for you
i mean people who think aita posts are real probably shouldn t grief others for thinking other online stuff is real lol so yta i guess just let it go
yta your just trying to ruin things that don t matter he didn t even say he thought it was real just that he wished it was because its funny stop being a joy kill

info what communication was there with your wife about this did you tell her how you couldnt be there
i think everyone here has valid arguments and it was just a bad situation fortunately it was a routine surgery and she came out ok congrats on the new job and all i think the best thing here is to not try and decide who was right emphasize that it was a rough situation and you thought you were making a right call come to terms with future situations above all else please leave your family out of it lol
nah maybe not the choice i d have made but you were in a tough spot with the new job also you didn t abandon your wife you made her go to the hospital when she was refusing to seek that kind of medical attention if anything you potentially saved her you also knew she has adequate support around her she wasn t alone
nah as long as her parents were there and you were there before and after it is not a big deal to me i mean you just started the job and would like to keep it you couldn t do anything for your wife and she wasn t alone so i think it is fine
leaning towards nah i see what you re thinking but appendix surgery isn t as routine as you think this is something you should have discussed with your wife first and made sure it was okay you weren t with her
nta you actually made her to get medical help before things get awful so you got away with routine appendectomy instead of massive peritonitis so you brought her to urgent care and then to er and was with her until you had to go to your shift leaving her with caring family it s hard to say if you d lose your job or would get bad appearance with this short notice but you definitely thought about your nuclear family with her when tried hard to keep it you would definitely come back to the hospital asap if anything goes wrong i don t see from original post if she asked you to stay with her
nta cook something nice bring her flowers i would ve said yta if both of sets up parents weren t there
nah you have a good job and you are either forced to ruin your pto and spend time with your wife in a surgery everyone has came to see her for or keep doing well in your job it s a very unfortunate situation and your wife has a right to be disappointed or angry but no one is in the wrong
i think you re not ta for going to work seeing as you re new it was a routine procedure and she had care what could make you ta is how you handled it ie whether you were understanding when you said it if you were just blankly going end of etc i don t think she s the ah for being upset either it s how she behaves after which also isn t said so going only by what s written there s no ah however maybe with more details it could swing one way or the other
nta in this work economy to have a good job is important there would be nothing you can do anyways in surgery and if something was to go wrong i would imagine you would drop everything and get to the hospital sounds like she survived plus she had her mom and dad there so she was not alone this isn t the birth of your child this is her getting an appendix removed you won t be able to watch it you won t be able to do anything so there would be no point of you being there even if you think your employer would have been fine with it you never know if they would be and use that as a reason to let you go because you aren t past your probation period just don t do that at the birth of your child you make sure that you are there because that is a one time thing that you actually get to participate in and be there for
under the circumstances of starting a new your you are not the nta in this case i d not want my husband if i had one to call out from a new job
nta just my opinion with the given information if i was the wife i would have thought it s unreasonable for me to force my so be there in that situation i already had support from family in surgery there is nothing for others to do but to sit and wait for hours i would support my husband and his start in a new workplace but i would of course except him to come see me after he was done working now if it were a dangerous risky surgery would be different but in this situation nah
nta your wife had people there to support her you are new on the job i had emergencys come up but had to work or be fired boss s seem really supportive until you try to call in she was scared but should understand especially with people there supporting her
nah it s fine for your wife to be upset and to wish you were there with her for your surgery on the other hand it s absolutely okay for you to be concerned in america that taking off from work so soon after starting a new job without the pto to do it would jeopardize your long term prospects with your new employer these kind of trade offs suck i wish people didn t have to make them i wish americans had stronger worker protections but we all have to make due with the society that we re living in while hopefully advocating to make those conditions better
i m leaning toward nah since she did have support while you were at work you did just start this job and while you had a valid understandable reason to call in you had no way of knowing how receptive your job would have been if you ve only been there a few weeks you are still in the probationary period the only ah here is the american work culture assuming you re in the us
nah it s a difficult situation all round new job stress fear over surgery etc however wife wasn t abandoned both sets of parents were there in event of an emergency they could have called him doesn t make her fears any less valid though op did right thing by taking her to hospital and being there before and after
gonna go against the grain nah yeah you could have stayed it is surgery but you had very valid reasons to need to go to work also as surgeries go appendix surgery is pretty damn routine she can be upset that you went she s not an ah for that but you re not an ah for having your reasons to go especially in this economy a job is pretty damn important
nta i m going to surprise myself and say it even though i d probably be beating myself up in this situation we don t know enough about op s work situation or industry to say just call in especially if he s not out of any probationary periods i lost a job two weeks in because i was injured in an accident and couldn t work a lot of employers just won t care in a perfect world op would know that he could be there with his wife and face no repercussions but that s not the case that the majority of us face maybe he could have told his boss the situation and been allowed to leave but that s not a guarantee even if you re settled into the job i also get how she feels honestly i just feel for you both it sucks you have to be in that situation
yta it was important to her that you be there that s your wife having surgery man you could have taken off work all but the absolute worst workplaces would understand my wife is having an urgent surgery but you prioritized your job over your wife
nta i would have been upset if my husband called out of his brand new well paying job to sit in the hospital for a routine surgery
nta you were with her at urgent care and it sounds like you were with her at the hospital before her surgery but went to work during surgery when there was nothing for you to do but sit in a chair
nah not about taking a day because of money he s likely still in his probationary period jobs dont care they will still look bad at you about it this is the reality if like we re assuming op is american i ve seen someone be let go from a job because she just started and her gallbladder went haywire and almost killed her they fired her keep in mind missing a day can be a small fortune to some folks
nah there s already so many comments so you likely won t see this anyway but an appendectomy is an emergency surgery not a routine surgery when i had mine removed i ended up in the icu for a little while afterward there s no way of knowing going into a surgery whether that person is going to make it out alive so i understand your wife s feelings however i ve also worked some jobs that absolutely do not care what s going on in your personal life and would have no issue firing for going negative on pto ultimately you believed she was going to be fine and had loved ones there to comfort her when she got out of surgery
nta you went to work not out drinking with your buddy there was literally nothing for you to do until your wife was out of surgery there s no difference between sitting in a waiting room going to grab a coffee or being at work if something went sideways the hospital staff was not coming to get you to help solve the problem she had support with her in the hospital they knew how to reach you hopefully you returned after your shift are helping her during recovery
oh this is a hard one as i see both y all s points she was probably scared and just wanted comfort from her partner but you have a good point to regarding the brand new job and pto nah and hopefully she ll get passed it in a little while
nta i would have told my other half to go into work as it s a new job she had enough support from the parents
nah your wife wants you there that s valid you were making sure you were maintaining a job that would allow to cover the hospital bills and her comfort at home also valid
i had to work period and i m too new there to call in i would have either had to take the day unpaid or gone negative on my pto this is what makes it nah for me i m sure everyone here could ve been nicer with their words but you have responsibilities you can t ignore if you get fired that hurts your wife worse than only having other family by her side
nta i m amazed at the yta s here we know there are bad workplaces and bad bosses he could be at one he also is new and it could reflect badly on him to call out so soon not saying it s right at all but it happens they also may be struggling for money lastly she had his parents and hers with her she had a support system
nta it s a fairly common procedure with minimal risks compared to others not to mention she had plenty of family there and coming from a healthcare worker prospective they limit the amount of visitors not to mention after surgery you re on a bunch of meds and sleeping i understand your conflict and the position you re in it s u fortunate but you have to do what was needed for your family
nta with your family and her mother being present she should be a little bit more understanding in this day of age jobs are hard to find and i believe they would have understood you missing work but know that they can judge you as someone who just got employed and on the first day ask for a leave of absence which they ll never say to you face to face so definitely nta
nta because i did this same thing when my husband had the same surgery he was in recovery for a bit afterwards so i couldn t see him anyway then we spoke on the phone when he woke up not that he can remember because of his painkillers he said there s no point in me sitting there while he s sleeping and he s an adult so it is fine on his own his parents visited so he had company but he was totally fine with it i would ve thought about it the same way as you but i guess your wife wanted you there so perhaps you should ve taken her view into consideration
i m going with nta against the trend here if i were her i d rather you were there but if you ve just gotten that job i would get you need to make a good impression if your parents and mine were there i d understand she wasn t abandoned
i ve had surgeries some emergency some not i completely understand being new to a job and not wanting to take time off my husband has been in that situation i m a big girl and other family members were there i was completely fine in fact i was tired after surgery and really didn t care who was there for me it s nta we re adults and being able to pay for the hospital and supporting the family is more important than staying with someone who is under general anaesthesia and groggy afterwards
nta she didn t even want to go for a check up she could have been at home on her own while you were at work and her appendix ruptured you did what you needed to to make sure you were looking out for her when she wouldn t take care of herself i ve had several surgeries since being married i would much rather my husband was at home after to make sure i was able to recover well then when i was otherwise unaware of him being there
i might get downvoted for this but nta you clearly care about your wife and her health you drove her to the hospital even when she didn t want to go if it was not for you she might have had prolonged suffering and possibly complications you also made sure that there were enough people around her who could be trusted to take care of her and to let you know in case you were required urgently if my partner was this caring i would trust them to make the decision on whether or not they needed to go in to work that day at a time when they were not actively required by me to be physically present by my side
nta seriously people what could op have done op s wife was at a hospital under anesthetic and away from op who could be contacted by phone even if op had stayed at the hospital he wouldn t have been much use there he was better off going to his work telling them that he might need to leave even though the situation was mostly under control plus she had three other people at the hospital
i m guessing unpopular opinion but nta i ve had a handful of surgeries and would never require anyone to be at the hospital while i was asleep and unaware to be waiting there for literally no reason it seems entirely pointless other than a weird symbol of loyalty my partner has worked during my surgeries and also while i was hospitalized with pancreatitis life goes on her surgery was not dependent on whether you were there and i m sure you were there later on you know during the important awake times and made her even go to get care i hate the way we focus on empty gestures instead of real care
nah depending on your job that could massively effect your work atmosphere interferes with finances and it makes sense i understand why your wife it upset but you didn t abandon her she wasn t alone she has support it wasn t life threatening and hopefully u can be making it up by taking good care of her now that she s out
this is a tough one bc i get it obviously you would want to be there for your wife in a crazy and difficult time through the corporate america bullshit it makes people extremely paranoid to think of asking usually the first days you are on a provisionary period and small things can be a cause for termination my last job fired a guy bc he was in a car accident shortly after hiring he had a broken limb he could have still did most of the job responsibilities but he would need some accommodations while he healed they thought it was better if they didn t waste their time friend coworker almost missed the birth of his first child bc he had just been hired on he had worked as a contractor at this job prior to being hired full time he had an established relationship with his managers and still needed to be told that he wasn t going to lose his job if he decided to go he still came tried to come in the next day and the manager had to send him back home edit nah for judgement
nah of course she wanted you there but you just started the new job and don t want to ruffle feathers i can appreciate both sides you definitely could ve tried but i can see why you didn t
nta i mean people are ripping you apart here but she wasn t alone her family was there you really don t need the entire clan to have a family reunion at the hospital for a surgery like that
nah if she knew you planned on going in she could have used her words and expressed she wanted you to stay she had plenty of support and you thought you were doing the right thing to protect your financial future her feelings are valid but so are yours
nah i personally would have made a different choice than the op but he didn t really screw the pooch unless his new high paying job is as an er surgeon or anesthesiologist his presence impacts nothing she had several people there at the hospital and if there were complications i m going to assume the op would immediately come to the hospital
because it was a recently new job and the fact that she had both her parents and his there with her who could ve informed him of any emergencies so he could rush over i m going to go with nta i have had this happen to me and unless it was really important for her to have him there for her own emotional support perhaps she could have expressed that to him and come up with a solution together like go in to work and tell your boss that your wife is having surgery i think it would have made a difference coming in as opposed to calling out
nta i had mine out when i was i told my parents to go home unless you re a doctor you don t need to be there for a simple operation you didn t leave her alone she had support how would it make everything better if you lost your job go to work whilst she s in surgery that way if she s in a bad way after it you are more likely to be able to stay with her
nta my son had lots of medical issues and surgeries there were many times my husband had to go to work while i stayed with him this includes exploratory surgeries where we didn t know the outcome you have to keep your job to support your family emotionally she may have needed you but sometimes we just have to be strong and pray
that s not a routine surgery but nta
idk how is it in us but in my country you aren t allowed to go to the hospital unless it s your child being operated on you can only go during visiting hours i m not sure what would you even do there just sit outside and wait nta
probably an extremely unpopular opinion but nta you re providing for your family in all reality there wasn t much to be done outside of emotional support and she had plenty you did your job as a man nta
nta when i had my appendix out my husband was told calling in would result in him losing his job she had three people there and i ll bet she d be more angry if you no longer had a way to pay the bills
nta she should be thanking her lucky stars op made her go to urgent care er she was too stubborn to go in the first place op basically saved her from so much more damage if she didn t go to the hospital
nta it s not open heart surgery and i m sure he could have left in an emergency
nta save that time with a new job to be with her at home after the surgery she wasn t alone she had her mom and your parents that is plenty of support
eh i m gonna go soft nta i personally would have told my husband to get his but to work she wasn t alone and a new high paying job is not something i would risk so he could hold my hand however your wife clearly feels differently and her feelings are valid you need to find a way to make it up to her and make sure she knows how much you value her
nta there were three other people there and you had to work
in the uk now mostly they won t let anyone at the hospital anyway so last time my partner had surgery i had to be at home so i wfh that day and waited for the call to say i could go see them all this who was or was not in the waiting room is a bit pre covid now here sorry to say so in my opinion nta if there was an emergency the hospital would have called
i m going to ruffle some feathers here but your wife had a whole community of support around her one person shouldn t make or break that and if she s in the hospital who s paying the bills not her she s understandably down for a while you not if you call off hell many places nowadays don t even need a reason to fire you they can do it because a supervisor has a bad mood on a particular morning you gave the rest of her support tribe a chance to be there for her while you did the fiscally responsible thing in providing a roof over her recovering head nta
nah you made sure she did have support and i m hoping your job would have allowed you to keep your phone on at all times in case an emergency did arise but she is entitled being upset that you were not there during a very scary situation
nta you got her to the doctor she was sent to the hospital and had people with her some people do not get that some companies can and will fire you during the probationary period for anything including an absence especially since you ve only been there a couple of weeks i understand she was nervous but she needs to understand you just started this job well paying jobs can be hard to find these days depending on where you live i m sure you wanted to be there too and everyone here is acting like you are some heartless monster for wanting to keep a brand new job and paycheck it s a risk you weren t willing to take and i don t blame you
nta your status at work is for the benefit of your wife as well and you left her with three trusted people not alone
nta you re new to the job and want to get a good start it was a routine procedure and she had support
going against the grain and saying nta i just had surgery a few weeks ago and my husband wasn t anywhere near it my mom brought me he was at home taking care of our kids and getting ready for me coming home sometimes life happens and it s not worth risking a new well paying job for a routine procedure where she has people there supporting her
yta people can die during appendix surgery there can be so many complications how would you have felt if she died and you were at work
nta you re at a new job you shouldn t call in sick she was hardly alone
nta you didn t leave your wife alone she had people there to support her considering how easily you can be let go when still on probation it s perfectly viable to not to want to call in he only started a couple of weeks ago
nah it s just appendicitis and the safest operation in the world with other family there i sent my wife away when i was in hospital with the same thing she was uncomfortable being overly attentive because she was bored my pillow can only be fluffed so many times and i was so high on pain meds i couldn t converse it was miserable for her for no reason
i m amazing at how many ytad you re getting nta here routine surgery and she had plenty of family support you were the one that got her there and advocated she go in the first place
nta
nah i had my appendix out as a kid and i only had one parent with me she had three and even if you re important to her there was no real reason to go other than support she isn t an asshole for wanting you there and you re not an asshole for not being able as long as you went asap after
nta you took her there and possibly saved her life you probably should be there in case of complications but she did have support from other members of the family that were able to be there so it s not like she was left alone not to mention depending on where you re from someone may have to foot the bill
nta she had support it would be different if no one was there
nta
nah it s not like you could ve been in the or holding her hand and it wasn t childbirth or anything major appendectomy is as routine as they come i wouldn t be mad at my husband for not staying
nta it s a new job wife was having routine surgery she still had plenty of support in the waiting room no use waiting around with everyone else i m sure if things went sideways you could have left work without an issue you did nothing wrong
nta in guessing you are in the us and the only ah is the american worker protections
nta you need the job money and insurance she had family there with her and you couldn t do anything but sit and wait as long as you were there when you weren t at work you didn t do anything wrong
honestly i don t think you re ta here i don t think she s ta either necessarily i think it s unreasonable of her to have wanted you there considering the circumstances and that she had people there to support her i mean i went through a surgery during covid alone and had no visitors so yeah that sucked a little but i m also pretty much a grown up so it was fine i guess i feel like she should have been understanding of the new job situation but i don t think she s an asshole for it i guess she just had a different need than i might have
i m in the us and unfortunately as much as i d want to have my husband there with me i would rather have him not miss work regardless of other people s opinions i ll be the odd one out and say nta with as much turmoil and crap as we re dealing with in the us going to your job is probably the safest thing to do
i was in the er then icu a few years back for my diabetes my husband drove me to the er at like in the morning then when they switched me to icu and my dad got there he went to work i was fine i still had my dad there he was also new in his work yes surgery is different from dka but i could have died had we not got there when we did as it is i don t remember much because i was on the edge of consciousness so i feel i have a pretty good perspective when i say nah yes i m sure she was scared because surgery is scary but you stayed as long as you could you re the one who got her to the doctor and she had a good support system when you left you knew she was in good hands one night of being in the hospital does not mean you should lose your job or pay for it
i think this all depends on the couple if i had my mom there and my husband needed to work to pay our bills i would be fine with that it s not like i m alone also i would prefer for my mom to be there over my husband because she s a doctor
nta you being there would have zero impact on the surgery i understand not wanting to take time off to soon after starting a job she will be home after 48hrs and can help her recover
nah i was in this situation planned day surgery though and due to the nature of husband s job i knew he had to go in to answer that urgent page so i gave him my blessing and sent him out the door i was the talk of the company for a week with a personal thanks from the president it takes a really strong and understanding relationship to make life work some folks work it differently though so that s why the no assholes here judgment
nta i can appreciate your wife s pov but life is expensive what if there are bills from this unexpected surgery i agree working made the most sense she had a support system if it is a higher risk surgery or more serious i would say ta maybe it s because i work in the medical field but i don t see this as a huge deal
nta considering the surgery was for the removal of an appendix and you had family in the hospital and the situation with your new job at a time of recession where every pay check counts if it was any other surgery that needed transfusions things could go wrong and you would be needed to give consent but not this one i don t think you actually thought about that part at all and for that i feel you should apologize
nta i just had a similar surgery i was perfectly fine with a friend there and a friend to pick me up i knew i was going into a long recovery and i would need as much help as possible i wouldn t want my partner or friend to mess up their new job to have extra worried person around me friends and family can t even get into the surgery ward they need to wait outside your gf is being ridiculous entitled and is acting like a child as if she won t need financial support for the recovery she had whole people there for an appendix lol
nta people will rip you a new one here but your wife wasn t alone and looks like surgery went fine i understand that you didn t want to call in
nta she had the best care in the hospital and you had no pto to use until very recently in my country you couldn t have anyone even visit you or go into the emergency room with you due to covid
nta you couldn t help her during the op and after the op there were people to treat her i by myself went through two surgeries during covid and noone was allowed in hospital and i would be completely pissed if my husband not mentally prepared to handle me being hurt etc sitting next to my bed the whole time while i try to get my thoughts together after anaesthesia i got both my parents at my bed after a teeth surgery when i was and i don t want anybody around in this time i guess you visited her after work and slept at home or were you required to stay in hospital for days
so i m going to be in the minority here nta not because i would have done the same but rather because when i had mine taken out i had a great time honestly still think it was funny as shit
nta she had family there with her so you didn t leave her alone i understand her wanting you there but your new job is presumably important for both of you especially if she s gonna be out of work while she recovers
nta if you re in the probationary period of a new job it can be dicey to take time off and your wife had people around her it sucks but you are not ta here
nta there is nothing you can do whilst someone is in the operating theatre to be honest if your wife is going to theatre from the er all visitors are doing is getting in the way whilst she is prepped for theatre you did the right thing going to work ensuring your job and income are maintained the time to take time off is when she comes home and needs rest and help post surgery as long as the hospital could contact you and have you return in a reasonable time i would have advised you to go to work
eh nta everyone freaking out it s surgery so lol it s a basic surgery if half my family was there and my partner had a new job to go to it would not bother me in the slightest i would have told him to work i ll be fine i really doubt op being there would have really made any difference other than give him anxiety about missing work at a new job
nta she had coverage it s not like you didn t have a cell phone
nta there is precious little you can do while she is being prepped for surgery in surgery and in recovery as next of kin you need to be contactable in case of emergency so as long as had phone on etc i say this as someone who has had five operations including one at and two at and in each case i got dropped off at hospital and then parents partner went to work the days after surgery are when you need to be there for her especially with any heavy lifting that said i do not work when my pets are in operation but that s because my focus is completely blown but i have the luxury of european paid leave i have worked when they were under but try not to since having to go straight into a meeting after telling vet not to wake her up but we knew that was high risk surgery
nta your wife was not going into life or death surgery it s a routine procedure she had loved ones with her she s not a child i really don t get her attitude to be honest i can understand her being disappointed but not angry
did your wife thank you for trusting your gut and taking her to the emergency room when she initially did not want to go if not she seems a bit ungrateful marriage can and do fall apart due to bad finances your job versus her health in your marriage is therefore both big things to consider if you were maximum a 30min drive away from the hospital you are good if anything changed for the worse one of the parentals would have called and you would have gone to the hospital
info you say she had plenty of company and support who was with her were they able to medically advocate for her should the need have arisen

nta you didn t even say anything offensive unlike him you just pointed out the hole in his hypocritical logic jordan is ta for obvious reasons but brandon is also an ah for not allowing you to speak for yourself brandon is clearly enabling jordan s terrible behavior
nta you weren t offensive you just showed him how illogical his own thinking was jordan won t have brandon around to handle him all the time and it s helpful for him to get the kind of calling out you gave it sounds like it might have actually made him think while what brandon said had no effect
nta jordon got a taste of his own medicine by having the logic he articulated applied to his situation he sounds like he s got a lot of maturing to do as for brandon it sounds like he s conditioned himself to apologize for jordan s bad behavior over the years he seriously needs to re evaluate that friendship
nta you had a perfect response people like that do need a taste of their own medicine to realize how ridiculous they sound and how hurtful their comments are i did it to an ex husband walking past a vs in the mall why don t you look like them well cause i m and built like a german pig farmer did he think i was going to change after he married me this wasn t the first time he had said something like that so walking past a f with those glorious half nekkid men posters i go up and stand in front of posters he comes and stands next to me what s up i sigh loudly and then say woof look at the abs on these men hot and then turning to look at him why can t you have abs and look like that i d love to take one of those home blew a kiss at the poster and walked off later at home he was like that hurt my feelings i said now you know how i feel and left the room
nta but these people are sexist you should be silent and listen to harassment so someone else does not feel bad why are you less important than they are the thing is the group is used to enabling this guy you didn t and they re not sure how that works set and keep the boundary that you will not enable his disgusting behavior and if he can t handle it he should be told it s unacceptable i am an autistic adult and know silence is complicit behavior and enabling bad it s not that hard
nta thank you for standing up for women of all sizes
nta chyna awesome kong aja kong madusa luna vachon and a whole host of other non victoria secret model looking female wrestlers haven t spent years putting their bodies on the line just to have their legacies and the ones who came after them disrespected just because their bodies don t get jordan hard
nta he brought it on him self with his stupid remarks dont want to be called out for your shape dont call others out for their shape
nta that was a perfect rebuttal
nta you didn t even insult him you just forced him to logically explain all by himself why all bodies can t look just like whatever arbitrary ideal body someone likes beautifully played
nta but inform brandon that someone in the future might not have been as polite as you were and he s gonna have to be prompt in shutting stuff down
nta op i really hate when others side with the person who deserves karma in my opinion seriously just unfriend those people who sided with him because you shouldn t be around fucking idiots who don t back you up
nta jordan says the wrong stuff and is offensive without meaning to be there are guides on how to behave appropriately available online and on youtube he has no excuse to act like that
i m sorry but unless jordan is a toddler who is just learning what words mean there is no excuse for his behavior being socially awkward or having asd or whatever they ll blame this on is not an excuse to be a misogynist which is what jordan was and what brandon is asking you to ignore nta
nta we learn by receiving stimuli from our environment based on what our actions cause if something is hot and it burns you you learn to not touch it if you say something sexist and you get called out and get the principles of your insults reversed on you you ll know what you said isn t cool maybe jordan will learn better now
nta someone is gonna call him out eventually brandon can t shield the guy forever so he s going to have to change eventually
nta like he deserved it and really you deserve better friends
keep bringing up how offensive this guy jordan s comments are he evidentally doesn t listen to your friend brandon nta
nta he had it coming
nta jordan was being a sexist dick and needed to be called on it brandon needs to stop enabling dickish sexist behavior they are ta i just find hilarious that jordan can talk shit but can t take it
nta why does only jordon get to say shit
nta chef s kiss to that
nta well done
nta he was begging for it
nta smack down delivered i salute you my friend
nta jordan is a big ah and brandon is an ah for saying jordan is offensive without meaning to be he s enabling the offensive behaviour because he doesn t want to have the awkward conversation bleeeeuch
nta like x1
nta perfect response he was been insufferable and sexist and really needed a reality check
nta i ve met many guys like jordan they expect the women they date to be thin and look like supermodels but the guys themselves don t look anything like models or athletes they don t do the work to look like that yet they expect women to look like that and they feel entitled to date them too
is offensive without meaning to be anyone saying that about a friend needs to go in the trash with their friend nta you did the right thing
hahahahahaha nta
nta he can dish it out but can t take it
nta dude deserves a reverse roundhouse kick from my girl asuka
nta actually it s kinda a good sign that your comments shut jordan up it makes me think you made him think about his double standard for the first time which might help him a great deal you weren t personally attacking his looks or him either no one should have to look like victoria secret models henry cavill or chris evans it s a miserable thing to have to upkeep tell branden if he doesn t want people to help him potty train his puppy then he shouldn t bring it with him
a very righteous nta
tehehehehe good very good nta
nta that was brilliant
that jordan guy is one of those people who criticize why x isn t like y but when someone asks them why they dont look like y henry cavill tall cm athletic and instead are jordan cm short normal non athletic they get offended nta and he should watch his words next time
but brandon wasn t handling jordan you did though nta you go person x200b edit to change word i assumed op is female dunno
i have a friend group that all act party and dress as fratty fuckboys and i have time and time again seen them shut that type of problematic talk down succently not with a hey dont say that but in woah no absolutely not you dont bring that type of thinking around here gtfo
jordan says the wrong stuff and is offensive without meaning to be he s not a child he s perfectly capable of understanding his stupid ass remarks he s sexist and was called out on his double standard and boy oh boy that was so nice to read i m smiling from ear to ear from how good that burn felt nta and take my poor woman gold through my upvote eta if brandon wants to be an ally he needs to call out jordan in public if not he s being all talk no action and says that he doesn t agree just to clear his consciousness and think at least it s something
nta jordan had it coming
nta it was needed
nta i get so tired of people like that
nta good for you girl i hope more people do this
lmao lol even nta
lol nta local man insulted as soon as his own logic is applied to him neither sentiment is nice but he had it coming
without thinking about it i go yeah so why don t you look like them chef s kiss nta
nta men and i say this as one have to do a better job on checking our peers on that shit making excuses for him is bullshit he doesn t mean well he isn t just awkward he s just a judgmental misogynistic hypocrite there s no need to dress it up or pretend like he s a good guy or chill outside of that his personality doesn t exist outside of that that s a part of it and that makes him an asshole not just an awesome but misunderstood cool guy fuck that noise jordan says the wrong stuff because he thinks the wrong stuff and believes the wrong stuff he s an asshole and brandon is just as big an asshole for excusing it protecting him from the natural consequences of his behavior and continuing to include him when he s an outright asshole to people fuck that noise show brandon this thread and ask him when you can expect his apology then tell him you re going to keep your distance until he learns to be a better friend
jordan has a problem he is publicly objectifying women in mixed company and does not see anything wrong with it brandon in some ways is a bigger problem he knows what his friend is saying is inappropriate but expects the op to suck it up because jordan is his friend why is it a bigger deal for jordan to hear uncomfortable truth than for the op to be subjected to uninformed misogyny does brandon value jordan s friendship over the op s
nta
nta
nta
nta
nta that s actually a hilarious comeback hope you woke the fool up
nta you were polite with your rebuttal and showed the flaw in his logic
nta if brandon was going to handle it he should have instead of his sad little we should say that no you shouldn t think that because the logic is flawed let jordan know that chris hemsworth has a workout app now and there of henry cavill s workouts are online so he has no excuse not to be as fit as they are he needs to get to it
nta jordan says the wrong stuff and is offensive without meaning to be no he says offensive shit because he is misogynistic and nobody calls him out
hahaha excellent response nta also let me handle jordan ew no i will speak for myself where i deem fit and he can t protect this guy s bs forever
nta a dude spews stupid stuff that shows how shallow and into double standards he is should not be shocked when he gets called on his bs
nta if you live in a glass house be careful throwing stones that s an important lesson everyone needs to learn jordan should be thankful it was a friend in private and not a stranger humiliating him in public
nta saying stuff like jordan was saying he should expect to to have someone put him in his place from what you said you didn t say anything out of line his ignorance as brandon tried to explain it off isn t acceptable
nta if jordan is going to open his mouth he needs to learn that people are going to respond in kind
nta at all what a sexist a h how is commenting on women s bodies not offensive brandon is just enabling this heinous behavior they re both tools
nta the time to handle things was before he started impacting other people with that nonsense if his goal was to control the situation then brandon failed you just picked up the slack brandon is clearly not in charge of jordan and he s definitely not in charge of you he s not handling jordan and you shouldn t allow him to handle you by telling you what you can and can t say either because guess what that didn t work on jordan either or you wouldn t be here asking about it jordan s an ass and brandon has some control issues
nta absolutely not those were sexist remarks and you as you said gave him a taste of his own medicine and i would have done the same don t feel bad and keep reminding him and without meaning to be offensive is not the same as socially awkward as brandon puts it there is a huge difference i have socially awkward introvert friends and they don t talk like that sounds like a lazy excuse to me he needs to think before he speaks
nta good for you for using his own idiotic logic against him
nta jordan is a sexist kudos for feeding him his own words
nta thank you for standing up for women rhea ripley has had this shit so much in her career it s a shame in people are still like this if brandon wants to be the one to handle jordan then he should step up and handle it properly good for you
tell him you re socially awkward and sometimes things you say might come off as offensive
nta to paraphrase tmbg this is where the party ends i can t stand here listening to you and your misogynist friend
nta brandon wasn t handling jordan somebody had to
nta i think you handled that perfectly
you are nta and brandon wasn t handling anything i would limit hanging out with them again
nta brandon is using jordan s awkwardness to excuse him from the responsibility of the andrew tate incel stuff he says do you think that maybe jordan was saying that to insult you and shut up when you clapped back a normal bf would ve told jordan to stuff it jordan isn t allowed to be excused from accountability for his decisions just because he was awkward i suggest sitting you bf down and having a long talk because this will only go on if you don t stop it now there s a chance jordan will say worse things when he realizes you won t comment
en tee fucking eh
nta it sounds like brandon was told all his life to make allowances for jordan jordan sounds like a jerk if you want to keep socializing with brandon i suggest you invite him to your get togethers but don t extend the invitation to jordan you don t have to like all the people your friends like
ummmm how old are you people
sounds like jordan is on the spectrum tbh all of this oh he just doesnt have a filter and can be offensive without realizing it kind of points to that
yta why is everyone ignoring that you made it personal

nta jordan really needs to learn from some life experiences and brandon isn t helping by sheltering him
nta
nta nicely done
nta this is how you learn to be less off putting regret the next day
nta what you said was exactly correct and proportionate
nta
brandon needs to realize that jordan is going to piss people off and they will handle jordan themselves that s part of being social brandon can t protect jordan and jordan needs to be aware of his audience and learn what is socially acceptable at the moment
nta and no he is not saying offensive things without meaning to be offensive you already know that he definitely needed a reality check and you gave it to him bravo
nta the incel is clear in jordan
nta and this guy sounds super thick headed and very much not self aware you fed him his own bs and he couldn t take it
nta people gotta learn they are being assholes you won the battle but lost the war i think jordan peterson and andrew tate just picked up a new subscriber to their podcast first time caller here i was just trying to enjoy wrestling when some feminazi tried to chime in
nta but next time let brandon handle it he s your friend you now know going in what jordan is capable of if you can t coexist in a way that will help your friend just avoid jordan in general
nta you gave him a direct comparison in language that he ought to understand
nta
nta that guy must have felt the burn though
nta you were right he needed a taste of his own medicine
nta
nta bravo

nah except maybe the friend for asking a tone deaf question during a light hearted drinking game
oh man i m sorry but i am laughing right now it took me a while to bond with my child after my wife delivered him at first it just felt like he was kind of a dick who stole my girlfriend and sucked up all the oxygen in the house this is primal shit i meant to love him immediately but it took a minute by the time he was two years old i would have taken on a gang of angry ninjas to protect him it takes time though and it seems like you got caught up in a stupid party game in the middle of this process and also while your wife is probably still pretty hormonal her feelings are valid but probably exaggerated at the moment i don t know what you should do next i locked myself in the downstairs bathroom called my best friend and spilled my unspeakable secrets i d try to talk through it with her if you can when baby is asleep and you have a minute of peace work in some dates with her tho keep your expectations low about romance right now we had to rush home from one of our first dates because in the movie children died in a fire that was it date over try to stay close i hope she s soon understands that you re a family nah edit because i m getting a lot questions about this it was manchester by the sea i picked it dumb on my part we both had baby blinders on no idea what s a movie went by reviews i used to avoid spoilers at all costs learned my lesson she threw down our popcorn and marched out i followed we were both relieved to find him sleeping peacefully as he only did for a babysitter thanks also at he s my guy my priority my buddy my hero my world alls i m saying is it took time for me anyway
nta but you only get a pass on one condition you must never ever again engage in these stupid trouble causing games there s a story just like this every week only immature fools go along with this absurd activity
nta nor your wife it was supposed to be a game although your friend should have never asked that question maybe its heartless but i just had this conversation with my best friend his wife is very close to giving birth he said if he had to choose he would choose his wife they can try again for another baby but there s only one of his wife i don t think that s cruel i think that s just the way life is sometimes on thing people should remember is that birth is both a physical and psychological process a woman s body is getting slammed with all sorts of biological chemicals some intended to insure that the mother accepts the baby
nta when i was smaller i was arguing with my mom my dad jumped in to take my mom s side i yelled you love her more than me he immediately replied of course i do i chose her after a moment of stunned silence we all started laughing and the argument was forgotten but like wait until your kid s a little older more annoying to make jokes like that right now your wife is dealing with the responsibility of caring for a tiny fragile baby she needs to feel like you re in baby protection mode of the time
there is no good answer except something like are you saying i couldn t carry them both you can t afford to really answer that in public that s not to say my husband and i haven t had that conversation but it was in private and not while i was suffering from pregnancy hormones also the answer changed several times depending on family make up
i m not gonna give a judgment but i will point out some thing even though they re hypothetical they could still happen you and your wife need to sit down and actually talk about if something were to happen in the future i m not just talking about this situation i m talking about wills poas trusts etc saying that you d willing sacrifice your child because your wife is sexy was pretty stupid but i understand you were trying to be funny lastly i know it might just be a me thing but if my so saved me instead of our child because we could always make another one is terrible i personally would never look at my so the same again yes that probably is just me stop playing games like this you guys are way too old to be acting this
my answer i d save my wife because she would already have the baby true story as a mom my butt would be all about my kids period you re an adult and can get out that baby needs someone your joke made her feel like she s the only person looking out for that baby you made her feel even more lonely
your friend is the ah for asking such a question
wtf is wrong with david your answer should ve been that is a f ed up question not answering yta these would you rather games should be done using situations that don t place people in the spot of having to rank their loved ones or abandon breakup with them includes things like which friend s cooking you d rather have they are relationship landmines and those who use and answer them should not be shocked that the ones referred to in that question feel upset my favorite would you rather a live next to an active volcano or b reveal your browser history to parents volcano my only choice is the volcano
yta do you tell that to everyone that loses a child god forbid you actually have to help yours in a life threatening situation
i can tell you now your wife isn t saving you
oh man coming at this from the perspective of a currently pregnant woman i gotta say yta on this one your intentions weren t bad but let me put it this way i haven t even met my son yet and the mere idea of something bad happening to him is agonizing by this point your wife has spent weeks waiting for your son hoping nothing bad will happen hoping he ll be okay and now he s here and she s still probably very aware of how small and helpless he is the idea of just making a new one would probably be completely devastating to her because she s invested so much of herself into him and the idea of losing him would be her worst nightmare and you pretty much just said you d let that happen obviously this is hypothetical and probably not what you would actually do if this situation somehow arose in real life mostly because she s an adult human who can take care of herself and he s a helpless infant i don t think you re a terrible dad or husband or whatever but this was absolutely the wrong thing to say to someone in her position right now when she really needs to know that you are on the same page as her and that she can trust you to protect your son
yta we can just make another one if our newborn perishes in a house fire dw babe then nah i m not the asshole for saying that she s the asshole for being upset about it i can t cope
only one way to answer this i d die trying to save both
there s no right answer to that question and your friend is the biggest jerk for even asking it but still yta you should have deliberated for a long time and made it clear that it s a tough choice certainly not given a quick easy answer your rationale for said answer is even worse you can make another child easily in a pleasant evening but your wife just spent months growing and birthing the one you have it s clear you haven t really internalized how much it took out of her to create a child for the both of you or bonded with him as a special individual i get that there s not a ton of personality to latch onto with babies but he s precious and irreplaceable to your wife and should be to you too i guarantee you d be less blase if you had to push the next kid out your dick
nta you got trapped with that question never answer those questions honestly just do what will smith did in the fresh prince of bel air and say that you would die trying to save them both
yeah my ex husband asked me once if i could only save him or our son which one would i save i obviously said our son because i carried around for months had spent a year breastfeeding him and operated as a single mother because he never spent any time with us or our son at all ex was furious and actually put that answer of mine as the reason he wanted a divorce he was a petty petulant child op you re yta because you clearly need to spend more time with your wife and kid to understand
nah first this is a stupid question that nobody should ever ask but they do all the time i have children myself who i would not hesitate to risk my life for that s my primary job as their parent keep them safe their job is to grow up and develop into their own people and grow their own families independent of their parents on the other hand my job as partner spouse is to love and support and nurture and grow with the person i chose ideally forever it s a different kind of love and i m inclined to believe that my answer to this question would differ depending on the circumstances realistically my knee jerk reaction as a parent in an immediate emergency would probably be to save my kids because they need my help more but if given time to think about who i m saving between you and me and the internet my husband is my absolute favorite person full stop
your friend is an ah for asking such a ridiculous and upsetting question as a game yta for joking in a way that made your wife feel like sh t and implied that she s a machine for making interchangeable babies you should have refused to answer your friend s stupid question
i laughed and jokingly said that we could just make another baby now shes giving me the cold shoulder even though i apologized to her i cant blame her for overreacting since im sure her hormones are still all over the place from the pregnancy giving birth and having a new baby i also understand that my joke was insensitive but i was also drunk am i the asshole you dont know if you can ever have another kid so dont say stupid shit like that your tempting fate and its really weird stop making exuses for the stupid comments you made them own them and stop blaming your wife s hormones and you being drunk
yta not for picking your wife by for saying we can just make another baby because while i doubt it was your intention that makes it sound like you wouldn t care if your son died and would just have another kid never say to the mother of your child even jokingly that if your child died you would just make another also your wife can make it out a burning building by herself your month baby can t lol
yta not for the answer itself that s actually pretty common most men pick the wife when asked this question most women pick the child but the callous and insensitive manner in which you answered the question is what makes you an asshole not to mention that you think she overreacted and are blaming hormones and being drunk it no excuse
nah that s one of those questions with no right answer only wrong ones
yta just make another one that isn t funny it s not even a joke sexy amazing wife kinda looks like what you prioritise about your wife plus blaming it on her hormones is ah territory alone i guarantee she will feel the same for the rest of her life that she will be willing to sacrifice her life for your child also you save the month old as they are unable to save themselves and your friend is also the ah jesus why even ask the question
oh yta most definitely your drunken joke made it sound like you were more interested in a sexy woman than your son
why do people play these dumb ass games but you chose wrong your job as a parent is to protect your child your partner is an adult they can protect themselves as a mom i d be worried too if my husband didn t feel the same way god forbid something terrible happened and he chose saving me over saving our son it would end me anyway my child would be dead and i could never forgive my husband it would be the end of our marriage yta
this type of situation always reminds me of a clip of family fued where the two guys just look at each other and in a split second agree to just nope out of answering a question this is the way
info you said you were drunk does that mean your wife was sober you weren t relaxing equally also do any of those other friends have kids parents know better than to ask existential hypotheticals like that
gentle yta let me put it this way if there was a fire and my husband saved me over our child he would lose us both i would never stay with him there would be no another kid we ve had these conversations though and you probably should too as a parent it comes with deciding what would happen with the child if one or both of you died it s morbid but necessary maybe wait till hormones have settled a bit but hormones heighten emotions they don t create them she was upset by what you said she may have reacted bigger but not differently
nta i too would choose my wife over anything in life i don t care if everyone else dies my wife goes first always she feels guilty because she wouldn t choose you over her child which is totally fine
yta not for the answer you chose it makes sense you care more about your wife than a month old you don t really know the month old yet but where the ah behavior comes in is once you noticed you upset your wife aka this part my wife gave me a weird look and asked why you can t make a joke about it anymore that s where you screwed up in your wife s head this was something serious and you made light of it
nta there was no good answer you did give the wrong answer but mars versus venus wife or kid of course you choose the kid you poor man
yta i know i will be the minority but i have lived longer and have more life experience than of the people responding that wasn t funny it sounds like you resent your son and regret having him you need to contact a therapist you have some issues that need to be addressed immediately
yta it s always the kids first everyone i know who has answered the opposite is now divorced
nah i think the we can just have another one comment is what made your statement bad but i can understand and honestly respect your logic
nah except for david lol maybe he didn t mean it but your bro set you up for failure there
a bunch of you aren t from devoriced families its so easy to tell spouses partners so fuck buddies come and go your child is your fucking child dude that s your kid that s not going away
yta your comment about being able to make another baby was bad but then blaming hormones for her overreacting being drunk isn t an excuse for making insensitive comments in the heat of the moment and i m assuming you were sober when you made the misogynistic hormone comment
yta look your wife probably took your comment as meaning you don t love your baby hormones are high and she s probably feeling like she s sacrificing her body and has sacrificed her body for nine months already for a vulnerable tiny baby additionally if she feels at all like you aren t contributing as much to childcare now she s going to spend a lot of time wondering if it s because you haven t bonded with your baby you need to sit her down and have a serious conversation about how much you love her and your baby and you made a dumb joke but you deeply love your son etc etc even if she wasn t postpartum i d find that myself to be something you can t joke about but i m aware my boundaries might be different from yours just be cautious many women and men both find that jokes about kids or movies with violence against kids are off limits once they have one so be aware that her humor there might ve shifted permanently too
yta your son is a own person and your wife loves him more than her own life she has been carrying him under her heart for weeks and sees him as a piece of you and her together and you jokes about doing a new baby as if he is replaceable thats hurting as h ll somethings you just dont say drunk or not and saying she s overreacting could also be you having to little of empathy and social skills does that feel good to hear labelling you and your reaction not then do not label others reactions as overly intense talk to her and be very very regretful because you were a insensitive insert own choice of word here to say so to your wife and mother to your child she almost certainly feels very alone now in her love for your child sees it as she and him together and you at the side of the family and her committment will always be the one of the child sorry but will have a long way to go here before you have made it okay again and its a climb a steep one
yta for answering a loaded question so quickly and confidently there is no right answer only wrong answers and yta for not knowing that
yta as a mother she was well within her rights to get that upset once your child is born you will kill for that child and they come before anyone or anything family and partners included but i feel that men don t have the same sort of bond don t get me wrong i know they have a bond but i don t feel it s a strong as a mothers as they haven t carried the baby and gone through what we went through this is based on my experience of men fyi i m not saying all men are the same however your wording is fu ing shocking you need to think before you speak the only situation you should be saying things anywhere near to this is if it was a life or death situation with labour and you had to choose between your wife and unborn child then and only then can you choose your wife over your child
asked my boyfriend this question and he chose our daughter she s months old and he said she s a baby it s our job to protect her bc she can t protect herself and we re her parents that made my mama heart so happy that he chose that answer my hormones were still are crazy and i m sure i woulda cried if he chose me in the hypothetical but some people also believe that you should love your partner before your kids and that s okay but you could ve probably gone without the we could make another one joke it was in poor taste but all in all nah no one ever wins in a hypothetical
sometimes i don t like these things because no one here is actually an ah i think your friend asked a shitty question probably feels bad and is learning from it rendering them not an ah just someone who had a dumb moment neither you or your wife are ahs either you joked she didn t take it well hormones or not something intended as a joke wasn t taken as such god if i had a dollar for every time that happened to me id be debt free i think a number of people here have a lesson to learn and probably are learning in nah but that doesn t mean anyone is guilt free either
nah the good ol mate vs child idea more than just a thought experiment of your house being on fire it also extends to how you ll make choices throughout your life i wonder if this goofy event could serve as a springboard for you two to have a meaningful discussion about how you will prioritize each other s and your child s needs over time
you fell for one of the classic blunders never answer a hypothetical question choosing between your spouse and kids nah i hate those questions even as a joke friend is an ah for asking something they should have known better hopefully you two can work it out without too much fuss
good grief esh
nah when i was pregnant with our first we attended a birthing class at the hospital they asked all of the soon to be parents this exact question to get us thinking in case the worst happened during delivery and only one life could be saved in almost every case the mother said save the baby while the father said save the mother apparently this is the most common thought process in the us the pregnant mom has already bonded with the baby but the father hasn t yet it doesn t mean you don t love the child
yta but i get you were just in the moment saying a quick answer with no thought and probably had a buzz going just making another is what you say to objects
yta the correct answer would be baby first since the wife can get out on her own instead you acted as if the child she spent months growing nurturing sustaining with her own body that she the birthed through a painful process was as replaceable as a shirt
nah you re both right and wrong here it s ok to say that the person you fell for and still care for and made a baby with is the one you love the most it s also ok for your wife to feel differently although she needs to thaw that shoulder out y all just need to talk about it
omg seriously it was a stupid hypothetical question that should never have been asked your friend is ta your wife is completely over reacting about this and should stop carrying on like a child throwing a tantrum you ve apologised and admit you were drunk nta
nta that was a loaded question those kind of questions rarely end well when spouses and boy girlfriends are involved feelings get hurt i learned my lesson by playing along with the what would you do for a million dollars question wow my wife was mad at me for several weeks
nah this is a question i would just pass on sounds like you re screwed no matter what you choose
nta what a terrible question i think you gave the right answer for anyone wondering i m a woman and i have three kids and five grandkids and i m divorced
nta sounds like you were playing a game tipsy and meant for your answer to make your wife see you still find her amazing and sexy above all else unfortunately all she heard in her tipsy state is you would let her child die a slow agonizing fiery death i would give it a couple days and reassure her you love your child and you were just trying to convey how lucky you felt to be in love and it came out not very good good intention poor execution sometimes happens
nta dude that s a no win answer right there and frankly your friend is the ah theirs a decent probability considering the fact she was upset about a hypothetical situation that would have a millions different possibilities and outcomes that you re wife would be equally upset if you left her to die in this hypothetical fire
nah tell your friend he s a jerk you don t ever put hypothetical questions where someone lives and someone dies he is ta you were drunk no matter your response you were going to lose
nah my husband would say the same thing and i d be pissed at him totally normal your friend shouldn t have asked that can t pass judgement as to whether or not he s just a bonehead or if he was actually trying to stir up drama but i d keep an eye on that red flag
nah it sounds like maybe you haven t really bonded with your baby yet have you been doing any on care with him gotta say as a parent i d be pretty upset if my husband ever chose me over our kids they come first for me and i expect them to come first for him that said people do have different feelings about this it probably letters that you and your spouse have a similar approach though
whoever asked is the asshole there was no right answer
the right answer is both either other choice you lose you went for the best of the losing choices and for that sir i tip my hat nah definitely make sure you re super attentive to both your kid and your wife also make sure she gets some sleep and time to take care of herself that s a big factor with a new baby
the only ah here is your friend for setting you up to fail there is no right answer except maybe my wife because i know she ll have the baby already saved nta
nta but you did mess up you need to tell off david off first of all you should have the moment he asked that question that s a ridiculous thing to ask when everyone is there to have fun he threw a relationship bomb at you and enjoyed watching it go off the question was tailor made to upset your wife so the real question is why did he do that to the two of you doing something like that isn t a ha ha funny joke it was about getting your wife upset and being entertained when you fought about it and someone who would do that to you isn t your best friend stop playing it off as a joke on your part and try using it as a chance to communicate with your wife seriously tell her that you get why she was hurt and explain that she has had nine months to deeply bond with your child so you understand why she feels so strongly about it but instead of focusing on the stupid hypothetical someone came up with to hurt your marriage agree to be partners and communicate tell her that you would of course put your life on the line for your son just like you know she would you will both protect your child and each other the best you can come what may if there were an emergency odds are high that it wouldn t be a situation where choosing between people is an even an option if an emergency comes up you will act as partners and try to save your whole family tell her that seeing her so upset made you think about it and you want to start a family plan for emergencies right now set up your escape plans and who will grab what if a fire or some other emergency happens a unified plan made beforehand is the best way to ensure everyone lives since you won t be panicking as much and it will show her that you are taking the safety of your child very seriously also never again call your child replaceable to her that s a one way ticket to the dog house
nah fun fact not all women bond with their baby right away either yup there are women out there that carried nurtured and pushed out that watermelon just to not want to hold it not feel connected to it and not want to be around it it can take a while for that bond to form sometimes a year or more it isn t unusual for men to take some time to form that deeper bond with their child especially because yes there is an innate primal jealousy that happens much like post partum can happen to us women you were caught up in a moment with libations involved shit happens i wish i could tell you what to do next other than profusely apologize to satiate those raging baby hormones i m sorry it s rough right now but it gets better
nta friend is for asking a stupid question btw the only way out is to zig when everybody is expecting you to zag answer neither i d definitely save the ps5 before either one laugh and move on
esh playing would you rather is almost always a bad idea and this is just one of the many reasons why and for future reference your child always should come first
nta my husband says some similar regarding me vs the kids lol
nta something i have noticed when i was working with parents is that most dads choose the wife and most moms choose their child children can t really say as to why just wanted to point out that you aren t the only dad who thinks like this
your friend is ta for future reference the correct answer is i d save them both or i d die trying and then refuse to budge from there
i had very little connection to my son when he was born it was impossibly hard in the beginning but by months i was so in love with him that it is quite literally impossible to describe he s now and well he s perfect no words can describe how i feel about it still long winded way of saying nta i suppose but take it easy on your wife too her feelings are super valid
yta if the house was on fire and my husband saved me and let our two kids die i d be leaving his ass immediately i would never feel the same way about him again thankfully part of why i love my husband so much is because he loves the kids as fiercely and deeply as i do
nah she s a new mother and gave birth a couple months ago so i m sure her head is flooded with all kinds of hypotheticals what ifs fears and doubts about the human being you guys just made and hormones too so she probably had a pretty emotional response to your answer you were also shoved into an awkward position by your friend who asked you if you would save your wife or newborn child from death who the hell asks someone a question like that in front of their wife and did your best to make a joke about it to alleviate the weirdness that comes along with a question like that if anyone is even close to the ah it s david questions like that don t have a good answer and put the questioned person in a lose lose situation
the asshole in this situation is david that s a no win question neither of the i would let a or b die has a pat answer that s guaranteed safe it s far from certain that even she has a reliable preferred answer either answer could get her angry depending on how she s feeling at the particular moment she hears it david probably knows perfectly well how fraught that question is and you should carefully consider how much of him you want around when he so obviously enjoys stirring up trouble
yta our neighbours house caught fire after the first lock down a three storey the husband got out the wife jumped out of the top floor window and was seriously injured and the kids never made it
nta but your friend sure is she s a new mother she s more hormonal than a teenage boy and your friend is a jerk to put you on the spot like that
nah i m a trained first aid worker and when i m in a situation of triage between reanimating a mom or her child 16yo i would always help the mom first the reason behind it is the mom can live without a child a child can t live without their mom op is not ta but could have chosen a better reason why
nta but like really a game of hypotheticals involving the life or death of close loved ones are we hypotheticals can be so much more fun and creative but ya ll consented to playing the game
yta honestly this doesn t sound good to me it was an obviously no win situation but still you don t talk about your living son as something you could just make again as if he was disposable i get hes really young and you did not have much time to bond but still who says that and for a sexy girl check your priorities at least your baby s mother has him in first place as she should too bad you think he can be remade anyways not disposable he is a person you are responsible for
nta it was hypothetical situation and you gave a hypothetical answer play stupid games win stupid prizes
nta because the question no matter who you would chose to save means one would die the question guarantees you would be labeled the ta the correct response would be not playing the game
trick question there was no right answer she ll get over it
nah but your friend set you up for failure there is no right answer to that question especially when pregnancy hormones are involved when that baby comes though you will know the right answer fatherhood is awesome
i m and i ve known most of my adult life that my parents put each other first then their kids they love us so f ing much and are the most amazing parents but i would never expect them to chose us over each other
yta this has to be fake i genuinely do not want to believe anyone could be this shitty
yta the correct answer is always both either we all make it out alive or we all burn to death together
people tend to say stupid things when they are drunk your wife has a reason to get angry at you but she should understand mother s have whole months to bond with their children emotionally the same can t be applied to father s because it will take time for them to accept there is another member in the family you are nta but you were an insensitive prick when you are drunk cause you re pretty sure that your wife s harmones are all over the place
esh this is a hypothetical game what ifs that could or could not happen if the house was truly on fire your wife should be able to get herself out while the baby gets saved by you hands down easy so your wife needs to calm down because if it did she knows you ll take care of it at the same time you re to blame here as well i m sure having your son be young it s hard to know him as a person who he s going to become and how you will get along the relationship isn t there yet the connection isn t as full as it is to your wife as a parent though she wants to hear you say your son he s your future together it could feel as though you don t want that with her it s just phrasing
yta sure you were drunk and joking but you said out loud to everyone that you d let your son die in a fire this isn t about hormones eyeroll you legitimately hurt your wife
nta she might have been even angrier if you d left her to burn maybe say that together you had a better chance to save the baby
nah this has been asked before your so or your child obvioulsy people will choose their so over a child for example in birth is common because of complications they ll ask wether to save the mom or the baby and usually mom is the one to be saved i mean you re not alone on your thought process but you said it out loud you can have more child but only one wife of course there are a lot more women out there but you chose yours for a reason
breeders are so strange
nah i feel like there was no right answer for this question and honestly it feels a bit weird to ask when you like just had the baby but she did just give birth so i can understand why she s upset but you didn t do anything wrong the situation was just weird
the correct answer here is always to save the child pet and say it s because the adult partner can save themselves and the others can t the best response is don t play these dumb fucking games
nta because i feel like no matter how you answered she would have gotten upset in some capacity and it would have brought this party down no matter what if you would have answered save the baby she would have accused you of not caring for her or accused you of cheating or something because you could discard her so easily i hate these stupid games people play this was a question that had no right answer in my opinion if anything the person who asked this question or started this shit game is the asshole
nta i don t know whether to laugh with you or cry with your wife someone needs to throw that would you rather card in the garbage i don t think you did anything wrong and your wife s hormones are still out of whack so i can understand why that upset her i hope she comes around soon and forgives you
my husband and i don t have kids but if there was a fire we would both be saving our cats and dogs we are both able bodied adults who can get out on our own and don t need to be saved by the other i feel the same should be done for kids both parents focus on saving the children
yah honestly esh but your wife your friend for making that joke i ve never understood those specific would you rather s and you for after the we could make another one joke

nta and i would change the way you frame it you started distancing yourself from bruno once he started making unwanted sexual advances towards you don t let anyone tell you otherwise
nta gay man here if bruno were straight and you were a woman we wouldn t even be asking bruno s engaging in straight up title ix sexual harassment
nta this isn t homophobic this is wanting to not be sexually harassed
i thought we agreed that we don t talk about bruno no ah but i suppose we must in isolation i would laugh off the cute ass comment or the jump on you thing but they weren t just one time bad jokes it s a pattern it s not ok to objectify and harass people even if the person in question is a man ask if your wife would be ok if you treated your sister in law the way bruno treats you insist on an apology for her words to you nta
nta the issue here as you ve pointed out isn t that he s gay it s that he is objectifying you to the point you are uncomfortable
nta you re being sexually harassed if you were female it would be totally unacceptable to talk about your ass and jumping on you just because you re a dude doesn t mean sexual harassment is okay
nta you were harassed and are now avoiding this person and just because people from a culture perform introductions by kissing on the cheek doesn t mean you have to be ok with this and go along with it put these two together and you arrive at the uncomfortable situation you are in now
nta he is sexually harassing you you wife is an ah as she is an apologist and an enabler
nta hes overstepping his boundaries to you when he knows you re already married he needs to step back it would be the same for any couple already together
nta bruno has to understand teen age is over
nta it s not a joke if everyone isn t laughing i bet they would have a problem if you said something like that to ana but it s ok for bruno to talk like that to you
nta he was objectifying you if it made you uncomfortable because of what he was saying then it is an issue i would discuss it with bruno himself though just let him know you love him like family but that the comments are making you uncomfortable since you re married to his sister
nta it sounds like he s flirting with you despite you saying you re not interested if he can t take no for an answer then it s only natural you d want to try to limit your interactions
nta he s crossing boundaries and is excusing himself of any responsibility with his sexuality he s sexually harassing you at this point and playing the victim you are not behaving in a way that is homophobic
i m trying to imagine a world where this would be acceptable if bruno was your wife s sister and she was hitting on you like this nope wife would probably not consider it harmless joking nta bruno is crossing boundaries this isn t you being homophobic
uhm if he was a female and not her sibling your wife would be pissed nta he s coming off creepy and making you uncomfortable and shame on your wife for allowing it it s not homophobic to be uncomfortable at advances from someone especially a family member
nta if he s making you uncomfortable by hitting on you no wonder you re distancing yourself from him
nta i d be having the same reaction to an il of any gender doing that to me this is a harassment issue not a homophobia issue
nta this is not homophobic your wife is misusing the word and clearly doesn t understand the definition if after he came out as gay you didn t want to be around him anymore because he came out that would be homophobic that s not what happened here it doesn t matter if a person is a different sexual orientation than you that does not make it safe to say inappropriate comments that make the other person feel uncomfortable plus he tried to kiss you on the lips that was a huge overstep i think you need to be like the family madrigal we don t talk about bruno sorry i couldn t resist
nta you are being sexually harassed and your wife is allowing it you should be more angry at her than you describe she needs to nip this in the bud
nta it s still unacceptable behavior by your bil announcing he s gay doesn t give him a pass to be a creep
nta but i think it s about time to have a honest conversation with everybody and communicate how you feel there s nothing wrong with being uncomfortable as long as you discuss it
you aren t homophobic you re being sexually harassed turn the tables pretend you are female sil and bruno is a heterosexual bil would this behaviour be acceptable then no it wouldn t your wife needs to stop expecting you to take this it is wrong she needs to support you
nta it s not the kiss it s the comments how would your wife feel if ana or ricardo s wife were saying these things no difference
we don t talk about bruno
nta he can be gay all he wants but those comments and behavior are inappropriate especially when you ve made it known that you don t appreciate them
nta bruno is the creep
nta obligatory as a gay man dot dot dot this man has made unwanted advances to you and you have a right to distance yourself from someone who does that period the end i really don t for the life of me understand why your wife doesn t find this to be a big deal if i said something like that to my sister s husband she d slug me navy master at arms they both are actually and she d have every right to
nta but i would if i were you have a talk with bruno he is not a mind reader but he is noticing you are acting differently tell him that what he is doing is sexually harassing you and or making you feel uncomfortable lay out everything just as you did here he just came out so maybe he is young and does not understand how his actions are having consequences someone needs to have this conversation with him rather than making excuses for him we all do stupid stuff at times when we are young and he needs to know where the boundaries are of course your wife does not see the problem it does not affect her and she loves her brother
nta kinda crazy how the title would make you homophobic but the story is about your sexist wife
this is a sexual harassment issue full stop nta
nta his behavior is not okay
why do people think they get to decide how someone s actions affected someone who is not them nta my recommendation is to write a short phrase bruno hits on me which makes me uncomfortable and this is my way of communicating it since my words aren t working and to repeat it out loud over and over and over you are being gaslit and aren t being heard you can treat them with the disrespect of training them like toddlers or set a boundary with bruno if you kiss me too close to the lips or you hit on me again i will leave in view of everyone else you ll have to follow through a few times before they get it but if you warn them you can always just repeat yourself over and over that way until they get it
the i don t understand is so infuriating to me are you an adult human do you have an adult human brain do you think adult human thoughts with it then forking try think about this adult human problem until you do understand it s not rocket surgery do the bare minimum amount of work for your partner who you theoretically love jesus herbert walker christ nta
nta bruno is being way too flirty with a married man i e you you don t have to like this coming from a gay man just as you wouldn t like it coming from a woman tell wife that bruno s behavior is inappropriate verges on sexual harassment and saying it s a joke doesn t make it better behavior
nta as others have said the issue is not his sexuality it s his behavior towards you being inappropriate if you were a woman describing the behavior of this man right now it wouldn t even be questioned if it was inappropriate or not it is
nta this has absolutely nothing to do with bruno being gay and everything to do with the fact that your wife s sibling is hitting on you and being inappropriate that s not okay no matter what
if things were reversed and he were a straight man doing this to a woman people would be supporting you your wife should be supporting you but it is hard to see a family member in this light it has nothing to do with homophobia
ask your wife if it were a woman doing it if she d say the same you don t care that he s gay you care that his actions are making you uncomfortable and i d be upset that my oh wasn t listening to me and automatically going for you being homophobic alternatively just tell him that you don t appreciate his comments or call him out if he kisses you too closely again woah you going for some tongue there bruno put the focus on his actions
nta bi guy here i just dealt with my own form of harassment from a male classmate i told him outright i wasn t interested in him and he either would continue pursuing me or call me a bigot even though that wouldn t make sense since i don t hide my sexuality the point is just because someone is queer doesn t mean they can t still sexually harass others and honestly male victims imo need to acknowledged more
nta but damn is the title misleading you aren t a homophobe for distancing yourself from the person sexually harassing you and trying to assault you i m sorry this is happening and i hope your wife realizes how wrong she is and tries to protect you family should support you not harm you
nta you need to tell him the unwarranted flirting is making you uncomfortable because you don t have experience with enough gay men that this is making you uncomfortable eventually i hope you can lighten up a bit because he is as you said around frequently and a big part of your kids lives be upfront about everything set a firm boundary that cheek kisses are to remain neutral and respectful and that it s fine to joke when it s in taste if he tried that crap with your wife if he was your brother he d get chewed out for disrespecting your wife and your relationship would he not so this is no different from any other situation where a stranger or someone close is flirting with your spouse but it does read homophobic as well once that initial conversation is had you might want to get some insight into your bil life in a healthy way get to know him better and show the family their perceived bigotry of you is wrong
nta
nta if you told anyone of a woman being treated by a man like bruno is treating you they d be up in arms calling him a creep why should it be different when we change a few sexes and orientation a clue it isn t bruno is acting like a sexual creep
nta it would be different if the jokes were made about all the fiancs instead of zeroing in on you though not much since if anyone is uncomfortable about those things it should immediately cease no matter what gender we are talking but he s focused on you i think you really should sit him down and talk to him maybe with a third party preferably also alphabet mafia to help keep things focused properly on the problem his behavior not his orientation reinforce that you love him as a brother and fully support his lifestyle but the fact that he keeps singling you out for comments like this makes you uncomfortable especially since he doesn t direct them at other men when they are present let him know you would feel the same if it was a woman making these comments too and it feels disrespectful of your family bond
wat the actual fuck is going on nta id heavily be thinkint aobut this whole marriage thing my dude like you liverally can t make this kinda shit up
nta your not a homophobe your reaction is perfectly normal to someone hitting on you making advances that you don t want his commented on your body done the whole if you wasn t with so so and so and now his kisses are inching closer and closer to your lips rather than your cheek your wife needs to realise his not joking it s not funny
nta bruno is sexually harassing you it s not homophobic to be uncomfortable with his advances that s human
nta as long as you would react the same way to ana making those same comments and kissing you that way which is seems like you would then you re not being homophobic you just don t like being sexually harassed by your wife s sibling
nta he is harassing you and your wife is condoning if not encouraging it boundaries need to be drawn now she can have whatever relationship she wants with her brother you should go no contact low contact and continue to do the fabulous grey rock method with him
it has nothing with him being gay it with make uncomfortable sexual comments there is nothing funny about and your wife dismiss you you have every right to be comfortable nta
nta he s pushing the borders and your wife is refusing to back you you were not rude to him but you ve distanced yourself from him since he will not change my concern here is your wife is discrediting your feelings
nta but he sounds like he s willing to own up to it the partner is the one being a real ah by encouraging him to sweep it under the rug it also sounds like this isn t a gay thing this is a weird comments about your body thing
nta and your wife is a major ah
yes yes he did do something to offend you he hit on you a married man who s primary association with him is through marital ties nta for distancing yourself your wife should have nipped this in the bud when you disclosed to her how his infatuation rubbed you the wrong way you shouldn t be made to feel uncomfortable to save face with your handsy bil not wanting to be hit on or sexually pursued by your in laws does not make you homophobic in the slightest i was ready to call you an ah since usually when people come out as gay they don t hit on their siblings significant others but he did that is a boundary that should never have been crossed
nta see if she would think the same way if ana s husband being non pc assuming she has one acted the same way to her as bruno is to you she d probably be creeper out and telling everyone
the place you re wrong is telling your wife what s bothering you but not confronting bruno directly nta for being uncomfortable since his joke was inappropriate but he s asking what he did wrong so this is a great time to bring it up
you are not being distant because he came out as gay you are being distant because he is distespecting your boundaries nta
so you are expected to endure sexual harassment because nta
nta you should work out with her sister her partner that you compliment each other the same way bruno compliments you and see if your wife likes it
nta this doesn t have a to be a discussion you are free to contact him and tell him i m treating you like x because you are doing y ignore anything other than an apology the end now your wife continuing to brush off your feelings is a whole different problem and out of my pay grade
nta as a guy who has been sexually abused as a child and sexually assaulted by a man when i was in my mid teens and have recently had male members from my in laws side who are gay try hitting on me despite me being married to their female family member reading your story makes me uncomfortable for you main point i love the lgbtq community and i love my friends and family including the in laws that hit on me so this is not a bash on that community just bruno s actions first the jokes they are objectifications about you and they made you uncomfortable the next time it happens you have to quickly and clearly shut it down talk with bruno and then reinforce the boundaries second kisses are fine until you know when they are not and continue to not be ok if it happens once or even twice no worries if it continues to happen then it is a common theme and intentional on his side for pushing the envelope the same way it would be wrong for you to do that to a woman again and again one of my male in laws is one of the ones that kiss on the cheeks which i have no issues with until on the day of his mothers funeral he kissed my cheek then decided to pull back hold my face in his hands and force a kiss on my lips in front of everyone i made no scene because you know funeral but that was not ok despite telling my wife about it she thought that he was just playing around and was not being serious he tried again to kiss closer to my lips on later family events but i put a stop to that by being firm and stopping the kisses altogether and going just for the hug for further information these in laws were individually trying to engage me in conversations that were clearly inappropriate sexual in nature and flirtatious i am sure they did not know the other member of their family was doing the same thing but either way it is wrong on all levels my wife thought that they were simply being friendly and seeking another male perspective on things it was not until i told her my what my therapist said did she realize that she was blinded by family love she is now backing my boundaries with them back to your case it is possible that bruno may not be objectifying you but from what you stated i think your intuitions are correct set the boundary with him and let him know that you do not appreciate the jokes that you love and care about him but they make you uncomfortable i think that once you deal with the jokes that will resolve the kissing issue if he tries to push past your boundaries then go lc and tell your wife how you feel and that she is not listening to you as she is blinded by her love of bruno the same way my wife was blinded about my in laws lastly and this is important tell bruno that despite all of this you still love him as family and love him just as he is through and through as long as he respect your boundaries he should be ok good luck op
nta i don t think it s homophobic behavior to want your wife s brother to not hit on you if you were a woman whose husband s brother was hitting on her everyone would be up in arms about it to defend her this is the same thing only involves a man your wife needs to ask her brother to drop the flirting with you because it is inappropriate
nta a good friend of mine had a friend that is lesbian once this woman found out i am bisexual it was as though i had a target on my chest even though i was already in a relationship she became very touchy feely made overly sexual remarks i asked her to back off but she said she didn t mind me playing hard to get when i complained to my good friend she laughed it off and said that was her friend s way of flirting i shouldn t take anything too seriously and even suggested that maybe i should just give her a chance it wasn t until i pointed out to her that if a man had been doing and saying these things we d all be yelling sexual harassment and wanting to chop off his balls she saw my point and we re even better friends now op are not the a you are the victim you are not homophobic instead you were supportive of him until he crossed the line and began sexually harassing you even if he is joking any type of sexual advance that makes you uncomfortable is harassment please explain to your wife how you feel maybe you can show her some of these posts i hope everything works out there
nta that s sexual harassment not homophobia
nta the problem isn t his sexuality the problem is that he s making you uncomfortable and downplaying it
im gonna go with nta here i worked a job with a year old gay manager and all of his jokes were about having sex with our male coworkers all of which were minors he used the fact that no one wanted to be called a homophobe and his position as a manager to sexually harass us i m picking up a lot of similar signs from this post however you can t expect him to adjust his behavior namely the cheek kiss if you don t confront him about your boundaries
we don t talk about bruno no no but we should nta sexual harassment is sexual harassment regardless of the gender and sexual identities of the people involved
nta but i will say that it seems like none of these things bothered you until you found out he was gay he didn t just wake up gay and suddenly start making jokes like this my guess is that he has always made inappropriate jokes that you never thought twice about because you weren t the focus of the joke furthermore i would venture to guess that you have probably laughed at these jokes at the expense of other people
nta you didn t start distancing yourself after he came out as gay you started distancing yourself after he started sexually harassing you
nta i had a ex s coworker act like that liked to say i d snatch you up and have my way until one time i said back you know i have a say in to matter too i wouldn t just stand there and let you r pe me ya that shut him up really quick
nta queer here and this is harassment your wife is not taking your comfort into consideration her because her brothers always like that yeah sorry no idgaf what they are always like if someone is uncomfortable you stop op stick to it get those boundaries up fuck show him this sentence being gay doesn t give a free pass to harass
nta this is sexual harassment and you need to tell your bil to stop otherwise he won t know he needs to
u need to show ur w8fe this post she s not supporting u at all and ur bil is being highly inappropriate i m sorry ur going through this
nta pretend bruno has come out as straight and told his brother s wife he d jump her if she wasn t married to his brother point how how nice her tits and ass are
he offered sexual compliments and harassments and then upped the ante with a near kiss which borders on sa i get you not just bc i m uncomfortable with my italian family and family friends growing up doing the sloppy cheek kiss i hated it growing up bc i don t like people touching me in general now i tolerate it better don t cringe and wish it was air kisses anywho what you described is hardly the same as familial love it s sexual harassment bordering on sa if he was a women my reaction would be the same but this ah is taking advantage and using homophobia as a defense for being an ah nta just bc u r gay doesn t mean u aren t an ah
nta this isn t homophobia it s sexual harassment bruno is openly flirting with you despite knowing a you re straight and b you re married to his sister it s disrespectful to you to her and to your relationship and bruno is way out of line worse he s shaming you into accepting his unwanted sexual advances by calling you homophobic and enlisting your wife to help him when you express your discomfort this is a toxic mess brewing and your wife needs to step up and shut this down with bruno asap
nta gay person here there s no excuse for bruno s behaviour it s literally sexual harassment i m also very concerned that sandra is so quick to brush it off and excuse her brothers behaviour doesn t matter if bruno always jokes like that which fyi is disgusting on so many levels he s made unwanted sexual advances and comments to you you ve voiced that you find it uncomfortable sandra is saying she basically doesn t care she s showing she doesn t value your feelings and frankly that s a big red flag it s stuff like this which is why men don t come forward when they ve been sexually harassed assaulted they re either not believed or made fun of she s quick to go to the if you re homophobic so either she s purposefully deflecting or feels protective over her brother and maybe has experience of homophobia against him either way it s not fair for how she s completely disregarding what you re going though if this was a man making advances on a women everyone would know that he would be in the wrong and that s just who he is would be a toxic excuse this isn t any different bruno is being predatory and not respecting boundaries and your wife is not valuing your feelings and safety not something you want in an partner you re nta and i think you should say to bruno that you feel incredibly uncomfortable with his advances and so that s why you don t want to see him hereafter i think you also need to talk to your wife about how inconsiderate she s being for dismissing your feelings if she continues this behaviour and doesn t apologise it might be worth rethinking if you really want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn t take seriously you being sexually harassed assaulted
nta that is very weird and uncomfortable behaviour if my sil said that to me or my sister said that to my partner both our families would be extremely uncomfortable and weirded out and i m brazilian we are also very touchy feely people who kiss people s cheeks to say hi and make pushy jokes etc but there are some lines you just don t cross i m also queer so this isn t about culture or homophobia wouldn t your wife find it weird if her mom or her sister made that comment i bet she would it s not suddenly okay to say those things to your sibling s partner because you re gay and they re straight
i feel like they don t talk about bruno
nta bruno borderline sexually assaulted you
nta if op s sil was saying those things i doubt his wife would feel the same way it s inappropriate from either a bil or sil
nta but i would absolutely talk to bruno tell him you re flattered by the compliments but you re uncomfortable with how far the jokes go this will only get worse if you don t talk to him whether the jokes get worse or the relationship gets worse but overall he s making you feel uncomfortable and it s just not okay
nta consent matters you ve made yourself very clear that you are uncomfortable with his sexual comments and actions if this was a man doing it to a woman everyone would immediately recognize it as harassment this is the same thing you have every right to have boundaries and not be harassed
nta it s not homophobic to not want to be kissed by a man it means you have your own boundaries and you want them respected this would be a completely different reaction if the rolls were reversed with wifey
nta i don t think this is an issue of him coming out it s his actions and creepy behavior if he acted like this before and you had no issues then you might by the ta if his actions are new then you have full right be want to keep your distance
info is this how bruno normally acts acted if things are different for you but he isn t acting differently than you need to tell him and its nah soft yta for seeing him differently as a person kinda understandable but not cool if this is new behavior now that he s come out than definitely nta and he needs to be told to stop harassing you
nta clearly if bruno wants to know if he needs to apologize for something someone should tell him that yes he doesn t like those kind of jokes about being interested in him doesn t seem like the wife delivered the message but also did bruno always make those jokes about women and now makes them about men and so it didn t impact op before and the women didn t express a problem so the wife is like it s literally the same thing and op is like but now it s not just it s happening it s happening to me would op have the same problem if his wife s sister did it if so then it s not homophobic at all to want it to stop
nta this is straight up sexual harassment but now all i can think about is we don t talk about bruno
divorce your wife instead of believing you when you said that her brother is sexually harassing you and making you uncomfortable her response is to call you out for being a homophobe which you decidedly are not this isn t love therapy won t fix this divorce her nta
nta as someone who has been harassed by gay males for the last years it is appalling behavior it is title ix harassment totally unacceptable and inappropriate you should however call your wife and bruno out she should have heard you when you told her if you were uncomfortable if your brother hit on her and she was uncomfortable you would in theory address it with bruno he s likely mimicking behavior that has been normalized by society he needs to know it isn t cool and if he wants to have a relationship with you he needs to respect you
nah you spoke to your wife not to your bil why not talk to him and tell him those jokes and remarks make you feel uncomfortable he does not become an ah unless you have talked to him and he disregards it and keeps on going after that talk but first you should let him know how uncomfortable it makes you feel instead of avoiding him and being distant reacting that way makes it seem homophobic edit in that talk emphasize the remarks that lead to you feeling uncomfortable with their cultural greeting not him kissing you as a greeting now you know he is gay but the remarks and sexualization with those remarks that make the greeting feel uncomfortable and too intimate aswell
nta but careful i dont think he is being too bad either i am spanish as well and we kiss and touch a lot that is a cultural thing but culture must be respected but not imposed if you are unconfortable with the kiss just tell him in private and you just hand shake that should not be an issue at all of course this can be seen as homophobic since it is a problem because he is gay it was not a problem before then you have the comments or jokes you can tell him that makes you unconfortable and it should stop otherwise it is harrassment if you are not ok with them they are not jokes however again keep in mind that in spain we do joke a lot about that as well there are a lot of people who overstep a lot and need to be told so you are in the right but he is not a monster either just seems to be taking too many liberties and once you talk with him he will surely stop
nta he s sexually harassing you he s likely going to use the fact he s gay as an excuse to call you a homophobe juat as your wife falsely has but he s giving you unwanted sexual attention also just because they are from spain doesn t mean that greeting works outside of friends or family that are okay with my best friend is from spain and as we are both girls and comfortable we actually don t touch each others faces but rather peck the air near the cheek on both sides we don t actually make contact there s no reason for bruno to be getting so close especially after covid so he has no reason to be doing that to you period plus your in america and you are culturally american we don t do those other greetings outside of very specific and consenting circumstances just tell him your not comfortable with it period you can even refuse the rest of the families greetings of similar action so he doesn t feel single out
if he always jokes like that and you knew this and you were fine with it before and it s only since his coming out that it s bothered you yta if he s always kissed you the same way and you re only now starting to think it feels a little close to the lips yta in the above two instances the only thing that s changed is your perception if you have never known him to joke like this before nta but also worth considering that it could be just that a one off joke that was intended as friendly flirting but landed poorly 1b if it s a case of having always felt a strange vibe from him and now you feel more certain there might be something to it nta 2b if you re responding to a definite change in behaviour on his part nta everybody seems to have jumped to accusing your bil of sexual harassment but i think that s a little extreme given the information provided unless in the case of 1b or 2b in which case the other commenters are right and you should establish firm boundaries
you feel how you feel i guess my question is was he like this before he came out and if so were were ok with it because you thought he was straight or the hokes were directed elsewhere and it did not effect you and now you are uncomfortable because he is gay i also don t understand why if the family is so close you can t just talk to him and say that makes me uncomfortable or i m not a fan of this action from you i mean honestly you are already avoiding him would it really be that much worse to have a honest talk but you need ot ask your self why does it make you uncomfortable would it if it was one of her sisters that was acting that way if so then not homphobic
yta you say his sister says he does this all the time you didn t stop the cheek kissing until you found out he was gay and then worried he kissed you too close to the lips
no you aren t wrong in how you feel those are your honest feelings i will say though that someone who is comfortable with their sexuality will take a compliment as it is meant men straight and gay can find other men attractive and even say so would you tell a sil if she was attractive if you are secure in your own sexuality then it shouldn t be anything but a compliment i d ignore your wife and talk to bruno about this and how it has made you uncomfortable as that is the only way to solve this on your behalf at this point also another thing to keep in mind is that europeans have a different way of looking at things than americans and sometimes that can get lost in translation nta
if he s legitimately always been like that before you found out that he s gay then yeah yta you ve got some unconscious biases to work through if the only reason his behavior makes you uncomfortable now compared to earlier is that you found out he s into dudes you re well within your rights to ask him not to make comments like that though i would again say to think about whether he made those sorts of comments before and you re only uncomfortable now the kissing business definitely sounds like you re uncomfortable because you found out he s gay

nta she pushed the issue and there were clearly feelings of inadequacy in your childhood that needed addressed
it seems that you had a bomb inside for all these years and it exploid boom it would happen sooner or later what to say if they really abandoned you for the first years of your life then they are tas for sure
i m going to say nta simply because i can relate i m the younger sister of a brother who can do no wrong in my parents eyes i ve seen them practically trip over their own feet to get to the door to greet him my birthday is weeks after his and one year after about years of him getting a birthday cake and me not i finally asked about it i was told we just had cake for his birthday we don t need it again we re both well into adulthood now and have this so called rivalry where we each say the other is mom s favorite he s playing i m not
nta and we are going to need an update in a few days or a week if your parents see their error and apologize double down to everything being ok back then or just ignore the situation thanks
nta at all for anyone who was raised catholic we all know what a huge deal the first communion is it s not even about the religious part it s about how loved and important your family makes you feel i can understand how that definitely left a mark on you i mean i got the big lavish party but my mom got obsessed the day before with a zit i had and trying to remove it let my face all weird the next day and i resent her to this day and it was so minimal compared to this i cannot imagine how you feel so yeah you re valid op go off
nta i am so sorry that you grew up in a family with favored siblings i also was a forgotten child growing up no birthday party until i was eight and plenty of other stories once the flood breaks open the dam there is no controlling all the rage pain and humiliation you felt as an invisible unfavorite child in my view you are absolutely allowed to lay into your mother when she wouldn t stop pushing granted it wasn t really the right time or place but unless you have felt that kind of pain of knowing your parents do not love you as much as they do your sibling nobody else can judge you or have anything to say about whether or not your behavior is appropriate most people will never understand how many nights you cried yourself to sleep how often you actually wished you d never been born because then you wouldn t hurt all the time about how you wish you were secretly adopted because these people do not treat you as a full member of the family you are just the pain in the ass kid they don t want but can t get rid of i see you you have value you deserve love without conditions i am so sorry but i am also very happy you can give your child the honor and respect you don t get from your parents please remember you are allowed to cut contact with your family if they are toxic and cause you constant pain sometimes no contact is one of the best ways to get the healing you need you are an adult and are allowed to choose your own family whether they share dna with you is irrelevant choose people who have your back and will be there for you and who accept you as you are i was nc with my parents and sister for many years eventually some of the relationship was repaired but never fully because when you feel unloved by your parents as a child due to your siblings consistently being treated better it never goes away that hole was created by the actions of your parents being thoughtless and it is part of your foundational relationship it is a trauma that can be healed but there will always be a tiny part of your inner child s heart that is broken and missing at least when you experience that even as a kid you know you can and will be a better parent and that is what you have done you are a better parent and you can feel proud of that hugs to you from an internet stranger mom type
nta especially with all the added context they sound awful that s ridiculous behavior
nta she asked why your daughter was happy and you were not and you told her
nta
nta and good on you for calling it out they probably had some damn fantasy in their head about how things were
i am so sorry you were so neglected as compared to your siblings and that there was so much pain around you being the least cared for sibling that came to a head with your first communion it must have felt great to give your daughter the kind of celebration you wish you d had i m glad you finally told your mother exactly how you felt about what happened to you you told the truth if she found that painful too bad don t let anyone tell you that you were wrong to tell the truth don t let anyone tell you that you ve got it all wrong and the truth isn t the truth keep putting your energy into your own nuclear family in the present and into healing from the terrible way you were made to feel as a young girl nta p s don t let anyone try to bully you into forgiving your parents insisting it will make you feel better and it will give you closure and blah blah blah if they want forgiveness let them repent them them apologize deeply and sincerely let them beg for your forgiveness you are not obligated to give it
nta
we need info what s the context of her not throwing parties was it a budget issue or a i don t care issue why did others seem to get acknowledgement more also you seem to equate big elaborate gifts as signs of love which they are not children feel loved without enormous material goods and you re raising your child only looking to compare to others that never makes you happy in the long term
info huge balloons rented several soft play bouncing activities characters a cotton candy machine ice cream a huge cake and customized treat table this is for first communion like the very somber white dresses and all formal religious occasion since when is this is a birthday style event age in a little white dress holding a rosary looking dead inside right _that s_ first communion i mean this must be very fun for your daughter sure but of course kids are going to like wildly over the top tonally inappropriate parties how is this even something you re holding a grudge about so excited at first for my communion watching my cousins get huge lavish parties thrown for them where in the world is this happening and where i have been living for the past couple decades
nta amended see replies your mother s observation was cutting but your revelation should have waited this was your daughter s day

months ago you were and in college suddenly you have a child old enough for first communion
i m going to say yta not because you expressed these feelings but how when and where you did you say she showed to two photos and then you finally snapped that is not enough provocation to throw a tantrum in the middle of your kid s party you have clearly had these feelings for several years there are thousands of more appropriate and productive ways you could have and should have handled this
esh what your parents did when you were little was unfair and kind of mean not getting you your own cake or a new dress and making you feel like you were overshadowed it s very clear you were hurt about it and i m guessing this also wasn t the first time this happened to you as a kid so it was just another thing on the pile but holy literally shit man this is a first communion you know what happens for most kids when they have their first communion they maybe get a few religious gifts and a cake with their family and maybe a few friends at someone s house or occasionally a banquet hall if their family has money meanwhile you sounded like you dropped figures on this party everything you described for a kid s party for any reason is beyond absurd of course your daughter was happy when you did more than most parents do for their kids birthdays for their entire lives combined you went over the top honestly you really need to tone it down because if this is normal for your daughter it s very likely she s becoming increasingly spoiled it s not uncommon for people who were neglected or abused in childhood to spoil their kids into being entitled nasty people also spending that much on a communion which is the acceptance of a deity who encouraged his followers to give up all their worldly possessions to the needy is hilariously ironic all in all i think you should have a frank conversation with your parents about how neglected you felt as a child and the communion thing just brought it to a head it s possible they didn t realize how much they neglected or hurt you and perhaps they d be willing to rebuild your relatiosnhip
holy fuck yta this just sounds like pure greed spoiled children might be happy but unless you re planning on financially supporting and spoiling them throughout their whole lives be prepared to have your adult child yell at you kind of like what you just did here if this was the worst thing that happened to you you had a pretty fucking happy childhood jfc
yta oh geez they didnt throw buckets of cash at you as a child and chose to allow older sister to celebrate a milestone one that you d also go through years later

nta
what was her reaction
nta fafo
nta
nta i feel you i did even get party to many april birthdays sorry parents are like that but they shouldn t ask if the do not want answers
nta because facts do you really want your daughter even associated with these people
nta congratulations your inner child is proud of you
nta let me guess at you were the only one left at home and it was suddenly oh hey we have another kid she s the one who pushed for an answer it s not your fault that the answer was one she didn t like from context it sounds like she didn t apologize or anything probably just doubled down i m sorry that s how you grew up
i definitely have held this inside my entire life
it honestly sucks and i really feel for you having a child heightened my emotions on this because i look at her and can t imagine doing what our parents did to us it seems a lot of parents favor boys for some reason too i don t care if my house burns down the day before my kids getting a cake
i feel your pain my little brothers were born a week before my 11th birthday i love them deeply but my mom would always get a cake for them and some matching cake for me i didn t get to choose the flavor theme anything and i don t even really like cake when i asked for some other dessert i was told that she got a discount to get the two together and no one else likes pie you re getting a cake i never ate any on my 12th birthday their 1st she forgot to tell anyone that their party was also my party my friend brought me a present but no one else did and my friend sang happy birthday to me alone at a little table while everyone else celebrated them my family all said they didn t know because it wasn t on the invitation and she didn t tell anyone this behavior went on until i left the house op you are nta it s painful to be left out or forgotten
i agree with you op is nta and i feel your pain my older brother also is the golden child his birthday is in the spring and my mom who was a teacher always had spring break the week of his birthday every year she would drive miles to my house to make my brother a birthday cake using my kitchen ingredients etc then she would take the cake to my brother which he liked but didn t truly appreciate the lengths she went to for him now mom is very old and cannot travel very far so the annual cakes for my brother have ended but she still calls him every birthday meanwhile i can t remember the last time i had a birthday cake probably in the sixth grade most years i don t get a card
same my youngest brother shares my bday with a sizable gap my parents have forgotten my birthday multiple times well into my 40s and yet never fail to remind me that my little bro s bday is coming up it s gotten a little better the past few years i get text messages now but in my 30s and he in his teens it was much worse i bear him no ill will whatsoever totally not his fault and we re pretty tight
they will probably double down and say she is misremembering and exaggerating
my parents had more than enough money my siblings got more acknowledgement because my parents played favorites i overcompensate for my daughter because i don t want her to ever feel what i did for context my siblings got huge sweet s and graduations i got nothing but pizza
children feel loved when they re not treated as an afterthought which seemed to be the crux of op s issues with her own party as a child
they could have afforded letters on the cake for both girls
this was after my child s communion
whose day my daughters or my sisters
it was after the party op family decided to stay a little after the party was over
guests it was her siblings and parents all of whom were present for her childhood
the point wasnt just that things were over the top its that the party was based on the girl being celebrated not only based on one of two girls being celebrated
i made this post on my daughters ipad which used to be my little cousins she lives with me due to family trouble
this is not my reddit account babe
i overcompensate for my child i never ever want my daughter to think for one second she s forgotten how i how felt my entire childhood i think it also may be a situational thing huge communions are common where i m from kind of like sweet s you re right on that i will talk to them when i think i m ready this conversation brought back a lot of painful memories for me
i think you missed op s point here op wasn t miserable because they didn t get a big expensive party they were miserable because all their siblings were showered in love and attention while they were given leftovers and weren t the center of attention even in their own party the party in itself isn t the issue it s a reflection of the way op was treated by their parents their first years of life
i do plan as long as she is doing something productive and safe to support my daughter as long as she wishes as stated i consider myself a forgotten child for years so this was not an isolated incident
huh if op raises her the opposite of how her mother did then her daughter will still do what she did so everyone just turns into an adult who yells at their parents if that s your reality i m so sorry
i was not celebrated for my confirmation either
you may appreciate reading adult children of emotionally immature parents eta and watching patrick teahan s videos on youtube
something that might help rather than use emotional means to convey these feelings use a more clever and matter of fact way e g your daughter looks so much happier than you did well she d look different if she had my experience she likes her dress you didn t she got to pick out a new one i am not surprised when their neglect is calm fact rather than some emotion it s more effective and it stings more
yep all the siblings will corroborate that reality it wasn t that bad i had parties
that gives context it s something that they needed to hear i do think you need therapy to unpack things you re feeling and need to understand spoiling a kid isn t the only way to make them feel loved but i understand the gesture like parental guilt and over compensation can lead us down strange paths but yeah nta

bingo i feel my delivery was harsh but i didn t say she had to throw a lavish party like i did for my kid but maybe including my name on the cake and one kids activity would ve made me feel celebrated
obviously but i said i need more info is it a pattern of neglect or just a stand out fuck up why does she feel her entire childhood was miserable and her parents are terrible but she s still hanging with them i ve no idea why this is being downvoted reddit is so bizarre
my apologies i missed that i will amend my judgement i know people are saying you shouldn t have said that in front of your family but that s where she was saying it too
thank you yes this was after my daughter was asleep and other guests left
yes to clarify it was just my mom dad sisters and brother
https://old.reddit.com/r/family/comments/xyibk0/do_you_consider_this_neglect/ https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ustsy4/aita_for_being_distant_from_my_parents/ same communion confirmation story in other threads in your history come on
i overcompensate for my child this is not a good thing it doesn t take much for kids to feel loved and appreciated they don t need fancy things tons of gifts big parties or all the other stuff like this they just need love attention and validation and your daughter obviously has that overcompensating and giving her too much will create bad behavior entitlement and sometimes even children who end up mistreating others just love and enjoy your kid don t use her as an avatar to heal your own childhood trauma
you keep bringing this up and it kinda has me worried i know you want to give everything to your daughter that you didn t receive as a child that s a very wonderful thing you want to break the cycle of abuse just don t get caught in a different spiral what you are doing is unhealthy behavior and it s not just unhealthy for you it s unhealthy for your child no one wants to look a spoiled brat in the eyes once they re an adult and realize that they ve created a monster you don t need to give her everything you don t need to try harder and harder you ve already won the battle she loves you instead of spending crazy money on the party you can work on decorations with your daughter so they are more special or spend the money on picking out a nice dress with her spend time preparing with her you do not want to show her that her worth is the equivalent to dollar bills it s the inverse of the lesson your parents gave you growing up i highly highly recommend that you talk to a therapist about what you ve posted here because it appears as though you ve got some really deep seated abandonment issues i feel for that but your daughter can t always take the brunt of that behavior something has to give good luck op take care
most kids don t get this kind of party at all was my point just because op chose to make a big deal out of this doesn t mean he parents were wrong to not do that
then you re planning on doing a disservice to your child
not at all what i said
lol yea that made no sense to me either if i celebrate and support my daughter i hope she won t have the pent up anger i do for being looked over
lol we all like different things it did hurt seeing my mother go crazy planning perfect parties for my siblings but last minute remembering to order a pizza 6pm the night of my milestones
yeah i get that and honestly your delivery was fine the only issue i see could have been the timing but that s easy to say now not as easy to demonstrate in the moment i know
my childhood was terrible until fourteen they changed there ways around that age which is why i allow them a relationship with me and my kids
to be fair the mom wouldn t drop it
we have two completely different parents her mother and my mother are siblings would you like photos of my daughter and her party lol i m not deleting it for a reason
they didn t have a party for me period they claimed it would be combined but the party had teen activities i was and my name wasn t on anything maybe if my siblings didn t get a party i could understand my parents more but all of them did except me
idk if you re catholic but i don t know a single catholic kid who didn t have a party for a communion
it s a cultural thing here where i live it s very common for kids to get huge parties for their first communion i got one also my siblings and all my classmates got one literally everyone i know got one
i plan on supporting my child you re doing a bad job normal attitude
the issue was the timing mom literally opened the conversation with her fun little observation
because by you would have been one of the last kids in the house jesus nta by the way but you could have picked a better moment
good point lmao never really thought about it like that but that s likely the reason i suddenly began to matter to them def agree i could ve picked a better moment i just felt immaturely that if she s picking at me for being miserable in front of people might as well call her out in front of the same people

esh you really should have had a conversation with your family before a stranger showed up to sleep on the couch and intrude in their lives and person spaces you ve got six people living in this house now parents all too often treat their children like they re not allowed to even have an opinion on major things going on in their lives and that s going to be expressed as resentment your son s behavior though is not acceptable and your ex is both enabling his bad behavior and undermining your authority as a parent by letting your son flee punishment by going to his fathers house all of this is pretty predictable though and you really should have given thought to the other people in your house before you volunteered for the open ended couch guest
info did you talk to anyone in your family before making this decision
be careful op my mom did something similar and the girl ended up leaving drug paraphernalia in the bathroom my younger siblings could have found it or worse someone could have been poisoned because fentanyl is everywhere these days all of us were legitimately shocked too she was someone my mom hired at her real estate company broke up with her boyfriend who was abusive needed a place to stay for a bit to get on her feet she was young i think beautiful girl she looked sophisticated super smart great to talk to absolutely never in a million years would we have known if she didn t leave something out later on we found out the real reason they broke up was because she had started using drugs he caught her and stole from the boyfriend s mom she had also forged her moms checks so her mom wouldn t take her in i guess i m telling this rambling story because you never know her real backstory you met her at school you really don t know her at all just what she tells you be careful oh and put your son first
idk about this whole situation i feel like it won t end well for you you ll get blindsided by this in the end
info what does your son say about why he doesn t want her around i m on the fence here because i can t tell what your son s problem with this arrangement actually is if he s just being bratty and entitled about this then he s being an asshole but there is another possibility your son has had to adjust to his parents divorce to his mother s remarriage to two much younger young half siblings and now to a new indefinite houseguest it s very possible he feels lost in the shuffle and is acting out because he feels like he s losing his relationship with you if that s the case he s not being an asshole he s failing to adjust to a turbulent situation i don t think you were an asshole for attempting to help a friend in need and i think there is something to be said for teaching our children to be altruistic that said people have to be in the right frame of mind to be taught such lessons and his outbursts may indicate that he s not this is going to require greater expertise than you re likely to find on reddit to properly unpack and i think family therapy might be the best course of action if you discover that this is one adjustment beyond what he s ready to make you may need to figure out a new arrangement or give it new parameters or you will be the asshole
man love all the people acting like the year old is a grown man but the year old is a poor little girl who needs help yta it s clear your son has been struggling and you just don t care he already feels like an outsider in your new and improved family and now you replace him as an older brother with a new and improved older sister have fun posting here in years about how your son doesn t speak to you
how long has she lived with you and how long will she be there have you checked whether she is telling the truth or not does she still work for her family or has she got another job if she worked hrs a week for her family why would they throw her out when they would obviously have to employ someone else and pay them at least national minimum wage does she pay anything for her keep your son at is hormonal and probably feels uncomfortable to suddenly have a girl not much older than himself foisted on him he may feel unable to relax and be himself while she s around yta
i know you mean well but look at it from your son s perspective you had two new kids with your new husband he probably looked at that as your do over or new family and felt rejected now you bring home a teenage girl that you re crazy about and expect him to welcome her with open arms of course he resents this new person it looks like you re trying to replace him and you respond not by sitting down and talking to him but by punishing him and you wonder why he wants to go back to his dad s it s okay you ll still have amelia and your two daughters once your son stops talking to you yta
slight yta i don t think you needed to ask your son beforehand but you needed to discuss it with him this is his home and you changed it suddenly there should be conversations that include parameters of the change have you even discussed the parameters of her living situation with him how long will she be there what are her chores has she misplaced him in any way are you giving her attention that he would normally get this poor kid has a stranger living in his home and he knows nothing about the situation including when it will end do you frequently take the side of others over his
yta this decision affects the lives of your children and you don t seem to care about that also explain to me why your son needs to pick up the person who is living rent free trash
yta 1st of all you are getting scammed nobody gets a farking oil change instead of paying rent that s ridiculous 2nd your son is a year old boy she is a year old woman let s get that straight 3rd if you had a yr old daughter and she was upset that you brought a year old man home bc he needed help would this even be a discussion
should you have asked sons permission no but i do think you should have talked this over with your family before you offered amelia the guest room having another person live in the house does affect them too
yta she said these things you swallowed her stories hook line and sinker i ll tell you the that stands out the most as a poor person she chose to get her oil changed over rent lady oil changes are at the very bottom of a priority list when you are poor i ve got some beachfront property for you in arizona dirt cheap
you do realize that you are choosing to torpedo your relationship with your son for the sake of a random person you met at a college course right your son is no doubt already feeling neglected you have two toddlers and are attending college so there s no way he s getting much attention plus custody is clearly split so he s only there part of the time then you bring in a new person barely older than him yet another person competing for his mother s attention and punish him when he doesn t do things like clean her room if you don t fix this you re not going to have a relationship with your son at all so i hope amelia is worth it
it sounds like your son felt he was already being inconvenienced in some way and now you bring in another person maybe his needs aren t being met but you managed to help out a stranger
it s a yta from me mainly because of this sentence the problem is i have kids they didn t just rock up to your life and burden you you chose to have them and they are your responsibility first and foremost for the rest of your life it s obviously kind of you to want to help amelia but her needs have to come secondary to your children s at least while they are not yet old enough to live by themselves so this is their home while your son could express his upset differently more politely you have caused the problem and instead of addressing it with him or talking to him about it you re now punishing him for being upset you ideally should have asked upfront but there s nothing stopping you having this conversation with him now and working out a way forwards with him if you want him to react maturely you need to have a mature conversation with him you can still offer amelia support but it may not involve her staying with you it s your home and therefore ultimately your decision but you can t then decide how your kids will feel about it and it sounds like your son is feeling resentful better to mend that relationship now
info have you tried asking what about amelia specifically he objects to or apologizing for telling her she could stay without at least informing him ahead of time or asking the kids opinions
yta x200b you are such a very good person for doing this you are an amazing person you are generous and warm and kind x200b but this is the sort of thing that needs to be discussed with the rest of the household first you didn t need to ask his permission but a discussion beforehand should have happened about what to expect how long it would be what you expected etc
yta i don t understand all the comments about parents not needing to ask their kids about who can live in their homes do you not care that your son is uncomfortable in his own home your son has ever right to his feelings he s voiced his discomfort and you ignore him and keep choosing a stranger i get that you wanted to do something nice for amelia but you re doing it and the expense of your son don t be surprised if your son goes to live with his dad and chooses not to come home
from a person whose mother was constantly taking in strays with no regard for her kids or how it might affect them i completely understand where your son is coming from so yta
you should have at least discussed it with him and the others in your household i had a good friend stay with me what was supposed to be for months but turned into years because of covid there is an underlying stress in having someone else in your house make sure amelia isn t getting all your attention money son i know this is tough but if you were in a tough situation i would hope someone would take you in you don t need to be amelia s friend or do chores for her but you need to be civil and not change the channels when she is watching tv if you feel like she is always watching tv and you don t get a chance let me know and we will work something else if you feel like i am not spending enough time with you let me know but always keep in mind these two thoughts two thoughts first someone looking for money support will review their options from most convenient to least convenient when you re asked by someone in a hard position it may feel like you re the difference between their chance to succeed and their chance to fail but you re really just the next stop on the list there was an easier one before you and there will be a harder one after you second what appears to be a crisis is often the end of the illusion that things were working it s rare that someone is actually in a situation where they were ok before and they ll be ok after if they can just resolve one immediate issue sometimes there is a reason someone s family kicks them out sometimes the family arethe assh les you don t know yet keep an eye on amelia and make sure she isn t mooching off you listen to your son to see if he is seeing things you aren t
info how has housing this classmate affected bedrooms living quarters
sooo i was that girl once and i was taken in by a mom with kids at home plus another kid she had taken in i was she told me she would take me in but needed to speak to her kids first she didn t ask them for permission but she did speak to them before i arrived they had more than half an hour s notice i think i showed up on the weekend but i had that option i wasn t kicked out on the street they were told it would be temporary and one of them had to share a room with me they were allowed to not like it and if it was too much for them and i sucked i d have to find somewhere else to go she didn t want her kids to be unhappy but she also didn t want me to be homeless so she asked them to compromise with her for a little while luckily for us all it turned out pretty great i stayed for a few months until i found my own place if i understand correctly your son didn t have a heads up about the new house guest if that s the case soft yta yeah your son needs to be a little better but he s also a kid and suddenly has a stranger in his house obviously i don t know your kid and it s all keyboard psychology but from my experience he might be feeling pretty disrespected and like the stranger matters more than him also your houseguest can take out her own garbage i never let the kids do things for me i was invading their space and they were already sacrificing their space for me i helped clean the house took up as little space as possible and remembered to thank the kids for sharing that space and letting me crash for a while it s your house and you pay the bills but it s your son s home and his safe space one of them and you kinda introduced an unknown element to that
nta honestly the way the ex and the child are described it makes me think your son thinks he s man of the house and so he should get the final say i d ask him what he would want done for him if he were in amelia s position would he want to be out on the street you re a nice person and you did an amazing thing for someone in need
i m going with nta people need help from time to time we ve always made our kids aware that if one of their friends was in that kind of position we always have a bed and a warm meal available the same rule should apply to one of your friends too
nta whether you should have talked to him about her staying there or not your son is mistreating a human being who is struggling and one that he does not have an issue with he does need to be punished for that he s allowed to feel hurt and he s allowed to be angry with you but he is not allowed to treat another person poorly because of how he feels towards the decision you made
yta bringing a teen into your home is a risky proposition and not only does it add another person to your family which adds to overall bills in your home it s stresses the family dynamic and did you even validate what she claims have you ever met her family or have you just gone by whatever she s shared with you which obviously paints her as an all around victim of a harsh family your son either senses something is off with her or is uncomfortable around her for a reason situations like this never end well and that s if you will even be able to get her out of your home smoothly
congratulations you get a new daughter and your getting rid of the son you clearly never wanted your new family is almost complete
i m going with yta yes what your son is doing is wrong and your ex is enabling it but it really sounds like your son and amelia had never met before you invited her to live you it could be a week before she moves out or it could be be a year and your son has no frame of reference what did your husband think about this six people would be a squeeze for any house and your son didn t just have no say in it it sounds like he wasn t informed at all until she showed up and on top of having some rando encroaching on his personal space his chores have been expanded to cover this rando i honestly don t know anyone who d be ok with that i know i wouldn t be
yta would you adopt a child without making sure your kids are okay with it no so why are you taking in someone your child isn t okay with
your son doesn t like it and he may have valid reasons or not but by the sounds of it your stance on this means your relationship with your son is suffering how bad will you allow it to get for a girl a literal stranger are you willing to lose him over your need to be right seems silly to me but hey you do you because on the face of it you re nta and i don t think this is an instance where if you give in on this one thing means he will lord this over you there s something deeper going on here which sounds to me you re glossing over in your need to be right
your son already had to go through you adding people to his household presumably without his input he already has to live in two houses and may feel like neither is fully his home during the limited time he s living with his mom he has to share his mom s time attention and resources with a stepfather and two stepsisters as well as college sounds like he s adjusted to all of that reasonably well suddenly again without his input you re spending more time attention and resources on a stranger telling him it s his job to take out her trash and telling him she gets to decide what s watched on the family tv to me the amount he is acting out seems very reasonable considering what he probably sees as a disruption to his life and a threat to him that he did nothing to deserve try showing him some of the kindness and empathy you have for a stranger yta
yta
esh as a general rule it s good to consult with everyone who will be affected by a decision that will affect them you failed to do so and while i m sympathetic to the it s my house argument it s also your son s home and he s acting out his anger at not being included in such a major decision your son however has made his point and needs to take steps to make the best of the situation one possibility of course is for him to move back with his biological father permanently or until your guest has moved out
nta you don t need to ask your son for permission to help someone maybe put a password on the app or whatever so he can t just change the channel like that you also need to sit both your ex husband and son down and talk to them about being civil towards others and about accepting the consequences to their actions and how your ex husband needs to stop letting your son get away with shitty behaviour which would include running away to daddy anytime he gets punished over at your house
why would you expect your son to collect trash out of her room and then punish him when he refuses you should have discussed her with your family also get your son a therapist he s crying for help and you aren t listening i hope his dad is
even though your heart was in the right place yta for failing to consider how all of the members of your household would feel about a random stranger moving into their home for an undetermined period of time one s home is supposed to be a place where one can truly relax and that is impossible with a random person living there all of a sudden if a move out date were to be established it would be easier to get through i would strongly suggest establishing a cut off point by which time she will be out of your home meanwhile make a point to spend quality time with your son
yta you weren t the only one in the house before you should have had a conversation with him before letting her stay there not after all you did was ruin your relationship with your son for a stranger how long have you even known her long enough to trust her around yours kids
yta look one of my parents was a wonderful person but also had a save the world complex that often came at the detriment of his family he ended up divorced and dying estranged from most of his family but was beloved by his community for his kindness and help to others we pick and choose our priorities in this life and you picked your son last
your son feels neglected enough with the two half siblings and your husband but now also has to compete for your attention with a stranger you need to get this solved immediately because i assume your son is in the same boat i was in when i was like my mom never gave me much attention so i started getting in trouble at school and with the law just cause i knew it would get her attention even for seconds i don t know your son or how it was growing up but with the information i do know he probably feels neglected and when young kids feel that way they don t care about the things they do yta for not thinking about everyone in the household your son shouldn t feel this way in his own house
yta it s a great thing you are trying to help but amelia is not being honest nobody prioritizes an oil change over rent you are being scammed everything she told you about her family was likely a lie
from your son s pov possibly you prefer daughters he wasn t good enough so you went and found an older daughter instead of him she now lives with you full time while your son lies there part time she came out of nowhere but gets your full attention and affection while he is punished and is expected to just include her as a family member
yta not for taking her in but for how you did it
yta he s not the ultimate decider on this as it s your house but you ve introduced him to a freeloading person in his same age bracket who is now getting subsidized in the same way he is and who he has to clean up after expecting him to be fine about this is ridiculous
slight esh if only because a family dinner table type conversation should ve happened on the subject beforehand but jfc the amount of unsubstantiated reaching and assumptions going on in these comments
esh this is your son s home he shouldn t have to do chores for her she is a guest and at the very least should be cleaning up after herself it is unreasonable to expect your son to do this for a stranger however he should not be talking badly to amelia that is uncalled for
have to say yta you have a family you share a home with maybe check in before bringing home the masses from your classes btw does she take her turn at collecting the trash and other chores everyone else does
how long have you known amelia have you checked into her to make sure her story checks out what kind of work was she doing for her parents that she was working hours per week and still had time for class is it night classes or day classes how do you know her parents actually kicked her out these are things you need to know considering you ve moved her into your house with your family for an undetermined amount of time i m still going with yta your heart is in the right place but i don t think i d move a women that i don t know that well into my house with my husband and kids if i was on my own maybe i hope this doesn t backfire on you
yta you re trying to do right by a stranger which is admirable but you re doing it at the cost of your son which is not
yta you should have realized that this was going to be a delicate situation because your son is already unhappy about having to share his house with your husband and his two half siblings and now you ve added a fourth person he didn t want there you needed to talk to your son beforehand and you need to realize that your son is and him choosing to go live with his dad is an option he has at this point if you don t want him to go live at his dad s you re going to need to take his opinions under consideration more he s also kinda being a jerk but i don t think it quite gets into e s h territory because he s a teenager and you haven t really given him better options for expressing his opinions
nta your son is being obnoxious for no good reason i honestly don t understand this attitude people have that you need to bow to your children s whims if he had an actual objection that would be one thing but he s just being an ass newsflash it s your decision as the adult and provider who gets to stay under your roof
nta it sounds like your son is though he seems very petty and immature my parents took people in all the time it wasn t always convenient but overall it was cool to have the diversity and they helped a lot of people get back on their feet you are a great person for helping your classmate
i am not going to ask my years old about their opinion on hosting someone in need nta
yta you can t just bring it upon yourself to bring another teenager into your house without asking your kids
yta you are being suckered by a leech
ya ll are wild out here here s someone doing something incredibly kind for a year old girl and ya ll are saying op shouldn t have in order to protect idk even know what for a year old boy who doesn t even live in the house full time a year old who s safe fed clothed and housed as opposed to a who could have been sleeping in her car starving and facing a myriad of dangers that she could have encountered in the streets wild nta op
this is a tricky one you ve done a wonderful and kind thing for a young woman who was in a dangerous situation i can t judge you negatively for that your teens behaviour might have been bad either way but a talk when moving him in could have helped his behaviour is immature but he s young he s probably had a fair few changes in life what with divorced parents new step parents and new half siblings after being an only kid that doesn t excuse or justify him bullying her but might be part of the why and part of what you could bring up during a serious sit down talk ask him why he is so bothered by her being there and depending what he says will influence how this needs addressing long term
yta my mom did something similar to me while i was on a trip in high school i came back to a homeless girl who had taken over my room when i was i stayed with my sister for a few weeks until the girl was gone although she has her own space it s still nice to let them know the other person will be there and to set conditions boundaries if anyone is uncomfortable about it his resentment towards her you will probably just get worse from punishment to be honest since she s still there
yta partially because not even talking to him first is major asshole behaviour but mostly because you re insanely irresponsible you don t actually know anything for certain about this woman and you ve given her access to your tiny kids if she were a young man instead you d be getting torn apart here like you should be because for all you actually know she could have been kicked out because she s dangerous to the family s children
it was a light yta that turned heavy yta because you didn t make a game plan i d give my spouse the benefit of the doubt at the beginning if the circumstances are as you describe them it sounds like an emergency i d gladly give the girl a few hot meals and a day or two of rest before addressing everything with her you should ve discussed it with your spouse the moment the two of you were alone then the both of you should ve discussed with amelia to create a game plan for the long term after that you should ve talked to your children it wouldn t be abnormal to talk to amelia and ask what needs to be done for her present financial situation or household contribution if she has x y and z emergencies or things that require immediate attention then i wouldn t charge rent at that point but determine a reasonable amount for the future chore division and other things would be fair because she s becoming a member of the household you re allowed to help someone who needs it you re allowed to prevent your son from harming or being unnecessarily cruel to that person you re not allowed to just tell him the person stays there without having an open non judgmental discussion about it let him explain his issues talk to him about them and then determine how you treat it going forwards after that you d be allowed to overrule him if he s being unreasonable
yta your son has to come first he s acting out and like an ass but it s because you aren t listening to him and have chosen this random woman over his needs he doesn t feel like he can relax in his own house because you have brought a stranger in to live in the common areas he can t watch tv because that s now her bedroom he has to get dressed to walk around rather than being able to be relaxed in his own house you made his home feel less safe that s on you and you need to fix it asap the woman may be nice or she may be a grifter and i agree her story seems pretty sketchy but she s not your responsibility your son is unless you want him to end up on someone else s couch with a similar sob story in a few years get your priorities straight tell the woman she has a week to get her life figured out and leave she may have to take a few semesters off and focus on finding an stable apartment roommate and a full time job lots of us had to do that
yta for choosing to ruin your relationship with your child over a stranger it was nice of you to take her in but your kids should have always come first and now you re just reaping what you have sowed edit should be fine though since you already have the kids and now a third to keep replacing him
yta
nta while it s nice to get their feedback your children don t set the household rules you do there s a big difference in talking things out making sure concerns are heard and letting your son dictate the choices the fact that he is acting like this and seems to think he has the right to dictate this actually has me concerned you should be having a full conversation about it and not letting him just escape back to dad s concrete reasons why he s upset try to figure out how the source of his problem and anger about this and fix that i m not agreeing with others here that your children should get veto power yes they should be alerted but your job is to be the parent not run a house where the children have control letting them dictate things like this and run roughshod over you will not turn out well later
slightly different but similar situation here i can share with you my story which is from the child s perspective my mum did that to me when i was fresh out of high school i moved out at because of it it has since affected my life and saving goals and i went down a really dark path for a while there i barely spoke to my mum for a while cried constantly felt unloved hated my life and the shitty unit i was forced into i could barely afford to live as i was in an entry level job at the time plus studying meanwhile this girl remained in my home rent free getting everything given to her for about another year before she got knocked up and moved in with her baby daddy the girl was a friend of mine but by no means a close friend the girl was impossible to live with and my mum failed to set the same boundaries for her as she did for me because of her poor mental health she got special treatment gifts i d get home from work and they d be watching movies just the two of them like me and my mum used to do she d get christmas gifts too i was expected to maintain the standards i was raised with e g cleaning and chores but this girl was held to no standards and everything was done for her she left the house messy i was working full time and she was unemployed and still she did nothing all day and i had to do everything i felt i had no privacy i was comfortable in my family and then this girl around my age was thrown into the mix not to mention her room was across the hall from mine she was a total slob and yes she had a hard life but half of the people i know had it harder than she did and they wouldn t behave that way the final straw was her getting drunk and flooding our house by mistake my carpet was completely ruined and because her bedroom was on the upper hill side of the house it didn t get even slightly wet my parents didn t even get mad at her they were just really sad that their new floorboards were ruined my mum told me the friend paid the insurance amount but i honestly beleive that s total bull and my mum likely just said it because i was mad and kept asking if they were going to make her pay the damages and no my parents are not rich we are very middle class i ended up having to tell her to stop whinging and get up and fix what she has done because my parents failed to do so if i had done that i would ve been screamed at forced to pay clean up etc she just hid in her room my life was pretty messed up as a kid and i think my mum liked that this girl idolised her as the perfect mum that s my theory anyway they still keep in contact to this day and hang out and it makes me sick but the worst part though is that she didn t talk to me about it first she just invited her without talking to me about it and it infuriated me the only reason she came to our house is because i was the only friend she had with a driver s license and she asked me to pick her up i told her she can stay the night at our place next minute my mum is consoling her telling her she can stay for as long as she needs to and she certainly took us up on that offer it felt like my mum had chosen her over me and part of me will always be hurt by that no matter how old i get talk to your son before it s too late not that i spoke to my friend like he speaks to this girl but if he is being rude to her he clearly has feelings about it that you should talk through with him also make sure you re not making him feel like second choice because it hurts a lot
yta
yta for punishing him for having feelings nta for helping someone that really needs your help can you not have a conversation with him about her problems a non i ll listen with out being defensive conversation
nta helping someone if you can is a good thing to do you and your husband were in the same page the kids are tricky because he s obviously got some feelings about it maybe try spending one on one time with him to figure out what his concerns are about her being there has he done counseling with you or individually in the past
deleted
yta if your talking to him was motivated by correcting him rather than understanding or accommodating him then it s no wonder he prefers to go to his dad s your actions in themselves towards your classmate aren t unreasonable but you don t seem to have made any consideration of how they come across to your son he gets his one on one time on your terms and when you re available but he clearly doesn t have an open dialogue with you where he can express his concerns or criticisms of this new living arrangement with any expectation of having any of them addressed when i was your son s age my best friend tried pretty hard to move into my house because she had a truly shitty home situation and much as i loved her her presence in our home on a near constant basis changed the family s dynamic and made me feel very uncomfortable in ways i couldn t express and part of that was feeling like having spent most of my life being unfavourably compared with my younger sister there was now another person in the mix whom i felt was bound to enhance my parents impression of my own inadequacies as a human the glowing terms in which you describe your classmate compared to the frustration you re expressing towards your son make me suspect that he feels similarly in some way here even if that s not reflective of your true feelings towards the two teens in your home mercifully for me our home wasn t really big enough to accommodate an extra person at the time so it was a very short lived situation but having no fixed end date to it by far made the situation more stressful to me
am i the only one that thinks amelia might be cute and the son is immature and is into her that s literally the first thing i thought of when i saw the ages
esh we ve taken people in over the years my husband and i discussed it first and if agreed on it took it to my kids now grown it s their lives too they had full veto power and they were always happy to help out someone who needed help and their attitudes made our experiences very positive which gets me to your year old i m guessing that he feels like there is too much in his life over which he has no control what you describe in his behavior are efforts to control the situation in whatever way he can i wonder how lost he feels in the rest of his life too maybe that s the angle to try to tackle find out where he s feeling helpless and maybe find strategies that will help him have a greater sense of power for his own life and decisions behaviors good luck this is a tough one
nah he does live in the house so it would be courteous to at least let him know but you re not obligated to do so since it is your house
removed
nta for helping this poor girl i do think very slight yta because you didn t explain to your family what is happening and listening to your son s feelings at least give everyone a heads up saying that because the situation is what it is right now it would be a good time to explain to your son that you re not replacing him he must be feeling a certain way and you need to reassure him and explain that if he was in amelia s position would he not be grateful for someone else looking out for him it would be a good time to teach this boy empathy the way he is behaving is not ok but it could be that he is acting out and feels pushed out a bit of kindness openness and understanding would go a long way from everybody and reassurance from you to your son
wait you have to ask permission from your son i would assume you spoke to your husband first about taking someone in which if you did and he agreed he s the asshole for not backing you if you didn t you re the asshole for not talking with your family it was the right thing to do just not enough conversation about expectations
didn t know you had to get a child s permission to help someone lol nta
nta how your son is acting is not right and his dad is no better i think talking to him beforehand would have been ideal just so he didn t feel like this situation was sprung on him but his behavior is inappropriate especially for his age if his dad is amenable i think you should get him into therapy a teenager that age giving a guest the silent treatment and purposefully annoying and disrespecting her is not acceptable especially because he knows she s only staying with you all because of abuse at he is old enough to understand how dire her situation is and treat her like a human being it s your house and you have every right to help support this woman right now my best friend growing up was homeless on and off and it breaks my heart to see commenters calling you the ah for taking amelia in they clearly don t understand what it s like for a teenager to experience abuse and housing insecurity it sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her and i m very glad you re here for her
yta and your son s life sucks because he is surrounded by enabled slatterns
esh obviously you should have discussed this with your family before taking in a stranger also why should your son clean this person s room everyone can clean their own room he is acting out i think you are partly at fault
honestly people here are heartless man are they really giving you shit for taking in a homeless abused girl i wouldn t think twice about it i would like to think that i ll raise kids with enough empathy for other people nta at all
esh there should have been a conversation with the entire family about amelia moving in with you and husband making the final decision it sounds like your son has some unresolved issues and is acting out i hope you are able to find a way to discuss his feelings and help him work through whatever is bothering him that said his behavior is unacceptable and his father is doing him no favors by encouraging it you are very generous and your heart is in the right place unfortunately you didn t handle this in the best way which is understandable due to the initial urgency of amelia s situation there s still time to right the ship so to speak talk to your son perhaps get him counseling i have some sympathy for him it s overwhelming being a teenager and feeling like you have no control and no say over your life doesn t mean he gets to be a jerk
yta if you were the only one affected by your decision it would be different to subject your kids to a stranger is just bizarre
esh consulting other members of the household to make sure they re comfortable with moving a stranger into the home is important your son is being spiteful
nta you are the grown up you are teaching your son that there are times when you make big decisions to help someone in crisis and you don t always get to confer with everyone in the house that being said i wouldn t push him to get her trash or anything like that have her put her trash in the kitchen bin when it s full make boundaries for how they treat each other and have a meeting with both of them so they know i ve been that girl people like you are why i m still here
nta your son sounds like kind of a jerk tbh
you are his parent you ought to sit him down and explain the concept of compassion to him that is your responsibility you do not have to ask your y o child if it is okay to take a friend in who has fallen on hard times yes its extra person but he behaves as if he s paying all your bills and is frankly acting pretty disgusting as a human being and he is only age that s some edgy teen behavior and my mum used to cut my allowance for less than that nta but you would be if you don t at leadt attempt to raise him into a person who can at least act polite even if he doesn t mean it
nta does your son listen to jordan peterson or something trying to exert his alphaness smacks of immature crush behavior to me
edit nah you tried to do a good thing but you are getting punished by a grumpy teenager your husband is not your son s father but lives with him i don t know what he is thinking but you sound so kind so i imagine he is too i bet he s working hard every day to try and befriend your teenage son and really hears him when he has complaints and tries to accomadate him i suggest you loop back to your husband and come to an understanding together then talk with your son as a team about what is going on teenagers are pretty magical but also yoyo between being awesome and awful if you can rope your son in with what is going on then i imagine your problems will go away and you won t feel like the a anymore thanks for being such a good human
esh are you sure amelia is telling the truth why of all the people she knows is she asking a much older classmate which whom she shares two classes for help it sounds a little dodgy to me and i hope you have all the salient facts your son s behaviour is boorish but letting a stranger come stay in your house without discussing it with your family and also setting boundaries about how long the stranger can stay there is really odd i have to wonder if amelia realised you had poor boundaries and that s why she asked to come and live at your house seemingly forever ask her what her next step is where to from here you brought a stranger s sob story i m not i don t believe a word of it tbh she s manipulating and using you get her out of your home she can go to a woman s shelter she s a stranger you know nothing about in your home with access to your small children have you even asked to see her id or any proof of identity before you let her live in the same house as your small children
esh while your son s behavior is definitely rude you didn t exactly give him a heads up if this isn t typical behavior for him then it s likely caused him anxiety with a stranger in the house some people just don t like house guests in their space i don t like having guests often over night either because i feel the need to entertain and monitor myself constantly and that s exhausting so i can imagine he must feel similar
nta sixteen year olds can be dicks but his dad is the actual asshole for encouraging him
nta if you hadn t done what you did she may be homeless right now she is homeless right now tbf but she d be more homeless this wasn t something you planned and left him out of the loop on it was a decision that needed to be made quickly and frankly i don t think it s wrong to say he doesn t get to have veto power here i mean the people saying yta here what a your thought process tell amelia i d love to help you but my teenage son doesn t want me to give me a break unless amelia has some actual issue or behavior that would make this arrangement inappropriate he needs to be made to understand that sometimes you sacrifice comfort for the good of others he s he needs to learn that sooner rather than later
nta news alert he doesn t get a vote he s throwing a tantrum and his ahole behavior is not acceptable this teaches all the kids how to get their way since you tolerate it it boggles my mind that you do you and your husband decide who and how you help and this time it includes housing you are teaching your kids what compassion looks like create a plan and sit him down be direct on why you are doing this and ask him to share his opinions address the behaviors you will no longer accept sounds like he holds you hostage with returning to his dad s feel free to open the door set expectations and consequences best to you
info have you taken any steps to verify her claims of neglect from her family
yta your impulse and ability to help your classmate is generous and kind not presenting this to the family first didnt allow them to bring up concerns or boundaries they had your husband is absent from the story and seems to have no opinion your girls are too young to know any better and your son s concerns are still unheard and are turning into resentment this could have been avoided with communication
yta the problem is i have kids really that s the fucking problem here
nta if your husband is fine with it then that s all that matters
yta he clearly wants your attention

this post is a fantastic example of how reddit black and white thinking translates to real life
info did you ask your daughter why like why she feels that way or what she is feeling about it are you sure nothing else has happened
i m going against the grain here for sure what emily did was bullying but on a scale of bullying this is relatively minor in both scale and duration this wasn t an ongoing thing it happened for a very short period of time and was dealt with immediately with no push back from emily how many stories do we hear of bullies who either refuse to apologize or won t do it because they think they did nothing wrong i m not saying sam has to forgive emily as that is her choice but this is sam s cousin s girlfriend now who could one day be part of the extended family will emily be banned forever because sam chooses to not forgive and continues to harbour resentment nta
the edit
bring on the downvotes i m sorry i seriously don t understand all of the y t a at best i would say nah what happened was almost a decade ago and all the girl did was call her a traffic cone and told people she was color blind and this lasted a few weeks and was resolved and then she apologized and after that apologized again seriously what i m sorry but if you re daughter is still offended over being called a traffic cone for a few weeks when that girl was then there s clearly other issues she s gonna have to get over it because other family members will all host events and i can assure you that they will not care that a girl was a bully for a few weeks when she was nine years old
i think it was going to explode regardless of how you handled it
nah yet i mean at this point it s going to be super awkward to say he can t bring her now after they ve already made plans and this awkwardness is then going to spread into school if they re at the same school my adult kid is bff with someone that used to bully them in elem school some it made me mad back then but i have to realize they are little kids and they re learning how to act around a bunch of other kids so holding something against someone that young forever is a lot it obviously bothered emily enough that she again tried to make up years later i ll probably get downvoted to kingdom come because the word bully gets everyone heated but they were like years out of diapers i think you need to dig deeper with your daughter has something new happened what s her plan if her cousin dates emily for a long time or even marries her she needs to think about the long game here about family events and then go from there with your daughter s input
nta your daughter needs to learn to move on that s life the other child learned their lesson you know like they are supposed to and she grew into a human being sam has issues if she s holding onto something for years i didn t know children were supposed to be perfect and not do anything wrong at all ever and heaven forbid parents and school work together all the way around so the issue is addressed right away as there is a positive resolution again sam has issues yta bc of your update never come to reddit for common sense real world advice it won t work
this comment section is actually crazy it s been nine years nta
nta emily was nine years old when she bullied sam she gave an apology when prompted by the school and then gave another unprompted apology two years later now emily is important to sam s cousin it is ridiculous to punish emily for something she did when she was a literal child even given that it did hurt sam people completely change from the age of to the age of your daughter should be able to handle at least being near this person for a few hours
am i missing something here it seems that at the very end of the story op said that cousin was still mad at sam because of some things sam did soooo sam is expecting a pass for her behavior but she can t get past what emily did to her if i read that correctly then sam seems to be a bit of a hypocrite if i have that right then definitely nta
your update doesn t surprise me at all year olds blurt things out without thinking bright covid and mismatched clothes would have gotten lots of comments when i was in 3rd grade it also doesn t take much for many schools to intervene with just a meeting and an apology letter at that age it s a blip on the radar on the other hand a kid that likes to prank others is often considered a bully by her targets your story reads very much like your daughter held a grudge and learned the hard way that the actions of a year old aren t reflective of that person as an almost adult also that people like her bully and her cousin s recent behavior more than hers and you learned that of the feedback on this subreddit is given by children some of it is good advice some of it is bad most of it lacks maturity and nuance
she would make fun of sam s clothes and spread some rumors this was fourth grade after that they didn t interact much but emily was civil in sixth grade she gave another apology in the form of a letter wait why did a written apology appear out of nowhere two years after everything was shut down quickly
nta this is a pretty run of the mill children being mean thing the girl was punished and seemed to genuinely apologize for also it was ten years ago this is a part of growing up and if she cant develop any skills to cope with minor unpleasant situations shes going to suck as an adult
goon i m just here with my popcorn
so the choice was your daughter and a girl that bullied her so harshly that the school needed to intervene but according to you your daughter needs to get over it because this bully is now dating her cousin and apologized twice because according to you this makes it all oke now it s been years not really because it s been if you were my parent i would go no contact with you as soon as i could you sound heartless yta if you don t stand up for your kids then who will
this whole comment section is ta it s crazy to me how many people are here projecting their own trauma with bullying this is not severe by any means and an instance over years ago that they have truly tried to rectify does mean something sam is honestly ta for not even giving emily the chance to show how they feel bad now or make it up real life is existing with people who have hurt you not banning them from your existence it just doesn t work that way
i think something might have happened between sam and emily that so humiliated sam she couldn t bring herself to mention it so she just talked about smaller issues and the she swallowed forced apologies twice because she had to live with the lie she told and then she had to live with everybody telling her that emily was good now two weeks detention for making fun of clothing and then a second forced apology a year later something seems off there
y all are weird as hell this subreddit is too much to the op nta but i hope you learned ur lesson never to listen to idiots on reddit ever again
bullying does a number on a person s self esteem that can last for years sam doesn t want to face a person who bullied her and she shouldn t have to why is this so difficult for you to understand
nta and this is the only fucking sub that has comments more delusional then the posts
info be more specific about the bulling no school would give two weeks of detention for just making fun of clothes and spreading rumours the punishment doesn t fit that description what exactly did she do be specific
nta everyone had bullies and trauma and life moves on and people change and things get better reddit is full of bubble wrapped children
nta while the phrasing may seem harsh getting over it is a valuable and necessary life skill op isn t asking her daughter to forgive and spend time with an abuser the bullying she experienced was typical elementary school nonsense it barely qualifies as bullying this current trend of respecting everyone s trauma is turning normal life experiences and hardships into victimhood and giving kids unrealistic expectations for adulthood sam is going to have to deal with difficult and rude people in life there will be someone at her job who is a jerk she s either going to have to find a way to navigate these people or her only option is to take her toys and leave the sandbox the commenters who are saying that sam has a right to feel safe in her own home are not wrong but really what risk does emily present here the worst she could do is say hey remember when we were and i used to make fun of you for wearing bright clothes it doesn t really sound like emily is interested in doing that but if she does then sam needs to be a big girl and shut her down i can t imagine it will be that hard for sam to socialize with others and avoid emily for hours sometimes people do just need to get over it op could have delivered that message in a kinder more productive way so maybe slightly the ah for how she spoke to sam but i don t think op was an ah for her initial decision not to ban emily
well that came full karmic circle now her bit of a prankster daughter is the one not invited or forgiven for childhood actions
info have you asked your daughter if she is still being bullied because what you see is not always as it is
info can you describe what the bullying event s was were it s important to know what bullying really means here if emily did anything physical to your daughter in any way emily absolutely should not be at this party even if it s been years i also think that if there was anything sexual or gendered about it or racial or any other group based hatred like fatphobia it s probably not reasonable to have emily come if the bullying was less abusive there might be a number of reasonable pathways forward that allow emily to attend the event but still it depends on the nature of the bullying
jesus christ almighty this comment section not even passing judgement but some of y all could do with taking a step back from commenting if sam is so upset by three weeks of teasing years ago where the worst thing she was called was traffic cone she s gonna struggle in life on top of that in my opinion her former bully showed remorse for her actions and that was the end of that what the fuck do you guys want to happen for her cousin to break up with emily over this or something get some help jfc sincerely somebody who was physically and verbally bullied for two years of secondary high school
info has your child endured ongoing bullying throughout her childhood or did it end with the interventions initially taken i m sorry but they were nine year olds that is typical behavior for that age group by design they are looking to sort their place in their social group of course in a utopian world everyone would be kind and inclusive but that is not the world of nine year olds they are constantly forming and reforming friend groups at that age which is developmentally appropriate hurtful things were said addressed and apologized for multiple times it is maddening that bullying has been co opted to the point that every childhood transgression is a validation for ostracising anyone who ever made another person feel uncomfortable bullying is a real and prevalent concern and sometimes leads to incredibly unrecoverable outcomes painting a childhood squabble resulting in hurt feelings as a valid reason to forever exclude and or avoid a person diminishes the toll true bullying takes on actual victims
yta emily s apology no matter how sincere or how popular she has become eye roll does not magically erase the pain she caused your daughter it s understandable that sam would not want emily in her home which should be her safe space sam has moved on and has chosen not to engage with her former bully which is a valid choice
i m going to vote against the grain here from all accounts the bully grew up the level of bullying sounds pretty mild and short lived sam does not sound like she accepted either apology and i would be concerned if my kid was holding a ten year old grudge to the point where she was unable to go to an egg hunt where her 4th grade bully was present it s not exactly an activity that forces interaction if the cousin marries this kid possible although probably unlikely given ages what is the plan sam refuses to attend all events with the cousin should this kid not be allowed forgiveness should her unkind and unwise actions more half a lifetime ago dictate whether she is worthy to attend an egg hunt your daughter doesn t have to interact with the kid but to deliberately exclude emily based on this seems unkind especially to the cousin this reminds me of a situation in my own kid s 5th grade friend group one kid sierra was unkind to another bonnie sierra got in trouble after a couple of weeks she understood she was in the wrong and went to ask forgiveness bonnie was having none of it she ended up using this situation to basically force all the friends including my kid to pick sides sierra tried to make amends for years it was really uncomfortable to watch and by the end the resulting exclusion of sierra had far more serious effects on her than the initial unkindness bonnie to this day doesn t care and thinks the other kid deserved everything she got if your kid is at all like bonnie i would not consider enabling that attitude to be supportive you don t want to change the rules of who is allowed to come in order to allow your daughter to retaliate against her long ago bully nta
you ve only heard good things about emily since who are you hearing these things about emily from considering your daughters reaction to the thought of emily becoming part of the family event i really wonder if your daughter has been telling you good things about emily does your daughter still love wearing bright colors does she feel comfortable is she out going and popular or does she make choices that enable her to blend in so no one notices her i need more info
ouch just saw this and the second edit is cringe af sounds like sam was a bit of a bully to her cousins pot meet kettle
what happens if the cousin and the bully get married is sam just going to avoid family functions forever i hate that same was bullied and still feels the impact of this but that s no excuse to exclude her when the cousin has a relationship with her this also isn t an excuse to let it impact her forever it sounds like she needs professional help dealing with this emily tried to apologize and make amends plus it was almost a decade prior sam absolutely does not have to like or be friends with emily but it s rude af to not disinvite emily because of all of this i m sorry you went through a lot of trouble based on the advice from this and it caused chaos among your family the best thing would be to talk to your daughter let her know you re on her side validate her feelings and still explain why it would be wrong to disinvite emily
love your addendum in this post as a frequent browser of this subreddit i firmly believe no one should post on this subreddit reddit commenters will always go the way of the most drama and conflict possible nta by the way it s been years your daughter doesn t have to like her but if she s genuinely been nothing but cordial since then she shouldn t have bad behaviour from the fourth grade hung over her head forever
being bullied is fucking traumatic and you re allowing your daughter s trigger to show up at a family event yta
yta if your daughter is uncomfortable with someone being in her space as her parent it is your responsibility to make sure she is listened to a lot of the information you ve presented is things you ve heard not things you know to be empirically true it s also not your place to forgive emily seeing as you weren t the one being bullied sam will always be your daughter emily may not always be your daughter s cousin s girlfriend
wow my daughters bully or my actual daughter tough chose i see yta you wrote this and tried to downplay the whole thing you also seem to be like those people that have that one uncle and instead of keeping your family safe you would just make them cover up or you care more about what people will say than your own children if it s been years and she feels this strongly that means there s more to it but you obviously don t want to see it enjoy your easter holiday with your daughters bully i m sure we will later see a post about why did my kid go no contact with me
yta she doesn t want her bully at the event if only she d said this to someone who cared about her the rest of the family really thinks its time to move past this that s easy to say because it didn t happen to them and they don t care about your daughter either
after the edits op is trying to downplay this even more everyone on this sub knows how kids will pull pranks but it s just bullying and the parents enable it op is one of them she mentioned that sam pulled pranks when they were kids this definitely means that sam was also a bully if you look at it then sam is just as bad as emily when they were younger so if emily isn t invited sam shouldn t be either and it doesn t seem like sam apologized for her pranks as a kid op you re an enabler and an ah
this whole situation makes no sense something is wrong with your daughter or you re not getting the whole story
you poor person she was not being bullied you listened to this mob and now everything is worse nta but the commenters are fyi there is a difference between bullying and being rude disrespectful
this sub is really making me rethink the classics i always felt the montague and capulet parents were dicks for not being able to put aside their petty blood feud from eons ago resulting in the suicide of their children but hey maybe monty really told cap he must be color blind wearing all those neon ass clothes walking around verona looking like a traffic cone aw hell no monty you done crossed a line feud fully justified f ck them kids
sorry your family imploded but you never told us all the information based on the info provided
the fact that you think you know for certain that emily is a good person now your daughter isn t currently being bullied and an elementary school apology is sincere is fucking hysterical she bullied your daughter so badly that the school intervened i d bet you she has trauma and you re dismissing it and flying off to reddit for validation you said sam is i d enjoy the last year you have while she s still legally obligated to talk to you yta
the school did the right steps and emily left her alone emily had to give an apology in sixth grade she gave another apology in the form of a letter she went on to be one of the popular kids in school and i never heard of a problem with her since only good things since sounds like emily learned the lesson and hides her bullying better there are abusive people who manage to have a nice public persona yta your daughter should feel safe in her home she is not an adult yet she cannot leave
we are in a social group with the parents of my daughter s bully the parents are not invited to events at our house home is my daughters safe space yta
i was bullied as an adult the sun will freeze over before i would want to be in the same room with them again no i don t need therapy it s perfectly healthy to avoid someone who made your life hell enough was enough anyone who would want to subject someone to their bully needs therapy
op you just learned the hard way that the aita hivemind is just as often incredibly destructive as it is helpful if not more so nta until you followed this lot s advice
nta but this sub is full of people who want to punish anyone they think they can it was teasing years ago and you just blew a family up over it because some of you can t get over your own minor trauma
yta it s good for your daughter to learn now that you re literally choosing her childhood bully over her she will always remember this what is wrong with you
yta bullying aside you re literally ready to choose your nephew s girlfriend over your own daughter why what are you hoping to do all this will accomplish is alienate your daughter from you and cause a massive rift among the whole family also while i believe it s possible emily may have truly become remorseful and learned from her bad behavior as a younger child you do realize that her perceived apologies and civility or even kindness can all be an act right she could still be a passive aggressive bully to your daughter you re also really discounting how horrible it must have been for sam to have school be such a nightmare for her for what was weeks or months of her life which at that age is a huge chunk of it why should she have to get over that she is still a kid and she deserves to not have to welcome this girl who ruined a year or poss more of her young life to a family holiday party if you welcome emily to this party you are almost certainly going to permanently damage your relationship with your daughter
nta looks like your daughter was a bully too to her cousins and got what she deserved if she can t let go of her decade long grudge even after appropriate punishment of the bully and multiple apologies then cousin has every right to hold grudges of his own and that too without any apology from your daughter
yta how are you so confident shes been nothing but nice
based on your edit your daughters pranks could ve been perceived as bullying as well and if no one knew this knowledge you did so you should ve gone with your gut and told your daughter to let it go someone talking about your clothes is definitely not as bad as someone playing an unwarranted prank
yta you don t have to be friends with someone who treated you like shit in the past even if they sincerely apologize
anyone who said yta i m going to assume doesn t actually talk to people in real life or are incredibly incredibly small being a parent doesn t mean protecting your kid above all else sometimes you have to explain how the world works op i m super sorry that you listened to the jabronis who said yta your initial instincts were correct and you seem like a level headed good mom
yta for not continuing to stand with your daughter and for not getting her into therapy the school took measures but did you how have you actually helped your daughter do you really want to hurt your relationship with your daughter over this
nta op but your daughter really needs therapy to hang onto something that happened in 4th grade this long is not healthy and now that you talked to the cousin who brought up all your daughter s pranks as a kid which now may be bullying the event had been moved to your sister s house and your daughter banned she s going to need it even more
nta emily atoned early on for the bullying sam is being a brat it is sad to see you daughter playing a victim for ever she may never be much in life but a victim especially when things got quickly nipped in the bud and atoned for how sad good luck you re a good mother
lol sorry op you listened to some random reddit opinion nta for no spam
she really grew out of being a bully and overall decent person she went on to be one of the popular kids in school doubtful she grew out of it she just hid it better as she grew up i never heard of a problem with her since you never heard of a problem since is the key here the fact your daughter doesn t want her there should say more than enough about how bad the events truly were for her and you should accept that
yta no matter how many apologies you never get over being bullied you might compartmentilize it but the feeling you had going through it are real and raw dont tell her or anyone else to get over it you never went thru it you have no idea how she feels
the only thing that makes me torn here is the difficulty surrounding talking to the cousin about this but on balance i think you have more of an obligation to your daughter than to this cousin so i have to go with yta and telling someone that they need to get over bullying is one of the least productive things you can do
if i were your husband i would take both your daughters out to a nice lunch while your oh so much important guests are there what cousins this age even want to go on a easter egg hunt i am betting emily is still a bully just discrete about it and is getting her jollies about coming and torturing your poor daughter just by taking over her house
yta you just lost whatever trust your daughter had in you you didn t have her back you told her to get over it you might think she s being childish for not letting it go but for her it was traumatic and you violated her safe space by inviting her bully when your daughter leaves at you can just get over it way to have your daughter s back you re a shit mother
yta so what if you and the rest of the family think she needs to get over it clearly she s not it was her experience not yours if or when she gets over it it will be in her time no one else s
nta you said your daughter received a forced apology and a more thoughtful and that this girl is trying to be a better person seeing all the y t a makes me sad i don t know why we do not teach forgiveness in the world today they don t have to be friends but your daughter should be able to co exist with her
yta you have no right to tell anyone to get over their trauma and tolerate the presence of the person who caused the trauma especially in their home where they are supposed to feel safe just because it s been years doesn t matter the girl may gave offered an apology and tried being nicer to your daughter but that doesn t mean your daughter has to accept the apology or make nice with her as her father you should be someone she can count on to protect her physically and or emotionally but instead you ve discounted her feelings and from her perspective sided with her bully
no one is gonna show up to the event at my house its happening at my sister everyone is invited but sam so the whole family is full of bullies you are better off with some distance if that is how they react to a non family member being asked to not come
i was not sure but after seeing your edit yta you are blaming reddit for your family exploding lol of course you are not to blame of course
when i was a kid a friend of mine made a joke about my brother i told her no one was allowed to make fun of my brothers but me she apologized to us both my brother and i laughed about it later in front of my mom my mom has never forgiven that woman and we are now good parents are protective of their kids great parents may forgive but never forget you re neither but yta
nta although not sure if you will see this i feel like i understand sam as i am very socially anxious and would feel shy and awkward with emily there however feeling awkward doesn t mean emily shouldn t be there based on what you said sam should ve definitely forgiven emily by now unless we are missing details like someone else said sam should seek therapy if possible for some reason she won t forgive emily whether she s holding a grudge for dramatic effect or she still really feels hurt neither should be the case
it would be one thing to not invite emily if she was still a bully however emily stopped was punished apologized and later wrote another apology letter maybe your daughter need s some counseling to let this chapter of her life go so she can move on
yta regarding family explosion update in hours really you expect us to believe a loving family exploded in hours because of reddit advice really this is either fake or you have the most unhealthy and toxic family and you re acting like reddit users are to blame just wow
yta you re betraying your daughter she s your daughter and this isn t an unreasonable request if she dates the cousin for some time and it gets serious then facilitating a conversation to mend things would be something that is needed a teenage romance which likely won t work in the long run is not worth hurting your daughter i can appreciate that you see growth in emily and i do agree that making mistakes at shouldn t follow her forever however it s not up to anyone else but your daughter if she s comfortable around her if you choose to make your daughter uncomfortable in her own home i don t think anything that is posted in this thread will have an effect you think you daughter is ta but i can almost guarantee the objective views on here will say it is you
yta tell the cousin to leave his gf home or give up on your relationship with your daugher
lol i still cannot stand the sighr of my bully and if one of my family members even considered dating her i would never talk to them or her again i am when someone makes it their life s mission to make you miserable you never forgive and forget you just try to move on and never think of them again yta
yta you weren t the one bullied by emily so you don t get to tell her to get over it people process things differently and you will never truly know the impact emily bullying had on sam unless she tells you also her home is supposed to be her safe space and as her parent i would hope you would have your daughters back over some girl her cousin is dating emily will remember that you didn t have her back in situation
u were right sam was wrong
wowzers you aren t going to get mom of the year any time soon yta
oh man you down played emily s bullying so bad and told your daughter to get over it wtf yta makes me wonder if you were a bully for not respecting your daughter s boundaries and forcing her to play nice with emily my daughter was severely bullied in school and while everyone made amends they stayed out of each other s paths as they got older
can t imagine lacking the spine to defend my own kid yta
yta pro tip it s best to side with your daughter instead of some random girl your nephew is going to date for maybe three months
yta
nta wish you didn t come to this subreddit people are fucking weird and are ripping you apart for no reason
yta you clearly prefer this bully to your own daughter which is truly awful
yta you don t get to forgive emily on behalf of your daughter
why are you choosing your daughter s bully over your daughter
i was also bullied when i was i still get anxiety when i see my bully and i m in my mid 30s now yta
nta and thank you for putting the age corresponding to the grade it really helps the non american reditors
reddit is right on this one the daxt that you can t give specifics make we wonder if you understand the gravity of the situation trust that you did the right thing by your daughter and that she knows you have her back now i was bullied in elementary school too and i m almost and still want nothing to do with those people i left my own baby shower when my mother invited somebody who did things she said i should be over too my kids don t know my mother because of stuff like that everybody else should be a distant second to your kids in my opinion
nta what emily did was not nice but i would barely call it bullying as it lasted so shortly and was not super harsh after all this time and she also apologizing two times and having clearly changed allowing her to come would be okay though it seems it is too late now and sam s own childish stupid actions backfired it sounds like the cousins made a good point that your daughter shouldn t have judged someone else so harshly if she acted as a child crap herself to other children
haven t read yet yta edited i ve read you and your family are ta and you re a terrible parent since when does the family get to decide when a different person has to get over emotional bullying
yta you are a major asshole for get over it comment alone it is sam not you or emily that will decide when and if emily is to be forgiven also you are fabulously optimistic at your ability to observe emily s behavior just because you don t see emily do crap doesn t mean that she stopped she may as well have got smart enough to hide it better
yta bullying runs deep i am sorry you do not support your daughter
yta your daughter doesn t feel safe in her own home w her bully coming in wtf is wrong with you that you want your daughter to have to see her bully in her safe place in her own home
yta my parents did something like this to me and i have never forgiven them for it it was concrete proof that they cared more about their social life and public faces than me
yta plain and simple trying to write off the trauma for the popular girl

nta what would he do if someone s dog slipped through their collar and went after your baby what would he do if a little kid was running and knocked over the stroller what would he do if someone saw an unattended baby and called the authorities because they don t know who the guardian is what would he do if someone took the child there are so many ways this could be harmful or deadly to the baby it s irresponsible and it doesn t matter how fast he can run he couldn t outrun any of those scenarios in any capacity that matters if he can t understand the gravity of this then i couldn t trust him to watch the baby by himself especially not with his passive aggressive i ll never tell you that i m going to do that again
nta i d like to point out that if a good samaritan called the police because they found an abandoned baby your husband could be charged with child endangerment or abandonment which could open a whole criminal and or cps case
nta my parenting attitude is hard core free range i m a helicopter free zone yet this scenario freaks me out anything can happen in an instant to a year old
nta that seems wildly irresponsible what if someone just walked off with her strapped into a stroller he can t watch her responsibly until you get home
nta this is dangerous dude needs to invest in a jogging stroller if he wants to do this i don t care how fast he runs we live in a messed up world and anyone could swoop in and grab her and maybe be a faster runner than him
i d be rethinking him being my fiance how could you ever trust him again if his response is not to tell you in the future nta
he responded ill never tell you that im going to do that again that right there would make him an ex nta
nta this isn t okay infants can have needs happen quickly and if he cannot reschedule his run he shouldn t have had sex babies are babies they re vulnerable and while he is faffing around can t go help i m having baby s first anaphylaxis or help some psycho is kidnapping me he needs to understand that these fears are not nebulous but real dangers as the child of neglectful parents this is also a concern what else does he dismiss that is a real and present danger and will he need to see it in action i also have been kidnapped and survived human trafficking so i am indeed worst case scenario minded because of the fact there are people who do bad things and my examples from life are those and good things
nta he s an idiot
nta the safety of your child is way more important than his feelings it takes only a second for a child to be snatched up children should never be left unattended i ve read heard of way too many stories where situations like this did not turn out well if he really can t wait until you or someone else can watch the child then he needs a running stroller if that is financially feasible
if he does this repeatedly all an abductor would need is someone to make a commotion in the other direction and your baby would be snatched and hubby wouldn t have seen anything this is super scary
he doesn t need to run a track to get a mile in there are other ways he can do it without compromising the safety of a baby the risk outweighs his exercise preference not coolio nta
nta and you shouldn t even have to explain why someone could have snatched her up and have her gone so easily high schoolers and old people aren t automatically all harmless it s such basic common sense not to leave a baby alone under a tree he s being a major asshole and extremely naive i m so sorry he put your daughter in danger like that
nta my blood would boil
this question and the responses drive home how american this sub is
he abandoned your child to go run massive red flag dump and move on nta
nta there s a lot that could happen in the time it would take him to reach the stroller from the other side of the track many potential hazards only take a couple of seconds to occur
nta and as a cps investigator i would absolutely indicate him if this report was handed to me and y all would be getting an open case with services focusing on parenting education for him this is considered blatant disregard of his parental responsibilities and if anything happened to the child under those circumstances he would be held criminally liable in my area can t speak for everywhere i would not let him be alone with the child until he understands the danger in leaving her alone like that this is definitely a hill to die on
nta the bigger problem here is your fianc refusing to listen to or respect your valid safety concerns he just told you to your face that he will lie to you in the future regarding your child s safety i honestly wouldn t let this go
as a runner and sahm i get the need to go for a run but having a baby to worry about i m not saying what he did was okay as it s not a good situation but get the man a jogging stroller there are plenty on offerup facebook marketplace what not that s the safest option and you won t have to worry
clarification are you both american if so nta but if not then i may lean towards n a h i know this can be considered fine in other cultures but in america it is definitely something i would be worried about that being said if he has other parents that also like to run could he next time just coordinate with a group and maybe have people stay with the babies while others run and swap
i don t personally think her taking a nap in a clearly visible shaded area while he runs around a track is a big deal at least where i live you could be at a place like that the whole day and no one else would show up and he s close enough to see her the entire run and hear any cries but this part is absolutely a problem he responded ill never tell you that im going to do that again he is flat out saying that he s going to disregard your opinion in the future and just lie to you about it wtf
you arnt the asshole however i m unsure what the proximity of unhoused folk have to do with your child s safety i can think of few things homeless people want or need less than an infant
last baby snatching i heard about from a news sight was a year old who grabbed a toddler when the toddler s minder looked away for a split minute 15yo was not a known person to the family either it s nice to have trust that the bulk of strangers are decent people but it needs to be balanced with common sense i can run fast if something happens is not common sense
nta and why did you ever have a kid with this guy
is his family from denmark
nta i only had to read the title to know you re nta are you kidding me he actually doesn t see the harm in it honestly i m so shocked i don t even know what to say i really don t but you re nta in any way shape or form
nta he literally endangered your baby by doing that there are so many things that couldve happened and it wouldve been his fault if he cant properly watch your child while doing something then he shouldnt be doing that thing while watching your child
nta and he probably thinks it s okay to leave her in the car if he just needs to go in a store for a couple of things
nta as a mother i had a mini anxiety attack reading this
nta your fianc is irresponsible and selfish
nta let your fiance read these comments he s an idiot
nta aside from there being sickos out there that attempt to grab children in stores with their parents there holding them there s also just general life being life that he s not factoring in a bee could sting her a dog could get loose a squirrel could drop down a leaf falls on her while she s yawning and she chokes on it there s a reason you don t leave babies unattended outside of being in cribs sleeping for long periods because they are incapable of taking care of themselves and rely solely on able human adults people maybe you need to sit him down and show him some youtube videos of shitty scary things that happen to babies so he can understand where you re coming from no nothing happened to her that time but ignoring it like that is the same as someone who drinks and drives going i can drive when i m drunk i haven t gotten in an accident yet yet is the keyword and i promise you neither of you will forgive him if anything happens to her anything
nta and him choosing a hill like this is terrifying game changing
nta it takes seconds for something to happen this is incredibly irresponsible this would be the last time he took her to the track
nta he abandoned your baby for a run buy a treadmill
nta tell him it s a jogging stroller or nothing he doesn t get to endanger your child like that if i saw an unattended baby i d call immediately
disregarding all the other valid points about what could go wrong in second making a habit of leaving something valuable like your literal child unattended in a public place is a terrible idea the fact that he thinks everything was fine so i ll keep doing it is worse still crime is a matter of motivation and opportunity plenty of people are motivated to snatch babies often for the most nefarious of reasons but might not act on an impulse now have that person watch your fianc leave your baby unattended while he runs on a track on a regular basis that opportunity is golden not to mention unless he put your child in the middle of the time he will be running with his back turned in the most predictable pattern ever nta and don t for a moment let him bs you into thinking otherwise
nta wtf that s how kids get kidnapped
nta what a nasty thing for him to say i ll never tell you that im going to do that again he just announced that you cannot trust him to discuss parenting decisions with you honestly or to talk it out that s absolutely terrible
nta children disappear so quickly on their own accord but imagine how fast a stranger in a coat could walk off with your kid my cousin was at walmart with her kiddos 2yo 14mo a passerby picked up the 14mo the store was locked down and she 14mo was found drugged head shaved and totally different clothes in the men s bathroom bc her mom called for help asap that s how quick you lose your child the fear is real and low life s will snatch your child in a blink trash the man and keep the kiddo good luck to you
nta the i won t tell you would have me leaving and i ve been married for years so i m not one to suggest divorce lightly the idea of someone putting my kid at risk and then saying yeah i m going to keep doing it and just not tell you nope i m gone trust is broken
most definitely nta my ex left my year old in the car twice so about years ago now once to go into walmart market and the other to go into someone s house he was in the house long enough that she got out and knocked on the door i might add she has severe anxiety i flipped out on him he told me i was over reacting and that everyone he talked to about it agreed that he didn t do anything wrong i told him i gave shits about what they thought if he ever did it again he would never take her anywhere alone again kids go missing daily and that s just asking for it to happen so you are most definitely nta
like how fast is he unless he could beat usain bolt in his prime he s not fast enough to save his kid from a kidnapper with a good getaway plan in place nta
nta in the uk there was a huge case over here with a kid called jamie bulger two other children year olds took him from a shop tortured him and left him on a railway track where his body was found the cctv shows his mother took her eyes off him for a second the case is still talked about constantly over here your husband s argument that the only people around were kids and elderly people isn t any justification that it s safe high school kids and elderly people can be all kinds of evil on the flip side if i found an unattended baby in a stroller then that would be an immediate phone call to the police and in the uk at least that would result in some hefty social services involvement if they discovered the child was left in purpose for a hobby
nah if it s a an outdoor circle track which is on average miles wouldn t he be about miles away from her at any given point to me that isn t very far and close enough to cut the track to get close to her fast i m assuming if the track is closed in he could see anyone seedy and run straight towards the kid i can see why you re worried but if he is doing everything he is saying i feel like he did all that research and care because he feels he needs the run does he get free time to run at other times can you go with him to see what he can and can not see did he think you would genuinely be okay with it or was it an ask for forgiveness later situation being a mom and dad for a one year old has to be brutal and i hope you two get through this
yta i get that you are scared but its just a school track she s in a fence he was always watching her not a lot of danger very unlikely that a predator is stalking a school track to steal a year old i really don t understand why a lot in the comments are thinking this is prevalent you can voice your concerns to him and i do get why you d be worried but you can t tell him not to do something that is very likely to cause no harm
nta i can see his point that he feels it s safe but unfortunately it s often not the case buying a jogger stroller is the best plan
nta when i was a baby someone literally took my stroller from my moms hands and started walking away with it it can happen to anyone at anytime and any place the best you can do is take as many precautions as possible
i m assuming this is in the us and not one of those countries where they leave their kids outside in strollers while the parents have coffee and pastries and the like this is very dangerous in the us many scenarios have been given i ll give another my old roommate and i used to live across the street from a track used by a local college she worked at the college but at a different campus a good blocks away or so from the track a security guard at work came up to her one day and told her she looked good running turns out there were cameras up at the track and they were watched she specifically was watched if your fiance does this regularly someone can figure out his patterns real quick and take that kid should they so desire really easily wait until he s the farthest away distract him woosh bye bye baby
nta and i doubt the police and cps would agree with his rationale
nta and him buckling down at telling you he just won t tell you that he s doing it is awful awful behavior
i d be asking him to imagine how he d explain his actions to the cops if someone took the baby nta of course
nta we never left a baby or a child alone in a public space sadly there are bad people everywhere and accidents can arrive too i mean what if there is a creep close to the school and he took the baby or anything else he can t see everything it s impossible and if something happens he s never gonna be able to forgave himself sorry if my english is incorrect
nta this is neglectful
nta oh my dear lord there s never and excuse to leave a baby alone for any reason
nta send him articles on human trafficking maybe he ll get it then
near a school predator hunting ground predators don t have age ranges literally any age and gender could be one and near a walking path where anyone could have come off of those are big risk factors it would have taken seconds for someone to walk off with the baby im surprised no one checked the stroller and called the cops not to mention off leash dogs and possible sudden medical issues like her stopping breathing or getting knocked over he put her in danger and he is not a safe person to leave her with at all because he doesn t get all the possible dangerous things that could have happened
nta i d contact every parenting agency the police child services protection whatever exists in your country and ask for literature about children s safety tell them what he did and ask for any materials or tips they have to to convince him why that behavior is unacceptable if you can t convince him that he is in the wrong don t allow him to take the child out without you another relative or a hired father s helper if you have to it may be heavy handed but the alternative could be a funeral for your child in the not too distant future when a stray dog attacks or a someone decides they want a kid or even a stoller and take off with your daughter good luck op
waiting for non americans to pipe in nordic parents leave children outside to sleep in winter and japanese years olds ride the subway alone he s nta a track is flat he can see
esh this is a clash of parenting styles he thinks it is safe and op doesn t it is impossible to tell if op is being over anxious and exaggerating the danger or if the husband is being irresponsible or the truth is in the middle and you just have different levels of comfort what is pretty clear though is you are both determined to be right instead of just saying the baby is fine but op is not comfortable with this lets find a new solution that you are both happy with and the obvious solution is to buy a jogging stroller asap check the local classifieds facebook pages etc for second hand jogging strollers if you can t afford a new one
just get him a jogging stroller and you won t have to have this argument again
nta he left your child to get mauled kidnapped a tree limb could have fallen on her his daughter should be more important than a jog
nta
nta this is not a normal thing to do in na actually is apparently super normal in finland i think leaving a kid unattended is risking them to be abducted
nta at least the infant traffickers didn t find her yet
nta he is a very irresponsible parent so much could have gone wrong
nah only want to offer the perspective that your husband might be feeling that his competence as a parent is being questioned and that doesn t feel good i don t have kids so don t really get an opinion on what the right thing is but i see your hubby s logic and how he would think it s an acceptable risk level fwiw i also just read a headline on kids being safer than ever anyway obviously you two need to get on the same page as to what you re both okay with but i think his response might be driven by feeling like you think you re a better parent than him which probably feels icky
esh it s common in scandinavian countries to leave babies outside of restaurants and shops to nap parents bring in baby monitors with them to hear if the baby wakes up north america has an unwarranted paranoia around kidnapping that being said your husband saying he s going to keep doing it and just not tell you is a complete dick move you guys need to co parent out of a place of trust and he completely obliterated that you guys need to have a larger conversation about how you are going to resolve important parenting decisions or you will just keep having this fight over and over again
nta
yta he s her parent too and he gets to make his own risk assessments parents need exercise and he was doing his best he was close and was watching her if you keep micromanaging his parenting maybe he ll leave and i can guarantee you on his parenting time he has every right to parent how he sees fit
it was a mile run on a track so he probably went around it times you can walk a mile in minutes so if he was running or jogging we re talking about less time than that the track was fenced in he was watching the stroller i personally wouldn t leave the baby in that situation because i overthink everything and and err on the side of better safe than sorry but i don t think the baby was in danger if i were at the track and saw this happening i wouldn t feel like i needed to call the police or anything like that if i was you i d prefer he not do it but it sounds like he did put some thought into it that being said his reaction to you was terrible you need to come up with a solution that both of you are comfortable with not don t ask don t tell so i m going with esh but he sucks more
yta not all homeless people are criminals thinking they are waiting in the bushes to kidnap your child makes you an asshole

buy a bob
nta he should get a higher if he wants to run with the baby
nta
info is this a long track and the baby was left alone or are we talking like a track around the football field he s doing laps on
it only takes a second for him to look away and someone to snatch your child your husband is delusional i mean your fiance is just out of his mind thinking that nothing could happen to your child your child could choke roll over someone could bump into the stroller hundreds of things could happen while your fiance is away from that stroller i would never ever trust your fiance alone with your child ever again nta
nta if he is really into running why not pick up a jogging stroller off craigslist from your last sentence with his response can you trust him not to do that again it s like a childish threat i ve seen in person someone try to take a baby out of a stroller while the mother was sitting with the baby the person was homeless and probably mentally ill but they did it with the mom attending to the baby is he running and watch the tree the whole time it only takes seconds
she was in his sight the whole time like in a fenced in area where he could watch her while running yeah he s probably not got eyes on her every second but neither is someone waiting for the seconds he looks away that s fine what s less fine is i ll never tell you that i m going to do that again that s a shitty thing to say loses all trust there was going to say n a h until that line instead nta
that s why i had a treadmill at home when my kids were little easy to get that run in once i know they re safe in their bassinet or playpen and i can keep eyes on them nta
info is that considered normal in the area you live i ask because where i come from it s absolutely not normal however when i lived in finland i ve learned that is normal to leave babies asleep in their strollers outside their homes even in cold weather if you don t believe me read here https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21537988
y t a for not ordering him to never do that again even if he s running a six minute mile on a mile track that s still seconds or more that he doesn t have the stroller ins sight which is more than long enough for someone to walk away with it nta and this is child neglect bordering on child endangerment
nta for so many reasons you all need to buy a jogging stroller tell him that s literally why they make them his comment about not telling you in the future was way out of line
leaves baby unattended outdoors while he goes for a run while strangers are present and walking around your child isn t willing to sit down and learn together on why this could be dangerous is happy and willing to hide things from you about how he s parenting the child you have together what else would he hide from you nta
nta there was a husband on here years ago who said that his wife would leave their baby in her car unlocked and running while she s pop into a gas station or store he made her promise to stop this and she agreed however she kept doing it he saw her vehicle at a convenient store and saw their baby alone inside the vehicle so he grabbed his baby put him in his the car seat in his own vehicle and parked nearby where his wife couldn t see que her return to the vehicle and she panics he let her panic for minutes and pulled up to her to show her how easily their son could ve been stolen i think if you could manage to do this without your husband seeing it may help the fact he is on a track makes it impossible to watch her at all times
nta and wtf men
nta i can t even
he might be right and have had eyes on her the whole time however i m with you that would have freaked me out had that been my baby you telling him that it scares you and makes you fear for the safety of your baby should be enough for him to not do it he s being dismissive of you as the mother if he wants to jog so badly he can go buy himself a jogging stroller nta your husband is being inconsiderate of your feelings
nta your fiance is he can run when he is not caring for his daughter what he did is highly unsafe and dangerous and is child neglect as well there is no excuse for this
nta have your husband read these responses and never let him have the baby alone again seriously anyone who is that careless with a child and then tells you he is going to do it again just not let you know is a horrible father he can t be trusted and you have to stand your ground to protect your child since your husband is incapable of parenting
time to get a jogging stroller then he can keep the baby with him at all times
omg no nta
nta please show him this post
nta and pay attention to his word choice he didn t say he d never do it again he said he d never tell you he s going to do that again so that means he ll basically just keep doing it and you ll never know because now he understands that if he tells you then you ll get mad that is extremely irresponsible and dangerous behavior he s exhibiting and i wouldn t trust him to go out with the baby again and no i highly doubt he s so fast he could have eyes on her at all times where is he going to leave her unattended next
i won t tell you that i m going to do that again anyone said this to me i would never leave them alone with my kid ever again even if that person was my spouse or the kids mother father
dude forget other ppl do you realize how fucking fast some peoples damn dogs move i fucking hate that shit esp when they take them places they shouldnt be claiming service animal when its obv very ill trained t t nta
nta he may be able to see her at all times but if something happened to her while he was on the other side of the track how does he plan to get to her in time it may sound dramatic to him but at the end of the day children have come into harm right next to their parent bad stuff happens every second

nta he is not your responsibility and they re trying to bully and guilt you into this so they don t have to he is their family not yours your priority should be your son not his father they should be embarrassed that they can t be bothered to care for their own father
nta you don t owe this to your ex you have done more than enough already
nta do not be guilt tripped by his children you are not his family and have nothing to do with him beside sharing a child they just want to put the pressure on you since they can t be bothered to look after him
nta lol of course the people that will have to figure out a solution want you to take over nuts to all of them if he wanted a partner he should have been a better one
nta that s ridiculous you can t be expected to uproot your whole life what happens when he gets elderly will you be expected to look after him then too stand your ground if anything they should be thanking you for what you ve done so far
you are really evil to not do this when you are much closer physically than they are your neighbour also just broke a leg and the lady across the street has pneumonia so take care of them too since you are close to them my brother is going on vacation to the us next year if he gets sick im expecting op to take him in since she is closer than me in case someone didnt notice the amount of sarcasm running like a river in the above sarcasm nta
nta you are not his wife or girlfriend you are his ex and his baby s mother they are his family they can take time off or pay for a nurse or a companion it s times like this that we bank on the relationships we have made with others the choices he has made have left him with limited options while you can be sympathetic to the daughters it doesn t mean they can guilt you into something you re not comfortable with
this is ridiculous you more than stepped up and your son will be proud that you have an amicable coparent relationship will you be at home and attentive to his needs at all hours if that s what he needs his daughters should hire an in house caregiver nta
nta you ve already went above and beyond he s their father and it s their responsibility not yours yes it s a difficult situation but it s not your problem just because he s the father of your son
what i can only describe as a silly situation i have no judgment just that this sentence absolutely killed me this morning
nta there are different levels of hardship and obligation just because you live nearby does not mean it would be easy for you to care for him it s entitled and presumptuous for his daughters to say that it s not their place and they just don t know the realities of it frankly it s fairly obvious that this is the obvious solution to the because it relieves them of any responsibility i think you should stand your ground you can t be forced to provide this service perhaps there are social hospital services probably paid that can support someone who does not have a family support network
nta this is not your responsibility and you ve already done more than i would for my ex husband if he has no one to stay with him the hospital can put him in a rehab facility until he is well enough to go home
nta at all stick to your guns and don t let the daughter manipulate you into something you don t wanna do they re being completely selfish as to them their father s heart attack is an inconvenience for them
nta your relationship with a predatory older man is long over and any man willing to impregnated a woman half his age is absolutely a predatory asshole you are never required to house an ex for any amount of time or for any reasson and absolutely not when medical care is involved im sorry that his daughters are trying to make this your problem but this is absolutely not your problem and its ridiculous for them to even ask you to contemplate letting your controlling and manipulative ex stay with you the arguments about your son feeling bad his morher didn t take care of his father are absolutely bullshit your son presumably understands that you are not in a romantic relationship with his father if not its past time to explain that ex means no longer responsable for eaxh others housing medical care or emotional needs your son will benefit from seeing you maintain healthy boundaries your son will not benefit from the expectation thst ex girlfriends provide housing medical care or support thats not how women work you can t just get some one pregnant to trap them into taking care of you forever your son maybe damaged by false hope that you are interested in a relationship with his father if you allow his father to move in your son has not become controling and paranoid like his father yet but living with a man who exhibits thise traits may cause your son to develop them your ex and his family clearly don t understand healthy boundaries or have reasonable expectations it would be convenient for them if you wanted to nurse your controling paranoid ex back to health but you don t trying to weaponize your sons feelings to get there way is extremely inappropriate your obligation to care for their father ended if you ever had one since you never married this guy i would argue that you didnt promise him any level of commitment that included in sickness or in health when the romantic relationship did and that you absolutely will not be allowing your ex to move in with you they are selfish entitled and disgusting to even suggest the possibility clearly they actively dislike the father or the wouldn t trust his recovery to his ex partner
nta his kids are guilt tripping you taking advantage of you it s your choice and right whether you want him to stay with you or not you can t be forced
nta kevin is your ex husband you weren t even obligated to stay with him in the hospital but you did out of kindness he s his daughters responsibility now if anyone is the ah it s them
nta why don t they ask their mother to come stay with him assuming she is still alive she should be willing to do that for her children won t they feel horrible knowing that she refused to care for their ill father
nta they don t want you to do it for your son but for themself so they don t have to and try to guilt trip you into doing it you are not family you don t have any kind of nursing leave just because the father of your son has health problems they might have tell them no and they have to figure it out not your husband not your family not your problem what you can over them is if they hire a nurse to take care of kevin that you will visit him a few times but yu still have a job and have to look after your son so no you are not obligated to help out just because it would be easier for his daughters
nta he has family and you are not it they are the ones putting you in a difficult situation but the reality is this is not your responsibility even factoring in your son
nta this is not your responsibility
nta i used to work in cardiac intensive care and this happened a lot there are options a nursing home a rehab a home nurse none of this is your problem the social worker can help him figure it out if his daughters don t step up you do not need to and should not feel responsible for him in any way you already went above and beyond by calling them and staying in the hospital you are a great person don t let anyone try to guilt you into something
nta his daughters are blood you are not you were young and convenient and your son by him is a result his daughters sound as if they want you to be convenient for them and are trying to guilt you into doing something that they don t want to do stand your ground and take extra good care of yourself and your son
nta kevin s daughters have expected me to let him live with me um what no no it s not reasonable to expect an ex to be someone s caretaker just because they share a child you describe your relationship as tumultuous but based on the little mentioned here it sounds abusive your responsibility is to care for your child do it for your son is just shitty manipulation they just didn t want to do it themselves and thought they could bully you in to doing it for them you were generous staying with him in the hospital refusing to live with this man again is a reasonable boundary
yeah no he s an ex and by the sounds of it a predatory shitty one nta if his kids care then they can take him if they don t care then i wonder why that is
so if he dies are you going to get a share of the inheritance because you are family or perhaps you should get all of it since it seems like you re next of kin in their eyes let s be real they are considering you family because it s convenient for them not because they believe it and the second it becomes inconvenient you will be relegated back to the position you held formally nta they re just trying to put guilt on you because they don t want the hassle of dealing with their father
nta my husband 50m had a massive heart attack in february completely out of the blue and i almost lost him he spent days in the cvicu and now that he s home it s a full time job being his caregiver it s exhausting and it s completely overtaken our lives understandably multiple appointments for ot pt speech cognitive and cardiac rehab managing the meds his monitors i don t know if your ex s situation is the same but his daughter s don t seem to understand what they are asking you to do this is not your responsibility and you have a young child to take care of that comes first also just to be clear i m not complaining i love my husband and am completely happy to do this and it was terrifying to almost lose him i m just trying to say that his home care isn t going to be simply him just staying with you
nta he s your baby daddy not your husband
nta that s what rehab is for
nta look up hospice care wife don t become one of those women
nta they are

you had sex with a guy had a baby with him and that means you should be his carer for life given the bit about kevin it s not surprising his daughters have internalized misogyny to this extend but frankly they can all go suck lemons nta what s best for you is what s best for you what s best for kevin has nothing to do with what s best for your son and you re under no obligation to care for him
nta x200b although i m not technically family to him i am his son s mother so kevin s daughters have expected me to let him live with me so they can return home to their family s and jobs so they will get a reallity check x200b x200b they re insisting that now since we get along better i should do it for my son fon t listen to these ahs much better for your son if they do it x200b make this a hard boundary
nta can kevin afford to hire help if not will his insurance pay some of it i would think that if it is a medical necessity the doctor could write an order and get it approved if not a necessity then perhaps the kids can stay a few days and you can go check on him some without living there edit to add what sort of heart attack requires round the clock care if that s the case his insurance should pay for him to go to a rehab facility until he can live alone or should pay for a sitter many older people have heart attacks and their families don t drop their lives to care for them something is off here
nta literally not your job and jeez how predatory is this man
nta i m sure if they all pitched in op would be happy to also pitch in where she could around her priorities which is raising their son
nta he is their father yes he fathered your child but as you put it he was controlling this is abuse now that he is in need of care think of how he will treat you depending on where you live if he is in your home more than days in most places he will be a legal resident and you would need to go to court to evict him do not let him in your home if they keep putting it in your face that he is the father of your child tell them their mom can come and take care of him
nta his daughters are being selfish expecting you to drop everything for an ex because they don t care to be there for their own father you already did more than necessary by being at the hospital with him you don t need to alter your life for an ex regardless of the fact that he is the father of your son i am a stepmother and if someone expected me to be okay with my husbands ex staying in our house because she was sick i d call them delusional
nah kevin was slimy he dated someone closer in age to his daughters probably damaging his relationship with his daughters he dated someone younger and predictably was a controlling ass to her he is reaping what he sowed i d squeeze dollars an hour hours a day out of him for housing him otherwise let him figure it out you don t owe him anything and his daughters don t owe him anything
nta
does he need an actual person life alert is a wonderful tool
he can be moved to a rehab facility and it is not your responsibility nta
would they like to care for an ill ex for a month it s just ridiculous you were kind enough to handle the initial emergency portion but long term care is on him if his children don t want to do it he can hire a nurse
nta kevin doesn t get to have all of the benefits of a relationship if he s not in a relationship with you he shouldn t have become insecure and controlling and should have treated you better if he wanted all of the benefits
the doctor may have recommended that he stay with family but it s not like that s the only option he could stay with a friend he could hire someone to come in and check on him a daughter could stay with him for a while and then they could both go to her home after he has recovered enough for the car trip
he groomed you and got out of it why should you care for him you only have an amicable rapport for co parenting you re not his family nor is he your responsibility it s their issue they can sort it out or not it s not your problem nta
nta
nta don t let these people guilt trip you into doing this and whatever they may think it wouldn t be good for your son
nta they will have to deal with it they can take turns work at home etc
nta kevin is not your problem you did plenty just by staying with him at the hospital until his family could show up don t be fooled into taking him into your home it won t end well
nta he has family his adult daughters you are not his wife you are his ex and not related or responsible for him in anyway they don t want to do it so are using your son as a weapon to make you do it instead this man is only in your life because of your son if you didn t have your son you would be having nothing to do with him i do not think he should be in your home as he is not proved to be a good partner to you it could then make his start pushing boundaries when he leaves your home if he ever does
nta there s a reason for your divorce and i m sure it took work to make the co parenting to work this would push boundaries that are already in place and considering the man was controlling i would also assume manipulative i wouldn t allow a single toe through the door frankly
nta separated not your problem so much for them appreciating your assistance prior to them getting there i guess
you can always say that sure i will take care of him just pay me not your family not your responsibility you ve done more than you had to already nta
nta what do people without friends and family available do in this situation maybe whatever they would do would work for him
nta they re trying to guilt you because they don t want the responsibility they asked you said no you have a young child to care for they need to accept your no as an answer if they re unable to care for him then they need to make arrangements and pay for for skilled nursing care you are not related to kevin his children are
nta this is not your responsibility his daughters are trying to guilt you into it which is not fair
nta if they can t provide care at home then his discharge plan will have to be going to a rehab or other inpatient facility
nta you owe nothing to him
nta if your son was old enough to go be with him that would be one thing but in no universe do people expect an ex to medically care for their ex
nta he s not your responsibility and you ve already gone above and beyond your obligations tell them to get in touch with the hr department at their respective jobs and request fmla or if that s not an option than a brief loa it s only a month and they can take turns and there are at least two of them so they ll miss an additional two weeks of work maximum his daughters are the assholes here
nta they re saying your son will feel bad later on but they are literally his children too so why don t they feel bad
nta tell them you ll only do it if your son gets everything in his will when he dies and see what they say then you re not family they are this is what you have to do to take care of family you went above and beyond to be there in the hospital until they could arrive which is what a good friend should do it s their job to do the rest if they can t take the time off to help then they need to pay for a caregiver that will or move their dad in with one of them
nta you are no longer his family this is something family should do he is not your responsibility if he wanted to impose obligations upon you then perhaps he should have worked harder to make you wilingly want those obligations by wanting to stay in the relationship
nta you aren t qualified to take care of him and the doctor needs to send him to a rehabilitation place if he is that bad off god forbid something happen to him in your house they would all sue you or your home insurance this is not in your best interest he needs professional help if he cant stay by himself
tell them you ll put in as much help as their mother does since he s the father of yall s kids nta
unless you signed up to be his paid nurse don t do it my husband had quad bypass surgery and i altered my work schedule for weeks but i m his wife offer them to pay your salary for you to work for him don t do this out of kindness heart patients personalites change after life altering surgery if you didn t like him before now you won t after
he can hire care you re not together for a reason
you should do it for you son me you should do it for your father
nta his daughters can hire a home health aide to stay with him for a month maintain your boundaries and do not allow him to move in with you
did they ask their mother s to take care of him instead if they somehow think it s your responsibility then it just as much belongs to his other childrens mothers s nta
i don t think sharing a child makes you obligated to care for him he has actual family members for that
nta those daughters are his family you are not this is not your responsibility
nta it s their father and you have a young child to take care of
it s not your responsibility it s his daughters and they re being lazy and trying to put all the work on you they are the next of kin let them deal with their responsibilities and stop being irresponsible and lazy
his family wants to dump this abusive controlling man onto you his ex that s insane you are nta
he is their father they have zero reason other than to use you for them not to deal with this they need to get off their asses and take care of their father you were never the ah in this one
nta they just don t want to do it and are trying to bully you you have already done a lot for them by being at the hospital
nta i guess
your nta for not wanting him to stay with you if you had a tumultuous relationship his daughters really do need to step up but maybe if you and your son spent a bit of time with him during the week and he hired a live in nurse for the rest of the time it could be a very generous on your part compromise also what does your ex want you or his daughters to look after him
nta there are of them they can split it amongst themselves or pay for in home care
more entitled family members nta
nta they need to step up for their father they don t get to dictate to you what you have time for they don t get to decide what you can handle emotionally he s lucky you were there for him when he was in the hospital
personally nta however think of the perception from the children with whatever choice you make
where is the mother of his other daughters
deleted
nta but i would consider doing it for your child as long as you don t hate the man it s quite possible your ex will be dead within the next few years so any time you give him with your son is a gift to both of them
nah they are trying to dump him on your lap and make you feel guilty for saying no to this ridiculous request
nta but please have a little compassion for kevin he has suddenly found himself in a life threatening circumstance and has realised everyone around him sees him as a burden this is heart breaking
yes and no yes for not working with hte family no because you should not do it all on your own but you have problems kevin is old and you are not how good is his health are you going to look after him for the next odd years i bet his other kids are thinking so
i m not weighing in on ah i will say that having had this surgery myself the recovery is really tough what isn t in your post anywhere is how your his child feels about your decision think carefully about that you may cultivate a resentment you hadn t counted on
yta he is ur sons dad u know how upset ur son would be you should look after him atleast for a while
op you need to clarify your post in the original you say you don t want to live with him fair enough in a comment you say he doesn t need round the clock care just someone to check on him are you trying to make us think that they are asking more of you than they are also you say he only needs someone to drive him one week to appointments and then he can drive himself info how many appointments does he have that week changing my judgement to esh it s only a week and you don t need to live with him i would that if he has two older kids they can be there a few days and because you have a kid with him maybe you can go check on him once or twice it s not a full time commitment on anyone s part sure it s not great but when you acted as though you were gonna have to live with him even though he doesn t require round the clock care makes me think you re a little bit of a drama queen here

nta you are no longer married to this man and have no obligation to care for him that is up to his family who are obviously trying to dump him on you his ex wife if an ex partner wants to help care for an ill ex partner that is fine but no one should bully or pressure or guilt and ex into caring for an ill ex partner very manipulative bullies his daughters are and terrible daughters as well
nta he is not your responsibility they are the one who need to organize care for him whether they do it or have a nurse sent to his home
nta being in a good coparenting situation and being close to care for someone are very different thing the daughters are just being assholes and trying to push their responsibilities to you who s a convenient scapegoat
nta he can always just fly and stay with one of them or he can hire a service to check on his or what have you either way no this is not your job

info what is your husband saying about this situation why isn t he speaking to his brother update n t a but your husband and bil are update2 just learned why everyone is supporting the niece op shame on you for not including it in your post yta
esh your bil for favoritism you because as a guest should respect his decision his house his rules edit yta the girl is orphaned she literally lost both of her parents and you re here whining everyone caters to her you re acting like a petty child
of course he favours her over your entitled ass she s a years old orphan i noticed you also refuse to provide info regarding your daughter too is she your husband s child
info does she live there too is it her room normally
i m going nta niece needs therapy support empathy compassion what she doesn t need is a bigger room than people sharing yes it s the bils house but he s an ah giving niece that message just because her parents are dead doesn t mean she can t be spoiled and this kind of behaviour of orphan get everything you want is not going to be setting her up well for later life when her entitlement won t wash with others eta2 in ops original post her initial reaction was can 15yo share she s not jealous of niece as some suggested she s fighting for equality for her own daughter some comments say she s an orphan so what and that this really changes things how the orphan part doesn t relate to the situation at all other than to explain in laws favouritism it shouldn t mean niece is entitled to more than her cousin one year difference between them they should be treat equally and what message is his clear favouritism sending to ops daughter she doesn t matter because she has living parents the grandparents since niece lives with them and uncle favour niece and poor ops daughter is left out she s going to grow up knowing she doesn t matter to extended family a yo having to share the smallest room with her parents rather than the biggest one with her cousin is unfair i m guessing one of them is on a sofa bed or something eta yo dad favours niece too that poor girl she has no one but mom in her corner this is going to affect her so much growing up and yes the niece will find things hard and traumatic due to her parents passing but that is now unpreventable and can only be managed with therapy support and time not spoiling her what is preventable is the damage to 15yo due to overt favouritism op you can t really do anything cause it s bils house and you just really have to respect his rules unless you find your own accommodation but the message he s sending is clear why bother staying anyway
if you don t like the accommodation stay at a hotel
esh niece lost her parents years ago and that is sad getting the larger room while people have to share a smaller room will not make that better cousins sharing a room makes sense op and her husband should have gotten a hotel instead of bitching about accommodations
yta he is favoring her because her parents died you re jealous of a year old orphan get a hotel or get over yourself
esh and honestly niece having lost her parents shouldn t mean she automatically gets a big room all to herself over people or at least sgaring it with someone bil is a dick and you should consider just ignoring the trips if he s the one housing since he s clearly full of crap that said making outright demands does kinda make you a bit of an asshole but i wouldn t react much better probably i would likely either make an ultimatum or just leave altogether right away call bil and any relative who would take his side a bunch of choice words and have my own family trips
info is she his daughter or dose he have custody of her
yta his house his rules i suggest staying in a hotel room or bnb
yta and a guest in his home it s one thing to ask if you can switch rooms but to make a fuss over it is another if the accommodations are unacceptable feel free to go to a hotel
yta leaving out the crucial information that her parents had both recently died confirms it narcissists leave out crucial information when they are drumming up sympathy for themselves or getting a smear campaign underway too
info so i m confused it s your bil niece but does he have custody of her you said in a comment she lost her parents
well yta for leaving out the critical info that the niece lost her parents not so long ago which means you knew full well who the asshole is and missed out this information to skew the results shame on you
yta you lost complete credibility when you conveniently left out the part that your niece is a orphan
yta mainly because it is his place his rules it sucks that they favor the niece however just the way you reply to the comments you sound rude are you like that in real life is that how you talk to people you ask a question and then give a lot of attitude
i m going to guess if he s favoring her that much and it s not some weird creepy thing he noticed that she doesn t get the attention she needs and is giving that to her yta
esh reluctantly you were a guest in your bil s house so he gets to decide who goes where in his home and this should be respected but your bil was an ah by not letting the girls share and listening to your common sense
ignoring everything else about this here im still saying yta op it s your bil s house he is allowing yall to stay there when he doesn t have to his house his rules adding on that your niece has lost her parents and you are acting so childish in fromt of her bigger yta if you dont like the situation then suck it up and go to a hotel
does your daughter care
op how big are the rooms because regardless of if the niece is an orphan coming from someone who lost their only parent at a young age it doesn t make any sense for three people to share a small room if a bigger one is available especially since they could buy a fan so the niece can feel cooler while still letting her have her own space when she stays there but like others have said here this isn t a hill worth dying on and ultimately it is your bils decision soft yta but really for the last comment about the niece she s probably working through a lot and needs support not animosity edit now i know fans don t cool rooms
op has left out the fact that said niece is an orphan just for that this makes her the ah op is the ah for demanding things when its not her house its her bil
yta that s a lot to conceal in the comments op
it s his house he s free to do what ever he wants your also free to pay for accommodations shouldn t really complain when it s free
yta any time someone is dissatisfied with free accommodation they have every right to book into a hotel that s what grownups do when they don t want to stay where they ve been offered
yta not even because she s an orphan but because it s not your house and you don t get to demand shit
yta his house his rules also good job leaving out that the niece is an orphan really helping your case here
leading the witness yta it seems
shes an orphan its his house if you dont like it get a motel or an airbnb
did you post here before
info how long is this trip
nta for thinking it s unfair yta for omitting some significant information information that gives the unfairness some legit cover i agree that mom dad and an adolescent daughter in one room is a little tight were i in your shoes i d spring for a motel room or suite next time
i know what isn t cramped a hotel room or any other accommodations you pay for i m not saying bil isn t going overboard but end of the day it s his house
wait she lost her parents when she was and you say it s been years she should be over it are you sure you re a mother are you sure you gave birth to a child and love it how many of your parents are dead what on earth is wrong with you honestly they should all cut contact with your toxic self something is seriously wrong with you if this is how jealous and selfish you are about an orphan getting a room pretty awful op pretty awful yta go get help
yta and an even bigger one for all the details you intentionally left out
it is his home so he does get to decide but that doesn t mean he isn t an a h
yta you re a guest in his home if you don t like the accommodations get a hotel maybe giving ungrateful guests the smaller room is his way of hinting that you re not welcome
yta his house his rules if you don t like it get a house
yta you are the guest in his home you aren t paying for an airbnb suck it up or get a hotel this is pure entitlement in action
yta it s his home and he gets to make the decision it s nice enough that he s letting you stay there you can t dictate the sleeping arrangements go to a hotel if you re unhappy
yta its your bil s house and he gets to decide take it or leave it you don t get any say i what bil do your jealous of a yo orphan get over it
yta get a hotel room or an airbnb rather than complaining when you re being housed for free
it s not an uncles job to make everything fair in life different people have different relationships and that s just the way it is yta
yta there are larger rooms available in motels
yup yta it s his home and he gets to decide how rooms are distributed plus your whiny attitude makes you an ah
yta the way i look at this is that every family unit always had a designated room to share when meeting for family gatherings at your bil s place the fact that the niece lost her parents now means she is now the only one in her family unit who gets the room honestly i can see why the uncle would decide to not heap even more changes on the kid and let her keep the room that she has always had instead of moving or sharing with someone else outside of her family unit the op has no right to demand anything in a free living situation especially under the circumstances her writing paints her out as an unreliable story teller by blatantly trying to leave out key pieces of information that would affect the judgement if you cannot stand that a recently orphaned kid gets some extra comfort by having a room to herself over the holidays i think that says a lot more about you as a person than any sort of unfairness
yta you got a smaller room that you normally have when you visit anyway it could be bigger than an average room for all we know just smaller than the other you re staying for free in someone s home you re a guest your accommodations aren t outlandish bil isn t shoving you in the attic and telling you to poop in the yard or shower with the hose not having a giant room in someone else s house is pretty pathetic to throw a fit over
esh
the only way you would be n t a is if both you and your niece paid to stay at the bil s home otherwise you staying somewhere for free and complaining you want something better yta
yta next time feel free to book an hotel
yta what does it matter how big the room is are you planning on doing more than sleep and get ready there usually a vacation with family members doesn t involve sitting alone in your respective bedrooms so what does the size matter also some people need the room to be cool cold to sleep and if your niece is one of those people let her have the cool room
info is this a two bedroom house or are the other rooms occupied do you have to stay at bils or can you get a hotel
info you mentioned that your niece s parents are dead who has custody of her
yta
yta you are a guest in his house stop whining
yta his house his rules don t like it then book into a hotel
well esh because while bil is an ah for unreasonably favouring the niece but it s still his house so unfortunately you really do not get a say in the arrangements you could however have shifted to an airbnb or a similar accomodation to enjoy the trip while also living comfortably
yta get a hotel
gee i wonder why he likes her better than he likes you s yta
may be an unpopular opinion but why does it matter that she s an orphan she can share the room with the daughter yeah it s sad and all but that doesn t mean she should get pampered for the rest of her life at the expense of others
yta based off all your other comments and also it s bil s house and he can assign rooms as he sees fit you are an adult if you hate it so much go get a hotel or go home
yta get a hotel room and quit complaining
nta it s kind of ridiculous to have a child in a big room by themselves especially if there is a bigger party who actually needs all the space yes her parents passed away and she should be comforted and well taken care of but she can still be taken care of in a smaller room you could ve asked in a more polite manner and maybe not demanded it of your bil but i don t think you are the asshole i think though you should get your own boarding whenever this trip comes up again if you feel like your own daughter isn t being cared for in the same way provide her with an alternative form of pampering maybe let her get her own room when you all go on vacay i don t quite agree with everyone s yta decision honestly it leans more toward needs more info
yta and shame on you
thank you for making this so easy based on your comments yta in the most remarkably self unaware way
yta let s say you go to a friend s house there s mom and dad s room daughter s room and a guest room let s say daughter s room is significantly bigger than the guest room you as a guest don t get to demand daughter s room just bc is bigger and would fit all of you cause is not your house and that s her room this situation is not that different clearly the niece has already claimed that room because she s stayed there times before is bil s house he knows how the rooms are distributed and if you don t like it you can find your own place to stay this isn t about favoritism maybe he does favour her who knows but is obvious that bil considers that room to be niece s and since it s her room you don t get to claim it
yta and a weirdo for being jealous of a year old girl who has spent the last two years of her life as a orphan you re a guest in someone else s home if you re that upset and self righteous you can leave
nta but i wouldn t be staying with that bil again i can t imagine how this makes your daughter feel especially since she s years old she probably deals with enough bs from people her own age you could not pay me to be again
yta buy your own vacation home way to bury the lead
vote with your feet and leave nta edit just read your comments where you re pretty heartless about her losing her parents yta enjoy the closet
nta he does get to decide just as you get to decide whether to go there or not
esh you for not sounding compassionate for your orphan niece your bil husband and family for showing so much favoritism that your daughter also their niece sees it your bil for cramming people into one bedroom and his niece alone into a larger room and their family being fine with it and your husband for going along with it showing compassion for a child who has been orphaned is one thing showing favoritism over other children and making them feel less than is rather crappy
yta you are a guest and have free accommodations from the owner of the house you left out important information in that the niece is an orphan who lost both her parents a relatively short time ago and so any special treatment is hardly spoiling her you wanted your own room and to have the niece share a room with your daughter when that didn t work you suggested your having the larger room for what purpose other than a power trip since it is a bedroom in a temporary accommodation so why do you need the largest room the ironic thing is that you aren t opposed to favoritism only favoritism that doesn t favor you you would have been fine if you had received the largest room at the expense of your nice
i m going with esh except for the kids i don t think these types of conversations should happen in front of the kids it s bil property he can do what he wants you are free to go to a hotel or air bnb i do feel for the niece but i feel this kind of favoritism could lead to entitlement down the road it socks but bad stuff happens to everyone
nta next time just get a hotel even if it s just for you and your daughter
everyone thinks i m an asshole because it s his home so he gets to decide what to do nta i think that s simply a difference of opinion of whether to keep a stiff upper lip or not which is more a values question than anything else while i m sure telling your bil to his face that something he was doing was ridiculous and showing obvious favoritism is more confrontational than people may have liked i believe it is reasonable to give him honest feedback that his actions are making your family feel unwelcome as guests
nta you should have just left it obvious you folks weren t his priority
info why are you dealing with your bil when your husband is here is the niece his daughter
i won t judge you op but i will give you a suggestion for the future that i do the next time you have to go with the in laws book a hotel you will have privacy and nobody will have anything to hold over you
you are a grown ass woman complaining about a free vacation lodging sounds like you and your husband need to do your own vacation or get your own lodging your husband can say we will get our own room so we have enough for the three of us of course it wasn t fair but your bil has something going on don t be reliant on others and you can make your own choice for lodging
esh i agree it s a bit silly to put one person in a room and three in another you and your husband having a room and the girls sharing another makes the most sense it s ok to point that out but it s his home and she lost her parents so of course she will be babied a bit
yta if you don t like your accommodations you should make your own you make a lot of demands for someone that doesn t own or pay for the house

esh you should have simply stayed somewhere that you d be comfortable if he wasn t willing to accommodate
esh just go to a hotel or airb b or don t go at all it sounds like you where already aware of this favoritism and then where surprised when it happened
nta what does he have against your daughter why can t both his nieces just share that definitely sounded reasonable
yta funny why you neglected to mention the part that she lost her parents in your post you lying shrew least your dh and bil know what you re actually like now
yta you re acting like a petty child grow up
words life s a bitch and then you die yta
nta and i m just going to say this it is concerning to me that an adult male is fighting insisting to isolate a teen girl parents make those decisions about who sleeps where i would not let any member of my family stay under this condition edit changed daughter to teen girl
it is his home and he can do as he pleases even if it makes him a colossal ass just don t go there stay somewhere else nta
yta because it is his house and because you hid a very important fact his niece who he is very close to lost her parents this is a free room and you decided to try to make yourself look good by hiding the reason why he is so sweet on her niece you knew you were gonna be the ta so you hid that reason until the comments bad shame
nta you know not to go on another trip that would include staying overnight at his place i would have left and went to a hotel
nta just because the nieces parents died that does not entitle her to certain things any good host would want to ensure the comfort of all their guests and in this situation it would be either giving the bigger room to op and her family or making the two girls share and op and her husband share also it s been years i m not one to undermine grief i too have suffered the loss of a parent during adolescence but after years it s most likely she would be well into the process of healing and wouldn t hold a strong attachment to the room because she shared it with her parents i saw that mentioned somewhere here op good job for sticking up for your family and not taking crap treatment from in laws you called out the favouritism and even though it was in front if the niece it had to be said and she s old enough to handle that
if you know there is favoritism and you don t like it don t go not sure why this is an issue since you decided to go on a trip you knew you were going to face this situation at plan your own trip and distance yourself from bil
info why can t your niece share the room with your daughter
info is that the room she used to share with her parents during visits when they were alive because the sleeping arrangements aren t fair and i can t see why he d think singling her out among the grandkids would be good for her relationships with them unless there was more to it than just preferred sleeping temperature

y know what nta i applaud you for standing up for yourself that took some immense bravery i m sorry no one else stood up to that bully on your behalf those are the true ahs here not you
nta your cousin clearly knows her fiancee is a huge jerk who tries to bully people but for some reason she is desperate to keep him happy always making excuses and blaming everyone except him
nta groom ruined their wedding not you i don t believe you should have gone through with attending the wedding just because it was already too late to back out or because they presumably paid for your bridesmaid stuff those are not strong enough reasons to endure any more possible abuse from the ah that is the groom i m glad you stood up for yourself hopefully with this more people would be aware of what the groom is like and by extension your cousin
nta and i worry because of how she reacted asking you to apologise after he insulted you that he treats her badly like that in private how you do one thing is how you do anything he doesn t treat people well in the long run he won t be treating her well
nta i m glad you stuck up for yourself and are enforcing your boundaries
nta picking on your weight and constantly belittling you is disgusting abusive behaviour and i m glad you were able to stand up for yourself the family members who didn t stand up for you and stood by as he said those things are the true ahs
oh come on bro that was just a joke no if your jokes hurt people you re a bully deal with the consequences of your actions and self reflect belittling people and putting them down to feel better about yourself shows how insecure that guy actually is nta he did that to himself you definitely don t have to be the bigger person to accommodate someone who doesn t care about your feelings and doesn t apologize or work on their behavior towards you
my _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was upset and accused me of ruining her their special day i should have just kept quiet for the sake of family harmony two of the most loathsome recurring things on this subreddit nta op you didn t ruin anything and apologizing keeping quiet getting along none of those things would have turned that wedding s frown upside down
nta and you will get some ta but you re not you stood up for yourself brought up the issue several times and in no way shape or form need to put up with bullying in any manner to keep the peace because keeping the peace for other people usually means destroying yours he s a bully he doesn t deserve your presence or her since she allows it
nta it s not joking or banter if it s making you uncomfortable he s just being an ah as is your cousin for enabling him
nta i hope your cousin realizes soon that it s not just his sense of humor but that he s actually not a nice person
why do families always insist that the victim keeps quiet and apologize for the sake of family harmony but never insist that the bully asshole do the same they may as well tell you let him continue to be an asshole to you and just accept it because we don t want him doing the same to us they want you to take one for the team fuck that shit good for you for standing up for yourself and not backing down nta
nta so much abuse gets swept under the rug to keep family peace congratulations for standing up for yourself unfortunately your cousin s husband will only find another family member to abuse
nta he was always a jerk to you then he took it too far at the wedding
nta but as a mother of a bride where the groom did a very good job of not showing his real side i wish more of her friends and cousins would have pointed out the things he did i would have done what i could have to get her to call off the wedding didn t matter if it happened seconds before
nta by any means the fianc is an ah and your cousin repeatedly defended him maybe you should have backed out of the wedding sooner but that doesn t make you the ah
nta if he acts that way towards you i m fearing how he will react towards your cousin once they re married
wait you were supposed to apologize for getting mad when he insulted you nta i wouldn t worry it will blow over when that marriage doesn t last or when she realizes how trapped she is if that happened to you it will slowly happen one by one to anyone who continues to stand by her he is slowly going to alienate each and everyone in the family that dude is toxic af theres no point in being the better person around that kind of person
nta family harmony is bullshit
nta nobody ever has to take abuse of any kind just for sake of family harmony
nta your cousin is completely dismissing your feelings while allowing her fianc to act rude and disrespectful to her own family member behavior like that shouldn t be just brushed off or excused i would have went off on her too it sucks that it all had to happen on her day but obviously she could have intervened long before as well
op nta in the end because she expected you to apologize to him but you should have refused to be in the wedding party to begin with
nta family can never see things objectively so you ll get some ta s but no one deserves to be belittled constantly for no reason i feel sorry for your cousin marrying someone like that you just have to realize you may sever your relationship with your cousin over this if your peace of mind and pride is worth that much do it i probably would
nta bet your cousin gets the brunt of his attention all the time he sounds like a controlling git and not taking his shit was a good thing bet women in general don t do that to him often
nta this is second post i ve seen today where someone s rudeness is being excused as joking if the person knows it bothers you and they continue to do it it s not joking it s harassment don t go to the wedding and end your friendship with your cousin who has shown that underneath they really don t care about you
nta good for you for standing up for yourself as others have mentioned i wonder if he is also emotionally abusive to her
nta
nta
nta brava for standing up to him and calling him on his shit he s a bully who gets off making snide hurtful disrespectful comments he ruined the wedding not you asshole is as asshole does
nta his lack of common courtesy respect was bad enough even after talking to her she just brushed it off as joking your cousin defending him is showing you who she really is a person with no backbone who will go along with abuse attempt to sweep it under the rug you did the right thing by standing up for yourself leaving the wedding
anyone ok with the groom bullying family especially on the wedding is sick i m sure he s trying his andrew tate bs trying to act superior and manly how sad nta you tried to tell her and we re at a breaking point
deleted
refusing to attend my cousin s wedding esh everybody sucks here uh refusing to attend would be more like sending your rsvp as a no you accepted being a bridesmaid then walked out of the venue right before it was time to go up the aisle very different why would the groom even be hanging around all you bridesmaids getting ready
nta considering he s been insulting you however you say this i told her that i couldn t support a relationship where one partner was constantly belittling and disrespecting the other yet i don t see anything that indicates he s belittling or disrespecting your cousin just you edit wait this is fake right looks nearly identical but flipped to this other post from hours ago https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12dkc4s/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding
i m a little torn it wasn t a new paradigm and to snap on the actual wedding day is pretty inconsiderate to the bride nta for standing up for yourself though and i guess if you stayed the day would have been awkward anyway
nta but you should have not agreed to be in the wedding when you knew what he was like
sorry but yta you have a right to your feelings but fucking say that before being a bridesmaid and on the day of the wedding like come on that s just being a dick and making sure she paid for it as well you could of handled this much better and said no ling before the rsvp needed to go in
yta because you chose not to say anything to him about his actions until the day of the wedding then you backed out you should have confronted him about this way before you even said yes to being a bridesmaid
esh this had been going on for months and escalating and you should have acted earlier rather than the day of the wedding your cousin tries to justify his behavior which isn t joking or funny it s bullying and the fianc is worst of all i m not sure where you are but at least in the u s the groom is not anywhere near where the bridesmaids and bride are getting dressed did he come there specifically to taunt you
yta backing out on the day of the wedding was really bad you had plenty of opportunities beforehand you knew before then that you did not like him and did not support their union so you never should have said you would be a bridesmaid that is on you it s good that you stood up for yourself but your timing was awful and you left her hanging you made a commitment to her
esh so yes he sounds rude etc and your cousin should have made him stop or maybe not even marry him however you knew all that and decided to be a bridesmaid and then he makes a comment and you say that s enough why now i think yes you should have sucked it up or not have been a bridesmaid or at the wedding at all since you know him his behavior but to do it at the wedding day is not okay
esh one thing i m confused about though is were you said i refuse to support a relationship where one person is constantly belittling the other am i wrong because that didn t make sense i thought the issue was that he was belittling you not his wife
why did you agree to be a bridesmaid when he has always treated you badly you shouldn t have if you had misgivings you could ve sucked it up for your cousin then talked to her about it quietly esh
esh you should not have agreed to be a bridesmaid to begin with or at least should ve backed out well before the wedding not literally at the wedding but the fiance sounds like a dickwad and your cousin defending his repugnant behavior is also deplorable

nta there s never a good reason to subject yourself to verbal abuse sorry your cousin won t defend you and stop the bullying jokes are only funny if both people are laughing
nta no one has to tolerate bullying not even as a gift to a bride on her wedding day why were you asked to apologize and he was not though you might want to keep a line open to your cousin this kind of behavior can escalate after marriage and she might need a lifeboat to help her out of a bad situation
nta good for you standing up for yourself your cousin refused to hear you before all this and now reaps the rewards by you leaving the wedding applaud yourself for standing up against the bully
nta
nta if he s just joking then why the actual f is he talking smack to bridesmaids before the wedding he s starting to divide her family against her he s starting with you and making you the bad guy to cut more people out of her life after the wedding you weren t wrong but this is classic stuff we ve all seen on reddit just put it out there to the rest of the family that while you can t support her right now you will support her when she s ready to leave this dude
nta
nta you shouldn t have to take abuse like that you made repeated efforts to get your cousin to alter the situation and she failed to address it
nta she ll discover the sad truth when he turns it onto her
you re nta anyone who tells someone to learn to take a joke is a huge ah
nta
nta obviously by why did you wait until their wedding day to say anything first time let it slide second or third talk to your cousin fourth and any subsequent occasion you talk to them directly
nta
nta
nta your cousin sounds like a cliche victim of some sort of abuse that is defending her abuser and downplaying his stuff as not that bad
nta just because she settled for trash and is ok with him with mistreating you it doesn t mean you have to support her make use of the block button if she corners you at a family function just tell her to have a sense of humor about her ruined wedding day
nta she ll see reality when he starts to do the same to her which he will when she comes back crying and apologizing remember how she treated you
nta their marriage probably won t last just go no contact with both of them
nta fianc couldn t keep mouth shut to keep the family harmony and the nerve of your cousin to make you apologize info what is his deal and does he do this to anybody
nta another obvious choice she should have shut this down long long ago
he s looking to isolate and control her by running off her friends don t go to the wedding if you wish but do keep reaching out to your cousin she s going to need support and an escape route in the near future nta
nta try the ol reddit gem of asking her to explain the joke and why it s funny
oh hell no nta we usually all have at least family member who s an ah you ve been incredibly patient with the situation the guys just plain abusive i actually walked out of my dads wedding because my ah brother who d been horrible to me for years was downright nasty abusive to me during the reception i just reached the point where i was so upset angry i told him he was an ah walked out fortunately my dad other family members witnessed him being an ah again my dad actually ran after me apologizing for my brother gave me a big hug while i cried promised he d take care of it which he did i m betting your sisters marriage doesn t last long because he s probably abusive to her as well
nta she overheard the argument and thought you needed to apologize hardly you d made her aware of his behavior on prior occasions she did nothing to curb his behavior honestly if i d heard from my cousin early in my relationship that my bf had treated her the way your cousin s fiance treated you i would have broken up with bf possibly after removing his tongue from the rest of his body i certainly would never have agreed to marry him that foolishness is entirely on your cousin oh and you didn t ruin her special day her ah fiance did that with no help from you whatsoever
nta i despise people who belittle others and it s shrugged off as it s just their sense of humor nope you re just an ah had a very good friend of over 25yrs marry a man like this i slowly realized she was kinda like this too but more covert our friendship didn t last long after the wedding they treated each other like a king and queen but everyone else so horribly they brought out the worst in each other to everyone else come to find out they divorced 5yrs later cause she lied about wanting kids and he has always wanted them plus she was cheating on him with her manager of the bar she worked at for the last year ex never found out though their marriage is doomed or she ll become isolated because he ll piss off too many people
nta what do people not realize that it stops being a joke when the other person isn t laughing
nta why should you stand up for someone who constantly treats you like crap why should tou sacrifice yourself for the sake or family why is your cousin ok with her fianc treating family like that it s not a joke if he is the only one laughing excellent that ypu stood up for yourself and might be time you distanced yourself from those family members that support such treatment
nta but your timing on when you decides to stand up for yourself is unfortunate you knew that the boyfriends was an ah and your already made your feelings known to your cousin should ve declined to be in the wedding
nta i hate when families try to keep the peace
nta it s good you stuck up for yourself exposed to others his indecent behavior by standing up for yourself and not tolerating it supporting their union that you re not required to even attend a wedding if you don t want to regardless
nta
nta it s the old be a good little girl and just take it so you don t upset anyone schtick all of the people who side with them should either be blocked or just ignored your reasoning i don t tolerate abuse of any kind and you told me to apologize for being the abuse victim ffs dna means nothing real family wouldn t do this to you if it s a family gathering memorize some humiliating comments questions to toss in his direction while smiling or just toss your drink in his face and calmly leave i don t tolerate abuse
nta but it does kinda suck when you choose to handle it you had literally years to take a stand and you chose the worst possible day you should have peaced out years ago and left your cousin to marry her gross partner in peace
nta she is the ah she should have immediately shut down his behavior and told him not to speak to you or about you like that full stop she s such an asshole i mean sure her husband is an ass obviously but her more than him
nta
you re nta for leaving because of his behavior but your post doesn t make sense i couldn t support a relationship where one partner was constantly belittling and disrespecting the other am i the asshole for refusing to attend my cousin s wedding because of her fiance s behavior towards me nowhere do you say that he was behaving poorly towards your cousin just towards you again that s still enough reason to not want to be around him but your stated reasoning doesn t match the situation you described
i m glad you stood up for yourself and i m also concerned for your cousin nta
nta there can be no harmony with someone like him being so cruel and belittling of others stay away from your cousin and the others spouting nonsense about family harmony because they are part of the problem
nta wtf he is trash set your boundaries girl bullies only get away with their behavior because people tolerate it you met your limit your dignity is more important than placating an ah
nta my brother married a woman who behaved the same way as your cousin s bf she would openly criticize insult me in front of my family members while they all pretended not to hear her it would be things that taken individually could have been ignored or laughed off but it was practically a monologue and cumulative whenever i attempted to fight back i was made out to be the bully their deafness was very selective eventually i flat out refused to be at any event that my brother and his wife were going to be my only regret is that i didn t do it sooner at one point i had a very frank conversation with my mother and she told me about a talk she d had with sil where she my mon told her that my brother and i had always been extremely close and sil said well i can t have that is it possible your cousin s bf is jealous of the relationship you have with your cousin as well a s being an ah i know it doesn t make any difference to your situation but you might feel better if you have an explanation for the hostility
nta but seriously good luck to your cousin she ll need it
nta her new husband is an asshole and will end up treating her just like he has treated you
the only ah here is him you are nta i hope your cousin doesn t end up deeply regretting this marriage
you re not the asshole your cousin and her fianc were disrespectful to you and there are going to be foreseeable consequences in relationships if you can t treat others with basic respect
just kept quiet for the sake of family harmony i call this a steaming pile of bulls it you took his nonsense long enough standing up for yourself was the right thing for you to do
nta your cousin sounds like she s heading towards an emotionally abusive relationship if she s not already in one
i can t imagine what he says to your cousin behind closed doors you know he verbally abuses her which will escalate to physical abuse she s already making excuses and trying to force others to apologize to him for his behavior probably because he takes it out on her later
nta if your sense of humor is ever rude disrespectful or condescending then it is not humor it s just bad manners the only thing that could be held against you which i would not would be the bad timing of it coming to a head at the wedding we need to stop justifying bad behavior just because it has been normalized at some point call bs early and often hopefully it won t have to happen at a wedding but don t blame yourself because it did
nta he should have kept quiet for the sake of family harmony you stood up for yourself
nta at all
nta there was family harmony and than everything changed when the fire nation attacked in the form of your cousins new husband
nta they aren t entitled to your time or energy
info i told her that i couldn t support a relationship where one partner was constantly belittling and disrespecting the other where does this statement come from the whole post was about things he said to you right anyway nta
nta you did your best to give him a chance but he clearly has something against you some kind of chip on his shoulder you don t deserve this at all good riddance i hate that there s this ongoing pattern i see in these posts about always wanting to keep the peace before worrying about anyones feelings so sad
nta also if he is like that with you what is he like with her behind closed doors stand up for yourself don t let him bully you or those around you call him out every time and when you re alone with your cousin tell her his behaviour is not ok it is not a joke and she will always have a safe space with you

this is precisely when you hire a lawyer she can stall all she wants but assuming you are in the us probate courts will eventually get to the bottom of everything so you might mention that her stalling is only delaying the inevitable unless you committed outright fraud she can t change the beneficiaries and allocations if they are specified in the four corners of the document
nta at all given her behavior throughout her life and up until now she s not entitled to any deference from you
nta and besides a lawyer i d highly encourage therapy and limiting your contact with her she s treated you terribly for what sounds like a majority of your life she s the one who should feel terrible not you
nta do whatever you need to do to survive and thrive you have no reason in the world to care about what she thinks or feels i hope that better times are ahead
nta the trust represents the father s wishes not the mother s she has no right to unilaterally determine whether the trust should be changed get a lawyer to take over for you
nta hardcore this is her sins coming back to bite her you have nothing to feel guilty of it is perfectly reasonable for you to seek legal representation in the face of obvious bad faith any trouble she gets in for having the truth come to light is on her sounds like she did some pretty horrible stuff to you throughout your life i m sorry you had to go through that at this point i d just practice the words any questions regarding this matter need to be through my lawyer good luck and don t let the bastards keep you down
nta you haven t take it anywhere its your mother who s taken it this far it takes two parties to have a conflict she can t lay this at your feet when its a simple matter of showing you some document that would resolve everything
nta she s stealing from you you re right to lawyer up go hard against her now before the situation gets any worse
nta that s your money they are giving you shit because they are greedy that s literally it don t back down get what s yours and never talk to any of them again they care about money more than you
nta she has no legitimate reason to behave like this
listen to me you are not a horrible daughter but clearly she a horrible mother she is lying and trying to steal you don t feel guilty about anything she probably would prefer that you don t exist at all she tried to abandoned you nta
nta at all take everything thats in the trust excuse my language but f her she is not a mother
nta if she won t show you the papers she s clearly hiding things from you this is why lawyers are a thing
nta take it to court if you have too and get what s yours you owe her nothing and shouldn t feel bad your brother and nephew s opinion mean jack shit so ignore them hell block them to make it easier as to your mom do all necessary communication through your lawyer
living trusts are also drawn up by lawyers and are often recorded there should be an official record and if you re listed as a beneficiary you are entitled to your fair share good job getting a lawyer your mom is being shady
nta she s proven she can t be trusted so you need to talk to a lawyer
nta and she can t change anything about the trust since she didn t set it up get a lawyer get your inheritance and cut that cancer out of your life
nta lawyers usually shouldn t get involved in family matters but this is an exception it s why we have them
nta it s interesting you re being put through a guilt trip precisely by people who have financial interest in you backing off and a mother not behaving like an adult while trying to pretend an adult relationship sorry about all of this op there s no need to feel guilty or gentle about something that s rightfully yours
nta hire that lawyer immediately
nta you are entitled legally and morally to your inheritance your mother has no right to treat you this way
dont let her take advantage of you
nta get a lawyer
nta smart move
nta fight to get what s legally yours who cares what this awful person who happened to adopt you cares get your money and keep your mother out of your life
nta she has a fiduciary requirement to provide the information and if she doesn t she could end up in legal trouble
nta do it hire a lawyer and stand your ground on this also let us know what happens
nta the simple fact that she is stalling is telling something makes me think she has probably used up her and your brother s portions of the trust and does not want to give up your portion you not only need to get a copy but also to go after her if she has stolen any of your share
funny how the negative comments are coming from the people who will benefit if your mother is left in charge find out what the trust says and secure your rights nta
nta if you are named in the trust you have every right to know what is in it for you it might not be a bad idea to have it frozen until it can be discovered exactly what is in it and who is entitled to what

get the trust with the lawyer she is in the wrong not you
nta do what your lawyer says your mom sucks your brother sucks and it sounds like your nephew is sucks too as a result of being raised by sucky people they re giving you crap because they are being greedy get whatever you are owned and strongly evaluate if you want these people in your life do they make you happy at all cause they sound pretty awful especially your mom
nta
nta good job getting a lawyer
nta she s trying to steal your money
of course you re getting negative comments from the people who want your share and for you to shut up about it already nta
you need to get a lawyer involved now before she spends everything nta
nta it sounds like she s trying to hide something
i have an excellent referral for you if you re in texas hire an attorney take it all the way nta but you ought to know that by now
trust administration attorney here you are owed a fiduciary duty by the trustee i e mother to act only in the best interests of the beneficiaries i e you she is trying to rip you off nta and time to lawyer up
depending on how the trust is structured upon the death of the grantor your dad how were the assets divided different states have different requirements for trust disclosures what became a marital share qtip children s pot common trust typically a revocable living trust becomes irrevocable and divided into varying sub trusts upon the death of the grantor but of course the specifics are dependent on how the estate plan was structured none of this is legal advice and obtaining duly licensed and experienced counsel is your best option to protect your interests edit nta
nta lawyer up you deserve your inheritance
oh my goodness take this as far as the moon if you have to your so called mother is illegally trying to steal your money don t listen to one word your mother says you know what kind of person she is hang onto your lawyer and also find yourself a therapist what you went through as a child because of this woman is appalling stay strong and get help addressing the negative impact she has on you in the present and the way her ugly words affect you nta
nta guaranteed she s mismanaging it if you wait everything will be gone and you won t be able to claw it back get everything you re entitled to and shut them all out completely after that
i am in the us however living trusts do not go to probate and are not recorded in the court system only way to get a copy of the documents is from the executor trustee which happens to be my mother
because of this i would also encourage all future contact to go through your lawyer let them deal with her and manage thus situation once this is dealt with i would go nc block and move on with your amazing life nta
i ve already decided that no matter the outcome of this i m done with her full nc i ve also gone to therapy before and continue working on self therapy thank you

even so living trusts assuming the trust is in her name rather than your deceased father s which might make it an irrevocable trust now can also be contested challenged another vote for get a lawyer nta
how do you even know she s telling you the truth about what type of trust it is let your lawyer get to the bottom of this
trusts and estates lawyer here the law varies by state but in every state i know of the probate courts have jurisdiction over trusts it s not just wills most probate courts also handle conservatorships so if your mother doesn t show you the trust documents your lawyer can petition the court to compel her to do so getting a lawyer is the best possible course of action when you have a potential legal dispute and the sooner the better you re not an asshole for hiring a professional to solve your legal problem any more than you are an asshole for going to the doctor if you have a health problem just like going to the doctor if you go at the first hint of a problem the outcome is going to be a lot better for you than waiting and hoping the problem solves itself it could get much worse instead
that doesn t mean she has the right to withhold the documents from you she can hold you off but not a lawyer this woman sounds hateful and kinda twisted don t be afraid to stand up for yourself and for god s sake do not fret over what taking action will do to your relationship with this nasty woman there is no relationship to put at risk you need to put your mother and your brother and your childhood behind you
your lawyer can force the issue by having her give that to you to see just do it your mother sounds like she mentally abused you for years so there is no reason to feel bad or guilty getting a lawyer after her
trust admin atty here trust disputes definitely do go to court especially when there is a breach of duty to the beneficiary different than a full on probate but usually heard by the probate court she has an absolute obligation to provide the trust documents and a complete accounting of her actions as trustee failure to do so may end up with her having to pay your legal fees in addition to anything else you are owed nta time to lawyer up good luck
you re going to have to serve her continue to communicate with a lawyer your mother sounds mentally ill and you should have never been treated that way you feel guilty because she conditioned you to feel bad about her made up slights you have done nothing wrong and deserve the money your father left you she is a thief and is committing a serious crime by withholding the information
a living trust is not the same as a trust fund a living trust oversimplified is when someone automatically becomes the owner of your house when you die no will needed there can t be a living trust towards you without your participation afaik but if there was and you don t have it that s straight up theft nta and do not back down
i do know there is language in the trust that if anyone contests their share they lose it but i m not contesting anything just trying to see what s in it lawyer has already been hired and contacted her lawyer for copies but her lawyer has not responded
my dad told me that it was a living trust before he passed he wanted me to know more about the family financials but mother always stopped him
for your legal health
check with lawyer but that clause may not be definitive if there is fraud or something else not a lawyer so not sure of the term also if a joint trust then it may have have become irrevocable on the death of one of the parties again jurisdictional variation
you re not contesting your share that would be trying to alter the language of the contract to give more to a different trustee your mother is illegally withholding your share and contesting your brother s
your lawyer can go to court and force the issue sounds like they ll have to nta and make sure they do it good luck you deserve your proper share
you would not be contesting the trust so no worries about an in terrorum clause you are challenging her actions as trustee and she cannot change a trust where the settler has died without a full court hearing follow your attorney s guidance and good luck
do you know that or is that what your mother had told you
keep the lawyer nta
once your dad passed the living trust becomes irrevocable and enforceable as to his share of the estate and that gives you the right to full information and a complete accounting

how the hell does anyone think they can play with a weight as a football
nta i m not dure i would have used the words you deserve a broken ankle but s a pretty good age to learn about fuck around and find out
i told isaac what he did was stupid this was fair and that he deserved this broken ankle this was not and super fucked up you should be ashamed of yourself as both a father and a human yta
just in case something like this ever happens again let me tell you what my dad would have done so what s the lesson here in that calm pointed non judgmental way gets the point across without the you deserve this wording
nta your kid needs an ego check but also if he likes the sport so much why not let him join a team instead of kicking random junk around the house
and that maybe he should let this football soccer thing die down a bit and find a new hobby this is where it tilted for me because you said earlier he s been getting his siblings into it and it s just been causing problems if he could play it d be nice but he s honestly as bad as a cat in water gracie and nathan have been hyping him up calling him the next messi and a lot of other stars not sure why you seem to have such an issue with them playing football if he loves it and they have no issues with it either he will have heard you deserve to not be able to play and you need to stop which i know isn t what you said but that s almost certainly how it will have come across
i mean yeah he had it coming but the assholey part was saying it out loud having the pain and rest time of a broken ankle is punishment enough without hearing that your parent thinks you deserve the pain even if that s true a better statement would have been simply this is why we don t go around kicking everything right bud we learned our lesson and then take care of him like a parent should instead of that was so stupid you deserve this so soft yta just because of the wording even though yeah your son was being stupid he probably doesn t need his parent to tell him that in this moment you can laugh about it after he s healed not during the x ray yknow
yta i told isaac what he did was stupid and that he deserved this broken ankle and it should teach him a lesson and that maybe he should let this football soccer thing die down a bit and find a new hobby until his ankle was healed he blamed me for not believing in him and wanting to sabotage his career dumb move yes does he really deserve a broken ankle no that was harsh also what caused his broken ankle has nothing to do with the sport there is no reason for him to not play the sport he loves why are you pushing this he just can t be kicking weights it does sound like you don t want him to play the sport
play stupid games win stupid prizes nta
nta who are these touchy feely folks who think you deserve this is uncalled for or harsh fuck around and fight out play stupid games win stupid prizes you reap what you sew and so on we have many many many sayings and expressions to exactly this effect at fourteen you should fucking know better it s absolutely appropriate to tell kettle bell pele that his dumbass got exactly what it deserved for ignoring every critical thinking lesson life had provided up to this point the word dumbass is wholly appropriate and i m sorry i don t think we should go out of our way to avoid acknowledging that the kid was a dumbass and did something incredibly stupid and absolutely deserved it no one else made those choices it wasn t a trap it wasn t an accident it wasn t a weight painted like a soccer ball no one was egging him on or pressuring him to do it he thought it d be fun he made the idiot choices every step of the way he literally deserves this this is a direct consequence of the choices he made as imposed by the laws of fucking physics and limitations of biology it s nobody s fault but his he literally deserved it he literally earned it there s nothing wrong with telling him that you people who think nothing is more important than a child s feelings are really undervaluing the critical step of learning lessons in comparison there was one of these the other days racist kid was the only one not invited to a birthday party and the comments were full of feeling over thinking half wits whining over the poor racists feelings and forgive me but that s some shortsighted dumbfuckery the lesson is what matters the moral the teachable moment not their ickle fucking feewings be a racist get treated poorly that s a lesson that s a valuable fucking lesson and this is the exact same sort of thing oh no you were made to feel stupid for doing something really stupid fucking good you should feel stupid you were stupid you did a stupid thing on purpose and as a result you absolutely should feel stupid grow to hate that feeling and then make choices that hopefully avoid it going forward that s the point that s the entire learning process that s how it s supposed to work
year old boy doesn t understand that kicking heavy things is going to damage his leg i have hard time believing this anyway nta you just said what he did is stupid which is true your son trying to tell you you don t believe in him seems to me like he is angry at himself and is trying to shift the focus of his anger to you because it s easier to be angry at the world around him than being angry at himself edit grammar
nta your year old son went full force on a kick into a weight i don t live in the us anymore but damn if i did that while we were there i would have put my family into so much debt thanks broken system and then for your son to blame you for him kicking the weight nope nope nope
i m sorry but don t listen to those people who are saying that you are an a because like what s with all these a yta verdicts like it doesn t make sense he s years old he should know that if he kicks a weight what s going to happen to him he should know the repercussions why are you guys acting like he s innocent and guarded and he doesn t know the stuff like this he deserved hearing that because it s going to teach him not to do it again next time stop baying these kids he s not a baby he s grown grown enough to know that he s going to hurt himself that s what he gets lol
yta i think the broken ankle was enough calling him stupid isn t helpful
i have two boys nathan and lewis and one girl gracie my middle child isaac interesting x200b definitely yta for telling child they deserved a broken bone telling him that what he did was stupid is harsh but true telling him that you hoped it taught him a lesson is pretty aggressive i think i agree with your wife i d have gone with a what did we learn approach that way your kid doesn t have a chance of thinking you just called him stupid he s not discouraged and you know whether or not he learned the right lesson from it
yta what he did was stupid and calling that out is forgivable but telling your year old he deserves a major injury is just cruel no one deserves such a thing simply for being kinda dumb even beyond that particular wording the broken ankle itself is punishment enough kicking your child when he s down you should be ashamed
yta the minute you decided to deliver a lecture to a kid suffering the natural consequences of his own stupidity honestly you could have just stfu and not kicked the kid while he was down
yta he is a kid kids can be told times not to do something and will do it anyway he probably feels bad from the result but worse from your action even if he never admits it to you
teenagers are dumb and do stupid things calling him stupid was a very stupid move on your part yta op
nta he s if he doesn t understand kicking something weighted will hurt him then this was the perfect lesson
year old boys are incredibly stupid ask any teacher
criticism isn t helpful you can still think the behavior was stupid which it was but you definitely could have voiced your thoughts and feelings in a more constructive way he absolutely did not deserve harm tho no matter how stupid he was being people make mistakes especially year old people yta
you should tell your son that you thought about what you said and you feel awful for telling him he deserves a broken ankle that s a messed up thing to say to a kid is still young enough to make really stupid decisions like that he is still a kid with a developing brain words can be very harmful especially coming from a parent
yet the language you used with him was stupid and you should k ow better and you re how old stupid is as stupid does hun yta
yta listen to your wife your son was in pain faces weeks of rehab and probably feels embarrassed about the accident he did not deserve to be hurt he needed and still needed love and compassion if he wants to go back to soccer after his ankle mends try to support him having parental support means the world to a kid whether he s a future superstar or will spend the rest of his life in the bleachers as a fan
yta yes kicking the weight was stupid but he doesn t deserve a broken ankle it must be very painful and will probably feel a little different even after the initial recovery i m sure he gets it why do you want to see your son suffering with a broken ankle
yta i told isaac what he did was stupid ok had you stopped there and then explained why it was stupid and how to learn from this painful experience you were actually kinda ok you hit mega douchelord with deserving the broken bones because you seem to forget how truly clueless teenagers can be they think they are immortal until they realize otherwise but you took this opportunity to ensure this was burned into his head that his father does not have any faith in him and thinks he is stupid not a great move at this pivotal age op
yta no one deserves a broken bone watch how you talk to your kids you re gonna mess up their heads man
yta because if this was true then you could have solved this with buying him a damn soccer ball
what about lewis what is his thoughts in the matter also yta maybe work with the kid and encourage him to keep playing and practicing
yta he clearly learned his lesson the hard way there was no need to pile on
yta yes what he did was extremely foolish but saying he deserved it was going too far
yta and a terrible parent poor kid to know his dad doesn t give a crap about him
yta i am sure he did not need you to rub his nose in it and belittle him to boot
yta why not try encouraging your kids
nta worried about this kid when he goes to college hope he lives through it
yta was it dumb yes but not everybody is good at any sport right at the begining sport needs time and practices your attitude will only cause harm in the long run
yta he already knows what he did was reckless stupid is never a great choice of words when speaking to your child even if it s accurate when my husband son and now grandson ever do which i could say did anything reckless i usually just say what did you think was going to happen is a prime age for acting without thinking first criticizing or name calling after the fact never helps i realize you said what he did was stupid but in a child s mind what he heard was his dad calling him stupid
yta kids only get better with practice telling your kids he deserves a broken ankle omg what is wrong with you why did you have kids if you hate them this much kids do dumb things they are learning he s not
yta because of wording deserved no expected yes he didn t deserve the broken ankle but it s not unexpected that it happened
yta pretty fucking mean dude
yta he doesn t have a developed frontal lobe stop expecting teens to make decisions like adults would he s learned a lesson about kicking things he shouldn t you mocking him doesn t make that lesson any more learned instead it teaches another lesson don t talk to dad when something bad happens in my life he ll just mock me
yta who talks to their kid like that after they got injured
all fine and dandy until you deserve a broken ankle he did something very stupid and arguably had it coming but very few people deserve a broken ankle yta
if op would ve bought his son a ball to play with right from the beginning then none of this would ve happened also kicking your son while he s down is totally toxic and unfair show your son some compassion for god s sake what really grinds my gears is the fact that op figured that his son would just get over his love for soccer as if it was a generic fad as a parent you should be supportive of your child s interests no matter what and offer advice when needed if you knew he was kicking dangerous objects around the house then you should ve stepped in and bought him a ball and told him to kick that outside instead it also doesn t matter what age he was you re supposed to be a parent and remind your kids what to do and how to stay safe op is definitely an ah no doubt in my mind i m speaking as a parent myself
yta like how would you feel if he did this at school and heard his pe coach reprimand him like that he was in major pain and already figured out that what he did was asinine your job is not just to teach him it is to parent him teaching him how to not be compassionate is a bully s job again you are the parent now after the hospital when his foot is feeling better it would be fair to remind him this wouldn t have happened if he would just think before he acts that would be fairer than kicking a gut when he s down
yta if his ankle never heals properly you never know with those things he ll remember that comment for the rest of his life he ll think that he deserves every bad thing that happens to him this is the definition of emotional abuse do better op
nta it doesnt even sound like he learned a lesson even with broken bones sometimes you have to say stuff to get your point across plus he does deserve his stupid prize for playing a stupid game better it happens with a broken ankle people have done and received much worse
nta kids this age don t think at all did you ask him if he at least scored a goal
nta
nta he s and thought kicking a weight wouldn t end badly yeah he needed to learn the hard way
nta but great story
nta idk if its cultural but with something this bone headed i don t believe in the soft approach it was a stupid thing to do you were warned not to do it you did it anyways you had it coming
i just chuckled because i remember what my mom would say when we hurt ourselves doing something dumb serves you right we heard that a lot nta but sign this kid up for a physics course
jeez why didn t you just call him a ret d do you think he doesn t know he did something stupid we all did at that age your disdain for his soccer skills comes through loud and clear at least his siblings have his back yta
nta what he did was downright stupid how does a year old think kicking weights is a good idea you re right he deserves the broken ankle
eh i would say nta but perhaps things could have been said nicer if you re going to fuck around you re going to find out he learned a valuable lesson hopefully he uses a soccer ball from now on
nah sure your phrasing could have been a little less abrasive but to be fair your sons ego is riding cheques his body can t cash
nta because you still brought your son to the hospital as an asian i ll tell you what my parents would ve said if i was stupid enough to do that especially at age very clever go on do it again i told you already but you re smarter than daddy right do it some more emotional damage what you said is mild in comparison to a standard asian scolding
i mean yeah he s he for sure deserved that broken ankle like come on why would you try and kick a weight but you re definitely ta for shooting down him playing soccer in general there was no reason for that at all support your kids in what they like to do even if they aren t great at it yet
eh i m not sure because that s just not something you say to a kid or not but i do agree with the play stupid games play stupid prizes sentiment
nta kids learn consequences and he s he s blaming you for ruining his career kid needed a reality check physics exists and it was his actions that lead to a broken ankle
nah he s and did something dumb you told him so thus helping him to stop and think before doing something similarly dumb again that s how we learn

is peak time for making some questionable decisions yta cuz no kid deserves that imagine you come to my er cuz you used a tool your didn t understand well and hurt yourself and i said you deserved that lessons learned without making someone feel like shit about it also parenting
why does he not have a soccer ball are you broke yta for not supporting his passions and for being heartless
yta no one deserves a broken ankle regardless of the circumstances i m sorry your son is having to recover from this i hope he recovers
nta
nta you just stated facts what he did was stupid and now he s paying for the consequences lesson learned hopefully
yta my parents regularly said to us that s what you get growing up often after we had sustained some type of injury none of us are serial killers and we re plenty empathetic not sociopaths we do have a dark sense of humor and find the humor in anything do the right things elsewhere and you ll be fine you didn t break your kid s personality or do lasting damage with this one set of words here s what makes you ta you need to show more support for his football aspirations as they re clearly important to him and nothing he said to you was a lie he s a middle child and the extra one he s not the oldest or the baby he s not the only boy he has nothing that makes him special this is his way to be special and have something that is just his you ve said you don t think he s good at it he can tell it s why your words hurt so much you re supposed to be one of the people on this planet that believes in him no matter what you pushing him to get a new hobby validated what he was feeling do you go to his games or practices are you enthusiastic while there do you treat his football as an inconvenience when you have to take him to games or practices are you maybe using this as a way to soft sell not being on a team this spring there s a lot he can learn and grow from even on the sidelines if he doesn t have the physical gifts to play maybe this time injured will introduce him to being a coach there are ways to participate in football without being on the field do you watch games together on tv maybe start go to a college pro or semipro game just the two of you start trying with your kid
this kids is nta
nta i m sorry but if at years old you think kicking a weight is a good idea then you kinda do deserve the broken ankle going to venture a guess he won t try that again
esh nta man some of you guys are not first generation americans and it shows lol as my mom would say ya ves por pendejo hopefully you used his college fund to pay for the hospital bill lol he might not need it in the end yeah saying he deserved it is messed up but if that causes him trauma then he needs help lol people are like oh he s just nah dude like some critical thinking skills should ve already appeared by then lol
yta poor choice in words
yta never tell a kid they deserve a possibly life altering injury
yta
at first i thought they were little kids and thought it was messed up you said that but this is a year old wtf did he think was gonna happen
possibly your choice of the word deserved was unwise i d personally take this as a teachable moment the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and long term perspective taking isn t fully developed in teenagers this is why your kid decided to do something that was obviously a bad idea he blamed me for not believing in him and wanting to sabotage his career is a concerning comment given that you seem very dismissive of his skills he clearly knows this does it actually matter whether he is any good what kind of problems is him playing ball with his siblings causing aside from the ankle many parents would be ecstatic to have their 14yo boy being active instead of playing video games are you usually supportive of your son s interests i think yta but not because you were hard on him about stupidly kicking weights the lesson you seem to think he should learn is not about exercising judgement over unwise things to kick but about not doing something he enjoys you don t sound supportive to me at all
nta ike the old saying goes and you basically said it that way he learns
yta why would you say that to your kid regardless of what he did he is a kid and if you say things like that they will stick with him
careful you don t break your own ankle kicking him while he s down yta even though i agree that he should have known better
ouch yta telling your kid that it wasn t a smart move fair telling him he deserved a broken bone that s too far he s kids this age do incredibly dumb things at no point do they ever deserve that though
yta wow you are just awful no one deserves a broken ankle
he s not he s and should know what things are stupid and not he s this might still be a failure of parenting but at this age it s still his own fault and find a new hobby until his ankle was healed he blamed me for not believing in him and wanting to sabotage his career you don t believe in him because you don t want him to kick weightlifting weights like a football dude how many times did you drop him on his head as a baby nta
who hurt you dude your kid has a hobby he likes and instead of encouraging him or just letting him be happy you re shitting on it because he s not pele enough anyway yes kicking a gym weight as if it s a football is pretty stupid but keep in mind that the predicting consequences portion of the brain isn t fully developed in young teens in any case hobbling around in a cast for weeks should be punishment enough telling him he deserved all that pain was an awful thing to say yta
maybe a little harsh but true i m an x ray tech if you play stupid games like kicking a weight you win stupid prizes like breaking an ankle pains a solid teacher
what dude watch this here hold my beer
because kids are really dumb i know this because i have of them
not ashamed to admit i also tried kicking a weight and fucking up my toe as a kid
yeah those words are the only poor choice here but it seems like the kid is not willing to respond to any reasonable advice how is his dad sabotaging his career by telling him that kicking weights is fucking stupid this is the kind of behavior i would expect from like a year old not a teen i hurt myself doing stupid shit a few times when i was a kid my parents took care of the injury and then told me that was stupid and this is what happens when you do stupid stuff like that be careful in the future as a parent you are responsible for making sure your child knows not to do stupid shit this entails correcting them when they do shit that is stupid but honestly i think the kid does deserve a broken ankle though i m not sure i would have the heart to say that to my own child is way too old to be kicking a fucking dumbbell like a football unless he has some sort of mental issue that is
that s the thing though teaching to assume the consequences of one s decisions is wildly different from saying someone deserves to be injured if a kid doesn t look both ways before crossing a street does he _deserve_ to be hit by a car and possibly die too extreme who draws the line as to how much maiming a child deserves for a stupid decision
yeah something like you brought this on yourself would have been better than you deserve it since you want to enforce that actions have consequences teaches fafo not that people deserve it when bad things happen enforces victim blaming culture
deserved is this wrong word earned is probably what she meant its a actions have consequences situation
he s fucking fourteen anybody should know not to kick a weight
yes this was my thought too absolutely fine to tell him that what he did was a bad idea and even to say that such actions have consequences but to tell your kid he deserves to have an injury that s a little far for me
a kid needs to learn when he deserves stuff too i have a nephew that did almost the same thing and we just assumed he was thick until he started making stuff in meinkraft would you let the kid grow up get thrown in jail and then tell him oh sweetie it s not your fault almost a man
i agree with your judgement for slightly different reasons being unable to unpack the subtle but important differences between this was your own fault due to actions you took that were objectively stupid and you deserved the bad thing that happened to you because of your bad choices is not great but in the face of a kid thinking you can kick a heavy metal object full force because hurr bdurr i m messi i can see how a parent might make a snap response out of frustration what really convinces me that op is bordering on outright malicious is the fact that he s so focused on isaac being bad at his hobby and apparently being willing to use any possible excuse to try and convince him to give up on something he enjoys because op doesn t think he s met some arbitrary minimum level of skill at it instead of being there for his son who is suffering from a painful serious injury albeit only after calming down from snapping something not entirely fair at him he s immediately trying to leverage this situation to be the hobby police
his child is and tried kicking weights like they are a football he deserves getting that broken ankle play stupid games win stupid prizes maybe next time the kid will not be as dense
even if he s bad at it if he enjoys playing then let him play i agree with you he s old enough to not make decisions that stupid and deserved being told everything before this to me reading this i thought the kid was about or so when i found out he s yeah the kid should have known better

nta and the people who spent the day gossiping are the ones who ruined it
his wife was mad some family think that me not going ruined his big day nta if he can t take the heat the fact of the matter is that estrangements happen they are embarrassing and just because they re embarrassing it doesn t absolve your brother of his responsibility to act with a bit of class while something like this is happening the only innocent party in the wedding is your sister in law
nta you were uninvited and then a month before you were reinvited you couldn t take time off or pay for it it s your brother s fault
nta he uninvited you then decided to re invite you it was fine for you to say no thanks and not try to move heaven and earth to be there
nta he may soon find out that a month is no time at all to organise a family vacation aside from obvious bollocks of un inviting you then re inviting you via your mom fuck that noise if he wanted there he should have been the one to re invite you since the last time you spoke about it was him kicking you out of it
nta he gave you a month s notice that you were reinvited through a third party it s not your fault other people asked where you were
nta you were uninvited then re invited in less than a month notice hardly enough time to get passports if it was in the same country they could hope a bit more but a whole other country he ll na
nta he didn t even have the balls to invite you back after rescinding the initial invite imo it serves him right having to deal with the explanations
nta what is it with people getting married and getting all pissy when they aren t the only thing people talk about i d have done the same thing
nta lol so let me get this straight you get uninvited months before wedding then reinvited just month before and it s in another country but you re the one at fault for deciding to just not go i know i shouldn t be laughing at this but the entitlement of some people is crazy you don t need that drama in your life glad you and your family enjoyed your vacation
nta you have the right to not go to a wedding in general you ve stated you have a rocky relationship with your brother it s not like you two were really close and for no good reason you decided not to go you were also uninvited months before the wedding and then reinvited
nta he uninvited you then didn t even have the balls to re invite you himself it s totally possible he didn t really intend to re invite you and your mother was just hoping that when you showed up he would accept it he s trying to make you the problem for something that was originally his decision
nta your brother uninvited you he never re invited you your mom did paying for travel last minute is expensive requesting time off and reorganizing your schedule at the last minute is a big inconvenience even if you had the money and the time it doesn t make it right to have you jump through hoops it seems like there was already no love lost between you and your brother so this is more of the same if he tries to gaslight you about not attending remind him that he was the one that uninvited you and you couldn t attend due to his last minute change see about your mother and don t worry about the rest of the family
about a month before my mom tells me that he wanted her to let me know i m invited again he couldn t even reinvite you himself are you sure hes a middle aged man and not a year old girl
nta
nta
nta regardless of what you could have done it still would have been a huge inconvenience and what was essentially the last minute
nta if he was worried about people gossiping all day he shouldn t have uninvited then reunited you people s reactions are not your responsibility
but you weren t invited if somebody uninvites you from something they can t send a random person to tell you they change their mind they have to come to you directly or it s not an invitation only the person having the wedding has the right to make the invitations what if you would have shown up and you weren t actually invited what if your mom made that up just because she wanted you there it could have been so much worse if your presence would have blindsided your brother nta i don t see where the problem was he never told you you were re invited
this is one of those aita traps on this site you won t be considered an asshole for doing this in real life yeah dude people are going to think youre the asshole for this particularly since your mom is not well side note sorry about your mom btw that s tough i honestly could go either way on the asshole front i just hope you made peace with the familial consequences that will arise out of not going before you made the decision
edit due to reconsideration nta your brother is ta for uninviting reinviting you to his wedding and then expecting getting mad when you don t go you re petty for not going over argument s but that doesn t make you an a

i could have gotten the time off and i could have had my families passports in time and i could have afforded the travel costs but i told them i wasn t going to be able to attend yeah yta
the way it turned out was entirely predictable esh
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** so my brother and i have always had a rocky relationship we grew up in a very messed up home and it was every person for themselves he would throw me under the bus a lot to benefit him we have never gotten along the whole family is a mess i moved away young over miles away over years ago he never left and instead moved his fiance in with our sick mom and was basically babied into his mid 30s so him and fiance are getting married big thing in another country him and i get into it at some point while i am visiting my mom and i am uninvited from his wedding about months before hand about a month before my mom tells me that he wanted her to let me know i m invited again i could have gotten the time off and i could have had my families passports in time and i could have afforded the travel costs but i told them i wasn t going to be able to attend by the time of the wedding my mom was not in a good place health wise so the family is all very focused on that this was a 60k dollar wedding btw anyways my absence was noticed and some other members of the family knew what had gone down so basically his whole wedding day was filled with why isn t your sister here and then other family members whispering and gossiping about the whole thing and how sad it was especially for our dying mom his wife was mad some family think that me not going ruined his big day he says my stunt ruined it but honestly i had the time and money and i instead used it to go on a vacation with my husband and kids and we enjoyed ourselves aita i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta either your mum guilted your brother into re inviting you or he purposely only gave you a month s notice because he was expecting that to not be enough time to organise the trip
nta the invited uninvited and then invited again i would have stayed the hell away too once it s known that i m not wanted i m taking that to heart and i m gone
good for you for walking away from a toxic situation and having a happy family of your own proud of you
sounds like a win for you all around nta
nta regardless of circumstances someone not attending a wedding and not bragging posting etc about their lack of attendance on social media via texts to guests etc can not ruin a wedding
nta he uninvited you months before the wedding then didn t even have the balls to re invite you personally month is pretty short notice to swing an international destination wedding too even though you mention you would have been able to do so it s not like you intended to ruin anything you weren t on good terms and you may have even avoided being in the middle of drama at the wedding
nta he said you weren t welcome not your problem
nta
what on earth would motivate you to attend the wedding of a person like your brother your so called stunt was a well reasoned decision that benefitted you and your husband as opposed to benefitting a man with a long history of treating you badly you owe him nothing nta
nta brother is pissed that he faced the consequences of his actions his actions caused the gossiping his actions ruined his big day
did you even get a formal invitation if not pass the message invitation does not count for a formal wedding nta
nta
in the first place anytime someone has a destination wedding they have no right to get butthurt when people decide not to spend the money and use their vacation time for it what makes it much worse is that you were uninvited until the last minute no need for you to scramble and make expensive last minute plans to go where they really don t want you nta
op nta invitations aren t summons and re invitations are even less so i wouldn t have gone at that point either basically you would have been the scapegoat if you went and you are scapegoat for not going i m glad you enjoyed your vacation
about a month before my mom tells me that he wanted her to let me know i m invited again if he wanted you there he s the one who should have asked a month usually isn t long enough to get things together yes your circumstances allowed for you to go but he didn t ask you now did he nta
nta seems like you did the smart thing it s ok not to placate toxic people in your life i hope you had a great time on vacation with your family
nta turns out them kicking you out ve the bridal party wedding was not the punishment they thought it was they eff d around and found out
i agree i bet a scene of some sort would have occurred if op did attend this could have been prevented if all the gossipy goblins had kept their traps shut nta
eh she was actually part of the uninviting fight it started because i was in town on business and i couldn t drop everything to go shopping for bridesmaids dresses and basically i couldn t get mine separate because they all had to be from the same dye batch and then when i told her to get me one that would be too big and i would get it altered she also said it was unacceptable and then he got involved and we we ended up fighting and he uninvited her and she was totally on board
i could have taken the time off and paid i just didn t and instead used the time and money for a trip with my husband and kids
he didn t have the balls to do the re invite in person either he did it thru mom he doesn t impress me
weddings keep the aita sub going really
i am not and it was while i was on the phone with my mom he still lived there and he just kind of told her to tell me
mom has since died still don t regret it as i mentioned one of their things was a tequila tasting and an open bar a lot of people got trashed as much as it upset her i honestly think things would have been much worse if i did go i doubt it would have been let s all hug and make up
yes it s petty but not going to someone s wedding when they uninvited you is justified
so i didn t have to attend and how am i jealous
how did you get jealous from this she was uninvited then a month before the brother couldn t even contact her himself to invite her and gets his mom to
deleted
that doesn t mean it s op s problem as soon as he uninvited op was nta
because op declined a second hand invitation that makes them an ah interesting logic
or the family was already gossiping about whether op would attend and he realized how bad it would look when she wasn t there and clumsily tried to fix it and didn t even have the balls to reinvite her himself nta op
he was in the background while i was on the phone with my mom and i did hear him to tell her to let me know
in other words her their actions caused some speculation at their wedding which sucked some of the festive air out of the room and they ve decided to look at you rather than in the mirror got it and nta
still nta your brother and his wife sound awful if he had wanted you there he wouldn t have uninvited you in the first place it was rather your mom convinced him to reinvite you or the realization that if you weren t there it would ve looked bad
also he used your mother as a go between not sure if it would have mattered if he had personally invited you but it would have made each person s share of ah ery at least a little about as it is nta
good for you nta
i could have maybe you could have but no one in their right mind would expect you to be able to and he didn t even ask himself nta
in that case it sounds like you made the right call your fam may call you an asshole for it but protecting your immediate family from bullshit is more important my condolences about your mom
do mean not going
hey nothing wrong with getting married in your mid 30s or not having kids and that has nothing to do with this story anyway
yeah that s part of it the family is so big on appearances hence the screwed up life we had
your mom convinced him to reinvite you yes apparently op was re invited but they had no guarentee that the invitation had come from bro and sil and not just mom inviting her and her family on their behalf and without bro and sil s knowledge
ha yea typos lol
of course not but i know people and ha e heard stories of the older siblings getting mad that the younger ones are settling down before them
yeah sure it s justified but still kind of petty
i mean it would have cost thousands for us all to go and instead my kids got to go on a vacation they enjoyed they had tequila tasting at the wedding and an open bar underage kids were drinking and multiple people vomited and not in bathrooms so that or i could spend close to grand taking my kids on their first big family vacation is it really that petty
well yea but being petty doesn t necessarily make you an ah
my bad with a little more info i have revised my position sorry for my mistake
fair point

nta they didn t invite you because they know they shouldn t be spending that kind of money and asking you for loans in the same breath
nta so amber can stand your money but not you stop loaning them money you care a lot for your nephews so maybe buy them stuff directly instead of loaning money to your brother
dude you re being used nta
that family friend can fund your brother s life if they feel that way being related by blood to someone doesn t mean you become their personal atm
nta you weren t invited because they assumed you d make a comment about their spending while borrowing from you don t lend your brother any money instead if you feel like you can and want to send him on a financial planning course
nta but your brother yes and your sil also yes
nta don t bite the hand that feeds
nta you ain t getting the 15k back either
nta honestly if i needed to borrow money to just live normally but still chose to throw an extravagant party i wouldn t be able to look the lender in the eyes either maybe they are ashamed and shameless at the same time not that its okay
nta that family friend is welcome to give them money
nta y t a for loaning him money you know they won t pay it back obviously they will spend money they do not have and then ask for money from others walk away your brother made his choice now he can live with it and the fall out i think you place entirely too much blame on her he doesn t really work and squandered money he chose to mary her and have five kids let them get evicted report them to cps if they can t care for the kids
nta so he has money for a birthday party for himself but not for braces for his own kid sheesh
your brothers wife sounds a lot like my brothers wife and that s what we call her x s wife because she is not a part of the family she s the worst no one in my family likes her she hates my mom and grandma and only likes my dad because he has some money and she tries to use him for it people like that don t change if your brother is anything like mine his mind has been poisoned with what she says and it won t get better until if they split i guarantee she said she didn t want you there and your brother complied that should show you the hill he is willing to die on also you re way better of a person than i am i would have laughed in his face if he asked me for money there s no helping people that think they are god s gift to the earth nta
nta tell you re family friend to lend them the money otherwise they could stfu
not understanding why you even loaned them money in the first place when they clearly have no respect for you or even remotely like you lol but you do you
nta if he can afford a nice party than he shouldn t need loans honestly you need to quit subsidizing his lifestyle
nta even if his wife was a pure delight and you were invited to the party you still wouldn t be the asshole for deciding to withhold funds based on how your brother is spending them
nta now you know that you are only an atm to your brother and his wife they shouldn t be throwing parties when they can t afford food or their mortgage i would demand my money back immediately and tell them figure out for themselves how to pay their bills you are done with both of them
nta he s got money for a nice dinner out for multiple people but doesn t have money for necessities yah um the real issue is their priorities and them using you like an atm not inviting you was the slap on the face for all you ve done so stop doing for any of them from now on he can mooch from the people he felt worthy of sharing dinner with on your dime
nta for his birthday forgive the loans and tell him the bro bank is closed
nta you will be a fool to give them more money
nta stop listing them money they are adults they can get jobs if you have the money to spend i would buy for the kids only if they need new clothes or shoes if they like certain foods do the shopping g and drop the food off but if your brother and his wife can afford a fancy dinner out then they can afford their bills what if something happens to you who will pay their bills then stop enabling them
well if you re not at the dinner then you and amber won t get into a fight at dinner so there s logic in that at least i d stop loaning them money not contingent on being invited to dinner or not you say you won t loan them but if you continue to loan them money to get up to date on their bills well by the end of the year it will be keep your cash the family friend said that you shouldn t come down hard on someone who is sick but you said that it is his financial situation that is leading to his illness tell him that he can tell your brother that you shouldn t have a fancy dinner when your finances are in the red and they ll only get redder since you won t be financing his lifestyle anymore nta
nta but why is he spending money on a restaurant but borrowing to pay bills
nta
loaning them money enables them nta
nta about time you cut him off send him some links to dave ramsey videos
esh this isn t about his birthday this is about you feeling used you are correct your brother and his wife are taking advantage of you they suck you are a grown person if you don t want them taking advantage of you then stop letting them the money you gave is gone unless you have a written loan agreement stop giving them money go low contact and work on your own life
stop giving your brother money just stop those aren t loans you know you re never getting the money back it doesn t matter if amber apologizes or your brother makes you guest of honor at his birthday just stop amber and jake are grown ups who blow through money and don t work you are their enabler let them get jobs if they can t afford the house let them sell it and live some place they can afford on their income from the jobs they have to get yta for continuing to throw logs into this dumpster fire situation back away stop it
esh it would be nta but calling him a sissy and saying you hate the sound of her voice is giving a pretty gross vibe
esh yes your brother shouldn t be throwing a huge birthday party at the same time he s asking you for money but you just sound like an insufferable jackass throughout this whole post also info how sick is your brother is it possible this could be his last birthday
esh amber obviously sucks the brother sucks for not keeping a leash on his wife and for acting like he s entitled to the loan but the op sucks for using money to manipulate his brother either make the loan because your brother deserves it or don t but don t insist on your ass being kissed meanwhile

nta he is treating you as an atm without wanting any relationship with you and you are right that is not on they cannot take your money then spit in your hand
nta you were not invited because he doesn t want you seeing the amount of money he is gonna blow
nta never loan family in distress money unless you re willing to never see it again most of the time they never repay and you get stiffed
ummm you ve already lent him a substantial amount of money the bills are paid up the kid s braces are paid for they got what they wanted with a nice dinner that you paid for nta but i don t know what your point is you got played
bs shut the atm off now they want to spend your money that is why they didn t want you there stop all loans and ask them to start paying back what they ve already borrowed
nta if he can afford a fancy birthday party then he can afford to pay the mortgage he s just choosing not to big difference don t subsidize their fancy lifestyle anymore if anything offer to pay for a financial literacy course for them
nta stop giving them money
nta but you need to sue them to get the money back never loan them every again
dude you are paying for their lavish birthday party they are taking the absolute piss out of you
info what s it s like being an atm i invite my brothers to everything i don t invite my atm anything
nta your brother isn t a human being he is let me think about it a bit i got it a leech
nta and stop enabling them they re using you and not even grateful about it
stop giving your brother money because that is what you are doing you will never get it back him and his wife need to get jobs if they need food then you can buy them food if you want but stop giving money of they will never learn nta
a family friend said that brothers shouldn t fight like this is he only child he doesn t know what he talks about lol nta
nta
nta you re probably paying for the party or rather he s paying for it but using the money you ve loaned him i d be eating beanie weenies until i paid you back for my birthday i d splurge on pizza and a grocery store cake that s it if i m too broke to pay my own bills i m too broke to have a birthday party if some of his friends were throwing the party that would be different his wife needs to understand that you and your money are a package deal
nta even without the second part
nta who s sick in this story
yes nta and would inform them of being cut off immediately
nta
nta but you are not helping your brother by financing his bad decisions stop giving them money
nta
nta you are not an atm and imo they shouldn t be throwing parties that are costly being funded by you essentially because you paid to help them so whatever they have extra to throw this party or anything else frivolous they do should have been money given back to you to repay you first
nta best case he s embarrassed to let you see him wasting the money you gave him to pay his bills worse case he sees you as an atm and doesn t actually want you in his life likely because of your bad relationship with his wife bonus theory perhaps there are people there who don t know how poor he is who he wants to think he is rich
nta that s the right decision don t give them anymore money
stop lending him money he is an adult he and his toxic wife need to work he will never get his spending under control while he can leech off you and he is taking the proverbial with his birthday who is in effect paying for this event ask yourself that nta
nta as much as you want to help your nephews its clear that they re misusing the money you re loaning them they shouldn t be hosting any lavish parties or dinners i wouldn t loan them anymore money period they need to live withing their means
nta did they pay for the party
the only way i could see you being ta is if your brother is dying really sick and you re the type of person to hold the loan constantly over his head like i can see them not inviting you if they knew you d be passive aggressive about them essentially spending your money on the party during it like he wants one peacefully night free from guilt shame and dealing with his declining health just speculating and spinning tales mostly lol but would still def love the other take on this
nta what are they doing with the money you are giving them what is their plan do they have any plans to get some kind of money coming in besides what you are loaning them it might be time to reassess the situation
damn for you could come to all my parties i would be so grateful if i had a sibling do this for me crazy
family friend can stfu nta op stop providing for your leech of a brother
nta why are they spending money at any kind of restaurant kids adults isn t even cheap at mcdonald s i absolutely would not give any more money and write off the 15k as a gift your brother and sil need to get their priorities straight and it isn t on you to do it for them sucks for the kids yes but could you take in of the kids if it came down to it what are other family members contributing to their finances if they are so concerned and berating you
nta by the way you probably won t see that 15k ever again
nta don t give them anymore money
nta and i would call in those loans
nta and stop giving them money you re not going to see a dime of the money you ve already leant them
nta the situation is starting to affect his health he needs to change the situation and not by leeching off his brother or having birthday dinners at fancy restaurants
nta stop enabling your brothers bad behavior you aren t helping your brother by giving him money you are simply allowing him to continue to make bad decisions let him fail that might actually help him learn to fend for himself
nta
nta at all
nta fuck amber and fuck him
nta but you have to stop loaning them any more money they will be losing the house so let nature take its course it would be a different story if they were really responsible but they re not aren t even thinking about consequences you have to treat them like addicts because they are
nta you are enabling your brother and his wife just like buying drugs for an addict or greasy food for someone who is severely overweight your brother and his wife won t change their ways until they are forced to deal with the reality of their bad financial decisions so i wouldn t lend them any more money which i assume you will never get back if you want to help some or all of your nephews you could consider helping with college costs or helping them network to find jobs
nta sounds like they need a financial counselor and your brother some other kind of work to see what his wife is or maybe he s just the same
info thus far i ve loaned them to get up to date on their bills and to get my 9yo nephew braces but why if you can t pay your bills you can declare bankruptcy it s not the end of the world teeth aren t going away the family could get braces when they could afford it or when the kid s an adult
exactly what i was thinking they know that he ll get very upset that they are using money they borrowed on parties
he said that he didn t want me and his wife to get into a fight over the loans great no more loans then problem solved helping them pay their mortgage so your nephews don t loose their home is one thing if they re otherwise being frugal if they can afford a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant then their options are to invite their benefactor or find a new one
sounds like op is throwing a party that he didn t know about
or start college funds for them but only give them if they aren t poisoned by amber depending on age let them know if they need a safe haven your door is open it sucks when kids suffer because of poor decisions by adults but since brother and wife haven t shown any ability to stop making bad decisions don t fund that
how is he being used op clearly has a head on his shoulders if the relationship ends here it was the typical reddit quote of you paid 15k to never see someone again of course 15k is a lot of money but considering part of it was for nephew s braces incredible investment and on the the nephew that op clearly likes despite everything related to his brother and that he was asked for a 50k loan and therefore must be stacked it was a small investment on his part to get rid of someone extremely toxic
literally
if op wants to be ta he could forgive the loan and then report it to the irs the irs considers forgiven loans as income
honestly if you needed to borrow money to just live normally _would_ you still choose to throw an extravagant party i think that s what makes them shameless and the ahs
loaning the money doesn t make op an ah it just makes him delusional if he thinks he s going to ever see a dime of it back
yeaaah like wrt the money i think he s quite right but attitude wise they all sound awful
stop being such a scrooge because it is his birthday month
this you do not need an invite because you are paying for it i m petty i would show up and make a toast about how happy you are to see him enjoying his birthday on your dime
nta and this
the irs considers forgiven loans as income because they are
i would say that he s an enabler the loans are allowing them to continue to live above their means better to allow them to reach the point of bankruptcy and then use the 15k to pay school fees for the kids or put it in a college savings account in their names
it makes him a doormat he needed to grow a spine a long time ago he should sue to collect the 15k they owe him
or how happy i was that i no longer needed to loan them money because clearly if they can afford a big expensive party they don t need my money

nta letting her friends borrow your car absolutely not okay your car so your rules
wait your sister was lending out the car you lent to her to other people you don t know nope nta your sister is a boundary stomper let her insurance help with a loaner and get your car back asap if you haven t already
nta running personal errands herself seems fine and part of what she agreed to but letting anyone else use the car without your knowledge she s done no more the fact that she s calling you selfish and stingy unreasonable and talking crap about you behind your back is the final straw she owes you a major apology and needs to set the record straight with everyone she badmouthed you to shame she decided to ruin your relationship out of her own self centered assholeness
nta even let her friends borrow it without asking me oh no oh hell no with sprinkles on top don t give an addict money don t get involved in a land war in asia and don t give a reckless irresponsible person the keys to your car family or not
nta your car your rules i would also make sure that your keys are safe in case she tries to take the car anyway because it sounds like she feels entitled to your car
nta hold your ground you generously lent her your car set rules and you were right to do that she took advantage of you and is now throwing the family card at you let her think that you re the a shole and to anybody else siding with her you should publicly comment that it was great that they re basically agreeing to lend her their vehicle then
nta this car costs too much for  to take chances w it
nta she s lucky you let her borrow it that long she got defensive when you confronted her because she was wrong especially because she let other people drive it what happens when they have an accident you d say they were not given permission to drive it and then her whole world blows up
nta i m amazed you let her use it at all what would happen if she totalled yours
nta your sister completely ignored your rules
was she only supposed to drive to and from work i can see personal errands being a reasonable use however it is odd that so many people seemed to call you and report on your car being in odd places even let her friends borrow it without asking me nope nope nope that would end all car privileges for me she didn t respect your property done she can ride a bicycle to get around she might even like it
nta you had reasonable conditions for lending her the car she agreed to those conditions but ended up just doing whatever she wanted and got found out lending your car to other people is incredibly irresponsible the liability alone is a reason not to let her ever borrow your car again the terrible sister who doesn t care about her family is her not you
nta loaning out your car alone ends the deal she s incredibly disrespectful to you and your property
info why isn t she getting a rental with her insurance
nta i probably wouldn t have let her borrow it for a few weeks especially right after she had an accident was she added to the insurance if not and she got in another one it could be a big problem especially if she is then lending it out to other people there s ride share public transportation rental cars or she can go buy another
nta who loans out someone else s property to friends without permission from the original owner your sister broke the agreement so she is the ah not you
nta if she can t treat her own things nicely i d highly doubt she d treat yours any better to borrow your car is an ask not an order she has no authority here so you are perfectly entitled to say no to a request you aren t comfortable with the fact she let other borrow it too is at least dumb asf at most dangerous as anything that went wrong would in your name
i argued that i was happy to help her but i couldn t let her take advantage of me and my property this is the reason you nta she didn t respect your boundaries she doesn t get to use your stuff
your sister can rent a car is she even on your insurance
nta you did let her borrow your car she abused the privilege car goes buh bye people can t expect others to put their lives on hold bc their life is screwed up you were nice enough to trust her she broke that trust
info whose fault was the accident
nta you set clear expectations but they were not met to help and how much is your choice regardless of the of dna you share with a person she is clearly taking advantage of your good nature and you are well within your authority to set a boundary even one that makes her life just a little bit harder
she let her friends drive your car when you had loaned it to her oh she s lost her car privileges for eternity that s unacceptable nta
nta if one of her friends were driving your car and got jnto an accident your insurance probably wouldnt cover it tbh that also holds true for if she got into an accident driving i know i wouldnt be okay with that
nta you did not refuse she borrowed your car did not follow some pretty basic rules and lost her privilege
nta while i do think it s ridiculous to let someone borrow your car and not let them run errands they absolutely shouldn t be lending your car out to a third party she needed to get around the car was lent to her not her friends
it s my primary mode of transportation and i can t afford to be without it for too long y t a to yourself for loaning her the car nta and take the car back before something happens to it
nta you were very generous with her in letting her borrow your car at all i would not lend out my car to someone who totaled theirs even if they were family
just go low contact for a while she will con someone else in to letting her use their car and she will most likely fuck it up when that happens all those people condemning you will probably apologize for not seeing who she really is nta
nta can i borrow your car no why you lied to me so i do not trust you anymore she said that family should help each other out in times of need and that i was being unreasonable i was happy to help you out until i found out you lied you don t get to use my car because of you not me i m a terrible sister who doesn t care about her family i cared then you decided your friends driving my car was more important than your family you hurt your family not me
it s easy to see you re nta you set up some simple and reasonable rules she chose to break them open and shut case car lending is over she didn t need your car in the first place it was merely a convenience she could have rented many insurance policies cover up to days of rental even if not car replacement rental places have special low rates
nta your sister sounds very selfish and immature
nta did you get your car back for me that s the bigger concern
nta she should rent a car or ask her friends for rides your sister broke your trust and can t be trusted with your car
your sister should contact her insurance company i mean this is why people insure their cars she should be able to get a rental car covered by her insurance i would not let her use your car anymore her accident her lack of proper insurance is her problem
nta she violated your very reasonable boundaries
nta your conditions are completely reasonable and she can t abide by them
nta let her be mad your rules for letting her borrow it were reasonable but she refused to follow them she can take public transport or carpool
nta your sister sounds so entitled
nta i wouldn t be mad about her using the car to run errands but letting other people use it nope nope nope you don t know these people from adam for all you know they re on drugs or their license is suspended or they ve got warrants or who knows what one wrong move with someone else driving your car and you ve got a ton of towing fees to pay and a nightmare of impounds to deal with she was ungrateful and dismissive of your property therefore she doesn t get to use it
nta i d be curious to know if she had accidents before the totaling one but in this case you lent her a car and she abused the privilage she s right family should hekp and you did help but she has not respected you or your help
nta rental cars exist and super cheap to add to your insurance sis is an inch mile person always wanting more
nta don t let her borrow it ever again
nta i m sorry but what it was already a leap of faith to lend her ur car after she was careless enough to destroy hers and she has the gall to disrespect and break ur agreement as well i d go lc with her and ignore what her friends say out of sight out of mind and those apes can stick and enable each other s selfish behavior together
nta your sister is wrong because she should have stuck to the rules you set you were helping her a lot by letting her use your car but she took advantage by letting others use your car she s the one who doesn t care about her sister
nta you set boundaries and she didn t listen also let her friends use your car without telling you
nta
nta
nta she didn t follow the rules i let a select few people drive my car they are family members and on my insurance
nta sister can rent a car she is putting your car at risk
nta she sounds like an entitled brat she got angry and accused me of being selfish and stingy she said that family should help each other out in times of need and that i was being unreasonable i argued that i was happy to help her but i couldn t let her take advantage of me and my property don t help her then maybe one day she ll grow to appreciate what other people do for her and who borrows someone s car and then let s a friend borrow the car you re borrowing
nta here your sister is letting other people you the car she crossed the line get the car back and look after it properly
she lent your car that you loaned to her and her only as a favor in her time of need to her friends absolutely nta your insurance if they did cover an accident under these circumstances would go through the roof on renewal
nta she reeks of entitlement
nta my sister would do this during her troubles only with my mom s car not mine even letting her scummy friends borrow it without sis in the car not saying your sister s friends are scummy my sister s friends were scummy and i cannot tell you number of cars she has totaled but it is close to double digits i started sleeping with my purse keys in my room right by pillow even the spare my dad had was hidden in my room so i do not blame you for refusing to let her use your car i use mine to get to work run errands and just in live in general we live in the country there is no public transport option so i need my car
who is covered under your car insurance policy i m guessing sis her friends are not covered if any of them get into an accident you re the one on the hook for everything sis is already whipping up the flying monkeys wailing banshees to guilt you invite them to step up provide sis with a car they won t get your car the keys back pronto nta
nta if she s letting her friends borrow the car then it sounds like she doesn t need it as badly as she told you take your care and boundaries back
nta if only there were places to rent cars as needed
you are lucky your sis hasn t done huge damage to other people your car your responsibility
i don t think you can get too upset about her running errands with the car you let her use but under no circumstance should anyone be using the car other than her nta
nta but if she can t use your car for her personal errands what errands would she be using the car for you can choose or not choose to let her borrow your car she can t loan your car out to her friends
nta your car your rules she obviously has no respect for the very reasonable boundaries you set or appreciates your generosity she can go rent a car
nta your car your insurance she has no business loaning it out to anyone you set reasonable ground rules for using your car she broke them i m sure if she had been responsible and followed the rules you would have allowed her to continue to use it she can take public transportation to work or carpool with someone she can pay for gas since she doesn t have a car to drive she can use uber lyft for errands she can look around and find a cheaper car that she can afford to purchase she has options
nta it s a sad reality that your own blood will exploit familial relationships to their advantage to benefit themselves and then gaslight you and try to guilt trip you for having the audacity to call them out there is a difference between blood and family and not everyone who shares the same blood as you is your family and some of the most painful events in life will come from your most vulnerable areas blood i hope you can see clearly now and learn and grow from it good luck
nta someone needs to let your sister in on the secrets of asking for favors when you re dependent on someone else bc you re in a tough spot you are expected to maintain good rapport and act sensibly with their things otherwise they won t be inclined to help you anymore letting her friends use your vehicle without asking permission or letting you know is totally off limits
nta
nta ask yourself just one question can you afford to replace your car if your sister totals it
nta
nta funny how selfish people always result to that line about how family should help each other out as they abuse any help you did offer fuck her and her emotionally manipulative bullshit
nta this isn t close
nta she fo and fa that s what happens when you ignore simple boundaries
nta your sister thinks she s entitled she d also inconsiderate she s definitely an ah
nta this is so easy that i wonder why you even asked
another blatantly obvious nta but like of the posts here it is very rare that there is any question
hide an airtag in the car so you can always see where it is has been
yta for trusting her to abide by your conditions you grew up with her you know what she s capable of and how unreliable she is she actually lent your car to others who would have thought it right she has always been so scrupulous about respecting agreements and treating people fairly amirite she is in the wrong but you asked for it and you cannot say you are surprised at the way she abused your generosity
esh she should not have been letting your friends borrow it but i don t see how she broke any of the rules you laid out you never specified that she could only use it for work so why is the fact that she used it to run personal errands an issue
esh because why you lend her your car in the first place car rentals are widely available and she literally was just in an accident yes her lending the car out to her friends is moronic but what s wrong with personal errands you said in your post she could i would not let her use the based on the friends thing alone bu don t paint this as her violating boundaries or taking advantage of you and your property it s not that serious
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** my sister 28f and i 26f have always been close we live in the same city and see each other regularly recently my sister got into a car accident and totaled her car she was lucky to escape with only minor injuries but her car was completely destroyed since she relies on her car to get to work and run errands she immediately started asking around to see if anyone could lend her a car until she could afford to buy a new one i offered to let her borrow my car for a couple of weeks but with a few conditions first i asked her to cover the cost of gas and any maintenance or repairs that might come up while she was using it second i asked her to be responsible and take good care of the car as it s my primary mode of transportation and i can t afford to be without it for too long she agreed to these conditions and took my car however after a few days i started getting calls from friends and family members who saw my car parked in places where it shouldn t have been apparently my sister was using it to run personal errands and even let her friends borrow it without asking me i confronted her about this and she got defensive saying that it was just for a short time and she needed to get around i reminded her of our agreement and told her that she couldn t continue to use my car unless she respected my boundaries she got angry and accused me of being selfish and stingy she said that family should help each other out in times of need and that i was being unreasonable i argued that i was happy to help her but i couldn t let her take advantage of me and my property we ended up having a big argument and she stormed out of my apartment since then she s been avoiding me and telling our mutual friends and family members that i m a terrible sister who doesn t care about her family am i the asshole for refusing to let her use my car i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta why people keep doing favors to people like this
nta especially considering they are letting other people use your car however asking someone who is borrowing you car to pay for maintenance or repairs while they have it is a bit much repairs due to their actions yeah they are responsible i could maybe see an oil change if they used the car for more than say of the oil change interval random repair like alternator happens to go out that s a bit much to expect someone borrowing your car for a couple of weeks
nta what was meant by selfish was she did not want to be called selfish or stingy for saying no to a friend for loaning out your car to them because it s not like it matters to her if it gets broken hers is already totaled and likely having insurance things happen with it
nta
nta look up vicarious liability and you ll see why i never loan my vehicle to anybody i would sell her one of my cars for a buck so she could use it for a while after which she could sell it back but under no circumstances would i have lent it to her
seriously if the accident was her fault in no way shape or form would i let her use my car ntah
my dad told me before i got my first vehicle to not let anyone else drive it but me and rarely someone who if they borrowed it they d bring it back better than when they left with it i have followed that advice for over twelve years and no issues with my truck i now pass that advice along to my younger cousins i m sorry but you shouldn t have let her take your car lastly with these posts there s usually family and others bitching at you that you re terrible or whatever right tell them straight out and calm that she your sister can take their car if they feel so strongly about it watch the calls drift away i m not gonna give my aita judgment since i only read the title and the first line of your post
nta my car is my lifeline i can t afford to buy another one most people who barrow a car can t afford to buy me another one if they total my car they would probably be sorry but that doesn t change the fact that i don t have a car you let her barrow it and she not only took it to places you told her not to she even let someone else drive it do you think that person would have bought you a car if they had totaled it no you have her a chance and she blew it she has no one to blame but herself
nta you aren t even refusing to let her use your car you re refusing to let her trample your boundaries i absolutely loathe how selfish entitled ahs use oh but family to justify their manipulative abusive ways
you have to put the foot down quick in this situation you set the rules so she either abides or loses the privilege no offense to your sister but she sounds like a child who needs strict boundaries
info apparently my sister was using it _to run personal errands_ why is this a problem don t get me wrong lending to friends is not ok but as to the errand stuff you said earlier she relies on her car to get to work and run errands and you gave her two rules cover the cost of gas and any maintenance or repairs and be responsible and take good care of the car so i guess i m wondering why are you acting so butthurt about her using the car for a purpose you knew she needed it for and did not prohibit her from doing so
nta your sister is entitled and doesn t care about your property or you just herself
nope she s the big baby asshole
the only thing she will be able to do is say sorry when she fucks up your car and your insurance goes up tell her to take the bus nta
nta you were nice enough to let her use your car and you explained the conditions beforehand and she agreed to them now that she s not honoring the conditions you discussed with her you have every right to take back your car
very smart not allowing her to you will be out a car if someone totals it hide all your keys to be safe
nta never loan your car to anyone that isn t on your insurance duuuuuh
op nta she broke your generous agreement don t let her guilt you she had has options
she sounds like a spoiled brat nope you are definitely nta her entitled behavior is ridiculous
nta i have an almost identical story but loaned my sister my spare fun car she drove it more in weeks than it had been driven in years and destroyed it and had the nerve to ask me recently to borrow my daily driver for days to go out of town bc the car my mom and i bought her last year isn t running well she s and lives with my mom rent free has money for tattoos but not for a rental i m not on bad terms with her she thinks it s ok to ask for favors that are way beyond reasonable and spews vitriol when the answer is no you might want to seriously reconsider your closeness with your sister her problems are her problems not yours

nta you may want to confront your aunt thought maybe this never has to go to the bride tell her it s not okay and if she insists it s no big deal you can say well then i can tell the bride since it s no big deal
this is what the maid of honour bridesmaids are for tell them and rally their support to help you fix this without upsetting the bride ywbta
nta probably tell the bride or bridesmaid in private after the party or the next day give her some warning so she can either hash it out joke answer also maybe accidentally stain the white dress on the day so she can t wear it
nta i would tell the grooms mom what her sister is planning to do and let her handle it you already said she would throw hands so she may be the best one to deal with the situation and get the point across that this aunt should not be wearing white on someone else s wedding day that s super tacky you could also try speaking with the aunt who plans on wearing white directly and let her know that wearing white on someone else s wedding day is not ok and that if she insists on wearing white still that you ll tell the grooms mom who won t be nearly as nice about it as you are
don t tell her at her at the party but do tell her and be chill about it if you make it seem like it ll ruin her wedding she will too it shouldn t ruin the wedding she should ignore it and let the aunt look like an asshole nta for telling her but you would be if you told her tonight
nta you should tell her privately before and give her the opportunity to sort it before the wedding
nta but i would speak to the aunt first personally let her know multiple people disagree with her wearing white and it s not just nan being outdated if she s still adamant about wearing white then tell whoever is the relative of the aunt which sounds like the groom based on your wording it s his family his responsibility to handle
you wntbta if you told her ahead of time about the plans to wear white aunt knows what she s doing and yeah she will look stupid but the bride will feel upset and disrespected please tell her
nta tell someone asap the bride will thank you
nta you should inform the bride in private so that atleast she indirectly points out that wearing white will get them kicked out youd be doing a good favour for the bride preventing drama and the wedding from being ruined
so i ve seen a post a long time ago that was this story but on the wedding day the guy was asking if he was ta for pouring wine on the dress of a guest who d attended a wedding in a white dress the general consensus was that he wasn t ta and was in fact the hero i m not suggesting you do this but i doubt you d get in trouble for it and in fact it d probably go down quite well to advise your actual situation i don t think you d be ta but i think there is a better solution if the bride already has a lot of anxiety surrounding the wedding adding this absolute boulder of a problem will not help you are related to the other spouse i m assuming groom but regardless you get my jist you should inform them and just have the aunt removed from the guest list it s subtle it avoids further anxiety and it keeps the problem in a small circle
nta you should definitely do that to prevent a shock on the wedding itself your aunt seems rather inconsiderate
ywbnta just tell her and let one bridesmaid prepare a nice glass of wine for the accident
nta tell her maybe not on the hen night but tell her soon she has to know so she can confront the aunt and get your cousin involved i assume the aunt is your cousin s mother so he should have a word in it it can be an informal wedding but it doesn t matter even the stones know that wearing a dress similar to a wedding gown at other people s weddings is poor taste it s wanting to unleash a drama
nta her even thinking of wearing white is nutty to me yes even in especially without running it past the bride at the very least with the potential impact it could have on the wedding i would seriously consider saying something just so conflict can be avoided on the day
ywnbta i would suggest first trying to resolve the issue without directly telling the bride to not worry her if there is still time so talk to your aunt again first and if that does not work to the mother of the bride and ask her not to tell the bride if all that also does not work then you should definitley tell the bride
nta best to give her some warning so it s not a shock on the day
ywnbta because there was no reason for them to even talk about all of that if they weren t aware it was the wrong thing for your aunt to be doing they all know it s not kind to not tell the bride
ywnbta tell the bride when she has time not at the hen or something like that maybe start with you are not sure is there any dress code for they wedding like or no white dresses if she says no no dress code even after you mention white dresses there would be no need to ask or tell anything more but if she says obvious no white dresses you can tell her that you heard abaut your aunt who wants to wear white so you wanted to give her a heads up maybe so she can write a dress code out to everyone or to ask her fiancy moh or someone else to tell the aunt she can t wear white
your aunt is mistaken and someone needs to tell her so it s still inappropriate to wear white to someone else s wedding in please be sure someone talks to your aunt and tell the bride before her hen do so she can get someone to intervene maybe the maid of honor can tackle it nta
why don t you tell her fianc they re your cousin so you must be able to contact them and it s their mother that s wearing white right so maybe they can talk to her about the dress

ywnbta for the second time this morning the first rule of weddings is don t upstage the bride if no one can stop the aunt please try definitely warn the bride then she can decide whether to laugh it off or have a guard at the door
nta don t tell her at her hen night but make sure to tell her before the wedding so she can prepare herself like getting her moh ready to stumble and accidentally spill a large glass of red wine on mil upon arrival or even take precautions if she wants to exclude her justnomil anyone who knows and doesn t warn the couple is an ah themselves
yup ywbta just let the aunt make herself look like a jerk no need to inject yourself into guaranteed drama
nta but tell your other aunt the groom s mother now so the drama can hopefully happen and be dealt with before the day of the wedding so your mom and nan get mad at you so what they should have reined in aunt or told aunt when they heard about this rather than just twiddling their thumbs so yeah tell aunt and let her handle this mess
wnbta i just don t get all these people needing attention so badly that they d wear white off white to a wedding i d bring this up to the bride before the wedding day then she can figure out how to handle it
better to upset the bride and groom before the wedding than deal with the insult at the ceremony always difficult if you keep such secrets and the hurt party learns of your silence you become almost complicit if you think your aunt is being deliberately hurtful and provocative then i think you should tell the bride and let the cards fall where they may if you agree with your aunt then don t tell the bride and let the cards fall as they may the first option upsets your aunt the second option may end any friendly relationship you have with the bride or your cousin for that matter ywnbta in my view
info has anyone told the groom what his aunt is planning on wearing this is something he should handle tell the groom and tell the bridesmaids and maid of honor about it at the hen night and ask them if they think the bride should know
god please tell the bride if i was her i would want to know so i could set some very clear expectations to aunt about what she is not to wear who the hell things white is appropriate to wear to a wedding even if it s
mother if it s not a big deal than why shouldn t i tell the bride oh you mean it is a big deal so i m definately going to tell her nta
nta but don t get the bride to deal tell the grooms mom let her mom deal with it
please be man or woman enough to tell the bride the aunt sounds like a delusional narcissist mom is wrong so i ll call her an ah op you would not be ta if you broke the news yeah there ll be a family shitstorm but you will have been a mensch no gender implied
wonder if the bride and bridal party could come up with something of an add on garment sash see through overskirt train that would distinguish them and defeat the intent of your aunt if not that a tip to the photographer to insure aunt and her white dress would not be in any photos could also just ignore aunt everybody who sees her like that will think she s an ass
ywbta hear me out as to why you do not know this information first hand if it s wrong or misunderstood you will have created a mess the proper way to handle this is to tell your mom and aunt that they need to tell the bride what they heard that if you were the bride you would want to know something like this before the event so that you d be prepared
nta but if i m reading this right it s your cousin s mother planning this so the cousin is the one to tell and have him deal with his own mother the bride should have no reason to be bothered by it
nta find the clumsiest person and give them a snifter glass of chardonnay or an opened jar of marinara source i have did the opsie at a reception on a few times
at a friends wedding they put up signs outside the grounds stating only the bride is to wear white and any guests who chose to wear white and cross this threshold to the event are consenting to being paint balled and the ushers who play paintball oftern were given paintball guns this it ensured the monster in law backtracked home when she turned up in white and changed outfits before the wedding if your friend does this and the aunt complains they should say it s wedding dresscode violations like trying to upstage the bride have modern consequences for those who want to boundary stomp
you should warn your auntie that should she show up in a long white dress at a wedding a large glass of red wine will be waiting for her before she even gets past the coat check
this is why kids with ketchup squirt guns at the door is a great idea
nta shout it from the mountain tops and buy red wine
if you are afraid to tell the bride tell the bridesmaids they will be ready with a glass of red wine
am i the only one who thinks it s incredibly incestuous when people do this like they have this big fantasy in their heads that they are their relatives bride i would be asking your aunt why she wants people to think she ll be having sex with her nephew that night
ywbta if you said something it would cause unnecessary anxiety for the bride and your aunt may have a change of heart and wear something entirely different that day
ywnbta if you tell the bride but what good will it do give her time to freak out about it until her wedding and then also freak out when it happens the best thing would be for you guys to intervene with your aunt and make sure she wears something else or get someone to threaten to revoke her invitation
nta tell her tell her right now if you don t you ll be a massive asshole just check hey bride my mom told me aunt will be wearing a long white dress to your wedding and wanted to see if aunt had gotten to cleared by you yet
maybe tell you cousin he can call aunt to tell her to put on something else or to not come ywnbta please tell someone so this can be avoided
meet up with the aunt when she s getting ready and accidentally trip and spill a glass of red wine oops clumsy problem solved
ywnbta somebody should give her a heads up does your aunt have a history of whack behavior or is this a one off
ask aunt directly in person if she really wants to go trough with this white dress thing if it was a bad joke then you can end the gossip but if not and she won t be stopped by you than you have no other choice than informing grooms mam other aunt you can tell her that let the grooms mam do her thing then disinviting pooring a bottle of merlot taking a dog and making him water the dress whatever sends the message to crazy auntie and gives the marrying couple a happy day and no you won t be causing the drama that s what your aunt is up to you are just helping out by stopping the gossip and speak to the person involved your aunt does it flip back to you cause your nan would know who gossiped sounds like spreading rumour is a family tradition and you just took care for the bride
nta please say something to the bridesmaids or the brides mother or best yet the groom
either tell the bride the brides mother or the moh you would absolutely be ta if you don t
tell your cousin let him take care of his mother shame on her for this
nta i would also tell your cousin his mom sounds awful
nta yell your cousin the groom he should be able to handle it without the bride even knowing your aunty isn t your cousin s groom mother is she
nta but why can t you take it up with your cousin he can talk to his mom
nta tell the bride
nta your aunt must be a narcissist
ywnbta however tell the bride or the person you deem best suited to tell the bride a friend bridesmaid or the groom outside of any events it can be the day before or something like that but do not add to the stress of an event if at all possible even fun things like hen nights have their stressors it absolutely should be mentioned before the wedding day and i d say as far in advance as you can i know it s the bride s responsibility for handling her anxiety but i don t see any sense in adding to it if it can be avoided do not spend so much time figuring out who should tell her that you run out of time to tell her i don t know what your time frame is here but i d probably try not to take more than a couple of days less if possible it s a case of don t let perfect be the enemy of good and there will likely never be a perfect time to tell her i d also add tell her calmly you say the bride has anxiety issues and take that into consideration but honestly this is not the end of the world don t approach this in an ominous way or something that leads her to believe it s on the level that someone died i suspect the aunt is right to an extent and no one will really care or if they do it ll be more like can you believe that however i think she s being disrespectful and the bride should be ready for that
ywnbta i think that contacting your cousin is a better idea however
nta is your aunt the mother of the groom or also an aunt it s bad either way but it would be worse if it s the fiancs future mil
nta
nta and buy a bottle of red wine just sayin i heard it s great for calming nerves on a wedding day
tell her or your cousin he s probably closer to the situation or like some commenters have said tell the moh in fact i d plot with the other members of the wedding party for a nice red wine accident to happen to aunty before the ceremony you ve seen the stories of people doing that she needs to know how terrible this aunt is but you can take care of it ywnbta
nta time to loop your cousin in and have him talk to the problematic family member not sure if it s his mom or what but it s his family and he needs to handle it
info is this aunty the mother of the groom
ywnbta tell her just not during her party i think it d be best to try talk to the aunt first and then tell the bride and co
definitely tell her don t even wait text her so she can deal with it now
updateme
hens is not the time to tell her too much alcohol mixing with emotions call the groom i d feel betrayed if i found out people knew and didn t warn me i think ywb ta if you don t tell them or tell her at the hens
is this aunt your cousin s the one getting married mom could that talk some sense into her the bride should probably get a heads up though maybe call her the day after the hen night
walk around with a glass of red wine or whatever at the beginning of the wedding and then accidently bump into your aunt no need to tell the bride problem solved nta
ywbta because it s not your business however you should definitely tell your cousin what his mom is doing it is his business and if he doesn t handle it that s a problem for their marriage not for you
wait is it the mil or an aunt one or the other unless they re from west virginia or kentucky
nta this hen s night is perfect because that gives her wedding party the ability to plan how to take care of that spectacle looks like red wine should be on the menu or at least the wedding party should come out with a bottle just for them and have an accidental spill on auntie s dress go further to have money for dry cleaning or replacement only if she has a real receipt for it and post lots of pictures showing her before and after if her moh and bridesmaids are tight with her tell them and not the bride so they can handle it this way you can say that you did not tell the bride and hopefully the wedding party can take care of things either in a spectacular manner red red wine or discreetly red wine toast away from the bride s dress you know because bride s dress
nta make an excuse to visit your aunt and spill something that stains on the dress
this is what red wine is for
ywbta don t tell the bride it will just upset her for no good reason tell the aunty that weddings are the one time people do care and it s one of the worst faux pas you can do tell her it might even get her thrown out banned from getting in
nta you know what you must do make sure you have yourself a nice glass of red wine i don t care if you don t like red wine if your aunt shows up in a white dress run up to hug her and accidentally spill it all over her bonus points if you can get your other cousins to do the same thing would be a real shame if she had to leave because she looked like a costume murder victim and smelled like a winery
you would be if you told the bride given her anxiety she doesn t need this but do tell your cousin and other family members this is happening on your side so try to stop it there instead of making it a problem for the bride s side
you will nbta do what s right the bride will be so hurt if your aunt do show up in a white dress tell her brides maids and figure out how to tell the bride and what to do afterwards she s been planning this for years it ll be ruined so do the right thing do what you feel like is the right thing as long as you not let your aunt ruin the wedding ynta
if i was the bride i would be very happy to get this information immediately this aunt will be banned from the wedding and future gatherings it s obvious this aunt wants attention and is dragging everyone with her toxic behavior you would not be but ywbta if you didn t do anything to prevent this all this costly event was ruined by one person who does not respect anyone
nta you need to tell the bride and also your cousin let him back up his future wife
i don t know what to do i believe this situation should be mentioned beforehand and not on the wedding day i think your mom has a point that your aunt will look like an ass at the wedding if she chooses to wear a long white gown the concern that you have is how the bride will feel about it i think that you could address that aspect without having to stir up the drama that worries you it might be good to talk to the bride about how to handle unexpected things that come up at the wedding such as people who dress inappropriately her attitude and composure will go a long way toward guiding everyone else and keeping the event a smooth one i had a friend whose dress literally caught on fire and the wedding was not ruined because of how she handled it you plan for what you can plan for and then handle the rest with kindness class and a sense of humor a conversation about her mind set might help her anxiety as well yes the aunt is being completely inappropriate and she will be the one who looks bad for it not the bride unless the bride loses her cool at the wedding about it yes you should have a conversation with the bride ywnbta even if you choose to mention the aunt s inappropriate choice
nta tell her asap
have a door guard if she shows up in white don t allow entrance
nta but why not tell your cousin what his aunt is planning why put this on the bride who is not yet related to this person if you do feel the need to tell the bride do not do it as the hen night or any other celebration events contact her another time
nta your family can t have it both ways either it s and nobody will care in which case you can tell the bride and it won t matter or your aunt sucks and the bride should be warned either way you aren t wrong
disinvite the aunt and anyone who sides with her it s an absolute rule that no one wears white except the bride and the aunt knows this she s a real villain and her excuse about is just hogwash tell the bride now if she has been planning the wedding for two years she needs to know about this major glitch that is approaching boy that aunt is one evil piece of work
nta i would tell the maid of honor a bridesmaid or your cousin they are likely closer to her and can tell her perhaps the next day so she can still have her night and then find out before the wedding
i would tell your cousin and his mother yes your aunt will look stupid but this needs heading off at the pass and it needs heading off by aunt s family which is the groom and his mother don t stress the anxious bride as she can t really deal with this nta
nta at a friends wedding they put up signs outside the grounds stating only the bride is to wear white and any guests who chose to wear white and cross this threshold to the event are consenting to being paint balled and the ushers who play paintball oftern were given paintball guns this it ensured the monster in law backtracked home when she turned up in white and changed outfits before the wedding if your friend does this and the aunt complains they should say it s wedding dresscode violations like trying to upstage the bride have modern consequences for those who want to boundary stomp
nta for tell the bridal party and letting them deal with it alternately buy some unsweetened colored drink packets green purple mix together with water and shake well and then put in an opaque drink bottle with a wide drinking spout meet aunt at the door of the church and accidentally spill your smoothie on her it s and people can drink smoothies everywhere
nta discuss it with other bridesmaids first and figure out how to tell the bride but not at the hen party also definitely spill red wine on the aunt s dress if she does come wearing white
nta tell your cousin and let him deal with his aunt
nta but do it diligently by talking to the maids first and knock8ng this out before the bride catches wind of it traditional or not one rule is never upstage the bride never
nta i guess but how do you think telling the bride vs just talking to your family members will help it seems like you want to limit or avoid a fight or hurt feelings but it seems like that isn t going to happen no matter the choice i think it is best to talk directly and in a less public wayto whoever you talk to do you want the bride and groom to do a confrontation or just uninvite the aunt ultimately it is just a dress and while your aunt is a drama stirring ah maybe people should just laugh at her and move on
nta
you need to tell the bride so that she can either be prepared for this to happen or deal with it before the wedding

nah i think it is an unfortunate circumstance you were valid in your concern about her and walking into the hospital to check in on her and she is right in trying to safeguard her personal life from a system and space that will be discriminatory and potentially even hostile upon learning her sexuality and marital relationship it is super concerning though how you both have spent years not ever discussing the toxicity and duplicity of working in the industry that she is in and how she might have to safeguard and keep her personal life away from her work life it is easy to assume that she is embarrassed of you or your relation but as someone who has known people in medical field it is equally possible she did it to not create a hostile environment for herself or to avoid people making unwarranted comments about you and her relationship this could be a big emotional and psychological toll you both need to sit and talk check in on why she felt exposed with your visit and if she is keeping her sexuality hidden and work and how that would make you feel not ever queer person wants to be an activist at their work it is a hard battle up hill and shouldn t be their burden to fight always
nah you both have what appear to be legitimate concerns when things are calmer talk them through it may be she s seen a track record of discrimination and is seeking to avoid it
i don t think you re an asshole but i find it curious that in years neither of you have ever visited the other person s place of business have you met any of her coworkers and vice versa it seems like there is a very long history of keeping your personal life together and your professional lives completely separate
nta because she never told you not to come to work so my guess is she s in the closet or maybe has the so called work wife see if you can get an honest explanation if it s a male dominated field if it s a gossipy work place there might be a more innocent reason
it honestly just sounds like your wife doesn t want to deal with anyone who is toxic in her workplace it doesn t make her ashamed or embarrassed but she just doesn t want to be harassed about her sexuality especially if it s male dominated women can also be cruel in that as well
nta you had a need to know what was happening and whether you needed to stay or leave her response is worrisome you need to talk to her about it
nta the real root of it is consent had she told you about her concerns regarding her work beforehand how she didn t want them to know due to politics in the workplace and you had a chance to give feedback instead you come across as your wife s shameful secret and that must have hurt a lot on a level of this i recommend couples therapy of some sort
nah because you weren t in the wrong but your wife is understandable that said if she didn t want anyone at work to know about her being married to a woman she ought to have told you this she has reasonable if very sad concerns i m sure you two could ve worked this out if you d been clued in on it but she can t be mad at you for breaking rules that you didn t know existed
yta someone with a minority gender sexuality status should have control over who knows about it and when you violated that unintentionally but when you doubled down and decided be the aggrieved party you became ta
nta because you had no idea she wanted you to obscure your relationship with her when you inquired about her at work what strikes me is your utter lack of intimacy or communication frankly but i don t think you did anything wrong this time if you continue to out her knowing she doesn t want that different story
info where do you live in a lot of ways it doesn t matter because there are biggots everywhere but some places make it easier to be openly biggoted do the two of you never discuss work
nta and if you did accidentally out her by going in that s on her for not telling her wife of years that she s still in the closet at work and hiding your existence from her coworkers
the ah here are your wife s toxic homophobic colleagues i m sorry you have to put up with this nta
nta but it sounds like your wife isn t out at work and you outed her one would think after years it would have come up but she should have discussed it with you so you had a heads up in case something like this were to happen oopsie
as the child of two women i have to go with nta i understand where eve is coming from she seems less ashamed and more protective but you didn t know what she expected in that situation your focus was on your kids as it should have been and i agree with what others are saying that communication between you two relating to work needs to happen but you ll run into more situations like this inevitably that s just life as a couple and parent i ve seen my parents navigate parents not wanting one of my moms on the pta because she wasn t really my mom the 90s so male dominated work environments aren t going to be the only places you might run into friction because unfortunately intolerant people just exist but i think you should accept your wife s apology and talk
nta if she wants to hide out in the closet that s your business too and it s ultimately her choice but she needs to let you know if she wants you to be a goddamn secret she probably didn t want to let you know because for a lot of folks this would be a deal breaker i know it would be for me here s some elder gay lore during the early years of aids there were a lot of patients who sickened and died right away and a lot who lived for many years straight doctors were stumped as to the difference between the two populations it took a gay doctor to realize the ones who died fast were closeted closeting is a stressor and having lgbtqia folks in medical fields is crucial for our health it is up to her to choose what to do with her public presentation but she needs to tell you ahead of time
nta if she isn t out at work she should have told you not everyone is comfortable being out in their professional space and that s fair but if you want your wife to help you lie you need to clue her in and talk about it she cut you out of the loop on something really important
nta but i totally get your wife s pov i ve never hid my sexuality bc i don t care but i have hidden other important parts of my life because i knew how the environment around me was for example i m hispanic but don t look like the stereotype and live somewhere where hispanic people are discriminated against just because it s still wrong on her part to get upset with you over it though
nta you expressed your emotions and feelings to your partner which is appropriate and you were valid she s only mad that you basically outted her at work probably either as a wlw or as a person who s married i hope for your sake it s the former and not the latter i d recommend working with a couples counselor if you can t get past your hurt
nta she told you to come pick her up if there were rules that needed to be followed because of her bigoted coworkers then she needed to communicate that in advance
yta if you re married to a doctor who works in a hospital it should hardly be surprising that they might get called to an emergency and be uncontactable at times you could have just texted that you figured she got caught up and you were going to head home knowing a grown adult could find their own way home from work i suspect you went into the workplace because you had some kind of suspicion which may have been warranted if after years i had never met someone my spouse worked with or been to their workplace i d be suspicious too
op as a fellow gay person i m sure you know that with homophobia on the rise she s likely trying to protect you right
nta it sounds like she s ashamed of her sexual orientation in this day and age as far as i can tell most people don t care who you re sleeping in love with
esh you went wrong when you went on a rant and continued the argument even after the apology i understand why you went inside and why it makes you angry but i also understand why she might not want people at work to know because of this my friend told me she works in a ridiculously male dominated field of speciality and her concerns were valid maybe she is not outed at work because she knows it won t be accepted by her colleagues and it is not a safe or comfortable environment for her to come out that does not mean she is ashamed of you but she should have told you earlier that she did not come out at her workplace yet
i think your wife is having an affair nta
yta i bet doesn t see it as a liability per se she s just not out at work i know lots of people me for example who keep their private life way from their co workers
nta she is clearly embarrassed of the relationship in some way is there any way she isn t out to her colleagues at work
her response sounds like she s ashamed of the relationship
esh you for being in a same sex relationship for years and not understanding that homophobia is a real thing i mean you insisted she must be ashamed about your relationship rather than undrstanding that there are workplaces where knowledge of a same sex spouse could make that person s life a living hell her for never having spoken to you about this before had she told you how toxic her workplace is to queer people then you would ve been forewarned and forearmed about it rather than blindsided by it but tbh you must know that people can be gigantic ah about queer people patients may even say they don t want to gay doctor or other bs like that i m kind of surprised that you re surprised that there are many unsafe places for queer people
ooh there s two things here going inside when you didn t know she wasn t out at work nta shes little bit the asshole for not telling you she just how private she keeps things at work and then getting mad at you for blowing up about it your rant about her being ashamed of you yta you ve already said that she is very proud about her ability to keep her home and work life separate so you know thats not what this is she s in a male dominated field and even without the not straight aspect women are always judged harshly for the way their personal life is conducted like even in corporate world straight women are judged for the strain of a family and its never thought twice about it when it comes to men being in a toxic environment where she knows her sexual orientation will put her at a disadvantage thats totally not at all about you but you made it about you so now yta
yta
nta either of you really your concern is justified her wanting g to keep her sexuality private from work is also fine personally i think it s shit that people feel the need to hide that sort of thing but i can totally see it being necessary in some industries healthcare is one of those industries that can harbor a lot of bias even though their profession requires them to work with all people
yta for going in when you know what your wife does for a living it makes sense that she might not be able to answer your text right away unless you thought she was injured or something you had no reason to go in i m not even addressing whether her coworkers know about you or not that s a whole other issue but i don t see why you had to go in when your wife is a doctor you know she can t always talk when she s literally dealing with patients all day why try to rush her out you could have just waited or texted her that you were going home to relieve the sitter and she could call you when she could
op is definitely nta i work in healthcare as well and let me tell you something first off it doesn t matter if your work place is male or female dominated people shouldn t be harassing you for your sexuality it s none of their business and even if people knew it s not a reason to be singled out at work that s a bs excuse the wife s behavior is fishy i do understand that confidentiality is important and that work life should be left at work that s not the issue the issue that i m seeing based on op s wife s reaction and her reasons for the recation is unsettling she s acting like her spouse is a stranger and that she s ashamed of being in a lesbian marriage you d think that being with someone for years with kids you wouldn t care about what other people have to say about you if her workplace is so toxic or homophobic then maybe she should bring it up to her higher ups report any verbal harassment from the other workers or find another work environment why would she be keeping your marriage so secretive i m in a straight relationship and if my fianc m acted like that i d be very concerned you shouldn t be ashamed of who you re with op definitely has every right reason to be upset
your wife is a homophobe

nta
nta after being married for years and this is the first you re hearing about it could be totally innocent and her not wanting to be outed at work could be a legitimate reason it s just weird that she has never mentioned it prior and has never asked you not to show up there before just alittle sketchy but maybe she was trying to hide that side of her work from you idk and i don t want to speculate too much
nta for being upset but you two need marriage counseling why don t you know that things are this bad for her why isn t she fully sharing her life with you it is ok not to share everything with your spouse but this is a really big thing
nta op with that said her reaction should be worrying to you imo i think you need to sit down with her and have a chat with her about what happened and about your relationship talk about everything again have an honest open talk again i mean
nta but i don t necessarily think she is either i think each of you should approach the topic once you ve both had time to cool off and can have a productive conversation about the whole thing i ve worked in the medical field since years old and let me tell you as a bisexual woman it is grueling it s already heavily dominated by males who for the most part think women are incapable and incompetent but it can be very toxic wanting to safeguard herself and her home life from that sort of thing is understandable you being upset that she started an argument over this also understandable
nah she said she would be there shortly then she wasn t you were going to end up having sitter issues and you were trying to avoid them she s concerned about perceptions in the workplace my thought is that you both should see a counselor together doesn t have to be a medical doctor i can appreciate your feelings but i can also understand her concerns the fact is that the cat is now out of the bag she needs to find a way to be more comfortable with the situation i mean what does she do about work related affairs dinners etc does she go alone and pretend to be single does she find a male to escort her how does she explain her kids if she never acknowledges your their existence while she s at work she s living a very lonely and closeted existence i know your feelings are hurt and rightfully so but have you given any thought to the concerns she s expressed i m just saying everyone needs to work together to find a meeting place somewhere along the way
nta she should have had someone call the house and leave a message about her being late
nta sorry you and your children have to live in secret in the 21st century
nah i don t think she s ashamed of you i think she s in an awful position
nah you have every right to feel upset about the way she reacted but i understand her reason for not wanting ppl to know because god knows how weird people are towards lesbians wlw i think she should ve told you that no one at her job knows she s married to a woman then at the very least you could ve discussed it what to do in a situation like this
nta your wife is closeted at work and didn t bother telling you that s a big thing not to know
nta it doesn t sound like it was discussed beforehand if you live in texas or idaho or some other red state i understand her reaction but stand up for yourselves i hope she ll someday be proud to announce you as her wife f and all the gop for that matter
nta out of respect for your partner and your years of marriage please find a time when you can calmly discuss this tell her you are very concerned that she is working in an environment like this and concerned about toll it will take on her ask her why she feels the need to work in a place like this maybe it is the easiest means to a goal that matters to her let her know that her hiding you hurts your feelings maybe the two of you can find a way to get her out of that toxic environment so you can live your lives openly
nta you didn t know that her coworkers weren t aware of your existence i can understand why finding out like that would hurt even though she absolutely should have told you your wife isn t wrong for wanting to keep her home work life separate i wouldn t take it personally being a woman in a boys club work environment is a constant uphill battle i don t doubt that your wife is correct in thinking that her being a queer woman could add to the imbalance it s bullshit but it s true communication is key in resolving this ensuring something similar doesn t happen in the future good luck
nta she hiding something deeper
i bet the wife is an ortho it s such a boys club
nta but if she does not want you to out her at work then you should respect her wishes outing someone against their wishes is not ok
info eve has always managed to keep work and home life very separate and prides herself in doing that why would that be something to be particularly proud of
nah sounds like your wife is a surgeon the specialty has stereotypically been toxic male dominated and conservative her colleagues knowing about her private life could potentially make daily work and career advancement more difficult so her concerns are valid and yours are too also i imagine if she were mid operation when the hospital called her the person taking the call likely just yelled out across the or that her wife is waiting for her in front of everyone it just sounds like unfortunate timing and a communication gap
nta but i can see your wife s side every nursing facility i have worked at whether it be a hospital or nursing home is nothing but drama amongst coworkers it feels like high school all over again except 10x worse i just want to give you insight and validate that what your wife is saying does actually happen
nta and the reason is if she s in the closet her spouse needs to know about it what if something happened to her and you had to deal with her work hell what happens if she ends up injured at her workplace also being in the closet is a deal breaker for more than one lgbt person i know hell if she had been honest you could have known for sure to just go home after minutes or something
nah it s unfortunate for you both but it s your wife who will have to deal with this everyday as well as the shame of hiding it the problem isn t with your wife it s society you re a team don t forget that
maybe she should just wo man up if she has the intestinal fortitude to become and work as a surgeon she most certainly has the cojones to stand up to other people for being gay what if there is a work gala would you not be invited by her or are you passed off as her plutonic friend at some point you have to stand up for yourself and more importantly for the ones you love nta
yeah as a queer person i cannot imagine not having had this conversation preemptively if being in the closet was so important to me it s high time you have it now op
it is super concerning though how you both have spent years not ever discussing the toxicity and duplicity of working in the industry that she is in and how she might have to safeguard and keep her personal life away from her work life i mean it doesn t sound like she ever told op about any of this or even that she was still in the closet and hiding her relationship from her coworkers so it s not weird or concerning that op hasn t brought this up that said it is a bit weird that they ve never really talked about her work at all but everyone is different i myself do my best to avoid talking about work to anybody cause i don t like thinking about work when i m not working so i get it
you were valid in your concern about her i don t think the op s concern was valid her wife was in work and common sense should tell you that doctors of all people have to deal with emergencies and have times when they can t use their mobile phones i m sure the op s wife has been late home more than a few times in their year relationship
very wise
this is what i was thinking as well it sucks that some people hide who they are but other people can make your life and career a living hell because they don t like your lifestyle or choices
years with my husband and we never visited each other at work his workplace was incredibly toxic and he did not want them to know anything about his personal life when they learned he was getting married his mom put an announcement in her towns paper they tried to convince him to leave our honeymoon in st lucia and fly to a work meeting in miami my job had security concerns and did not allow visitors we never met coworkers wither since we never spent time with any outside of work not that curious a situation
i agree like wouldn t op know about her wife s work schedule i don t think it s crazy for a doctor to have to stay minutes late
so my guess is she s in the closet or maybe has the so called work wife eh i wouldn t jump to this conclusion based on the fact that they ve been together for years and neither one of them has ever visited the other person s place of work sounds like they both keep business and personal strictly separated
she s a surgeon it seems to be going into an emergency or i can t imagine her job not being secure in today s climate she s already at the top pretty much
maybe has the so called work wife or work husband
she should report anyone harassing her about her sexuality because it is literally not safe to have homophobes working in a hospital where lgbt patients come through being secretly closeted when you re married is an asshole move to the spouse too op is nta for being hurt about being kept a secret
we fight back and normalize it not keep our spouses secret
i wish this was true but there s plenty of queerphobia and homophobia these days there s an enormous difference between not wanting to be harassed and undermined at work for being gay queer and being ashamed of your relationship
in her defence most workplaces in healthcare are toxic she may just be very private and closed off and keeps to herself to avoid being pulled into drama but if that is the case she should have a discussion with her partner and explain
based on what her tone that s not really reliable evidence of anything i don t want anyone at my work to know anything about my life either
oh trust summer child we know homophobia exists we know
it s not fine homophobes shouldn t be allowed to work in hospitals it s not safe for gay patients op has an obligation to report coworkers with dangerous beliefs
exactly your partner and your home should be your safe space wherein you can confide in harder and more bitter aspects of life i hope op and the partner can find a way out of this and talk through how they reached this place in companionship
this not intermingling work and home is super important i have worked places with people for years and couldn t tell you anything about their personal life cause they are not my friends they are my co worker
yeah with the sitter issue i would have just said i was here but i have to go get kiddo let me know if you want us to swing back by to get you otherwise see you at home i might be concerned something was wrong if i didn t get an answer from my spouse but knowing her profession emergencies are probably not uncommon
she should have sent a message what i fear is that if op left she would be in trouble with the wife if she doesn t solve the problem caused by her wife s poor communication and somewhat selfish attitude about time then she is rude to the babysitter i would say nah but really the biggest issue is the partner s poor communication about both the delay and about the situation at work
i agree there are some situations where it might be the norm but if it is the case for op and their wife as it has been for years i don t understand why op thinks the wife s response is odd if you ve kept personal and professional strictly separated for over a decade and then suddenly that changes it seems to me that some people might be upset or taken aback by it i don t think op is an asshole at all but i also think when you keep such stringent lines between personal and professional don t expect the other person to necessarily be thrilled when that changes
a decent thing to do is to tell your partner that you may be running late after telling them to come get you going into a surgery after agreeing to get picked up is a great example especially if it involves being without your phone while someone is waiting on you
ahhh one would think but there are many many homophobic boys club surgery departments out there i suspect op s wife just doesn t want her romantic personal life to be a topic for discussion she wants to be seen as a medical professional and surgeon at work only and not have any discussion of her home life which is completely understandable i think op didn t mean any harm and nta for that but i do understand where her wife was coming from completely source female surgeon
her job may technically be secure from being fired but not necessarily from ridicule from homophobic coworkers
you may not be aware that in the us one of the new fronts in the war on women is religious foundations and churches buying up hospitals and shutting down eg reproductive health care she may well have good reason to be concerned
knowing you have a husband and what he looks like isn t exactly spilling your personal life
keeping your personal life separate from your professional life is one thing your colleagues aren t entitled to parts of your life that don t affect them but not talking about your job or profession with your life partner is really weird she s hiding a huge part of who she is from her wife especially when she works in a high stress job like medicine does she never share a bad day with her spouse the last few years have been brutal for health care workers did she just hide her sadness and stress from her wife because she has a boundary about keeping work and home separate
maybe she was afraid that leaving would just cause the wife to call her an ah a lot of people are afraid of their partner s reactions to reasonable things
op s wife went into emergency surgery do you think she should ve stopped to text op she s running late another decent thing to do is understand and respect your partner s work responsibilities
in emergent situations it s understandable that you won t always have the time or availability to do so
not to mention many hospital systems are faith based and therefore can skirt some of the rules based on handbook bylaws codes of conduct etc she could also know that this would get her the garbage shifts or prevent her from advancing getting better equipment or staff etc
knowing you a woman have a wife is not the same thing as knowing someone has a spouse homophobia is real
could be she knows her wife would go all in on drama given an opportunity i got a sil like that constantly looking for a fight
she s a surgeon she most likely can afford to uber home i d be mad if i waited minutes to pick someone up and they were taking out an appendix and i m sitting there like an idiot do i think my minutes is more important than another person dying no however i would appreciate my time being respected a surgery tech could text op and tell them the situation while they do their job no one needs to know the relationship as long as it doesn t say wife if the contact info
i totally missed it was women still shouldn t be ashamed or worried as a whole i think most people are not homophobic those that are tend to be the loudest maybe it s just the people i know
okay
whether or not most people are homophobic is irrelevent when it only takes one homophobic person at work to make your life a living hell
it always only takes one person you don t need to be gay for that to happen can literally happen to anyone in situations like that people often find support there s more good than bad and there s laws and workers rights that protect against that kind of harassment

nta has your dad apologized to you your grandmother shouldn t have had to intervene in their wedding planning to make sure you were included because your dad should have taken that stand first there should have been no reason for him to be embarrassed about the disparity in christmas gifts because he should have known what they were giving the kids and made sure it was equitable it sounds like this current request for an apology is just your dad once again disregarding you in favor if his wife without taking any accountability for his own role in the matter
your father needs to understand that the reason he and his wife are in couple s counseling is because of how his wife treated you asking you to apologize is once again allowing her to pretend you are the problem simply for existing and being loved by your dad what does he want you to say to her i m sorry you never wanted me i m sorry that you resented me i m sorry that you were expected to treat me as having equal important to my siblings i d point out to him that the problem has always been how she chose to treat you and you stopped speaking to him because he allowed it if he s looking to make you the problem then maybe he isn t ready to be a part of your life yet she s the one who created the rift in their marriage by treating you unkindly asking you to apologize for that only shows that she hasn t grown or changed at all she still wants to blame you instead of accepting responsibility for her actions nta
nta what even are you supposed to apologise for existing
i will admit for context i was not a nice teenager i was highly intelligent and very good at picking up ppls insecurities once she threw down the gauntlet and made it clear she didn t like me it was game on for me and i picked at every single insecurity she had my mom tried counseling her on how to parent me but it truly was like she hated that even more i am willing to apologize for threatening her mom because i was raised better than that but between the disrespect that day the crossing of sooooo many boundaries and my grief of losing my grandmother suddenly i truly snapped but everything else i feel like she needs to charge it to the game
nta i told him that i m open to rebuilding my relationship with him that s what he needs to listen to if he really wants a relationship with you both of you need to work at it he asked are you open to apologizing to your stepmom she feels she deserves an apology that s not how to go about it he feels i should be fine apologizing so we can fully reconcile as a family but i don t view her as a parental figure an i ve no interest in being a family again he needs to listen to you is this all about making his life easier or genuinely having a relationship with you
fifteen years have passed and he still doesn t get it nta it doesn t matter how good of a father he was because all of that is gone by the fact he let someone into his life that treated you as less and worse wants you to apologise for it it s best for your own sanity to just keep him out of your life
info is she expected to apologize to you either way nta it just adds an extra level of narcissism if she refuses to acknowledge her role while demanding an apology for your reaction to her actions
nta he betrayed you by not dealing with her treatment of you he needs to apologize and so does she you have nothing to apologize for
nta but i would be up front with your dad and say the only apology you can sincerely offer is one where you say you are sorry you lost so much time with him because you reacted poorly to his wife s abuse i d also acknowledge that neither an insincere apology nor the only one that can honestly be given are likely to help things particularly given that stepmom doesn t seem ready to acknowledge the reality that she was in fact abusive to you but you d certainly hear her out if she was ready to sincerely apologize for what she did if not and you feel generous you could offer to treat her like a polite stranger so long as she does likewise and hopefully that works for all of you i would tell your dad if it doesn t the best you can do is have a one on one relationship with him where you and stepmom never talk or cross paths at all
nta unfortunately this just proves nothing has changed your dad still isn t protecting you he s still propping up your step mother and he s still willing to allow her to mistreat you you don t have to subject yourself to that
nta your dad turned his back on you the day he realized his new wife was mistreating you and he tolerated it he should be demanding that she apologize to you and then hope you are willing to continue a relationship with him after he also apologizes he has some audacity to think it should be the other way around
nta your stepmother crossed many lines and your dad did nothing to stop it i hate step parents who think they can cross the lines just because of their family
nta why do so many enablers your dad stepdad think it s up to the child to forgive and accept bad behavior that fundamentally didn t change your dad stepdad isn t asking you to accept her apology and move on in harmony he s asking you to simply accept her bad abusive relationship he has options address his wife s bad behavior and tell her to apologize and change that ain t happening have a relationship with you on the side but leave her out of it have no relationship with you not complicated good luck
i am so sorry that this is happening to you all over again you owe nothing to your stepmom if anything i feel like she should be apologizing she was the grown up and should have known better i hope you can still have a relationship with your dad
nta you do not have to accept anything or apologize if you don t want to you say you dont have any interest in being a family so be it
nta obviously therapy isn t working if your father is asking you to apologize to your stepmother i can t imagine any therapist agreeing with your father s statement that you are the reason they are in couples therapy your stepmother treated you differently because you were not your father s biological child your father allowed that to happen i wonder what he would have done if your stepmother had treated his biological children the way she treated you would he have stood up for them
tell her you re sorry she mistreated you
nta don t apologize in fact let him know how little she means to you as a person and that you hold strangers in higher regard than her
fuck that from your description she sounds at the very least cold hearted and entitled and at the very worst wantonly cruel from your post you have not a single thing to apologise for and personally this would be a hill i would die on she treated you dreadfully she was openly and intentionally hostile she demeaned you privately and in front of others criticised your mother and rejected you and refused to accept you as part of the family how your reaction to this treatment can possibly warrant an apology from you is beyond the most fevered imagination your stepfather dad was guilty by his neglect and absence both physically and emotionally by supporting her treatment of you he is every bit as guilty as if he d done and said those things himself it was his responsibility to protect you from the cruelty of his wife and he failed obviously i do not know a single thing about you but from the details in your post this anonymous old bloke from the uk would be very disappointed if you ever spoke to the woman again much less apologised ultimately you have to do whatever you feel is right to do for your own wellbeing if you feel the rewards for apologising to your abuser are worth the humiliation then you have to do it for your own sake however there is not a snowball s chance in hell that i would apologise to someone who had treated me like that i would feel sullied and dirty nta nta nta nta nta ad infinitum nta
nta my step mum made my life hell when i was younger and it wrecked my relationship with my dad as well he never stood up for me never took my side and generally just stood on the sidelines while she relentlessly bullied and harassed me i m sure i said some things i shouldn t have at some point but i was a kid you were a kid it was never on us to be the grown ups in that relationship you don t owe her an apology and you can still love your dad without apologising this seems really manipulative on his part to make things go away without standing up and taking a side
nta if anyone is owed an apology it s you
nta i m not clear on what it is that you re supposed to apologise for i don t think your dad even knows what it is he s simply been told by his wife what she expects it s all very stupid and i admire you for having the patience to hear him out he wants a quiet life he s looking in the wrong direction at the source of his problems don t give in x
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** i f30 was raised by my stepfather dad from 9months until my parents split and although my stepfather was not my biological father he included me in his custody agreement with my younger sibling we spent every other holiday and most of the summers with him barring deployment he met my now stepmother she was a single mom in the same career field as him our relationship was always rocky i felt she made digs at my mother for having a lower economic and educational level than her at the time my dad deployed often but he did not want to amend lose any time with us so we kept the custody schedule but just went with her the major incidents i can remember she did not want me in their wedding and my paternal grandmother had to threaten to have none of the family show up if she didn t put me in the wedding during christmas it became apparent i was given much less than everyone else the other children were given scooters as the big gift of the year my dad was embarrassed since up to that point mom always had us for christmas stepmom made a big stink about how that wasn t fair and then pulled this crap my grandmother passed and at the repast my stepmother introduced me as ______ s stepdaughter while my parentage was not a secret most of the family just knew me as his child my gpa could not bear to enter the house or to even sleep in their room he was so upset about the death her mom decided that she would watch tv in their bedroom while laying on their bed i physically threatened her mother and barricaded myself in the room while sobbing hysterically i told my mom i wanted to find my real dad it hurt his feelings and he wrote me a long email basically saying that i needed to learn to get along with his wife for the sake of the family i told my dad that if he was accepting of how she treated me then i no longer wanted to be apart of his family i did not speak or see my dad again until i was i wasn t ready fast forward to age and he reached out again and i was still not ready he has according to my sister been going to therapy he started reaching out to me more insistently recently and after going to therapy myself i felt ready to at least have a conversation i told him that i m open to rebuilding my relationship with him he gave me his viewpoint on the situation at the time he always assumed that i would eventually come around he asked are you open to apologizing to your stepmom she feels she deserves an apology since the situation between my dad and i has caused continuous strain on their marriage and although not the only factor it s a big factor in them being in therapy as a couple apparently he feels i should be fine apologizing so we can fully reconcile as a family but i don t view her as a parental figure an i ve no interest in being a family tldr my dad remarried someone who disliked me and we didn t speak for almost years now he wants me to apologize to his wife in order to fully reconcile i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta apologize for what he s got it wrong she needs to apologize
nta your dad has a terrible therapist or is lying about going no therapist would recommend you apologize tell your father f off and he s p0s
has your father ever apoligized to you for being a doormat nta
nta isn t it the opposite he is supposed to get his wife apologise to you then you get to consider if you want him in your life again
nta why are you being asked to apologize she s the one that should be apologizing to you she s the one responsible for the strain on their marriage not you
nta a few years ago i read a quote that goes it is never the child s responsibility to mend their relationship with their parents and it has stuck with me since your dad and stepmom are t as here
you know you aren t ta there is absolutely no reason for you or anybody for that matter to reconcile with anyone who has treated you poorly in the past if you wouldn t want to she s demanding an apology out of you and i guarantee you will still receive the same treatment from her and it will continuously drive a wedge b n you and your dad the way i see it your dad needs to rebuild your relationship on your terms nta
nta apologise for what for existing so she could treat you like that the only reason they have marital problems is because of her treatment towards you why should you be the bigger person why is it always the wronged party that has to be the bigger person
i honestly think you and your stepdad should be in a counselling session together so a therapist can be the one to tell him how fucked in the head he is for wanting you to apologise to his disgusting wife
nta tell your dad he needs more therapy to understand that you have no interest in his wife and it is because of how she treated you the one needed to change is her not you and you re doing just fine without her in your life
nta you don t owe her anything it s just another one of her power plays
nta frankly i wouldn t bother talking to your dad as long as his wife is in the picture she s so toxic that you shouldn t have to ever deal with her again he chose her over you and he got her if he wants it the other way around there are plenty of divorce lawyers out there
nta am i missing something your stepmother was an adult who mistreared you and your dad let her and now after therapy dad wants you to apologize to the step mother to re establish relations yeah no this would not work for me
i will always love and appreciate everything you did for me growing up but your current wife is a toxic woman who wants absolutely nothing to do with me she has treated me horribly ever since the moment we met and you have never done a single thing to stop her so unfortunately as long as she is a part of your life i can not be i wish things could be different but it is clear you are never going to hold her responsible for what she did to me and will always expect me to sweep everything under the rug because it s easier than her being held accountable you made your choice you chose her now it s time you learned to live with that decision please do not contact me again nta
nta hes completely in the wrong and you need to tell him you arent talking to him again until she apologises for treating you poorly for all those years i cluding specifics like christmas but your mom kind of an a too for letting you continue to go there that long it should have ended by at least that christmas she didn t need a judgement to say my girl isn t going to spend any more time with that witch everyone would have let you stay with mom why did your mom let it continue
nta my response would have been not nice something along the lines of an apology to him it probably would have been sorry you couldn t keep your asshole wife in line enough to have a good marriage not my circus not my monkeys nice to see i wasn t the only one she treated like crap i just peaked at the comments and see you have that in mind anyway
nta but you have to accept there will be no reconciliation unless both you are his wife apologize to each other so you can stand your ground but it won t make things better he s not going to divorce or exclude his wife from his life
nta while now as an adult you could be the bigger person this all stemmed from your stepmother bullying you as a kid she and your dad are the ones that need to apologise and attempt to make things right not you
nta that women can t take accountability for her actions and has been blaming you since you were a child for their marital problems even though you re not even around sorry you had to go through that op
info i m not questioning the wedding and christmas events your stepmother was out of line but i m so confused by the actual nuclear event being your grandmother s funeral wake what did your stepmother do that was so disrespectful or rude to you during this event you say you assume your grandfather would be upset at seeing her in his bedroom and you had an emotional reaction to seeing her there which is fair but you never clarify if that was in fact out of bounds did your dad give her the ok to rest in there was your granddad actually upset you physically threatened her mother why displace it on a completely unrelated third party and then when your stepmother finally left the room you then go in there without permission and lock yourself in your father comes over to tell you to knock if off admittedly not much tact there and you immediately go nuclear and tell him you wish you knew your real dad afterwards you all literally never talk about this again and you go completely no contact and start living full time with your biomom like please tell me if i m misunderstanding something huge here
i don t get the third point why were you barricading yourself exactly in the room and sobbing she wanted to watch tv on your mother s bed that is kind confused written imo but even with the other incidents and everything nta why would you apologize to this bully of a stepmother your father is hard to judge he should have make clear that she has to be civil and her behavior is a big nono if you consider reconciling with your father you could meet him a few times during the year for a day or dinner depending how far or close you live and make it perfectly clear stepmom is not welcome neither do you want to talk about her good luck to you
nta as you ve done nothing wrong your father and the donkey witch on the other hand but consider what you want to get out of this situation if you want a relationship with your dad you may have to offer some form of an apology if you don t really care about the relationship then stand your ground i didn t speak to my father for almost years after he pulled some unforgivable shit and only then it was on his death bed not once did i speak with the woman he married who was not wanting to warm up to her new step kids the relationship meant nothing to me my sister on the other hand was more of a peacemaker and regularly though not frequently kept in communication with them my point is that either way can work just fine go with your gut and or work with a therapist to find what is right for you
nta you shouldn t have to apologise to your step mother it should be the other way around having said that if you stand your ground you may lose your dad again that could show you his true colours and at least then you ll know where you stand with him
nta
nta it sounds like your father still hasn t acknowledged how your stepmother mistreated you i wouldn t attempt a reconciliation until he understands she needs to be the one apologizing
nta keep it the way it is your dad doesn t get it and never will you owe stepmother nothing
nta that woman was awful to you
nta your father is delusional and stepmom can fuck right off
nta the fact they want you to apologise she s nothing has changed she has not changed
nta the slippery slope every step parent has to be on when it comes to their own children and possible steps to becoming a whole family is tricky your step mom clearly has no want or need to have you around the family as much as your father and it s apparent everyone could see that the apology is just the cherry on top of her pushing your boundaries with your step father and your relationship with him to me it sounds like he just wants to mend his relationship with her more than with you he just needs you to take more of the accountability than her or him even though you were a child at the time low contact or no contact it s inevitably your choice how much of a relationship you want to have with your dad again never apologize for having feelings as a child that were shoved aside
nta you did nothing wrong why isn t he asking her to apologize to you given her poor treatment of you
you do not owe this awful woman an apology she owes you one for treating you as she did what a horrible spiteful creature you were a child and he was your dad you are allowed your own boundaries stepmother needs to be one of them nta
your father is the asshole if he really viewd you as a daughter he should have kicked her ass out immediately
nta for either decision the decision is yours talk to your therapist
nta don t apologize you apologize and you ll confirm to him and her that she s right she s not you know it stand your ground
nta basically he is repeating the same imposition on you he did when he married her once again the onus is on you to fix the situation in which his wife resents your existence
spend time with sd if you want do not go near to her if he brings her then leave nta regardless what you decide
nta he s making your relationship conditional that shows that he isn t willing to start anew
no that is no way to restart your relationship and to expect you to do it to appease her is spineless of him nta
nta your step mom wanting an apology from you is hilarious tell your dad everything that woman said and did and then tell him that you expect an apology from her instead tell him that your relationship with him is dependent on them both acknowledging the hurt they did to you her asking you to apologize is a power play you do not owe her an apology at all to hell with her
nta
you reacted to her abuse she is the root cause of everything and it is on her to apologize and make it right
nta you don t owe her shit least of all an apology
nta _ in this conversation did you r dad apologize did he say the wife is willing ot apologize i know you are now but it pisses me off that parents think kids need to apologize to adults for perceived slights just to keep the peace she was the adult you were a child this is on them to make right not you
nta call your dad and ask to speak to her on speaker phone and unload all her feeling about her use ever curse work you can think of he is not your bio dad she is your stepdad and you owe him and his wife nothing
nta i actually don t understand why your dad thinks that you should apologize but i don t care what you did you were a child and she was the adult she does not get to act like the victim in this story btw did your dad ever apologize to you he s actually the biggest problem in this story as it was literally his job to protect you
nta seems like he wants to reconcile more than you if he expects certain stipulations to be met first that is on him
nta screw him write him off completely from your life if he really wanted to reconcile he should be the one apologizing not you
nta they owe you an apology not the other way around
nta what s your crime consuming the oxygen in the room she should apologize to you and your dad should say sorry as well
nta your stepmother doesn t think of you as your dad s child so there is no reason to pursue any type of relationship with her outside of common courtesy if you really want a relationship with this man you might consider the non apology apology for his wife ie i am sorry you felt that way but really think about if you want to invite that sort of drama back into your life it doesn t seem she has changed and he may be sorry for behaving badly but it doesn t seem that his behavior has changed either otherwise he wouldn t have told you to apologize to her
nta and how very disappointing he is
as far as i can tell you have nothing to apologize to her for like is it your mere existence that she wants an apology for now nta
nta
nta has your dad really been going to therapy bc no good therapist would recommend that he ask you to apologize to your shitty step mom in order to have a relationship with him he should have apologized for allowing her to treat you badly and then severing his relationship with you
nta after reading your comments please just cut and run you seem smart and strong enough to know you don t need a toxic person and their enabler in your life he hasn t changed and doesn t see anything wrong with the way she treated you and still blames you for everything
nta it is not your job to apologize if they have marital problems that s between them not you go no contact again and save yourself the bs
nta i d say that if your stepfather s wife wants to sincerely apologize for all the ways she mistreated you when you were a child including trying to have your father use corporal punishment you re willing to listen but if she s still holding on to a grudge more than a decade later about something you did at age or younger that sounds pretty minor that s something she should discuss with her therapist because it s her problem not yours
nta if he married someone who didn t like his daughter thats his fault not yours
nta your dad is asking the wrong person to put the past aside he should be saying that to his wife it is not your responsibility to apologize to his wife to make her feel better she owes you an apology in my opinion she mistreated you from the beginning so all of your actions were just reacting to her your dad has to see that his wife is the problem her need to subjugate you is ridiculous you hold your ground continue to explain your position to your dad and make sure he understands why you will not apologize and play house with his wife
f that you owe her nothing and your dad is still being the ah
nta x200b your dad is the ah not you
nta what have you got to apologise for exactly existing do you want a relationship with this man sounds like he abandoned you for his asshole wife for years doesn t sound like great dad material tbh
nta from what i am reading sounds more like they owe you the apology
nta your dad owes you an apology i can t believe he let his wife treat you that way you can say you won t apologize outright or you can tell your dad to slow down first the two of you need to begin healing your relationship and you can do that when he reflects on the way he allowed you to be treated he really should have nipped that in the bud there were obvious problems from early on
definitely nta don t apologize to your stepmother
nta if your dad wants to have a relationship with you then he should be willing to acknowledge and apologize for his past mistakes part of that should be promising to do better in the future and that includes standing up for you against your stepmother it sounds like she was never willing to treat you as fully part of the family so why should she expect you to do this for her it sucks your dad sounds unwilling to move forward without this apology from you to her but if this is the hill they want to die on then it sounds like nothing has fundamentally changed in the years of lc side note it kind of sounds like she wants this apology so she can be right since this has caused issues in their marriage it s not your job to fix their marriage problems caused by her being a bad stepparent protect your boundaries and mental health sorry you re going through this i hope someday you can have a relationship with your father outside of her
nta at all your stepmom is a huge one tho your comment to your dad when you were younger about not wanting to be part of the family if he accepts the way she treats you was so good and mature i mean ik mature isn t exactly a compliment following that trauma since you re forced into it when parents fail but you definitely seem like you were way more mature at whatever age that was than your dad and stepmom even currently are she didn t act like a mom to you so you re under no obligation to reconcile for the family the fact that she s not apologizing herself tells you all you need to know about how she still views you if you re comfortable having a relationship with your dad still you can always do that with the boundary that you want nothing to do with stepmom but also if you re done with him after all this that s totally normal too you gotta do what s best for you it was a really kind thing of you to be willing to hear him out but you don t owe either of them anything more if he truly believes that you re the one the needs to apologize best of luck to you op
nta have they apologized to you at all why do only you seem to need to apologize i don t see why you should have to apologize to her for anything
the only apology owed here is from your dad stepmom to you they owe you big time if he was telling his therapist your story the therapist would surely see he s the one that needs to apologize but everybody has a different perspective i don t think your dad sees yours don t ever apologize you are nta
nta
he needs you to apologize to the grown woman who went out of her way to alienate her step daughter so your father s relationship with her can improve it does not sound as though the therapy or time has given him much perspective on this he is essentially saying it is your fault nta
nta therapy has taught him nothing the stepmother created the problem she nurtured the problem she is the problem it s time she apologized to both you and your dad you owe her no apology
why are you still talking to him nta
nta your stepmom was cruel to a child she should apologize your dad needs to keep going to therapy
nta your dad sounds like a coward who would rather pressure you into an apology rather than face the wrath of his wife i would go no contact with them both i know a good therapist is not recommending that he harass you into an apology

i sympathize with you but i also work in elder care and understand fully how you re wrecking your wife s life you should accept that she isn t willing to live this way potentially for years i m too sad for all involved to pass judgment
question did you talk to your wife about this before making the financial decision also where is your mom staying in your home with a care nurse
info can you sustain the expense for the rest of your mother s expected life expectancy instead of quantity of time spent making memories will quality suffice are you inadvertently willing to sacrifice your relationship to care for your mother
nah or a little bit y t a but only for the way you spoke to your wife i m not sure if anyone has talked to you about this but with alzheimer s it only gets harder for them to adjust to a care home the longer you wait if they go into care while they re mostly still there they can still learn that this place and these people are now their home they still have the ability to reason that much at least some of the time the longer it s delayed the less they are able to adjust my mom s family kept my grandma in her children s homes as long as possible when she was finally put into care every interaction with anyone she recognized involved her begging to go home asking when we were taking her home demanding to know why we weren t taking her home sometimes meltdowns over that place not being home she didn t have any ability to adjust left at that point having said that choosing to be a caretaker is a choice you re not wrong choosing to be her caretaker but your wife is also not wrong for not choosing the life of a caretaker it s a hard life with a lot of sacrifices the fact that you want to make them and she doesn t is simple incompatibility she s not childish for not wanting to sacrifice her life for your mother and it was unkind and unjust to call her that
yta for the specific question you asked aita for telling my wife she was being childish and unreasonable for trying to make me choose between her or my mother yes you are ta because your wife is not childish nor unreasonable according to any mature criteria she wanted to have an equal discussion with you where the outcome was not predetermined that isn t childish or unreasonable she has concerns about the future of your marriage that is something most spouses would treat seriously and not call childish she has not been consulted on financial decisions that affect her too that is how children are treated but it does not make her a child to point out how inappropriate that is please believe that all my sympathies are with you in your obvious love for your mother and the difficulties her care will bring you i admire your devotion to her and willingness to support her for that you definitely not t a but your inability to see any solution but the one you have chosen makes you ta so does your lack of empathy for your wife you see the situation as black or white your wife feels it s more complex than that don t insult her by calling her childish or unreasonable until you listen openly to her concerns i hope you and she can come to an amicable understanding about the next steps
yta not because of what you did but because your wife is begging to be involved in the planning of her own fucking life and you don t see the point in involving her in those conversations you say over and over again that talking about things with your wife would have been pointless because you were always going to do exactly what you re doing really hear yourself you didn t bother to have a conversation with your wife about your shared financial situation because you didn t care about her opinion you decided in advance that what she had to say wouldn t matter and she didn t need to be consulted no wonder she s pissed
look i care for my grandparents full time both of whom have dementia and other health issues we are now at the stage where it s getting unsafe for them to be at home even if i m here all the time so we will be transitioning to a nursing home in the coming months it s a process i have no life of my own and have made many many sacrifices all of which my grandparents are completely oblivious to nothing about this is easy
i have a huge amount of sympathy for you and your wife what struck me is that you mentioned you re on the spectrum and many of your comments reinforce that you can t see from your wife s perspective which is understandable but the issue seems to be you haven t discussed your decisions and seem to have imposed them on your wife your argument is that you had made your mind up and that discussion was pointless but that isn t how your neurotypical wife sees it discussion isn t always about changing minds sometimes it s about talking out feelings and fears it may not change the outcome but it is reassurance for your wife that you care about her and the impact on her similarly you are very focused on the fact that she s asked you to choose between her and your mother and that you can understand if she leaves but not why she wants you to choose again for your neurotypical wife this isn t about making you actually choose its about you reaffirming your love for her showing you understand her perspective and are listening to her you re seeing things in quite binary and simplistic ways you still spend time with your wife you have all basic needs catered for but you have fewer vacations what you are not understanding which makes sense if you re on the spectrum is that your wife can still feel insecure even if everything is still paid for yes you still spend time with her but it s less than before and perhaps doesn t feel the same as before perhaps it s less carefree perhaps there s more discussions of your mother etc the point is that talking and discussing these feelings are an opportunity for you to listen to her fears and see if you can reassure her dismissing her feelings as childish isn t helpful as it s ignoring the subtext of what she s saying she is scared her marriage has changed and her future has changed you keep saying that she can leave if she wants to i think she wants to try and talk to you and find a solution that doesn t end the marriage and that s the point she s making by asking you to choose it s really possible this marriage won t survive but i think your neurodiverse brain means you aren t fully recognising that your wife needs to talk about these issues and have her voice heard and her opinions listened to if you listen to her and try to ask her about what she wants rather than telling her your decisions and expecting her to deal with it you may find this marriage has a chance of survival but you need to recognise that being entrenched in your position and telling her that this is the situation like it or lump it is not effective communication ultimately the outcome may not change but marriage is about being a team and solving problems together its you and her vs the problem not you vs her that requires discussion and an acceptance that she has a say in matters that you think only affect you try talking and more importantly listening and acknowledging her feelings and you may find a way forward nah
info this wasn t out of no where right did you discuss and make an agreement with your spouse before you took this your mothers care on as far as finances what was the agreement about spending and what is the current reality of spending what would your wife say is the biggest concern right now and how are you working on maintaining y all s relationship right now
why are you even making this post for validation so as to make you feel that you did nothing wrong and the only bad person is your wife because after reading your post and your comments you absolutely don t want to compromise or accept the judgement of others so why are you even posting here yta you have the right to take care of your mother and she has the right to feel upset with it because it s taking away your presence from the relationship and marriage and also puts a financial strain in the relationship for every response you are just trying to argue with the commenter and don t seem to understand or accept their opinions if you don t want opinions then don t post here and ask for judgement you re only wasting others time and lastly yta not because you want to take care of your mother but because you don t care what your partner feels and how you even after posting in this sub you are not ready to take others opinions
heartbreaking situation i ve cared for an elderly parent and one of the things that is most difficult is the uncertainty if your mother had a terminal illness and six months to live i expect your wife would be on board with giving her all the love care and attention you possibly could but your mother may live another ten years getting gradually worse as her personality crumbles away but her body continues to be strong is what you are doing at present truly sustainable what if you get burnt out after seven years at the point where your mother needs even more help you are looking at an intederminate but long term future here be sure you can deal with it financially physically and emotionally i used to fantasize about murdering my parent a clean quick death and an end to the constant tension disruption sleeplessness and fear it added to the burden i felt because nobody wants to be wishing someone dear to them would die your wife has told you she cannot live this way any more this is undoubtedly not what she signed up for she wants a partnership with you not a situation in which the better part of your attention is elsewhere if you want to keep her you need to have a re think about how you are handling the situation a long careful talk with your mother s doctor and or other medical professionals who are not personally involved may be what you need unbiased advice on the best way to care for her you are aware of the facts but you are emotionally involved because she is your mother and you love her and good for you being aware of how much she has done for you and wanting to care for her in return there are no good answers here but if you want to both care for your mother and keep your wife something obviously has got to give if on the other hand you believe your wife is being unreasonable which may be true then the marriage is basically over nah good luck
we are not struggling but let me explain all the ways we are actually struggling your wife is telling you and showing you that you are both struggling she isn t trying to be cruel but the reality is that it s only going to get worse she s reaching her breaking point and yes you love your mom that s understandable but you also are supposed to love your wife and by making the series of choices you are and will continue to make if you don t consider care you are actively showing your wife that you don t actually love her enough to make her a priority so i m sorry op but you get a yta not a massive one but a boop you are the ah you can fix this but it means actually talking and listening to your wife not getting defensive but actively listen to what she s saying and try to come together as a team
this is hard i know it is it s the path we re headed down with my dad but yes yta your poor wife apparently has zero say in the next however many years of her life because you made this decision she s not being childish she s absolutely entitled to feel the way she feels and they way you talked to her definitely made you ta find another way it s a huge life impacting decision and you have no right mother or not to make it for your wife
you re spending to on her home care expenses and that s cheaper than a memory care facility where do you live the national average is it s ultimately easier for her if she goes into care before she is deep in dementia you re making it harder for your mother in the long run it appears you re making decisions based on your own emotions instead of your mother s or your family s best interests you re also emotionally blackmailing your wife her concerns are valid not childish or unreasonable
yta not for caring for your mother but for making a huge unilateral decision without your wife s agreement alzheimer s is a cruel disease and this could last years your wife isn t wrong to feel the way she does especially given the impact this is clearly having on her
info how much time do you spend with your mother or on tasks related to your mother s care in an average week how many visits how long are the visits
yta based on your comments your wife didn t have any say in the decision to care for your mother you presented your decision to her and went on your way that s not how a partnership works you are not an asshole for wanting to take care of your mother your wife is not an asshole for wanting no part of that however you are an asshole for being a bad partner and then losing your cool when your wife starts a discussion if you want a chance for your marriage to continue you should both seek counseling to figure out what to do in the meantime start thinking about how you re failing to support your wife partner instead of blaming her for not supporting you
yta when you decided to commit to a person in the form of marriage you were supposed to understand that there were responsibilities attached to that the fact that instead of wanting to understand and compromise with the woman you have been closing yourself of from you d rather make a reddit post to call her immature leaves me to believe she is right to think she can t depend on you especially going forward into the years you ll continue putting your mother first no wife wants to feel that way i also don t understand how you can feel comfortable surrounding yourself with that tension if you decided to fully sacrifice your life to your mother in the optimal way for her you should fully commit to it in the way you couldn t in your marriage stop filling both buckets half full
info if something happened to her parents could would you provide them a similar level of care
after reading the comments yta while this an incredibly difficult situation you should be partnering with your wife not telling her how things are going to be you really don t value her opinion she s not trying to kick you while you re down her concerns are legit instead of listening to her you result to name calling and ultimatums reading this post it comes across like you just want her to divorce you so you don t have to deal with the situation also is there a reason you haven t sold your mom s home you could use the funds to put towards a private facility it s easier to make that transition now instead of waiting for her illness to progress this would also help to lighten your load financially
sounds like you forgot you had a wife the second your mother needed help no shame in helping your mom but you seem very determined to forget that your wife was supposed to be your partner in this she doesn t exist as just an extension to yourself you chose to take on the extra responsibilities needed for your mother but your wife your life partner the person you re supposed to be striving for a mutual future together with got no choice she was told this was how it was going to be no ifs ands or buts no discussion no brainstorming options just this is how it will be yta
marriage is supposed to be a partnership you chose to drop the partnership to make decisions unilaterally to benefit the most important person in your life your mother that s fine but acknowledge your own role what do you want to do here divorce is the logical outcome as you don t want a partner
yta it s not your funds your finances are tied with your wife s what your doing isn t sustainable you need to give your wife some hope for the future you can t keep doing what your doing until your mother passes
as a single mother i worked and sacrificed to give my son everything i could god forbid i have alzheimer s or dementia or any other disease requiring a similar level of care i don t want him to devote his life to my care i didn t sacrifice for his his family s life to be made smaller because i have this disease however i understand why you feel like you owe it to her or just need to do it that being said your wife is feeling neglected she s had this idea of building a life with you in her head but that s gone out the window with no end in sight then when she told you how she was feeling you basically told her you didn t care your mother s more important to you and you didn t care if she wanted to get a divorce the situation sucks and i feel for you my cousin cared for her mother with alzheimer s for more than years and it was awful i m voting nah because it s just an impossible choice for you but your wife is entitled to feel what she feels you are however a bit of an a h for speaking so coldly to your wife
i m going to go with nah you re not wrong to prioritize caring for your mother over everything else in your life including your marriage but you can t expect your wife to just be okay with that because you have dictated that this is what you both are going to do because you know this means that you re not only giving up vacations right given the amount of money you re currently spending on your mother s care which you know is only going to increase as her illness progresses can you envision adding children to the mix with their always increasing costs and wedding funds and college funds can you envision yourself being able to be an involved parent of dependent children as your mother s condition worsens and she requires more of your attention this is early onset alzheimers right you could be looking at years of caregiving you and jane could be in your 40s or 50s before this comes to its inevitable conclusion so yes you are asking your wife to give up most of married life and motherhood because of the way you intend to handle your mother s care you re not wrong to want to provide that care to your mom but there s an opportunity cost to your choices jane s also not wrong to decide she s not okay with sacrificing her entire future to the cause maybe this just means that you and she are not compatible
yta bc you made these decisions unilaterally you are married you don t get to make major life decisions without input from your wife you are making decisions that are financially draining and not sustainable with no long term plan your decisions are based entirely on emotion this is tough i know that but you also n ed to think about your marriage and long term plans with your wife is there room in your life anymore for kids doesn t sound like it does your wife have any say in all of this no you already chose your mom over your wife sounds like you are willing to go bankrupt to care for your mom and that isn t good time to take a breath and figure out what life you want and how to balance that with caring for your mom
yta simply for the reason that i do not see mention of a family discussion of how you will be spending the family money and time you are married you chose to share your life with your wife but do not accept input on said life and how it will be lived this is why women are warned about mommas boys
i m sorry your mom s ill my grandmother had alzheimer s and the last six years of her life were hell for those of us who cared for her your wife is not an a h for complaining about the changes you re both facing but you are an ah for the way you ve spoken to her this relationship has run its course better to let her go and find her happiness elsewhere with a partner who cares about her and will prioritise her too if she stays she s going to resent you for not being there for her enough and you ll resent her for making you miss out on the last few years of memories with your mother no judgement you re both in a difficult situation here
i was going to give you the benefit of the doubt until i read your comments you made this decision on your own without much discussion with your wife your spouse is you life partner and chosen family you did not consider her needs and wants
yta i m sorry your going through this but i can tell you from experience caring for someone with alzheimer s at home becomes incredibly expensive and will run you dry you made a major decision without a proper conversation which you need to do when married you re now also neglecting your wife she has every right to be concerned my grandmother had alzheimer s and was also in great health she lived with it for years it s unfair to ask your wife to go broke and live without a husband for several years you re in an impossible situation and no one is saying you completely leave your mom high and dry but you re married and can t neglect your wife and expect her to stay married to you
as a carer she will need to be placed in a home sooner rather than later if its early onset get on a waitlist now because by the time she needs to go and you ask for a spot you will be waiting for months do the list waiting now even if you decide to say no to the spot at least youll have that option the people who came early and went from low care to high care to dementia ward always coped better i had a year old with early onset when i started she was just a shell but when she first got diagnosed her family did a million things with her went on holidays etc and took a million photos that stuff matters thats what id be doing if i were you but i cant judge you just both dont agree i just dont think you truly understand whats going to happen why work extra when you could spend time with her i think any parent would choose that over staying in their home a few extra years early onset is very fast be ready
you are feeling guilty about how your mom s story is ending and you re dragging your wife through your guilt instead of working with her to find what is best for your mother your wife is telling you she s breaking under your load and you re telling her to stop complaining i know you love your mom i know you love your wife what you need to do is talk to a neutral third party and make a plan for your mom s care that has her safe taken care of and visited regular by you nah just sad tired people
yta mostly because of how you are going about speaking to your wife you lay the entire collapse of your marriage and her wanting to leave on her it is not you are making many decisions financial emotional and social that are affecting her and she is putting her foot down the only way to apparently get a point across to you is to take the nuclear option as from all of your responses you refuse to see any other side of this situation you can make your decision and live your life caring for your mom the way you are you are willing to work longer hours sacrifice travel and free time and live on a tighter budget this does not make you a bad person your wife can decide she wants to spend her younger years being free traveling and then possibly settling down with kids she doesn t want to wake up years old and never having enjoyed her youth this does not make her a bad person stop the attacks on your wife s character and lovingly let her go
yta not for caring for your mother but for not making this decision that will affect both your lives with your wife
yta you should have married your mother if you were going to keep choosing her over your wife you are a terrible partner for making such a huge decision unilaterally
i would divorce him i would never want my son to destroy his future for me no way op is not being reasonable or realistic at all
yeah yta i cannot at all fault you for wanting to take good care of your mom but you need to realize you completely upended your wife s life without even consulting her that is what partners do they support one another help lift them up when they fall not kick them while they are down this goes both ways right you re not supporting her you re insulting her instead of considering her perspective making huge life and financial decisions and not at all allowing her to have an opinion about it you are going through something extremely difficult i d have a hard time not acting like a bit of an ah on occasion if i were in a similar situation and it s possible there s no solution you and your wife can both agree to but you should have a calm and rational discussion about it with her if you can t manage that yourself find a couple s counselor or clergy member if applicable to help you
yta mostly for you comments and attitude towards your wife i get it and i empathize how difficult a situation you re in i watched multiple family members deteriorate from alz and its tough so i m very sorry about that that being said you re your wife brings up being young and experiencing life but based on your comments i don t think you really get the reality of the situation you say your mother is in great health besides the alz so this can easily turn into a year caregiver role with 8k leaving your account a year you re asking her to be ok putting her life on hold till into her 40s while watching 100k a year leave your household come on man even if you re not asking her to contribute in what world does she not have to contribute more to at home things are you really making 200k at that 100k is just a minor inconvenience to you how many hours a week do you need to work to achieve that how often do you actually see your wife you want to see things in black and white and sure no brainer you d care for your mom but let your wife go then you keep saying she can leave she can leave but can she can she walk out on you and have her reason be o his mom has alz no she d look awful my grandmother had alz and parkinsons and was when she started needing a fulltime caregiver my mom started spending a lot of nights and weekends with her and she ended up living more years so for years my mom spent most of her free time there and i watched first hand the toll it took on my parents marriage and how unhappy they both were basically long winded way to say let your wife go or actually listen to what shes telling you because you re asking her to put decades of her life with you on hold
yta you are within your rights to give your wife an ultimatum but she is within her rights to walk away y t a bc you made a unilateral decision that affects both of you this wasn t a discussion even though it hugely affects her life you say you re only using your money but then say things are tight so it is affecting her financially it s affected your marriage bc you aren t there you ve taken a job with more hours and use your off time with your mom and it s only going to get worse thats the bummer of alz her body could keep going for anothrt decade or more you planning on having kids how your wife would be a single mother without the benefit of child support she isn t being childish or unreasonable to want her partner to be her partner
yta because you are making all of these hugely significant decisions that equally impact your wife on your own your wife did not sign up for this and you are making an admittedly difficult situation even harder on you and your wife than it has to be
yta she s not kicking you when you are down she is trying to make a financially sound decision based on facts and trying to stay married it s not your money if it is earned when married it s both of yours the marital estate i m sorry you are struggling with an aging parent with dementia but seeing your age your mom is relatively young you are the path to divorce and if you are ok with that so be it
yta for not valuing your wife s opinion and input she is your life partner not your mother i have worked hard to make sure that my child will never be in a position to have to put their life or their partner s life on hold everyone is responsible for planning for their end of life and retirement your mother neglected to do this and your are taking it out on your wife not cool
it s hard to give a ruling here because there are no winners in this scenario my stepfather s father got alzheimer s and cared for him at home with the help of his mother until the end it put a strain on my mother s marriage and that was without taking any of his son s resources he had fully funded retirement and in home care near the end my stepfather needed to go on anti depressants he probably needed therapy that he never got he never recovered from that it was a very long difficult decline hard to watch and hard to be a part of even tangentially it was tragic and horrible and took a large chunk of his life he never got back and it aged him he also ended up getting cancer unusually young with an aggressive metastasis being caretaker for one parent after another is really hard on your body whether that made a difference in his inability to fight his cancer we ll never know try to show more compassion for your wife it sounds like she still wants to share a life with you after your mom is gone your mom deserves your respect and care for as long as she is with you but you also have a duty to consider the life she has given you in order to do that a balance needs to be struck nah
a very very very soft yta first of all i am sorry that you re going through this with your mom this is a terribly difficult journey for so many reasons and having to deal with financial issues and now marital issues on top of it is heartbreaking and difficult i think you re a wonderful child trying to do right by their mother however as a married person you aren t making decisions for only yourself you cannot unilaterally make decisions for your family your wife is a part of the package and she is clearly communicating that the current situation isn t going to work for her long term i know you want nothing more than to do what is right by your mother but you are sacrificing your wife s needs wants in the process that isn t fair to her either it sounds like this is a hill you re willing to die on though so maybe your inconsideration for your wife is not that important to you that does make you a bit of an ah to her but you re entitled to choose that however it sounds like that means you re going to be dealing with a divorce too if you re not wanting to end your marriage you need to come to the table and compromise with your wife her needs wants need to be taken into consideration and minimally they need to be validated heard your desire to meet your mother s needs shouldn t come at the sacrifice of your personal well being whether that be mentally financially or relationally it might be worth trying to find a middle ground where everyone can be happier in an otherwise really difficult and challenging situation
soft yta here i m just gonna let you know that my ex husband and i divorced because he kept choosing his birth family over the one he made my current husband and i almost divorced over the same issue you may not see it that way but try to put yourself in her shoes her life is greatly affected by this and she explained that s not the life she wants to live forcing her to be okay with it because you re okay with it and don t want to change is an ah move she is your wife and you re supposed to work things out together and find solutions compromises that work for both of you you re gonna lose her if you don t make some type of effort
soft yta whether you like it or not you fate is intertwined with your wife s you are spending marital assets on care for your mother you are working longer hours in order to afford that care i hope you can see how these decisions significantly impact your wife and should have been made together afterall you could be carrying this for many many years not sure what state you are in but some have home care programs through medicaid but whether she is at home or in skilled care you should be applying for medicaid and availing yourself of those supports you can always pay out of pocket for additional care on top of the subsidized benefits eta i see that you are already receiving pca waiver care but i also see that you are covering her living expenses how was she getting by previously could you get her into a more affordable apartment senior housing sadly your mom s care needs will only increase and as others have said it is better that she adjust to a new situation sooner than later
yta there so no better with your mother obviously you can t care for her physically due to your long hours and you ll go bankrupt financially as her needs for care worsen you need assistance on multiple fronts and your unwillingness makes yta
yta yes it is a terrible disease my best friend s mother just died from it my grandmother had it before she died in the s but it is never going to get better you are ignoring your wife and sinking all your assets into mom and your wife is not given any say and has been relegated to the back row of your life
yta you are part of a couple these should have been discussions not you announcing this is how it s going to be it s admirable to want to take care of your mom but your wife isn t selfish because she doesn t want to you guys need to figure this out together and that means compromise not just you making a decision and insulting your wife when she doesn t agree with it
esh sorry you are going through this but you both are ahs whilst it is noble you want to care from your mum but you do have a wife you wife needs to understand that she is your mum you have completely blown off your wife s concerns this takes a toll on a marriage and resentment breeds ive done the wife to the son that puts caring for his mum before his wife and kids and whilst i was proud of the man stepping up i resented that he could not find a balance that didnt hurt the rest of us not having freedom to do anything taking the hit financial holidays if you get them are not relaxing because its all about being close by or easy to get home should it be needed if you voice that you are struggling you get told you are being unsupportive six months after her death i still cant say anything or plan anything as it now sorting out her estate and that is stressful dont through your marriage away find a compromise
info how desparate is your income do you pull income would you be open to having seperate accounts what was the agreement between you and your wife when you married did she agree to this do you mother and wife like each other did you make this decision that impacts both of you together or did you decide alone and give her no choice how long has she been living with her mil do you expect your wife to nurse her how long do you want to host your mum for it sounds like your wife misses you do you not miss her frankly you sound like an asshole because you are make descisions as if you are single and then telling her she has no right to get upset but i ll reserve my judgement untill you answer my questions
health economist here also note that in most states the money spent by the govt at medicaid funded care homes are considered loans and the state will seize any assets after the person passes such as a home please talk to a case manager or call your states elder law hotline most every state has one in advance to make sure there are no hidden financial consequences for you and your wife down the road
so you chose to help your mom that sounds reasonable to me as i love my mom and would do the same but you did not ask your wife on her opinion she has the right to choose if she wants to be with someone who does this she was more mature than you because she told you about her feelings and gave you the chance to make a desicion for yourself she doesn t want to live that way and you don t want to change the care for your mother both sides completely understandable yta though because she tried to speak about it told you her feelings tried to find other solutions and finally when nothing worked gave you the chance to make an informed desicion for your future you on the other hand didn t listen and called her childish
yta
yta when you re married you don t get to make unilateral decisions for your family does not matter how much you stand behind the nobility of said decisions if you re not taking your spouses wishes into account calling her childish is just you handling the situation badly by lashing out and being mean in reality her leaving you would actually be very mature because it s a hard decision that she needs to make for her own long term well being
dear u according_apricot_00 you are not down that is her issue you play the victim everything that is done to you is your choice you choose to care for your mother financially out of your pocket because at that point your wife can t tell you what to do yeah except for the following things that happened too you too on a more stressful job guess who gets to deal with that you guys have a social life which you up and left which left her alone in it you both see daily how the life for people changes when a family member is sick so her wanting you to trust in people taking care of your mother because they know how to so you can actually be there for your mother instead of working for her i m thinking you are using tunnel vision on this yes she is your mother but what is there left for you when your mother is gone what have the singlehanded decisions created for you because you say a spouse support each other but it sounds like you are in the my way or the highway mode for the past few months since mom has gotten diagnosis
yta
i don t think either of you are assholes but tbh if someone or something was impacting my lifestyle i would be very upset i would most likely end up putting my mother or mil in nursing care but check on them often it s unfortunate when things like this happen but i would want to save my future rather than hold on tight to something that is passing on maybe i m an asshole
yta based on your comments this is a hugely upsetting and difficult thing you re going through but you re married you can t unilaterally make decisions without discussing it with your wife you told her instead of asking her what to do with your mom you have to be a bit flexible here this disease will get progressively worst over time and 9k a month is just not sustainable what is your long term plan you will run out of money if your wife leaves then you ll be in a far more difficult financial position your choice to do this has obviously impacted your wife and your marriage
i don t think there s enough info here to make an assessment on the financials but yta for dismissing your wife s concerns on what sounds like a very significant possibly long term financial investment relevant things you didn t include do you have any debt how much do you have in savings is that your money or shared money do you own a house do you have an emergency fund do you have a 401k or some kind of retirement fund do you have a diverse portfolio of investments in case there s not enough in your retirement fund do you want kids if so so you plan to fund their education how much do you net yearly that you can spend this much how are bills split how is housework split how much of a time commitment is caretaking currently do you have a long term plan in place if she continues to live another years do you think it s fair to a spouse that they play second fiddle to a parent
yta look i get it i know how hard this is my own dad died of dementia when i was but i could not and would not upend my life because of it i have a husband kids and a full time job those all had to come first you have your own life and marriage that needs to come first if you can t prioritize you ll be left with no mother and no marriage in the end
yta when one gets married their spouse becomes your yes parent should be priorities well but should never overshadow your marriage
it s confusing that you re framing this as being upset she s making you make a decision when you ve already made a decision and just informed her of it instead of talking it out like partners are supposed to do you did make a choice and you ve chosen your mom
yta i made the choice to care for her what was your wife s choice
honestly if you are already spending 8k on her care you can afford to put her into a nice facility my mother in law has dementia and is living in the nicest memory care in our area it s super bougie she has her own apartment in a lock down unit that honestly has the most staff i ve ever seen in an assisted living facility it s aide for every residents and it costs us a month when she was in texas it was slightly less
i would just like to say that you should reach out to a council on aging or an aging service access point people on medicaid can get some home care services for free they also be very helpful for different resources for someone with dementia
it s a blessing you don t have kids because it will make the divorce simpler yta
look i get it but you don t get to have a wife when you feel like it and discard her and invalidate her when things are tough you need to get better at managing this stop dismissing her also no if the tables were turned you would be just as frustrated yta
yta x200b so make your choice
my grandmother lived with my family while she deteriorated from alzheimer s it was excruciating i feel for you i understand your position i don t necessarily disagree with it but you can t make a decision like this without your wife being on board and expect your marriage to make it through my dad was in agreement that he would care for my mother s mother through all of it my mom had stood by him as he cared for his immediate family before they had all passed they were a unified front and it still put an insane amount of stress on my parents marriage you made a decision that affected your wife without consulting your wife it continues to affect your wife in more ways than one there s no timeline with alzheimer s especially when it sounds like your mom is early onset and in otherwise decent health i m guessing since she s ambulatory so there s no telling how long your finances and time together will be affected i don t think you re ta because of wanting to care for your mother but i do think yta for making the decision without your wife even if it s your money because it affects her financial status too and i do think yta for calling her childish for having emotions about the situation
yta and the fact that you can t see it doesn t bode well for your relationship
yta she does need to divorce you and i hope its soon you can waste all the money and time you want she doesn t need to be along for that ride and if there is one thing i can assure you now you have idea of how bad it s going get with your mother once she starts becoming violent to the carers there will be no one to care for her but you and you will struggle source helped my dad care for my nan for years before we were able to get her into a nice home and i m reliving everything again with my pop on the other side
i m not even sorry to say yta if she a divorce so be it but don t try and play the victim or act if she is being reasonable and you are you re putting yourself above your wife and your mom with all the time you re spending doing mental gymnastics trying to control everybody in your life you could have put in a lot of effort into finding alternative solutions you act like she s making you choose but it s very clear you have already made the choices your wife is supposed to be your partner and should come before everyone else you re not the a hole for wanting to do everything possible to help your mom through this journey but yta for doing it at the expense of your wife and treating her as an obstacle
but she is being reasonable she is not being childish how long is she supposed to be your support while you can t support her back if you want kids how long is she supposed to put that on hold because as it is you re barely there as a husband and won t have anything left time or money wise to be a father she s putting her future on hold for your mother imagine back to when your mom was fully well is this what she would have wanted for you a broken marriage no kids of your own complete dedication of your life to her who is going to decline and die no matter what and what will you be left with after she passes mild yta because you are in the impossible position but your wife is right
absolutely nta your mothers health is in serious decline and your wife s reasoning for not wanting to support you is fomo i seriously can t get past the yta comments perhaps it s a cultural things because a lot of caucasians seem to be very comfortable just shoving their elderly in care homes which is not the same in other cultures as stated you are paying for her care and your mother was extremely important to you perhaps you should have had a discussion with your wife to make sure she was on board but at the end of the day when the decision comes to it between your wife and your mum it is absolutely yours to make i do think your wife lacks empathy and if she s worried about missing out if indicated where her values are in life she s not interested in supporting you through this which in my mind is a violation of in sickness and health
yta your mom is too to a lesser extent i lived this life voluntarily in my late 20s and early 30s and it was a tragic mistake we absolutely could not provide the care memory patients needed it ruined us financially hurt our family and took precious time and energy away from our children even with in home care most hours of the day i still found glass and pills and feces all over you have no clue what you re getting into you re not even asking your wife you re telling her you deserve to have her leave you your mom is an asshole for using her young son as her retirement plan
enjoy your divorce yta
yta
lots of good points being made i think op needs to listen to the only things i ll add is op if your mother is still fairly lucid you need to talk with her about what she wants make sure she understands the progression of alzheimer s if nothing else it ll be easiest for you down the line with balancing what you are able to provide her and what her wishes are and follow through as best as possible still think she will ease into it the best if she is lucid enough to have some conversations about it and come around to the idea on her own terms so she isn t fighting it i use to work in a nursing home and some people really jumped into the next stages of dementia so quickly the facility and family couldn t get them into even out memory care fast enough it put them at risk for inquiries falls and unable to call for help or running away or getting lost while out walking even getting violet with their spouses or staff anyways this too will give you and your wife an idea of what your sacrifices will look like for the next decade or two because yes she is making sacrifices and it s more than financial comfort and vacations etc after you two can see if you are still compatible or just need some therapy to help navigate this situation
yta even if the outcome remains the same you re not even considering or validating your wife s feelings your mom didn t raise your wife she did t sacrifice for your wife and yet you re expecting your wife to sacrifice her happiness for your mom and you won t even validate her feelings on it your wife should be your partner and you re not treating her like one it doesn t even sound like your wife needs the trips or vacations but to be a considered member of this relationship you have continuously put your wife last
it sounds like you re pretty much checked out of the marriage
as someone who has been a caregiver and grew up watching my grandmother take care of my grandfather with als you re an asshole majorly caregiving is extremely physically and emotionally taxing and your wife shouldn t be forced into dealing with that it sounds like you work long hours so that leaves your wife taking care of your mom she didn t sign up for this and for you to expect her to finance and take care of your mom is beyond selfish stop using your wife s money and figure out how to care for your mom in a way that doesn t make it your wife s problem
yata so what you are saying is taking care of your dear mom is an obligation for your wife and a cost that impacts your wife who was not raised by your mom you consider your wife as you in terms of this obligation and aren t happy that this isn t what she signed up for she married you to have a life with you but you have pretty much arranged your life to not be doing the work around your mom because you can offload all of that on your wife her life is drastically impacted her marriage to you greatly altered she never agreed to any of this but you go off to work every day feeling virtuous while she has to deal any attempt on her part to make you understand this is not sustainable fails to move you you feel your wife owes you this consider what you will do if your wife s frustration prompts her to leave you once she realizes that she isn t getting anything out of this relationship and you have abandoned her and your mother will you quit your job and take care of your mother yourself then have you ever cared for your mother yourself if the shoe was on the other foot you could old your wife you would support her but how would you do that if your wife earned the income and supporting her mom required you to be there as caregiver not knowing how many of your best years would pass like that would you actually do that if you would why are you not giving your wife an inch now when she yells you she can t go in like this
nta but you have to understand your wife s feelings regarding this caring for a loved one with dementia alzheimers is extremely taxing mentally and physically they have their good days and they have their bad days but over time they will be more bad days than good days i dont know what state you live in but there are lawyers who specialize in elder care assets etc so they will be able to help you get her affairs in order if they aren t already but also show you how to get the best care for your mom through insurance and not have to subsidize most of it we did this with my grandparents and were able to get them home health nurses doctors and pt a few times a week then not if but when it is time to move your mom into a home you have to do extensive research on where you are putting her make sure you visit the facilities beforehand i also work in healthcare and have been to my fair share of terrible nursing facilities of them the first thing you should note is the smell if it stinks then its not good when you go walk the grounds to make sure it is safe you want it locked down in case your mom gets confused and starts to wander off watch the staff and see how they are treating the residents are they sitting around on their phones the whole time or are they actually interacting with the residents and making sure they have everything they need check the facility rating if it s stars make sure it really is stars and they didn t just change the name recently to get rid of the old rating and reviews and try to start fresh and finally leave a google or alexa device that you can do video chat on so you can drop in whenever you want and make sure that your mom is attended to on the days you can t make it down to visit her the good facilities tend to have longer wait lists so getting her name on the list doesn t mean you ll be contacted right away good luck
nah your marriage is already over the sacrifice involved in taking care of your mother is too much for your wife you would resent her if you did put your mother in a home to try to save your marriage there is no going back for your relationship although i sympathize with your wife i completely understand were you are coming from when it comes to your mom i could not be with someone who wanted me to put my mom in a home it would make me wonder what would they do if i was injured or had alzheimer in the future myself would they take care if me or when they put me in a home and move on with their life
nta it s honestly surreal reading all the y t a posts here imagine if in years the post was instead aita for putting my recently deceased mom who suffered from alzheimer s into a cheap care home and seeing her once a week after raising me by herself because my wife wanted to go on more vacations a year what the comments would be ruthless i get your wife wants to travel more and enjoy life but have some class you said in your post you re not taking her money what s stopping her from still saving for vacations and supporting you in that way or just traveling by herself if it s so important to her you also already conceded that if it was the same situation happening to her mother you d be supporting her again nta but man your wife sure is
yta wtf you are paying 8k i made the choice to care for her using my own funds but you are married with children so really you re pretending its your money when its joint money your wife not unreasonably wants to know when is the end of this your wife is not being childish and your a dismissive ah she wants to know if you will sell the house car children to finance this health care at 8k per month if you were making so much money why didn t you make sure your mother had health care insurance or lived in a country where she would be cared for so to deal with this financial money pit you have resigned from the marriage taken a job that involves less hours with anybody in the family including your mother i don t say you shouldn t love your mother but you are treating your wife like its all her fault
she loves you and wants to build a future with you how can she not be involved
i m not giving judgement but can we stop down voting every answer op gives it s just so fucki g dumb and against the guidelines for aita
a soft yta from me i can understand your wife s anger you are paying out a huge amount every month for your mothers care but i can also see your point of view as well are you using your own funds or is your wife having to contribute in some way as well this may be having to contribute more to household and other bills etc if she is then i can understand why she s so upset she s also missing out on vacations and other fun stuff i assume she works and works hard why should she not have nice things and vacations etc she didn t sign up for your mums care she s missing out and it s not fair op there are some excellent care homes out there if you choose wisely then your mum could get comfortable and settled before her dementia gets any worse you could also contribute with extra s just not to the crazy amount you re spending now if you want to save your marriage you ve got to start being inventive and forward thinking with your mums future care i bet if she does get settled in a home your wife wouldn t mind you visiting several times a week also as a year old myself with one daughter i can honestly say i would not expect her to spend a small fortune every month on my care especially if i was in the throes of dementia as an ex nurse i ve worked in care homes and care of the elderly wards i can assure you that what older people appreciate more than anything are those visits from loved ones not the money being thrown in their direction you sound like a wonderful son i d be proud of you if you were mine but you also have to realise you re a husband as well and you have responsibilities to your wife good luck on whatever you decide
yta spending that kind of money is a jount decision in marriage nta for taking care of your mom
thanks for all of the feedback and i appreciate it i will make an update post in the future after we try marriage counseling i wish to say one thing that is slightly off topic medicaid is not some magic bullet and one phrase that many who have gone through this journey and battle with medicaid will know very well safety and supervision is not a covered service medicaid is not what it is cracked up to be and pretty much any medical professional will reinforce this we have a motto at work for medicaid if the patient is breathing that is good enough anyways thanks again going to peace out for now and do what i should have done from the start sit down with my wife one last part since for those that keep asking if i meet my responsibilities on the financial end i make around 187k salary and i have additional 35k a year from two rental properties i have plus another 45k in cash for emergencies all of which is separate from joint accounts we have much more regarding investments retirement plans i have been saving for years and i have a million dollar whole life insurance policy and i have long term care insurance never my intent to a burden to someone i care for my wife knows all of this god forbid something does happen to me she is not going to be left holding the bill alone i will say i was the asshole for letting my stress and frustration get the better of me
soft yta i know you re hurt and feeling attacked but you dismissed your wife s valid concerns by calling them unreasonable and childish she is being reasonable dementia is progressive and isn t something that kills fast so you re not talking about sacrifice for a few months or another year but years decade it isn t what you wanted from a partner i know but your wife saying she can t live like this is her choice maybe not a fair option to give you but reasonable her feelings on this are just as valid and reasonable as yours if you hadn t dismissed her i d go with a tragic no ass holes here but you did also to echo something i saw in other comments the sooner you find a home the better if she s able to build comfort with the setting it will help so much more instead of waiting until there are no other choices and the unfamiliar setting will always be a trigger for her i wish you the best through this terrible time
yta you say you decided not we decided regardless of the circumstances you re partners and nothing should have been done unless both of you came to an agreement the situation is tragic but you re over ruling because you feel it s your right it s not it s a decision to be agreed unanimously
having been in that exact situation with the person that raised me and also work in healthcare i would actually lean more toward a true soft yta solely for the fact the op will destroy his life and his health looking after someone and hasn t planned accordingly there is a reason every week people are dropped off at the er with caregiver burnout you will never get a day off never have a vacation never enjoy life the op should realize the decline is real the workload always increases and the final last thing after working in healthcare is that nothing is ever good enough no care will be good enough because we know to much when we finally put our person in care there was relief because they were a heavy person assist we came twice a day to feed them and spend time with them when my kiddo was born they came when they were not sick they actually lived longer in care then they could have at our house unfortunately due to the disease process they eventually stopped eating we never realized just how much time was spent on them and how much we hurt ourselves looking after them at home till it was over had we started the planning much earlier it would have been smoother and we would have started the grief process earlier yes that s right we didn t accept the decline and just like someone dying when they start decline there is a whole grief cascade that doesn t make you think straight and not until you get into acceptance of the situation do you realize you made the correct choice it is not the right choice or the choice you want but it is a correct choice
it seems like you ve already chosen your mom over your wife with no discussion no plan speaking as someone who had my mil in out of our home for the last years of her life with minimal discussion your wife is probably upset that her home isn t her home anymore but has turned into a care facility we had caregivers visiting nurses and each with someone to train or a supervisor with them every damn day mil made absolutely no plans for this stage of her life just assuming she would be taken care of by one of her sons your joint finances are being spent on this note please start to plan for your retirement ours was spent on caregivers but also toiletry items pee pads for the bed diapers and food that only she would eat over the years it added up we re waiting to be repaid from her estate my mil was not a nice person to begin with it got worse as her dementia progressed the point i m making is that this is a huge job and you didn t ask your wife if she would sacrifice money peace and the relationship with you so you could do this for your mom that being said in the end i was glad that we could do that for her making her last days comfortable even not knowing how many days were left but i don t know if i d do it again and don t recommend it gentle yta
nah i m very sorry about your situation the life of a carer is very hard and it s a choice to make you have all the right to make it and so does your wife if you want a good life you cannot impose it on her as much as she cannot take you out of it some counselling could help to see if you can find some compromise but it could end up that you ll be going different ways
yta i think i have a different view when it comes to parents than most i don t think just because your parents raised you that you have to care for them once they get older and i also don t expect my son to care for me once i do when you take on the role as a parent it s your job to care for the child and also your responsibility to set yourself up for care later in life when you decide to marry and start your own family they come first sacrificing years of your wife s happiness to care for a person who has the condition your mother does is insane to me while i sympathize with the situation i also don t agree with splitting apart your own family maybe i m the ah but both my parents know i will not be caring for them once they get older i would never chose a parent over my spouse
it tells your wife a lot about your feelings for her when you are so willing to give her a divorce you obviously have no love for her

nta easily no period no opinion he used the private bathroom rather than waiting a bit to use the one down stairs they are not in display as per your description of being in a wicker basket so he doesn t need to poke his nose or hand in that basket in the first place
being offended at clean unused sanitary products is like getting mad at toilet paper being out the difference being that he understands the necessity of toilet paper nta
nta your uncle is the one who should be hiding in a cupboard imo
nta your uncle is pathetic if the mere sight of a box of panty liners gives him the vapors
nta it s literally your house and there s nothing gross about unused menstrual products i hope you re parents stand up for you
nta at all if it s not been used then whotf cares
nta your uncle acted like a moron
nta you re uncle was the rude one who is he to scream about how you store your sanitary products in your own house i swear old people are wackadoodles sometimes
nta does he get offended when he walks into a supermarket and sees sanitary products on display my dad bought all the sanitary products for the women of the house since he did the grocery shopping
nta your uncle is a child
what now they aren t used and gross they re in a basket in the upstairs private bathroom so i m not seeing the issue here sorry you get to deal with an uncle who doesn t understand that women use period products nta
nta your uncle is acting like a complete fool and as ms manners would point out is himself being enormously rude by criticizing his hosts
nta your uncle is ta with his sexist bs
nta it s not like your slapping used pads on the wall like some sort of demented art installation half of humanity has periods this idea that they are somehow shameful is full on misogyny your uncle needs to get a grip
nta wait baby wipes your uncle is offended by seeing baby wipes geez does he have a heart attack if he sees them at the grocery store or clutch his pearls when seeing an ad on tv for feminine hygiene products or baby wipes how does he get through a day if he over reacts to such minuscule things
nta i would be tempted to create a real display for his next visit maybe a motion activated rotating pedestal with a spotlight and an epic soundtrack
uncle needs to grow up nta
nta jesus christ your uncle sounds like one of those types that still believes in stereotypes from the s i first thought you had some boxes of pads or something close to the cereal or something but the locations you mention are completely fine and have absolutely no impact on anything at all
nta it doesn t matter even if the period products were on display it is your house and the bathroom that you use if he has a problem with it he can go home and use his own bathroom that is period product free
nta normalize periods this is so sad to hear and so out dated what an absolute wanker you are my hero stand up to the patriarchy
i was in the kitchen when he came back down to the living room and overheard him talking about how gross and disrespectful having sanitary products on display is if you don t like them you re free to not freeload in this house edit nta but take the offending items and place them all around the house play it as a funny thing and don t take him seriously laugh at his stupidity
nta is how are still some men still scared of the idea of menstruation
nta remove all the toilet paper so it s not on display when he visits
hide all the toilet paper the next time he comes over when he gets angry or confused just tell him that you understand from his last visit that he wants to be protected from seeing disgusting but clean and unused hygiene products that toilet paper falls into that category so you removed it out of concern for his fragile disposition hygiene products are for taking care of our bodies and what comes out them if one is offensive then they all are but since none of them are you re nta and you re uncle deserves to deal with his bodily functions without the convenience of hygiene products to help him clean up
nta this is how your family usually keeps these products he is a guest in your home or your parents home he should suck it up because he s truly acting like a child but it is your parents house so sometimes you just have to suck it up to keep the peace he won t be there long right just put them away for a short while if you have to but i see nothing wrong with how you and your family keeps their bathroom products
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** apologies for any mistakes or formatting issues i m on mobile so some context i guess i nb born f started my period around years ago my immediate family have no issues talking about it freely in the house and have encouraged me to do so since i got my period the house is made up of mostly women so this is expected the issue arose when my uncle came round a few days ago usually guests use our downstairs bathroom due to it being easier and quicker to reach this toilet has a small set of drawers filled with the sanitary essentials for both men and women and are usually out of sight as to not clutter the already small room however i m assuming my mum or someone else was in that toilet at the time so my uncle had to use the one upstairs i was in the kitchen when he came back down to the living room and overheard him talking about how gross and disrespectful having sanitary products on display is for most of my time having periods i ve been very firm with my beliefs that periods are not something women should be shunned for or ridiculed for apparently my uncle feels differently i walked into the living room and my uncles attention goes to me context my parents have an en suite they usually use and my sister keeps sanitary products in her room because she travels a lot and it s easier to just keep them in the bag so she doesn t forget them he starts berating me for having those products pads panty liners and baby wipes on display i would like to say that the majority of these products are in wicker drawers next to the sink with the panty liners being in a box by the wall next to it here s how that conversation went in a shortened version me they aren t on display they are just in an easy place to reach uncle they shouldn t be out at all it s gross and disrespectful to guests me well when you start bleeding every month then you can tell me what to do with my period products he then got mad and left the house minutes later and now my parents said i was rude and should apologise aita i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta the man can t handle baby wipes oh dear that s a whole new level of unreasonable they are hygiene products in a bathroom where all of the other hygiene products go i guess all of the toilet paper should be kept out of sight as well after all it s a product that touches v a g i n a s it ought never be in an easy to reach spot er i mean on display what will the kids think or more importantly the men s he s a guest and doesn t get to dictate how you keep your bathroom he needs to stay in his lane and keep his mouth shut
nta he needs to grow the fuck up seriously in who still has hang ups about periods i ve bought every pad my wife and daughter have used in the last years stood in line with them in my hands and everything and they stay in the original packaging on the back of the toilet if any guest i have has something to say about it they won t be a guest for long
werk
nta i assume the toilet paper is also visible is poop somehow less gross than blood as long as used products are disappeared of properly who tf cares
nta oh is the man scared of the idea of blood will he faint at the mere thought of it oh fan him next time he starts getting flustered like this fainting spells can be really dangerous and cause serious concussions pathetic boy that s what your uncle is and given he was using your bathroom not the guest bathroom this sounds particularly entitled as well if it really bothers him that much he can resolve to use the other bathroom available when he happens to be there as it is to be honest i m always suspicious about guys that get flustered thinking of things like that in regards to younger female relatives it should not fluster someone unless they re thinking of very inappropriate things themselves
you weren t rude you were right do not apologize at all you have periods so it s totally ok to keep that kind of things close especially in your own home if he s not happy with it he can get tf out and good riddance nta and it seems you were more polite and nice than me lol if someone tried to make me feel ashamed of my periods like your uncle tried to do to you i would have become very snarky
nta it s not gross he needs to grow up and minds his business he s the only one with a problem here don t change your habits for him you need to have an easy access at your products if he doesn t like it i should only use the downstairs bathroom
nta he was being a petulant child time to grow up and realize that when someone bleeds they need to take care of it it he would have had the same issue with a band aid then i will possibly accept his issue with pads tampons etc if not then his sole argument is that vaginas are icky
nta alternative response sorry can t hear you over the sound of your fragile masculinity shattering d
nta your period your house your rules
i m so sick of parents telling their kids to apologize for shit they don t need to just to ease another adults frustrations they started the nonsense let them be frustrated and maybe stick up for your kids every once in awhile definitely nta
nta
nta the only thing gross and disrespectful is your uncle
nta your uncle is nuts we have a similar set up at my house dad never complained neither did any male guest that used our bathroom while at our house
nta god your uncle s being such a baby about this it s a personal hygiene product the sort of thing one would expect to see in a restroom the fact that he s still this squicked out by so much as being reminded of the existence of the human menstrual cycle is something he needs to just get over frankly
nta it s so old fashioned and dumb to be grossed out by periods or period products as a grown ass adult they re not even dirty they re not even opened
nta those people getting upset need to grow the hell up they re acting like whiney little goblins
nta normalize having that stuff out and open your uncle is wrong and if anyone says maybe he s just old i m
nta they are not gross if they are unused and in their packaging no grosser than having toilet oaper or a toilet visible your uncle is immature and rude to demand someone else s home be rearranged so they aren t reminded some people menstruate
nta your uncle is absurd my teenage son is more mature recently had to ask me for a tampon for his girlfriend no embarrassment so glad he recognizes this is a normal bodily function for women
nta ffs that guy needs to grow up has he ever been in a store where that stuff is sold or is that woman s work to go shopping there s absolutely nothing you did wrong and you shouldn t have to change anything too bad your family isn t being more supportive i could almost see this being a problem with my grandparent s generation but then i m guessing your uncle isn t pushing so that can t be an explanation
nta periods are a part of our life tough tatas for snooty uncle lol
op ywbta maybe but not really if you dressed up like a pirate approached your uncle started waving around a couple of used tampons like they were glow sticks at a rave and said arrrggghhh i m cap n bloodysnatch and this is my treasure and accidentally hit him in the face with a blood clot actually nevermind that shit would be funny oh and you are most definitely n t a and i say this as a middle aged dude who s learned that periods happen and it s no big deal
nta uncle needs to grow up he sounds like an uptight child
nta and your uncle is an idiot and a hypocrite does he think it s gross and disrespectful to have the toilet paper on display how about the soap and your parents suck for not sticking up for you
nta approximately of people have had will have periods it s not disrespectful to have unused period products out especially in a bathroom any more than it s disrespectful to admit you own shoes
nta what an immature misogynistic reaction he had to be snooping to see your period products he was in your house in your bathroom he is a terrible uncle and a terrible guest normalize periods normalize women s health down with misogyny
nta it s not like you left a dirty pad on the side of the sink it was new product easily accessible
info are you walking around waving a bloody sanitary product if so yeah you re ta that was sarcastic before anyone comes for me your uncle is massively ta
they are products to deal with human bodily eliminations you can t say it s gross to have tampons and pads on display and then say it s perfectly fine to have toilet paper on display not a thing if displaying pads and tampons is gross so it displaying toilet paper hell toilet paper is worse because it s unwrapped and everyone touches it tampons and pads are individually wrapped so you don t even see the actual product that touches an actual vagina most of the time as opposed to the communal toilet paper which everyone slaps directly on their poopy anus and we all know it it s not like having condoms lying around in baskets in your bathroom which i honestly think is fine especially in your personal bathroom but which i can see someone being surprised by it s not remotely sexual and it s no more gross than pooping as someone who does both i would argue it is significantly less gross than pooping everyone knows poop happens in a bathroom everyone should know periods happen in bathrooms sorry not sorry for the human bio lesson uncle perv
agreed nta having worked for companies that provided free essentials and left them out in the bathroom i e feminine products eye drops lint roller it s a game changer if anything you should get credit for leaving it out your uncle contributes to kids like myself back in the day being embarrassed about talking something normal the shy embarrassed kid learning about their period thanks you for leaving it out
nta and next time he comes over hide the toilet paper and tell him you find it gross and disrespectful to have it out considering what it s used for
someone bring in a fainting couch his delicate sensibilities have been offended
that s is what a man looks like ops uncle is totally the ta not your house not your problem
hahaha thank you for this
guessing that there is no auntie shocking not
that s a great idea but unfortunately the parents suck and they don t have op s back on this
how about a porta potty in the yard nice and private
if ever someone deserved to be called a snowflake
and sorry she exaggerated the story to our family members did she tell them she exaggerated the story otherwise her apology is worth absolutely nothing she ll still be the victim from their point of view and you can t hold a grudge without looking like an a hole because she apologised
i don t understand the need to drive hours for them to apologize facetime works just as well i m so tired of the moms who use the i need a break from my kids as an excuse for some one else to watch them these are usually the kids who aren t parented well and aren t used to a routine there s no reason to subject someone else to another parents failings it s a big red flag and big fat no for me
seconding that not telling everyone that she lied and slandered you to the entire family is not an apology or atonement for her actions she needs to come clean and regardless i would never do her any favors
she wanted you to drive hours back so she could again play the victim see i m apologizing even though she was the wrong one that was going to be the jest of that conversation the entire family is still under the impression that you were mean to her and her child tell her to fix it or no contact
one thought i had while reading your original post and this update is that it s upsetting that your family didn t or wouldn t give you the space to explain your side of the situation before making a judgement call or choosing sides and since those same family members are continuing to act distant and cold op might need to address a systemic issue that goes beyond just this one incident i don t know just thinking out loud obviously op needs to do what s best for themselves so now might not be the best time to address any overarching family dynamics and just stick the issue at hand
sorry but i think what she did before was unforgivable and no amount of apology will change that no matter what stress a mother may be under she can t insist on childcare from someone who isn t willing you didn t have this child she did and the child from your report is a horror also it s not clear how she explained the event and her alleged repentance to your relatives i don t believe you need their forgiveness because they shouldn t have opened their traps about it in the first place why didn t they take little trudy or whoever she is how you deal with this is of course up to you but i personally would not want any of these people in my life including little trudy
they are not obligated to talk to you ever again
well hey man unlike the rest of these crusties in the comments i m happy you got what seems like genuine apology
i asked carol about it and she s not even sure maybe double check she s told them she exaggerated events
carol needs to clear this up with the rest of the family she was also wrong for doing that and needs to fix it
sounds like they might still be angry because they haven t heard the full story from carol yet
yes she knew she was wrong because she had to exaggerate the situation to make her look like the victim i agree that it s doubtful she explained this part to the rest of the family even if she did they should be mature enough to to apologize for being an a h to op they have no reason to be petty and still not speak with her i wouldn t lose any sleep over it you did nothing wrong eta correct spelling
this right here if carol is truly sorry she can clean up the mess she made
if they re anything like my family they ll just pretend nothing happened no acknowledgement means no apologies

nta you didn t even report her animal you were asked by the front office and you answered honestly
nta her choice her mistake her actions her consequences
you didn t report anything you responded to an accusation that they thought was you but wasn t nta
nta lying to the admin would have gotten you in trouble she is the one that messed up by not registering it and not paying
nta you risk being kicked out of your home if it comes back on you your roommate clearly knows they re allowed pets be smart and register them
nta you didn t know and it s not your fault she got caught her actions les to her consequences don t sweat it if she asks how admin found out be honest and tell her it was a mistake lying to cover for yourself probably won t make things any better
nta if you didn t know you didn t know besides registering the pet was your roommate s responsibility not your fault at all
nta you didn t report it you got something from them that prompted you to provide them with the information
nta clearing your own name is never the asshole move it s not like you went out of your way to report her they made a mistake you corrected them and in the process of that they discovered roommate was skirting the rules
you didn t know that she failed to register her pet so nta but if you had known and decided to snitch on her my verdict would be slightly different a lot of people don t register their pets because the fees are insane and its already hard enough to live as is i can sympathize
nta i would feel bad about it too but it wasn t like you reported it maliciously
nta
nta you had no idea your roommate had never registered the dog you weren t home during the inspection so was your roommate if your roommate was home then i think there s a question of was the email actually an error or did she say the dog is yours to avoid the fine it is plausible for the roommate to say the dog was yours thinking you d then go to the office to address it they d confirm you have a registered pet and then they d just drop the fee i m not saying it was a good plan but i can see how they d think that would get them out of the fee
nta the unregistered pet is a lease violation since they emailed you ask if they will remove the email from your rental history you don t want that hanging on you when you look for a new place responsible pet owners pay the deposit fees and pet rent when you move out get them to do a walk through with you and have them confirm that the damage was not done by your cat that way you protect your deposit
nta largely because you didn t know rm s pet wasn t registered so you weren t going out of your way to expose them you simply gave an honest answer to a straight forward question
nta you didn t do it put of spite they asked a question and you answered honestly thinking the dog was registered
nta you had no way of knowing your roommate didn t register her dog with the complex please don t feel bad over a misunderstanding you could not control
lol nta the roommate screwed up and should be fined heavily
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** i will start this out by saying that for a while now i completely believed that she had been paying the pet fees after multiple noise complaints and the apartment doing virtually nothing about it i figured she had just been given a warning as her dog was already in their system i was recently gone during apartment safety inspections and i keep a cat in my room after coming home i got an email stating that i had an unregistered pet which would lead to a fine which was odd as i paid the pet deposit a year ago and continue to pay pet rent i asked the front office about it and they were able to confirm all of this and said the email must have been sent to the wrong room in the unit they then asked if one of my roommates has a pet and i replied that yes one of them has a dog they looked things up on the system and apparently my roommate never registered her animal after living here around half a year or more i feel completely guilty that she may be fined when there is only a short amount of time left in the leasing period but i had no idea that the dog wasn t listed in her documents on the other hand with noise complaints it is a very loud dog and other concerning things about behavior i have noticed i feel like it was right to let the apartments know aita i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta
nta you didn t actually report her she got caught in her own subterfuge
nta you didn t even report it you just said yes when they asked if she had a dog part of being a pet owner is paying for things like deposits and pet rent she should ve done what she s supposed to do and it isn t your fault they accidentally found out when you told the truth
nta you went through the system properly your roommate didn t if they want to play stupid games they can win stupid prizes
nta you didn t report her you were fined and accused of something you didn t do so you rightfully called the complex and they asked you a question which you truthfully answered the only ah here is your roommate
nta you got a bill that you didn t owe all you were doing was clearing it up because you had done your bit it s all on her for not being a responsible pet owener
nta it would be one thing if you called the leasing office unprompted but they literally were going to fine you your pet is registered and hers is not she should have taken the dog out while they were inspecting if she wanted to keep the dog a secret you had no idea she didn t register the dog and you did nothing wrong
nta that dog is her responsibility she should have registered it and pay for it if you didn t go to the front office you would end up paying fine yourself which is not ok
nta she didn t pay the fees pretty cut and dry you didn t run to the office to report it and they would have assumed the dog was yours if you left out that detail and you would be paying those fees
nta
nta
nta you didn t even really report it in my opinion they discovered the pet during an inspection you just told the truth so you didn t have to pay their fine you did and paid everything you were supposed to for your pet she knew she was supposed to pay a fee and chose to take the chance on getting caught she failed
nta you mistakenly thought your roommate was following the rules you re lucky they aren t kicking you out for her violation of the lease
nta you mistakenly thought your roommate was following the rules you re lucky they aren t kicking you out for her violation of the lease
nta even if you didn t know that dog was going to be found out eventually also what was your roommate s reaction
nta roommate needs to follow the rules
nta i know someone who didn t pay the pet fee and the apartment found out after a couple years and they had to pay on top of their rent for the month and they were warned you shouldn t have to pay for your roommate s problem and you don t need to jeopardize your living situation with the management
nta well if it isnt the consequences of her own actions eh
nta
if she d asked op to lie or even let them know it was an unregistered pet that would be one thing not that you re obligated to lie just because someone asks but no one can be expected to lie about something they didn t even know needed lying about
as a former apartment manager they would have found out eventually personally i wouldn t confirm that you told so i hope the office doesn t either to keep things from getting awkward also the office has to notify you before entering which means she had time to remove the dog and his belongings nta
actually kind of sucks because the violation is on the unit property managers rarely go through the effort if differentiating
both of my pets are illegal residents but i made that decision fully aware that there s a chance i ll get caught and have to pay i ve got roommates and everyone was very aware of the situation before the cats were acquired not paying exorbitant pet fees is fine hiding it from the people you live with is shitty
meh i m for pet fees
i agree it s considerate to let your roommates know at the very least but i feel you i had to pay an deposit plus pay an extra per month to have my cat in my apartment and yes that deposit is additional on top of my other deposit for in case of damages when i moved in straight up thievery i d rather take my chances of getting caught and pay a fine
i m over the pet limit for my city but only my dogs and one cat are on the record i ve decided the risk is very low and i m not worried about it
not paying pet fees is shitty too
most pet owners in rentals destroy the property that carpet will have to be replaced not just professionally cleaned pet smells are hard to remove etc it s fair to charge more for pets month is nothing
haha good one
i have dogs and a cat and i live in a rental home i take my dogs for walks and let them out frequently my cat uses her covered litter box and does not mark or scratch walls i completely understand having a pet deposit but there is no way i d pay an extra monthly fee maybe you know people who allow their pets to destroy their homes but don t lump all pet owners together
the carpets are always the cheapest crap dude my husband and i could destroy it
i had a dog in a rental for years with no damage issues but i also am a lawyer with a client whose tenants racked up 15k in damages caused by dogs including having to hire hazmat cleaners to pick up a year s worth of unscooped poop because she loved dogs and thought the tenants would be responsible pet owners i told her this us why the only thing worse than being a tenant is being a non corporate landlord this is why landlords that do allow pets require hefty fees
i know landlords too many don t take care and dven with the best care accidents happen

nta the whole thing is just a lot
nta i don t even like friends family showing up unannounced
nta you tried being polite and she didn t get the message now she does
nta if you ve tried to set boundaries and she goes past them that s an issue
nta she could be lonely sure but that doesn t give her a pass to get pushy and invade your life and privacy you set some healthy boundaries
nta that s weird behavior on her part and she needs some boundaries
nta the average person knows it s rude to do the things she does i have a neighbor like this but not to this level you have to be firm with some people before they get the hint
something similar happened to me the person lived nearby and was a physically intimidating feet tall special needs person who didn t know he was behaving inappropriately by standing outside my house at midnight or following me round getting on the same bus and even following me to work he s the reason i learned to drive
nta boundaries are healthy and you weren t rude
nta she s lucky you re so patient
nta she can t just assume she s on a sitcom
nta you did all the right things and it didn t stick at the end of the day she has to be responsible for her behavior and if her feelings are hurt because of her behavior
nta you set boundaries she ignored them and now faces the consequences
nta she was overstepping nobody wants random people in their home
nta you don t owe her friendship and it sounds as though her personality wasn t invigorating and that s the end of it
nta people like this count on you not setting any boundaries and they only get more annoying as time goes on the next thing you know you have no time or space to yourself my mother in law is like this and so was someone who lived near me when i was in college you have to get rid of them before they fully take over your home you did the right thing
nta been there it only gets worse the longer you let it go on if you didn t say anything she was going to eventually move in wear your clothes demand money and the crazy part you were probably upfront the whole time but left in utter shock when she just walks in after you say not right now right yeah i don t know if this small percentage of the population does this intentionally or not but it s exhausting enjoy the silence and don t back down because you ll have to actually yell next time don t feel bad she sure doesn t feel bad at all about your discomfort only herself
nta she sounds entitled and annoying and you have the right to privacy
nta at all you are just trying to maintain a healthy boundary that should have gone without saying
nta all you did was establish a healthy boundary
nta and start locking your door
is she called penny
is your neighbour a sim nta
nah some people are okay with the pop in it s absolutely fine that you re not and now that you ve set that boundary that s important and it should be respected it won t stop you from being friendly with her
nah she s struggling to make friends and thought she made new ones with you and your roomie you and your roomie weren t making friends just being good neighbors you did the right thing to try and repair things with you her you can try and reiterate that you want to be good neighbors tell her how she can lean on you in future with things like watering her plants if she s on a trip and make a point to bring her a disposable nothing to be returned plate of food when you cook something like a big pot of chili in the next week or two
nta she s toooooooo much
nta never feel bad about setting firm boundaries
nta she is overstepping your boundaries
nta you shouldn t be made to feel uncomfortable in your own space she needs to know there are boundaries
nta you have been incredibly patient with this woman but she clearly isn t sharing your reality make sure to keep your door locked at all times and don t hide a key by the door etc so she can t come in uninvited
nta her intentions and such may of been good in her mind and maybe just wanted a friend however not acknowledging the boundaries you tried to clearly set nicely is pretty out of line you have all right to feel comfortable in your home you also have all right and reason to be more aggressive the last time you set your boundaries had to get it through to her somehow if being nice wasn t working
isn t this trespassing
next time answer the door naked
is her last name kramer
nta i live in an apartment and would love to have my neighbours as friends but you can t force friendship you re not ta for setting boundaries and she is ta for ignoring them your apartment is where you live you don t have to be bothered by these sorts of things in your home
it really is she came back today like at pm and i was so tired of her so i told her to gtfo
same this would drive me nuts
she may be lonely because she did this to everyone else who might have been a friend but that s not op s problem to fix or even put up with
this was my first thought asking to borrow food if op doesn t maintain boundaries they ll be living next to kramer
sounds like it i wonder if op s name is sheldon
no that will be a mixed signal some people don t have boundaries and forget others do don t lead her on by accident with yummy chili just be polite when you see her and if she seems hurt say i m sorry if i hurt your feelings but i m more of an introvert and get uncomfortable being so outgoing she should understand that and then it shouldn t be awkward nah
is her last name kramer
good honestly there are a lot of question marks as to why she would think this is appropriate behavior
was just wondering who does that only sitcom neighbors just show up to hang out

nta compromise for the middle name is reasonable and he s over reacting especially given you weren t close with her and your perspective of her not getting to be herself essentially being forced into the shoes of her dead aunt is fair
naming a baby should be both parents decision in my opinion i think both parents should come to a mutual agreement
nta they are still grieving and they may think they want this but it really is best as a middle name using the loved ones name might seem like an honor but how long before it becomes unbearable if she had been gone for longer years for example i d say different but in this case i don t think they could handle it
nta naming a baby is a two yes one no situation both parents need to agree on the name or it s out
nta absolutely do not do that it s a horrible thing to do to a child your baby will be there own person not a replacement for his sister lucky you re the mother so you kind of have final say here and he can t make you final say in a practical sense in that she can just have the baby without him present and she doesn t need him to sign the birth certificate your compromise was completely reasonable and he is being a huge ah about this
nta personal story here and i m not saying using the name as a middle is not a great compromise its more of a the family may not be thinking through this warning my cousin died within months of my birth i was given her name as my middle it always felt off and yes i did feel like a replacement which also may be because the family was filled with awful people i ended up changing it as an adult i understand my mother thought she would be honoring her late niece but it was more like i had to live up to a ghost child who s potential was imaginary and i was never seen as me especially to the aunt and grandparents
nta and i personally wouldn t even want it as a middle name so you are better person than me your partner doesn t realize how lucky he is that you d be willing to compromise on that
nta he doesn t get to insist you name the baby after a person you basically tolerated at the end of the day the hospital asks you the name for the birth certificate well they do in the states he can either compromise or you tell the nurse what name to put on it
nta i think compromising on using her name as baby s middle name is perfectly reasonable maybe doing an early gender reveal will nip the argument if it s a boy anyways
nta i think it s absolutely fair to not want your child to live in the shadow of a recently deceased relative if you put it to him as reasonably as you did here then i think you re fine you offered a compromise that sounds fair i think he s being an ah by refusing to consider anything but his own opinion
nta you re actually birthing the baby so your vote matters more imo the common reddit line is baby names are a yes no meaning that both of you have to agree on the name or it s a no go stand firm use the name as a middle name don t let anyone beat you into giving your child a name you dislike
nta first off you bf shouldn t be calling you names guilting you and punishing you by not speaking to you i d think hard about that he has no respect for your feelings and reasonings which frankly are all valid your not having this child as a tribute to his lost sister women too often allow themselves to be treated in ways that aren t healthy to keep the peace you say you don t know what to do i do go to a friends your parents a hotel tell him he needs to decide what and who is important to him and if it isn t you and your child your moving on without him and naming the baby whatever you please and he can have visitation and child support
i don t understand why anyone would name their children after their sibling dead or alive
nta trying to force you to name your baby after someone who was always unpleasant to you is not reasonable you ve offered the option of the middle name which was generous of you i m not going to say that your boyfriend and his family are arseholes as they are still grieving
nta in a few years you may not even still be together especially if that s how he acts but your daughter would be stuck with that name you were willing to compromise and he just blew up on you and is giving you the cold shoulder plus this is all a hypothetical for now since it s a boy hopefully things gets sorted before the reveal
nta end of
nta he doesn t get to not budge you re the one carrying the baby and you ll be the one giving birth to the baby so you have the final say on the baby s name this business of partners who employ silent treatment tactics and namecalling mystifies me it s never a good way to settle a disagreement because all it does is breed resentment that will eventually beget greater problems you didn t get along with his sister and so you re being more than sensitive in offering to give the baby her name as a middle name if your boyfriend doesn t like that then he can step aside and you can simply name the baby as you see fit as far as his family same thing you ve offered to give your baby their daughter s name as a middle name it s a good compromise
nta i m sorry they re stressing you out like this
nta you ever watch the tv show you they made the baby s middle name the deceased brother s name and that side of the family only called the baby by the middle name instead of the first name and it was super unhealthy now i know this is a tv show but i feel like it would be similar in real life i hope everything works out for you though just make sure the father isn t in charge of filling out the birth certificate even if you decide on a different name you never know what could happen
nta i was named after an aunt that passed when she was a child people said i looked like her and it was as if she was reborn as me my grandma especially would talk to me as if i was my aunt it was uncomfortable and family told me to let her pretend i wanted my own identity my name was chosen by my father it was his sister and i hate it i instead used my nickname as it felt better and family said i was erasing my aunts identity and should be more proud i think suggesting the middle name was an incredibly fair option
nta you need enthusiastic yeses for a baby name maybe offer some other ways to honor his sister plant a tree on the property in her honor or commission a children s book about her for the kids to read it sounds like your husband is worried about forgetting her which isn t an unreasonable fear especially if you were on bad terms with her make an effort to show him that his sister will be remembered and that your kids will know who she was
nta sometimes it s nice to have a boyfriend instead of a husband as you learn facts that make you go hmmmm
nta believe it or not naming a child is a decision if he refuses to move try suggesting using his sisters name as a middle name if you re happy with the solution and select a first name which brings you both happiness and joy please don t feel pressured into settling just to keep your husband happy
info do you know if it s a boy or girl yet you may be arguing over nothing it s a very emotional situation so maybe wait until you know if it s even going to be an issue
based on your reasoning i say yta had you genuinely disliked the name and didn t want it for your child i d get behind that you have every right to want to love the name you give your baby but this means something to your husband and probably his family as well disagreeing solely because you didn t really get along and she was cold you sure you weren t the cold one is an unfortunate reason to go against something that might mean everything to him the excuse i don t want a dead person s name my kid will feel less special eh no she won t is just a dumb excuse you re making to try and validate yourself if you had a real reason the name just isn t a good one doesn t suit my taste then yes but i just didn t like the girl sucks to use as the sole reason to deprive him of this honor you re saying that had the two of you hit it off your husband would be good to go nah yta
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** so my boyfriend and i have been together for about six years and i m pregnant with our first baby about a year and a half ago one of his older sisters passed away it was very sudden and shocking and the family is still in mourning recently my boyfriend and i have started discussing baby names even though we are keeping the gender a surprise until the baby is born agreeing on a boy name was easy enough but he is dead set on wanting the baby named after his late sister if it s a girl i didn t want to be insensitive so i told him that i would think about it but i already knew what my answer was no his sister and i never really got along she acted cold and was distant towards me the rest of his family and i get along fine so i m not sure why from the beginning maybe if we had been closer i would be more open to the idea of naming the baby after her but i m not sure also this is probably selfish but i just don t want the baby named after a family member that has recently died i don t want them to grow up feeling like they re just a memory of their aunt after a few days of thinking about it i let my boyfriend know how i feel he was shocked that i said no and became incredibly upset calling me selfish and immature and other things like that i offered to compromise and use his sister s name as the baby s middle name but he didn t like that idea he said he wants the baby s first name to be used after her and he won t budge on that he won t listen to any other names that i like for the baby and now he s barely speaking to me at all so i don t know what to do my family doesn t really care about the baby s name but his family is also really upset that i said no especially his mother which i understand but i think she s the one who is really pressuring my boyfriend to get me to agree to this anyway aita i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta naming your child is a personal thing between and mother and father only others may voice their opinion but they don t have a say in the final choice naming a child should always be two yes and not a split decision be honest with your partner and say sis was always cold to me and aloof although i am sorry she has passed her name brings up hurtful feeling that i wouldn t want to associate with my child yes all children will have a period where they give their parents the cold shoulder or silent treatment it would only reinforce a negative feeling if she has the same name as his sister who treated you the same way
nta you offered the middle name which was generous considering the circumstances his family are in mourning i was going to suggest not stating exactly why but maybe finding some info regarding kids named after other people and the impact it has on them then gently raise it with your bf coming from that angle might alleviate some of the resentment if it s because you disliked his sister valid from what you ve said he and his family will remain resentful due to their recent grief
nta both parents have veto power
nta
nta you were willing to compromise and use the middle name he wasn t i m sure his grief is clouding his judgment perhaps therapy could help
nta of course but if i can make a suggestion my little brother is named after my dad s uncle johnny who died right before my brother was born my parents wanted to name my brother after him but didn t want to name him john so what they did instead was looked at the john equivalents in other countries and languages like juan hans johann gianni and so on and so forth they went with none of those names in case y all were wondering if the homage to his sister is important to your bf but you would prefer a name that wasn t hers you can always look for a different version of the sister s name or something in a different culture with the same meaning
nta a name shouldn t have negative feelings attached
nta baby names need to be agreed upon by both parents to initially get upset because you do not agree with the name he wants is understandable but to continue to hold onto that anger is not does your boyfriend understand that you were not close to his sister because of her demeanor or are you just supposed to forget that when naming your child or because she died does he think that no longer matters not sure what the answer for this is other than to hope you have a boy so the problem is bypassed for this baby
nta in this day and age it is a bit creepy to name a baby after someone who s recently deceased i get that your partner is still full of grief but he doesn t get the final say here baby names are two yes s with full veto from either partner your compromise of using her name as the baby s middle name is a perfect way to respectfully honor his sister
nta he s setting up your daughter to be sister and it s right not to give her that baggage i hope you have a boy
nta but i m curious as to how that works on paper what happens if two parents won t agree on a baby s name do hospitals have some sort of procedure to follow in events like that either way your husband is going to have to compromise this baby only half belongs to him so he only gets half a say if he won t go for the middle name idea maybe try and pitch names that are similar to his sisters name for example if his sisters name was lauren you could suggest naming the baby laura it s close enough to be reminiscent of his sister but different enough that you aren t just using your baby as a tombstone
nta i hope you have a boy
so there s the thing that a name requires two yeses but i d like to point out that you are not married and therefore he may legally get zero say in this depends on where you live of course not all couples want to marry and that s totally a valid choice but it gives him less power at birth in my opinion both morally and legally
nta you are compromising by letting it be the baby s middle name plus you re the one pushing the baby out you definitely have a say in what to name your baby his mother doesn t also don t let him fill out the birth certificate if it s a girl
nta it s two yes otherwise look again
nah my middle name is from my father s sister that passed as a young child my grandmother spoke of her sometimes never comparing us just fun moments between her children one memory is a vivid as the day it happened over years ago i graduated university my grandmother was sitting in an arm chair holding my diploma and i can still see her finger running across my middle name she was happy for me but i m sure she also thought of what could have been she passed a few months later
this is the way named my daughter after her grandmother first names are for the child to create their own identity second for the fam and to root them in tradition
my mother wanted to name me after her sister who died at birth my grandmother said absolutely not that it was bad luck and would curse the child to do that thankfully my mum listened
it isn t always possible and in this case it seems that it won t be possible for the parents to truly agree agreement in this case means op gives in and gives her daughter a name she doesn t especially like in honor of a person she didn t especially like to please other people that s not agreement that s acquiescence if they parents can t come to a true agreement not acquiescence but agreement the op who is actually giving birth to the baby has the final say
way back in the 30s women weren t consulted when naming grandmother was not okay with making her firstborn a jr but grandpa did because she wasn t consulted about the birth certificate then jr died while she was pregnant with their second kid and grandpa decided with grandmother after that because he was superstitious
oh wow thank you for sharing that it makes me feel better about my decision
lol slowly but surely the misandry always sneaks in on reddit active parents should agree on their child s names end of by your logic a sahp has to ultimately accept what the working parent says if they don t then the earner should make the decision and ignore the sahp what are the odds you won t agree to that though because the public image of a sahp is a female mother in this scenario it s the male father thats on the losing end
seems like it would be smarter not to use it as a middle name because everyone in the boyfriend s family is already being extremely unreasonable so if it s the middle name they might just insist that it s basically the de facto name because it s the only thing they ever call the kid
your vote matters more you have to be joking by that logic a sahp should have less of a day when it comes to any financial decision because they are the one who s actually earning the money and paying tax what nonsense
thank you i agree if we can t come to an agreement soon we may have to spend some time apart unfortunately
my brother is actually named after all uncles two have the same first name adjusted for cultural differences like jesus and joshua or john and ivan and the third is his middle name i m named after my amazing grandmother and my crazy and i mean virulently and purposely awful not mentally ill great grandmother but my of my grandparents came from huge farm families so all of the regular american names were taken they got recycled because back in the day you got nicknames like my great uncle bud he hated styles i wanted to name my son david eugene after my grandfathers and because it sounds perfect for yelling out the back door for a kid to get home immediately but was vetoed we settled on not naming him after anyone
it s a two yeses no kind of deal your attitude of i m the woman it s my decision is nearly as bad as her husbands
she suggested that he said no
op stated they are keeping the gender a secret they need names pick for both genders
all her reasons are valid
that s what we did too
yup as birthing parent ultimately she should be able to make the final decision
nta your boyfriend s lack of willingness to compromise or even discuss things rationally doesn t bode well for how he will be able to work out future issues down the line my brother died suddenly in his 20s suicide and the grief was intense and blindsiding so i have empathy for your boyfriend but when i named my own kids i chose not to use his name because i have seen how badly it impacted other kids who were named that way in my extended family beyond feeling like a replacement they tended to be very afraid that they would die in the same way or have the same issues as their namesake no kid should have to go through that while i hope your bf turns it around if he doesn t it s important that you do what s best for the baby and not what he wants because he isn t considering the baby s or your feelings right now which doesn t speak highly of his ability as a father or a partner it s possible he can come to his senses but don t hold out for that protect yourself and your baby
if you cannot get to two yesses and some couple s can t then the body that carries the baby makes the final decision when men can get pregnant and go through all that pregnancy and birth entails and it s a lot then they can make the final call when they and their partners cannot reach agreement
while usually i agree with the yes no approach in this case they aren t married and he is showing an unreasonable unhealthy attitude towards the issue which makes it seem like this relationship may not last so while hopefully he can change his stance and work this out to find a name they can agree on if he won t then she needs to choose the name otherwise the baby is going to be named after not only someone who died prematurely which can be especially bad depending on the cause of death such as if it was suicide an overdose cancer etc because the child can get hung up on the idea that they are doomed to die that way too as i ve seen with kids named that way in my extended family which is a horrible thing to do to any kid but also op will have a child named after the sister of her ex boyfriend who disliked her the middle name of my first kid was chosen against my wishes and it bothers me every time i have to write it down i can only imagine how much worse it would be for the first name for op the boyfriend s inflexible stance shows he s not really thinking about the baby as an individual yet nor valuing their or their mother s feelings he s still just processing his grief which is understandable but it s important he doesn t get the chance to make a mistake that will hurt the kid because of it
he s not her husband he s just a boyfriend
so here s the thing this is an opinion thread and i offered reasoning why i don t think they re valid and then i voted i didn t comment on your vote commentary and randomly tell you your thinking is wrong ffs
only one of the people involved in creating the baby is at risk of dying in the process after all
by you logic you would also agree that if a financial decision needs to be made with a sahp involved then the final decision is on the breadwinner if they fail to agree
you re absolutely right that this is an opinion thread but part of that is probably having an opinion on other people s opinions wouldn t you say
if you dont want people commenting on your opinion then dont post it keep it to yourself
fair point i suppose so you think people should explain their reasoning for the opinions they give
to be honest i was just trying to get a conversation going about it

nta repaying you comes before a vacation you need it to commute to work their neglect caused it to be stolen so they need to face the consequences especially since it was expressly forbidden that he ride it
nta she is responsible for her child when he breaks or lose s someone else s property his consequence is they don t get as big a vacation this year that s actually a good punishment for him
nta your sister should pay you your parents can pay money into your sister s vacation budget your sister can make payments back to your parents solved
nta this is your sister s fault she s responsible this is an expensive enough item to expect repayment not to mention it is your way to commute to work
she said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund if replacing the scooter meant they d have to use money reserved for basic necessities rent or mortgage food utilities then i d say you may want to reconsider the payment plan option but if they re upset because they can t take a vacation this year because of this then tough shit nta
nta family vacation is luxury they can skip a year to teach their kid a lesson and to learn a lesson of their own have an insurance even though the insurance possibly wouldn t pay in this situation because the kid isn t that young anymore it s not like they have to cut their food or every day life to pay you
nta x200b years old is old enough to accept responsibility for his actions and his mother is just as culpable as his guardian your nephew needs to learn to respect other people s belongings and although it sucks to lose their vacation expensive lessons are often the most impactful
nta screw their vacation if they can t even make their kid to listen to simple instructions for example don t touch my scooter
nta if they would starve trying to pay you back https://americanliterature.com/author/guy-de-maupassant/short-story/the-necklace), sure if they are denied a vacation sucks to be a bad parent if this was california it is illegal to ride such a scooter without a driver s license
i don t understand the y t a votes i knew better than to steal other people s vehicles at the age of your sister is an asshole for enabling your nephew to steal your property and she has a lot of gall to suggest paying back in chores actions have consequences they are lucky you didn t call the cops they are lucky that their son wasn t injured and also payment plans are bullshit they will not pay you back they can skip vacation for a year nta
nta everyone involved knew this was off limits an immediate replacement is needed they are tagging the money as vacation money is money not your issue how they perceive where it comes from wrong risky behavior without consequences leads to it happening again you can submit a claim to your home insurance but it may jack your rate folks who work insurance may weigh in or consider r insurance r insuranceprofessional
nta i bet this isn t the first time ever that nephew took it out either sister probably covered for him until it was stolen and she couldn t hide it from you
first of all if god forbid your cousin had been injured killed himself or caused an accident on the road you could be sued and people could have gotten hurt this is a very serious breach of your trust and should be treated as such your sister knew her son was desperate to ride the scooter and she did nothing to assure that he would leave it alone he didn t take the scooter and left it unattended the kid straight up stole the scooter and got it stolen if he left it unattended it is reasonable to assume he used the scooter multiple times kids who are sneaking a vehicle of any kind are usually not wanting to get caught so they put it back after using it getting distracted and leaving a scooter lying somewhere around tells me that it wasn t a one off and possibly that mommy knew they have the money to replace it the fact that they want to go on vacation with said funds instead of replacing your commute scooter immediately is not your problem your nephew is the one responsible for them not having the money to go have fun your parents agree that nephew should be punished was a swift punishment not issued by mommy immediately if so what like no tv for minutes good tell them that his punishment should be him not your sister doing chores for his mother so she can pay back the vacation money additionally he can mow lawns wash cars etc for neighbors to help her pay you back as if this kid should be rewarded with a vacation after pulling such a dangerous and costly stunt anyway if he had stolen a neighbor scooter used for commuting and got it stolen would your sister beg them to let her do chores actions have consequences this child fucked around and should find out what it means to lose privileges like a costly vacation imo your nephew also should take responsibility by writing you a letter of apology outlining how risky and inconsiderate he was with his actions you are not being unreasonably demanding and it is not you who is punishing everyone else in fact it ridiculous they are trying to guilt you into letting this slide like you are in some way responsible for any of this do not agree to a payment plan this is opening yourself up to a host if future problems let your parents fund the vacation of their daughter s family if it s so important for their precious baby and grandson to have one nta hold your ground
sister needs to pay for it and nephew can work for her she s culpable as well nta
nta they owe you or the exact same scooter with all the same mods this isn t that hard
nta technically he stole it you forbid him from using it his mother didn t check on him and now the scooter is gone stolen again but from a stranger it is expensive and as a year old he should know better i wouldn t care about them dipping in the vacation fund they should pay you back right away
lol let him do chores around your sisters house to repay for their vacation fund after they get you a new scooter nta
nta maybe they can put their holiday on a payment plan a holiday is a want not a need tough luck their kid was irresponsible with something they couldn t afford to replace easily maybe should have instilled in the kid not to touch others property
nta you aren t talking about a little damage that leaves it still usable it s gone you need it for the purposes you use it for consequently they need to replace it immediately if that means no vacation for the brat that seems like a fair punishment on top of the required restitution of paying for the new scooter
nta so your nephew stole your electric scooter only to have it stolen from him and you feel like the ah
nta have them finance it directly at the point of purchase if they want a payment plan you aren t a bank and they ll stop making payments to you and just expect you to deal with it
nta you re holding them accountable and it s completely justified to hell with their vacation they can learn common decency in the meantime
nta he stole your scooter was careless with it paying you back especially if it means he misses his vacation might teach him a necessary lesson i get that your sister will lose her vacation too maybe that will teach her something about the consequences of poor parenting
nta kids a thief i wouldn t want him doing chores in my house either you also need to report your scooter stolen
nta they were told not to mess with it the kid didn t listen and now they need to make it right
nta and where was your sister when your nephew took the scooter out
nta and don t cave
nta substitute car with scooter and we d wouldn t be hearing this about your nephew
nta your nephew knew he wasn t suppose to take the scooter and so did your sister yet he did take it and it was stolen he is responsible and so is she if they lose a vacation so what maybe it will teach them to abide by your rules and listen your parents are enabling their grandson and daughter by saying it s too harsh no it s not he basically stole the scooter and is lucky you aren t pressing charges for theft in fact your sister is teaching him it s okay to take things because he wants to and she ll cover for him
nta thats practically a car he knew not to touch it she knew he shouldn t touch it and yet here they are in this predicament vacation money is a privilege that others don t even have so yes it should be paid back if its providing you transportation to your job she could also just get a loan from the bank line of credit ask your parents and pay them back
if it was stolen they should have filed a police report and you could claim it on your insurance
nta your nephew did not have permission to use your scooter and it ended up stolen say you weren t related and you filed charges against a person who stole your property do you think the judge would say they re guilty but they ll pay you in installments because they have a vacation planned losing out on the vacation is a direct consequence of his actions and hopefully he ll learn from it also how much does your sister think chores around the house are worth they owe you that s years worth of toilet cleaning and laundry from a year old who i doubt would do a pristine job anyway
nta i d be just as livid as you and your sister should full well pay for it back if paying the money would put them in a tough spot then i d understand the payment option but if its only because mah vacation then i d get the money back asap edit actually the payment plan option would be good if they accept paying interest
nta the kid needs to learn that actions have consequences lose a 2k scooter don t get a vacation pretty sure he will become more responsible after that
nta he was told not to ride it and still did and you use it to get to work your nephew using the scooter without your permission and then leaving it unattended getting it stolen is not ok they need to pay you back
nta he is old enough to know better and your sister needs to replace it if they can t go on vacation oh well part of the lesson learned
nta whining to elderly parents when you do have the funds but don t want to spend them on your bratty son s negligence is beyond juvenile and pathetic when your child has expressly been warned that the scooter is too powerful for him and four figures a mannerly apology with amends does not begin with boo hoo my vacation my son will be so sad tough luck buttercup pay your sister and perhaps junior can learn a little lesson in values by helping seniors single parents any neighbour who needs a hand during the time he should be on vacation this is precisely what my father used to do with my hellion brother
nta nephew took it against your express orders and then didn t even take care of it properly letting it get stolen i m wondering how many other times he took it out and just didn t tell you about it because no harm no foul if your parents think it s important that sister and nephew go on vacation they can give them the money for it
nta your sister runs to mommy and daddy to get out of paying what she owes delightful
nta the mom should have paid attention the mom is responsible for them losing their vacation fund you are not responsible you should not have to wait for a payment plan
nta if she wants a payment plan she can get one from the bank when she gets the loan to either top up their vacation fund or pay you back edit sorry it s your parents suggesting the payment plan fine they can buy you a new scooter and your sister can pay them back at a dollar a month or whatever
nta your nephew doesn t have your permission and he took it your sister knew that honestly if i were you i d even talk about pressing charge as this isn t something cheap and easily replaceable this is something you need to use and expensive if they want to moan about vacation then they really should have taught that kid better thirteen years old is definitely old enough to learn about the consequences of his actions if your parents are so concerned about where your sister would have to pull the funds you can suggest them paying you then to have your nephew pay them as chores around their house
what kind of punishment did she suggest when you lose destroy or cause to be stolen something of such large value the punishment should absolutely hurt let s be honest op his mom likely knew that he took the scooter and he d likely taken it before taking away their vacation fund seems entirely reasonable to me nta
nta when i break something of someone else s it s not even a question i am replacing it people will politely decline but i think it s just the right thing to do i am teaching my daughter the same this isn t even a situation of your nephew borrowing it and breaking it he used it without your permission and then was irresponsible and it was stolen i do think a reasonable payment plan should be acceptable though
nta tell your parents to pay u since they feel it s unfair to go into the vacation money tough tour nephew needs to learn consequences to his actions
nta your nephew doesn t deserve to be rewarded with a vacation either
nta it is not a toy it is the vehicle you use to commute to work if he d joyridden in a car and had it stolen police would likely be involved it seems a fair trade off replacing a method of work transport versus a holiday that said hope they are legal where you are illegal where i am and people ride them on pavements so not a fan
nta i too have a emove cruiser that i use for commute and i would be pissed if anything happen to it your nephew is at the age where he is well aware that there are consequences for his actions stay firm and get the money your are owed
nta did they even file a police report they can t just do something with big consequences and just say oh well get insurance on your next scooter
your sister needs to repay you now especially since this is your commuter transportation they can use a payment plan to put money back into their vacation fund nephew is plenty old enough to have understood that the scooter was off limits this is an excellent life lesson for him it sucks that they re painting you as the bad guy but you are not nta
nta maybe your parents can lend them money for the vacation and let them pay them back on a payment plan
nta you re entitled to be made whole again if they take long enough that you need to rent transportation to commute to work where you d otherwise use your scooter that adds to the costs imo it s just a vacation fund too a lesson should be learned here especially where the nephew could have been seriously hurt but you should seek new house sitters for future trips
nta he can pay the holiday fund back
get them a tent for their budget vacation nta
nta nephew can go mow lawns or some shit to replace what comes out of the vacation fund your sister knowingly let him take your scooter meaning this is entirely on her so they maybe don t get to take a vacation any time soon sounds like an entirely preventable personal problem to me i would also rub in the fact that she s very lucky all she has to do is cough up grand she doesn t have to pay medical or legal bills because she was unable to tell her son no
if your parents think a payment plan is reasonable they can pay you and set up a payment plan for your sister to pay them back nta
nta at i knew not to touch peoples stuff if i could t afford to replace it for context i had a friend who was into bmx he had a super nice and expensive bike i wouldn t touch it because if it broke i could t replace it even though he said it was fine the child isn t too young to understand no and understand consequences however it s unlikely you will get your money back in a timely manner if at all i would compromise pay half now and the kid works off the rest and not let them house sit again
we didn t have a vacation fund growing up i can tell you for certain that if i lost a 2k bike of my family i definitely wouldn t be having a vacation nta suck it up you failed as a parent he failed as a house sitter time to pay the piper
nta you expressed multiple times to not use it and he went behind your back and it was stolen also the fact it seems they waited to tell you is definitely not ok actions have consequences
nta losing out on a vacation in order to pay you back is a natural consequence and a reasonable one for your sister as well as your nephew she probably let him take the scooter for a joyride knowing full well that he didn t have your permission the only other possibility is that she was completely ignoring her son to the point that he was able to take it without her noticing either way they both need to learn from this
nta in the future though get an air tag for the new scooter and if they every house sit again lock it up
nta your parents opinion is irrelevant here what are you and your sister your parents need to stay out of it alternatively they can save your sister s vacation fund by paying you for a new scooter and setting up a payment plan for her to pay them back but they are not offering that are they you very clearly told your nephew to stay away from your scooter he took it anyway your sister didn t stop him it was a mistake is bs he has no life experience and didn t know what happens when you leave an expensive ride unattended now he does actions have consequences why should his mistake a k a violation of a boundary you ve set and your sister s over indulgent parenting have consequences losses and major inconvenience only for you if it doesn t cost him seriously he won t remember and will never learn although from the description of your family it s likely that nobody is open to learning about boundaries only about blaming the person who sets them
your nephew stole your scooter didn t take care of it and as a result allowed it to be stolen by an unknown third party of course he owes you for a new one which means his family owes you because he s a minor how does your sister think your nephew is going to do worth of labor for you it doesn t sound like he s very competent i ll bet he s not even capable of doing work worth can you afford to replace the scooter if you have savings which could replace the scooter then you should probably let your sister repay you in installments make sure to charge her interest nta
nta is more than old enough to know to respect stuff that isn t yours and also old enough to have real world consequences for your fuckups
but to take away their family vacation is just cruel and petty this is ridiculous you are not taking away their family vacation they are needing to access that fund because they were irresponsible it sounds like your sister isn t even sorry which is probably why her kid acts like that poor parenting and lack of taking responsibility don t let it slide
nta if your parents want to protect your sister which they shouldn t ffs since she s an adult then they can pay on her behalf and she can pay them back however you should be made whole immediately
nta she should watch over her kid better also where were the keys
nta tell them pay now or i file a police report
nta stand your ground and demand the payment a vacation is a luxury not a necessity
nta a vacation is not a necessity plus i wonder if the mother encouraged the son saying op wouldn t find out or she might not have either way parents are responsible for the mistakes of their children so you teach them better and if the mom knew it could have been an issue could have kept an extra eye on her son some parents keep on enabling bad behaviour maybe they will learn better to not do that it s just a vacation while the scooter is a main mode of transportation to work a necessity could op file a police report for theft and get home insurance involved i feel like they have more important things to consider rather than losing their vacation like if op decides to go through the police for theft of their scooter
nta if you want to and can afford it i d recommend buy a replacement yourself and setting up a repayment plan money not chores around the house because i m guessing you don t want the added work of supervising a year old boy for weeks on end his parents can deal with that if you can t or just don t want to take the immediate financial hit it s completely reasonable to ask for a replacement scooter if you want to be really nice i suppose you could ask sister s family to pay you back in installments and cover your ubers to work in the meantime regardless the two main points are your nephew was warned not to ride it the scooter was your transportation for work alone trumps a family vacation
nta might behoove you to set up a payment plan with them though feels like that s the path to getting your money back while also keeping a good relationship with your family
nope your nephew is a child ultimately his parents are responsible for everything he does so yes his parents deserve to be punished for bad parenting obviously it s bad parenting at fault since they re asking you not to take the offenders vacation from him nta
nta give them a deadline of a few days and let them know that if they don t pay you by then you ll report it stolen and press charges against the nephew he stole your transportation would they expect you to get over it if it were a motorcycle or car if your parents want to enable him then they can reimburse you to keep you from pressing charges the nephew is going to learn there are no consequences to his theft he steals and then gets to have a nice vacation too bad so sad for his victim
nta you break it you buy it if they don t like it he shouldn t have stolen and ridden it personally i would agree to a payment plan and or allow the nephew to work chores to help pay it off have you talked to your parents about them paying you in full and having the payment plan with your sister nephew if they can afford it
nta your sister should be responsible for paying it back and her son can do chores around her house to pay her back i also agree with another commenter if it was taking away from their necessities i would say reconsider the payment plan but missing out on a vacation is punishment for not being responsible
nta she can use their vacation money to pay you back y o can spend the summer mowing lawns or something to pay back vacation fund done deal then parents can punish him as they see fit for the inconvenience he caused his own family
nta if sister has a vacation fund they can afford it and tell everyone that they won t be going on this vacation thanks to the year old i ve made an observation about this post sister jumped in right away to tell him the bad news soo to me that means that either she gave permission her son to ride the scooter after he was told don t touch nor ride it or he stole it sister is lucky that op didn t call the police naming her so as the thief report the scooter stolen and get all your cash from your sister buy you another one and figure out another person to house sit from now on obviously sister can t be trusted in your home anymore
soooo in the us theft over is a felony he committed a felony and somehow your family thinks you re the bad guy them sacrificing vacation to pay you back is somehow not an appropriate punishment for a felony they re going to have a rough time in the future thanks to their enablement nta
nta taking your scooter wasn t an accident he stole it and then carelessly lost it your sister was also at fault as the house scooter and kid were in her care they owe you a new scooter and they don t get to prioritize their vacation over that repairing the damage they did to their relationship with you absolutely should come before family fun time
nta but everyone else is your nephew did something that he was strictly forbidden from doing and now he has to learn that his actions have repercussions such as his family not being able to go on vacation this year no wonder he stole it he has never been accountable for his actions
please update us if they pay or not we all need to know the results of this issue
tell your parents to pay you back then since they think the vacation she takes is more important
nta fuck that kid and his mom
nta but am i the only one really bothered by op s choice to word it like he s doing his sister a favor by letting her house sit for him op she is doing you a favor not the other way around even if she does like a change of scenery
nta for wanting to be paid back for your sister allowing her son to use the scooter you have expressly said no to and then it getting stolen but can i ask why you keep saying you let them housesit for you like you are being ever so gracious to allow them to do housework for you when you are out of town
obv your sister is the person responsible here nephew should be punished you should be compensated and are absolutely justified in being pissed as to demanding money right now if it would dip into their basic necessities fund that would be definitelly shitty vacation is not a necessity though break from work school is but spending that in a fun place is an indulgence i d say if you want to be gracious ask for the price of the unmodded scooter now so you can replace it and for the rest of the money later but you re not doing them any grave harm by expecting them to fix the damage they ve caused asap at the cost of their vacation
nta take your sister to small claims court she was an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to use your personal property when she and the nephew had been told it was dangerous and off limits to the nephew she needs to own up and take responsibility nephew can pay sister back by doing odd jobs for your parents if they think sister and nephew deserve a vacation
teaching a year old boy that he can disrespect you steal your incredibly expensive possession then destroy lose it then be expected to be given a cushy punishment and still have his vacation prioritized is raising menace to society absolutely nta your sister needs to do a better job at parenting
nta a vacation is not a necessity and in my opinion the fact their son stole something that valuable means he does not deserve a vacation your sister should be making it her priority to resolve this and she should be grateful you haven t filed a police report if she s so worried about her precious holiday fund it s time for your nephew to get an age appropriate job paper route babysitting etc
would she rather you press charges for your nephew stealing or in the first place other question isn t property like this covered under your homeowners policy
no you are nta your sister and your nephew are tho this also goes for your parents he was told not to use it under any circumstances and he did it anyway it got stolen and he is solely responsible i don t care about their vaccination this is their responsibility to pay for a new one now not whenever they get around to it you are in the right on this don t play the doormat because family
nta bye bye vacation consequences are extra hard when you don t follow the rules
use the word consequence instead of punishment it is a natural consequence that money set aside for fun must pay for his expensive and irresponsible choice
oh boo hoo not the vacation fund nta that s some entitlement
nta not being able to afford a vacation sounds like a them problem not yours you set a boundary with a needed item for commuting that they did not respect if they can t afford it then they shouldn t have touched it like you told them to they need to pay you to fix it irregardless of their vacation
nta i d get hard demand a payment plan or involve the law in many states four figures is grand theft
you could offer them a police report for theft instead nta
nta court idk if small claims court is applicable but definitely seek legal action it s clear that they don t plan on paying you back they think that they can just get away with a slap on the wrist

nta please do the appropriate aftercare and nurture your beautiful memorial of your father you will probably be glad later that you got it your husband needs to either set aside his feelings about tattoos in general to let you have bodily autonomy or he needs to leave
nah you like tattoos he doesn t he still tryed to support you and as it seems he never blocked your choices over your body yes your body your choice but he said he doesn t find them appealing so if you get them regardless you have to life with the consequences consequences might be that his attraction to your body sinks which is a thing nobody can critize everybody has his own prefers when it comes to sexual attraction and for some people tattoos can be a turn off your husband might be someone who thinks like that
nah if your husband put on a cologne that you felt smelled awful and off putting and you told him that you hated it and hated being around it and he kept wearing it every day it would probably hurt you even though it s a decision he made for his body because it was something he liked i have a big ol tattoo so i get the appeal i was very lucky in that my hubs was fully supportive it is your body and you absolutely get to put what you want on it he gets to feel his feelings too and he doesn t have to like your tattoos in fact he s already told you specifically that he hates them you don t get to pretend that there were no signs that he would be unhappy over a large tattoo that he has to look at every day everyone has their weird things that people don t like i don t feel like he has to justify why he doesn t like tattoos just like you don t have to justify why you do like them your husband is in a no win situation in this scenario look at all the people trying to crucify him for having an opinion in this thread he was honest about his feelings never crapped on your tattoos after you got them and always acknowledged that it was your right to do what you wish with your body i don t get where his big failure is he told you before he hates them he hates it you knew he would hate it if you want a husband who loves your tattoos find a new husband he loves you and that s going to have to be enough
not wrong for getting it but this seems like you probably could do with some couples counseling there is a fair chance that if you want to keep getting more tattoos it will probably cause significant problems in your marriage
nah her body her choice sure husband is not obligated to like the tattoo or even be attracted to her sometimes tattoos are a dealbreaker doesn t make anyone in the wrong as long as there is communication we all have preferences op has to know there was a risk husband may not be as attracted to her if she went ahead with the tattoos he isn t forbidding her from having them but he is entitled to his opinion
nah he s allowed to not like tattoos just as much as you want to get them i think this will potentially ruin your marriage though
nah your body your choice but if he doesn t like tattoos and finds you unattractive because of it that s his right you got two more tattoos knowing his feelings towards them so his reaction isn t all that surprising he tried being supportive and then you came back with a bigger tattoo so he s probably feeling misled by you give him some time for him to work through his feelings and then have another discussion either he will stay or he will leave but you need to have a discussion about if he chooses to stay that means he has to work through his feelings towards you having tattoos
it seems you haven t even considered the possibility of your husband losing attraction to you because of this you can get tattoos your body after all however what you re witnessing is just consequences of getting those tattoos body art can be polarizing some people love them and some people are disgusted by them ability to compromise is a requirement for any long standing and healthy marriage you just have to weigh what s really important to you and act accordingly good luck
he is allowed his preference what is pushing this into nta territory for me is that he festered over this for years years of him being annoyed about it without communicating it beyond snide remarks and huffs then he tells you is sarcastic about the memorial tattoo you ve been wanting and planning and now doesnt talk to you he is allowed his feelings he is allowed to see you differently he is allowed to feel less atracted to you he is allowed to take his time to manage his own emotions and feel what he feels he has also been absolutely horrible about communicating this to you in anything but sarcasm huffs snide remarks and not speaking to you it comes across to me like he almost resents that you havent magically adhered to a preference he never communicated that he had and it kept slipping out in hurtfull ways over the years and now when he finally told you and you still got the memorial rooster those years of annoyance is seeping out all at once that makes him ta here for me eta i m interpreting teyears ago as ten which could be wrong but even if its not years he has been doing this for years regardless which is what i find unacceptible holding a partner up to a standard you never communicate to them that you have and then be snide and passive agressive about it for years when they dont magically adapt to it without knowing it exists is setting your partner up for failure and unfair resentment regardless of if it is ten or three years
hard choice but if someone doesn t like tattoos and since this is already your fourth or fifths one day you could look like a billboard in his thoughts nah
i d never give up my bodily autonomy integrity and being allowed to feel good about my own choices for a man but you do you you re not the first person to prioritize your husband over self respect and you won t be the last
nta it s your body not his if he hates tattoos so much he s more than welcome to not get any for himself
your body your choice that s it that s the response
you should not have gotten together esh
nta and your husband is clearly a terrible communicator
nta i hate tattoos my husband loves them however i am reasonable and just won t get one on me but i ll go with him to his appointments for his and make sure he has what he needs to take care of them
he sounds boring
nah your body your choice but also your choice your consequences
nah this sub is full of terminally online children who never had an irl relationship you can t do permanent body modifications without consulting your s o and them not saying anything afterwards that s not a reasonable expectation to have both are valid here and no one is wrong
nta and your husband needs to get over himself i would understand his frustration if it was a tattoo that had to do with an ex or was on your face neck but this a beautiful memorial tattoo that means a lot to you and it s in a pretty inconspicuous place he s allowed to have his opinions and preferences but he s just being a huffy jerk at this point
nta it s your body and these tattoos are hurting him how this is his problem and your tattoos have meaning it s not like you are getting a giant tattoo on your forehead he hasn t communicated to you clearly
nta my husband doesn t like tattoos either but knows i can do what i want with my body he has never made me feel like i wanted to peel my skin off where the tattoo is because of how much he doesn t like it
esh light you admit to not paying attention to his feelings originally then the third tattoo he told you he hates them maybe he told you he hated them the first time you got a tattoo and didnt communicate well with you the second time because he thought you paid attention to his feelings the first time we do not have enough information to know who is the ah for communication so i think it s both of you i m not saying a bf should have a say in what you do with your body but a gf should at least pay attention to their partners feelings when they express them onto the tattoos no aholes but there are consequences he is allowed to have a preference you know he does and get things done to your body that he doesn t like you re allowed to do that and should do what makes you happy but it s pretty obvious this will continue to affect your relationship and for future tattoos you should make the decision knowing that
nah people like and dislike different things you like tattoos he does not he stated his views on them which he is allowed to have he didn t prevent you from getting one or he would be
nah its your body and your choice but its his mind and he can also have any view he wants on your tattoo
nah
there is nothing wrong with you getting tattoos if that is what you want also there is nothing wrong with you husband s dislike of tattoos he can t help how he feels when he sees them hopefully you can both get past it
nta men feel way too entitled to women s bodies there is no reason whatsoever for him to be upset about something you did to your own body you do not belong to him and he has no input on your choices he should not even have to approve anything
nta he doesn t get to say what you can wear on your skin and what not unless you did the tatoo on your face it s not a valid reason to be mad about and it s not a goddamn tribal its a tatoo of your deceased father for fucks sake you gotta be a major ah to get mad about that and people saying yta because he s not attracted to it are you all cuckolds who live by the parameters your partner established for you
ehhh i hate this but i think yta it s unkind that you surprised him with a tattoo much larger than he expected it seems like despite his dislike of tattoos he has tried to stay supportive and he is hurt that at some level you were dishonest or misleading about your plans it s your body and you have the right to do as you please to it nobody deserves control over that but that doesn t seem to be what is at issue here which is trust between the two of you
nah you can obviously do what you want to your body but your husband was honest communicated and told you he does not find tattoos attractive so when you go get another one you re surprised he didn t like it i m not following like obviously he wouldn t like it
nta for getting and doing what you want with your body but he is nta either for not liking tatoos he also has a choice and if this is a deal breaker for him so be it it means you are not compatible if a compromise is not possible there is no much to be done except accept the consequences of everyone s choices
i got a tattoo my husband didn t like and have regretted it ever since like years just a thought
while it is your body when someone deliberately makes bodily changes they know will repulse their partner well you are sending your partner a very strong message i am not talked ng about health related issues nor natural aging things but deliberate permanent changes to your body
nah you have the right to get tattoos and he has the right to dislike you getting tattoos things that impact our appearance affect our partners as well because part of having a romantic relationship with someone is being physically attracted to them and what someone looks like affects how attracted we are to them my wife s hair is naturally unique with vibrant white streaks and i love it she s asked me how i would like it if she dyed her hair all one color and i told her that she s free to do what she wants with it but that i wouldn t like it anywhere near as much as i like her natural hair color she has kept it the natural colors that i love since then and i appreciate that on the flip side of the coin my wife hates it when i shave i can t grow a particularly good beard and don t love the way my facial hair looks but she likes it so i haven t been clean shaven in years talk to each other about it and maybe the next time the tattoo itch strikes you have an artist draw something up print out an accurately sized image of it and show your husband where and how big you want it done it doesn t sound like he s ever tried to tell you no so i m sure you guys can work out a compromise that you can both tolerate
everyone is right with your body your choice but you also can t force him to accept those choices additionally you have no right to be upset over his choices in not helping around the house not being faithful not spending more time with you etc would you retaliate using those examples had he done something to alter his appearance in a manner that turned you off his body his choice too actions and lack of have consequences
nta your body your choice your husband on the other hand is the ah he doesn t have to like your tattoos but he does have to accept they re a part of you and it s completely your choice alone whether to get any more done
nta huge red flag you might want to take a step back does he turn manipulative any other time you disagree with him because this is what controllers do silent treatment the manipulator refuses to communicate and uses emotional and or physical withdrawal as punishment
nta i don t like tattoos my wife has them i don t care for her getting them but they bring her joy and she loves them so i like when she gets them for herself too it s her body she can do with it as she likes just like i don t get tattoos despite her thinking i d look good with some
nta keep the tattoos loose the husband this is super controlling
nta i think passive aggressively huffing and puffing about something you don t like your partner doing for years is an ah move if you dont like something say it straight and say it early he shouldn t have let years of resentment build up until he snapped when you guys are already married committed and have a kid together he may have the right to not like something and not be attracted to it but he does not have the right to be snarky rude passive aggressive and give you the silent treatment over your tattoos his feelings may be valid but his actions which is what matters are not if he s talking about your body in a way that makes you want to peel their skin off he needs to take a long hard look at himself you re grieving about your dad for fuck s sake he really thinks now is the time for him to take some moral stand on how you grieves and how your body looks good job op s husband way to be supportive of your partner s
nope your body your choice
nta if his issue with tattoos was so severe maybe he should have thought about that before marrying and having a child with someone who has them he s not the asshole for having preferences but he is the asshole for not accepting who you are and being angry at you after all this time when he already knew what he was getting into
nta your husband had a lot of opportunities to make his feelings known instead he chose to be quiet and be passive aggressive about it later does he handle other problems this way
nta you have every right to get tattoos it s your body so you can get all the tattoos you want
you should not be worried about him leaving you you should be getting your bags packed and your lawyer on standby for when you leave him like so much yikes nta but please don t be a pushover and doormat either he should have said something years ago if it s that big of a deal terrible and controlling behaviour
nta it is your body it is your choice and i m sorry he s so controlling of it that he gets pissed when there s a change as simple as expected size of a tattoo
nta imo if the husband didn t like tattoos or want to be with someone with tattoos then he should have voiced it at the beginning of the relationship not saying he s a misogynist or trying to control her or anything but i feel like that s the kind of thing you talk about when you are getting to know someone while dating maybe that s just me i might be coming from a weird place tho because both my so and i have tattoos and they ve even come home with a tattoo on the back of their hand that i had no idea they were even going to get he ll they ve bought a car and i found out through text we have an agreement that we keep our finances separate except for bills and anything left over is discretionary funds for our own use i understand being surprised and not enjoying being attracted to tattoos but the adult way to handle it is to talk things through not to employ the silent treatment that is childish af imo if you have differing views on body mods that s fine but communicate in a mature way and if that s a deal breaker then leave before you have kids
needing to process and getting angry and making you feel bad about something important to you are two different things he was selfish and cruel in his reaction choosing the side that it was more important to show his childish emotions over something he had approved and knew was coming over supporting you over something so important and so close to your heart
first off i am so sorry for your loss please accept my condolances i want to peel my skin off immediately i now hate it and want to undo it because i hate that he s mad at me i really hate that any negative feelings are now associated with this beautiful tribute to your father nta if you are willing would you be comfortable sharing the connection between your father and the rooster
i don t even need to read the rest after reading the title you are allowed to do anything you want with your body you don t need someone s approval for this nta
i don t care how much i get downvoted he has no right to tell you what you can get on your own body he has no right to throw a fit afterwards for him to even act moody and cranky afterwards is very controlling and manipulative here s what he s doing he s being miserable so you ll never do it again cuz how dare you make him feel miserable it s manipulation just wondering what else he doesn t like you doing and how he reacts he doesn t even get to be upset he has no ownership over your body nta
your husband not liking tattoos is valid your husband throwing fits and manipulating you emotionally after you get them is not valid nta he doesn t get a say in what you do with your body
nta but i could never be with someone so judgmental and emotionally manipulative
take care of your beautiful memorial you ll be glad you did and he will get over it when i first started coloring my hair he didn t like it i think he still doesn t he doesn t say a word when i first started getting tattoos i knew he didn t love it but he went with me for my first and watched it off and on and talked about the colors and stuff piercings he was not thrilled about the nose or the eyebrow but he doesn t say anything he also doesn t give me the silent treatment it s my body these are for me there are a lot of tattoos now i m back in tomorrow for more work on my sleeve you do this for you he can suck it up and learn to love your art
you need his approval gurl wot nta
nta no man or woman has a right or say over how you present your body a preference is understandable but not a judgement or an excuse for poor treatment
nta if he hates tattoos and he knew you liked them when he was dating you why did he marry you i ll never understand why some people are so damn up tight about tattoos they re beautiful and cool we ve been adorning our bodies with jewelry and ink since like the dawn of humanity why does he object please tell me he isn t one of those people who thinks tattoos are unprofessional or trashy or even worse that women shouldn t have tattoos i ve met those types and they are a handful
ugh nta every other response makes me so sad i am so tired of hearing about what men want women to do with their bodies to continue to be attractive to them they re tattoos they did not turn you into an entirely new human being and his responses are passive aggressive and childish do you if he continues to be rude then he ain t the one i m so sorry about your dad i got a tattoo for mine when he passed and it s my favorite tattoo i love it more than i could possibly love any man you re the one who has to live with yourself for the rest of your life good luck
i had tattoos before i met my ex husband many years ago but he told me he didn t like tattoos and didn t want me getting anymore despite him getting while we were together his first ones mind you i didn t get any for years but it went against everything that was me eventually i stopped caring and got more ink we divorced eventually for different reasons but your partner should support you and not tell you what to do especially if it s something you ve already been doing
nah for getting the tattoo yta for not communicating the new change with the husband you aren t wrong for getting a tattoo but you and your husband were finally communicating about the tattoos and created a design that you both agreed upon i get that things don t usually go according to plan and that you might have been forced to increase the size of the tattoo but it seems like you knew your husband wouldn t be okay with that change and yet went through with it
your husband is mad at you because you chose to get a memorial tattoo for your dead dad and you re still defending him he s entitled to his opinion on tattoos but he s not entitled to act like a jerk to his wife when she makes a decision about her body i ve noticed a weird amount of people that are so concerned with their partner having a pretty picture on their skin i really don t get it my so doesn t have any tattoos currently but even if he decided to go all out i would support him him having tattoos doesn t change the person he is or that i love him
i mean you got some tattoos full well knowing your husband would not like them or find you attractive with them anymore that s your choice you wanted to get tattoos you got them good for you you knew the consequences of that choice will impact your relationship negatively you made it nta for getting a tattoo but don t be mad at the consequences of your actions on your relationship you made that choice fully knowing what it would do people on this sub are so crazy with all this me me me attitude relationships are a two way street it s the same thing as the dude going out getting bald with a giant tattoo on his head if his wife expressed she wouldn t like it can he do it sure it would be his choice but this sub would change their tone super quick if he made a post here about how his wife doesn t like his new look this sub is full of people who either hate their s o or have never had a relationship
yta all thee your body your choice comments show how little respect you all have for your partner s feelings you have the right to get a tattoo absolutely but if you know he doesn t like them and you still continue to get them why would you expect him not to be annoyed you can easily get discreet tattoos to remember loved ones but that s not what you did ultimately you ll continue to colour yourself in and he will hate it you aren t compatible
nta however you should understand that your husband obviously doesn t like tattoos this will impact his perception of you and how he may feel about you if you are comfortable taking that risk it s fine have your tattoos you can t have it both ways if your husband was doing something that went against your likes and or beliefs how much of it would you tolerate
yeah my husband doesn t like tattoos either but he was completely supportive of me when i decided to finally pull the trigger and get one he even suggested making a special trip out of the way to go by the shop ahead of my appointment to talk to the artist since it was my first tattoo nta
nta and if he continues to be pissy about something as trivial as a tattoo i d leave him no one is gonna be huffy and not speak to me over something i do with my body he can grow up
nta my husband doesn t like tattoos period in fact he hates them but he knows i love the art and the meaning of each one i have i have tattoos that cover my rape scars those ones are ones he appreciates he saw how happy i became in my own skin after i got them and i have memorial tattoos for my mom and dad and a few of my brothers and friends i even have for my fil and mil your husband needs to talk to a therapist and learn how to deal with his feelings he sounds like a petulant child
i m someone who has never like tattoos and never found them appealing on others so when my daughter was old enough though still a minor to make that decision for herself and asked for my approval not permission for her first one feeling like her mom who doesn t feel as strongly about it would probably still freak out this was my answer you know i don t care for them but it seems to me that you re not asking if i m going to get one i don t pick your clothes for you and don t choose what your haircuts are going to look like i don t tell you who your friends are or should be i d say just make sure it s something that you re not doing because you think it s currently trendy or cool because no one i grew up with in the 80s would be happy if their hair or clothing styles from then were a permanent thing that they have to live with now i promise not to make snide remarks or act disapproving i don t like them myself but i m not that invested in it and i like plenty of people who have them you were not wrong to get it nta and yes if he wants to control everything about you to this degree he is being ta are you a superficial appendage to him or are you together for reasons that are more than literally skin deep
nta your husband is trash i almost threw up when you mentioned he approved it that s ridiculous he has no say and can shut the hell up the worst part is it sounded like you loved the piece until he started running his mouth
he didn t approve the design you made it clear you didn t care what he thought as the title of this post proves aita for getting a tattoo i knew my husband wouldn t like
yta but with conditions yes you re right it s your body no if s ands or but that said you know it is something your husband doesn t like he s trying to be respectful over time but it is building up and you are missing the point he s unhappy you re not catching his clues or you are then disregarding them
yta i think you and everyone on this sub has a weird view of marriage i can t imagine my husband doing something that he knew i would hate unless it was life or death and the same with me i think we see a lot of abusive relationships where the level of control is over everything and we apply our rejection of that extreme to healthy relationships you essentially don t care if your husband is revolted when he looks at your body how does he feel that you do t care about that
yta your body your choice your consequences you knew he didn t like tattoos and decided to keep getting more and then this time it was considerably bigger than you led him to believe from his perspective he knows he s already going down a slippery slope and you re not the woman he signed up for
i mean if it was a memorial tattoo where a tramp stamp goes i probably wouldnt be able to fuck doggystyle without thinking of your dad lol
yta
every time someone posts that they got a tattoo and their partner doesn t like it or doesn t like tattoos in general there s an avalanche of fuck him your body your choice he doesn t get an opinion responses well that s horseshit yes it is your body and yes it ultimately is your choice however your partner is entitled to his opinion he s your husband so his opinion is supposed to matter to you on some level it s entirely your right to decide that your desire for the tattoo outweighs his distaste or discomfort but the decision does come with consequences he ll get over it but maybe not immediately i m admittedly biased here though because like your husband i hate tattoos and would be horrified if my wife suddenly started wanting to collect them i find them aesthetically displeasing and would hate to see that all over my wife s skin whenever i looked at her however if she wanted one it would be her right and choice just like it would be my right to give my opinion nah
nta your body your choice
nta
nta your body he s being weird
nta it s your body and especially as a memorial i don t see anything wrong with that i think he just needs some time to get over it we can overreact about stuff like change in appearance sometimes but if he continues this i would just really let him know how you feel and how his actions affect you don t let him make you hate your tattoos or stop getting them i personally wouldn t get a tattoo but my fianc has of them with a few small ones here and there and while i may have been surprised at some of them i realize she can do whatever she wants it makes me happy when she comes home from an appointment excited to show me and most times i go with her
nta your husband is ridiculous and it sucks that you value his opinion
your husband needs to chill out he made the choice to marry you after you continued getting tattoos now he has no room to sulk and give you silent treatment over another tattoo your husband is acting like a child and needs to grow up he decided to be with you knowing he hated tattoos and you liked them please do not feel bad it is your body and your choice please do the proper after care to take care of the tattoo especially since it s a memorial piece your best bet at this point is couples counselling so you can find healthy communication techniques but hun at this time you re married to a petulant child that is upset at what you do to your body even though he married you knowing this was what you wanted source i married a man knowing he s a smoker even though i hate cigarettes and smoking i knew this about him and love him anyways and have never given him silent treatment or gotten pissy when he smokes or tried to quit and can t you marry people knowing all of their faults and ticks and traits but love them anyways not in the hopes they will change to fit what you want
nta but your husband has growing and maturing to do best of luck if you wanna endure that
nta he waited years to finally say that he doesn t like tattoos he has had a lot of moments to tell you and he didn t so now they re on and he can accept it you wanted a tattoo you got a tattoo you can do what you want it s not like he asked you not to and you did it anyway you shouldn t be ashamed because someone you care about doesn t like them it s not fair to you it s okay for him to not like tattoos what s not okay is projecting that negatively onto you after not saying a word for years don t allow him to make you feel this way this is something he has to get over go to a therapist or something but don t feel bad girl it is his fault for leaving it this long he has to do something because he may not have said it or even knows himself but you need to see if he has resentment towards you over this often when people shoving things down rather then expressing their opinions it leads to resentment towards the person they have an issue with so this has to be addressed but don t blame yourself you talked to him about the tattoos you gave him opportunities to speak up and he chose not too for whatever reason he chose to not say anything and just get all pissy about it
nta sounds like something he should have discussed a long time ago i think tattoos look trashy and talk about this early on when dating i only date women that also think tattoos look trashy
dude nta but why would you let his opinion sway you so hard on a memorial tattoo for you dad is his being frumpy for a day worth more to you than honoring you dad like that s crazy to me you loved the tattoo you had meaning behind it saved for it and he knew it was coming he is ta and you both need to maybe work on your communication
to me your tattoo represents that rebellious vibrant part of you that is just going to shine regardless i think someday it ll be your favorite one
nta your husband should keep his opinions to himself it s not his concern your body your choice
ytah

honey dont defend him you re nta which means he absolutely was that reaction is not healthy or normal and you two should consider couples counseling before that behavior leads to a place you can t return from
nta i d hope that your husband s attraction to you isn t so fickle that a single new tattoo would suddenly make him unattracted to you look this tattoo means a lot to you it isn t just some random art you decided to get on your body and ultimately your husband should respect that he is certainly allowed to not like it but this whole passive aggressive reaction is so childish and unnecessary now that you are more aware of his opinions on the matter i would definitely sit down and have a chat about what boundaries you both can have moving forward best of luck and congrats on your new piece
hard nta he was never upfront with you that he didn t like tattoos just got huffy expected you to figure it out years into the relationship he finally tells you he hates tattoos literally makes you feel like peeling your own skin off for a memorial tattoo you got for your father that is so immature manipulative it s not even funny it s your body i d be absolutely damned if my fianc made me feel like shit for anything harmless i put on my body please keep up with the aftercare don t try to get rid of the tattoo yourself you ll regret it more later
nta the tattoos are a part of you if your husband hates that part of you so much then he shouldn t have married someone who has tattoos as part of their identity clearly it means a lot to you and if he doesn t want to compromise on something that is on your skin that s his problem i personally feel that you shouldn t feel this uncomfortable in your skin because of his preferences i obviously don t know any details but perhaps a in depth discussion on why he dislikes tattoos so much may be beneficial to you both
nta he s such a child for this please don t get rid of it or hate it doesn t matter what he thinks it s what you wanted and you love it that s what matters if he s really going to be a baby about it then oh well ignore him too
i m amazed the things people do in relationships
nta but i gotta ask you got a rooster on your ankle as in you got a c ck on your ankle is going to be a response people will give
you have every right to do whatever you want with your own body but he doesn t have to stay with you if the tattoos alter his attraction for you and realistically that is likely what is going to happen given his reaction to your tattoos after you get them some people do not find tattoos attractive it sounds like your husband is one of those people and he should have communicated that early on but he probably hoped you would stop getting them so it s time for the both of you to decide what is and isn t dealbreakers and it s time you both sat down and communicated you need a couple s therapist and you need it immediately sadly though his reaction has ruined your memorial tattoo and i am not sure if that resentment will ever be something you can move past so you should probably prepare yourself for a future breakup and co parenting arrangement esh for the lack of communication

nta this jerk has no business working in student housing the seafood allergies are more than enough to give you a better pick with accomodations the dean did right by you
nta you have life threatening allergies the system didn t work for you this year and it sounds like you were just asking that your access needs be considered and acted on you shouldn t have to move heaven and earth to be placed in a living space that is safe the head of disability services should have been more attentive it sucks if they were fired but it seems to me it s not a fireable offence entirely possible that there other marks on their record or they were moved to a different office or maybe they weren t in the next time you visited
nta he got himself in this situation
nta it wasn t you that got him fired he made the choice to not help you which is what got him fired
nta you had to advocate for yourself in this situation it s also pretty likely that this isn t the first time he has needed to be reprimanded
nta you are the one responsible to take care of you first and foremost this is your health you did not allow it to be dismissed you did what you needed to ensure you have the best environment you should be proud of it the guy may not have been the right fit for the position had it been one mistake only i doubt that he would have been fired you may have helped him in the long run
absolutely not you could have died bc he didn t even want to listen to you and didnt give a crap about the fact that you could have died the year before if this was happening to you then surely it was happening to other people good on you for sticking up for yourself
nta and good on the dean wish more school had admin who looked after their students
nta how do you know he was fired they may have moved him to another position where he wouldn t interact with students if he was fired i doubt his interaction with you was the only reason he may have had other complaints or issues with his performance

nta you tried to be proactive and advocate for yourself to get the best outcome for your health and everyone involved and the disability services guy didn t do his job you were right to escalate the situation to someone who would give you the appropriate help
nta you need to advocate for your medical safety as a person who has been to the hospital on several occasions due to your allergy you need to be able to at least be able to sleep without worrying if your going to wake up in the hospital the fact that this guy didn t want to help you and disregarded your health means he got himself fired
second aita for getting some guy fired because of my allergy post i ve seen in a couple of hours weird
nta his poor performance at work got him fired you bringing it up to the dean might have gotten him fires earlier but better now than after he gets some kid killed through negligence you may have saved a life possibly your own
nta you just did everyone else with health issues at that school a huge favor by continuing to advocate for yourself good job
nta the guy was being a major pain that needed to be removed for the good of those with serious allergies
nta your allergies are life threatening if he lacks the basic intelligence and empathy to deal with it he doesn t need to be working in that job
nta the man at the housing office obviously didn t take his job and students health seriously enough you were right to go to the dean the fact the guy isn t at the housing office anymore shows that the dean shared your opinion
nta good job advocating for yourself
nya this really could be life or death he s a prick
nta
nta he didn t do his job it isn t your fault that you escalating the issue showed his incompetence
let me put it this way if he kept working there someone literally might die and that someone might be you nta
nta he shouldn t work there at all you didn t get him fired he failed in protecting you and the university with his base dismissive attitude he deserved to be fired
i m honestly really sick of this sub being inundated with please tell me how much i was victimized and bask in lambasting this very obvious asshole instead of please help me determine who is the asshole in this situation where i genuinely feel i may have overstepped
exactly nta
the look on the lady at the desks face and her apologetic tone told me that they re used to him treating students like shit so it could be likely he had a long list of complaints on him before this
someone heading a university department is not going to be let go for one thing unless he embezzled university funds and spent them on hookers and coke it s more likely they shuffled him somewhere that he won t be dealing with students although if he was fired i wouldn t shed too many tears i m making an assumption you re in the us in which case you have the right to reasonable accommodations asking to be in a room without pets and allergens that could kill you is reasonable you are nta
i m assuming because his name and picture used to be on the office of disabilities for my schools website and has since been removed with a new man listed and his picture it s very possibly they moved him to another position the lady who worked in his office s demeanor told me he treats people like shit regularly
i had posted this twice on accident might ve been me lol unless it was a different scenario
idk i think the op in this case knows they were clearly wrong i think they just feel guilty about potentially losing someone their livelihood if someone was acting like an asshole and i did something to get them in trouble and it cost them more than i expected i might second guess my actions with that said i definitely agree that this sub is saturated with i was wronged please weep for me posts and this fits the bill in some capacity
removed
i mean not killing people is definitely part of his job description he was so close to doing that how many times why do you feel guilt about him not being there to put more students in danger
op as someone who has worked in a variety of university offices you are nta in any way your university s system is terrible if it doesn t allow students with disabilities to register for housing first no matter what year they are without ever being put into a general lottery and make disability accommodations first priority with emphasis on safety you should never have been put in a position where your roommates made you unsafe with their cooking at a minimum they should have been made aware of your needs and agreed not to use those things before they became your roommates the head of disability services should never have been so dismissive of your safety i m absolutely stunned re reading your post i m sorry you had to be the one who had to take him on but i am not sorry that a h got what he deserved and is far away from students who need real help
let me put it this way if he kept working there someone literally might die and that someone might be you nta
it wasn t other one was about a peanut allergy in any case you are definitely nta and the dean s assessment of the lack of compassion problem is spot on his failure to take a life threatening situation seriously could and would probably have eventually resulted in a lawsuit against the school that dude should not be in the position he was in don t waste a second of your life feeling guilty about it
i see where you re coming from but the last paragraph sealed the deal for me it makes a point of relaying very specifically that the dean explicitly said it s for the good of the entire student body and the reason he was reprimanded was because he actively put students safety at risk this wasn t like a i filed a report and then a week later i found out he got fired thing this is a i deliberately went all the way to the dean got the validation i needed and he was of course promptly fired situation but you re right this isn t the worse of them and i m probably pretty jaded
i thought the first sentence was sarcastic but judging by the rest of the reply it s not but how could anyone think an employee who arrogantly disregards legitimate life threatening health conditions deserves to keep doing that job nta
i think the op in this case knows they were clearly wrong how was op wrong
okay but it s right in the title instead of me finding a whole different sub to do what this one is supposed to do couldn t people posting this type of thing go to r youwouldntbelievethisasshole
my first reactions was that if he kept working there someone literally might die and that someone might be op nta
i didn t feel like it was vindictive unless he got his needs met prior to the situation and even still i know if i was in that situation i d want to prevent it from affecting others yk agree to disagree ig lol
removed
no also way to deliberately cut off your quote before the relevant part where i lament the behaviour of some of the people posting in the sub and not the sub itself to use your own logic if you don t like it block me or go comment somewhere else and if you re gonna come back and say i can say whatever i want well so can i cheers
removed
like i said
removed
look at your life dude

nta it s your game mr red flag isn t entitled to your things without your permission
nta he can t guarantee it s safety no matter how he might protest he can t say that no one s going to handle the cards with greasy snack fingers or bend the cards or spill spray liquids on it he d have to pledge that he d completely replace the game if something happened to it what s the game
nta the shady way he avoided telling you about his plans is what stood out to me though this dude sucks i doubt that he would have taken enough care with your game to protect it from being damaged sounds like you could do better
nta he should have at a minimum asked to borrow it he doesn t get to take your stuff without your knowledge or consent
nta i wouldn t let my partner take a mint condition board game to a drinking night with buddies i gave a collector s edition of monopoly to an ex for a combo birthday christmas present his brother has some friends over while we were gone on a holiday he broke into brother s room took the game and they trashed it and since the company that made that particular edition is no longer in business it couldn t be replaced
nta this seems like an unhealthy relationship there s a lack of communication followed by a bunch of petty punishments of course you don t want to send your things to a drinking event he needs to grow up
nta your bf seems shady and inconsiderate of your boundaries and feelings he obviously did make plans for his evening got supplies on the way home and still lied when you asked again directly i suspect he engineered the argument about the board game to shift the focus from his lying to you all day
nta he sounds like a child
nta it is your game and has multiple items that could get lost and or ruined by a bunch of drunken guys he sounds like an immature a h you need to watch these red flags
i wouldn t let anything like that out of the house to go with a bunch of guys who were drinking unless i knew that the guys were all board game geeks and would take care of it i d assume that it would come back with a couple of pieces missing or ring marks from a beer bottle and an ah bf who was talking about how it didn t really matter and you could still play it with the pieces that were there nta
nta he sounds very inconsiderate and entitled
nta i would have done the same thing he is clearly playing the wrong hand to win this game
nta hide it in case he tries to borrow steal it anyway
nta he can t just tell you that he s going to take your stuff much less to something you weren t even invited to he s not entitled to your stuff and was being unreasonable if he d politely asked beforehand to borrow your game then that s different but he can t act all shady about his plans and then just demand your board game
nta because it belongs to you and it could become damaged so easily around a bunch of people drinking and partying
nta nice board games are expensive and fuck no i wouldn t let someone take mine to a drinking night
nta i definitely wouldn t loan out my favourite game when he didn t ask and i wasn t invited can you imagine what a bunch of drunken guys could do to it brrr and he was being totally shady about the evening when he knew exactly what he was going to do sorry to say he sounds like a walking red flag
nta he did not ask he told you what he was going to do the game is yours not his and if he and his buddies are going to get drunk there is no telling what they might do to your game
nta the fact that he lashes out and tries to punish you when you tell him no and express a boundary is a huge red flag
nta bf needs cards against humanity and to be broken up with
nta
nta leave him
nta i also like boardgames and i do not borrow my game if i m not sure that person is responsible enough to keep it clean and intact drinking night pffff never
nta he sounds like a year old
nta i d film myself touching literally everything he owned but i m petty
nta but reconsider how you have been treated he did have a vague idea of what he wanted to do maybe nothing set in stone but he was making plans he left you out on purpose now there is nothing wrong with partners spending time without their partner and just with friends but i m sure you would like to know as anyone else would what plans maybe happening if you had it in your head that you both would be together that night i m sure you started thinking of dinner and activities to do but if you knew he was going out you probably would have been planning a meal only you enjoy movies only your enjoy pampering yourself or even going out yourself or inviting people over what he did was disrespect you as a partner and include you in the process of plan making even if it was individually he disrespected you a second time when he decided he was going to take something of yours that you value without asking just assuming then having the nerve to get up set with you he thirdly mistreated you by having a tantrum and deciding you couldn t touch his belongings out of pure spite i m going to tell you this and you need to understand the weight of these words you can do better at this point it would be better to be single loving yourself then getting bread crumbs of affection from another person
i mean it sounds like you didn t want to let him borrow your game mainly because you were jealous you weren t invited to his drinking night rather than being worried it might get ruined lost etc which seems a bit petty tbh that said he didn t ask and he doesn t have a right to use your things without your permission and you aren t required to give it maybe petty but nta plus he sounds shady af
yes but its always important to never share trivial material possessions with loved ones
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** so i asked my bf yesterday if there was going to be anything special today he said no but then came home carrying beer i asked about it but he didn t really give me an answer just said he visited a new grocery store that opened recently then his friend called and they were clearly planning on having a drinking night with the guys after the call i asked what s up and he told me he was going to go drinking with some of his friends i don t really know them that well i was a bit bummed cause i thought it was going to be a home night but okay then he said he was going to take my favourite board game with him it s in mint condition and contains multiple decks and small tokens etc i said i don t want him to take it to some random drinking night where i wasn t even invited he got mad about it i offered he could take any other game but that one but he refused he thinks i m being unreasonable and as a revenge said i can t touch any of his stuff then while i m spending the night home alone i feel bad about it but it s my game and i would like to play it too but wasn t welcome maybe i would have felt differently if he had asked to borrow it beforehand or even offered i could join i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
so he tried to play the situation so that he could be out playing your game without you f outta here w that shit
info is the game red dragon inn because there s no way i would let my copy of game go to a party that i wasn t present at nta regardless he doesn t get to take your stuff without permission
nta doesn t matter if it s just a game it s important to you therefore he s not touching it without you around
nta i have magic the gathering cards so valuable that i do not allow drinks on the table when we use them during game nights with my friends as guests at my own house it is a long standing rule because one tipped beer could cause two months of rent in damages cards instantly
nta and touch allllllll his things while he s gone lol
nta but find a boyfriend who enjoys spending time with you he ain t it
absolutely the game part isn t even relevant after the first paragraph but it truly does demonstrate the depth and breadth of his audacity so i asked my bf yesterday if there was going to be anything special today he said no but then came home carrying beer i asked about it but he didn t really give me an answer just said he visited a new grocery store that opened recently then his friend called and they were clearly planning on having a drinking night with the guys are you his girlfriend or is he and you re his mother asking where he s going when you hear clanking in his backpack relationships are built on trust he s behaving around you like he s trying to evade capture that s ludicrous the moment i sense something like this emanating from a partner that is out with it or i end it right now for me you can party with your friends but if you wanna sneak around and be a shady asshole about it then you can go and drink beer there every night from now on while i move your things out of the apartment i see literally zero reason besides cheaper rent to continue having this person in your life i don t care how good things are when they re good if this is what you get when they re not nope i know people say dump him over every little thing on here but that s because most partners on here are people that you should break up with sorry not sorry
eldritch horror
right and if i m understanding mint condition correctly it sounds like op hasn t even played it yet or at most has only played it a few times like it s one thing to take a game to play with rowdy drunken friends it s another to take a game that not even the owner of the game has played played with much yet
greasy snack fingers
nailed it
i don t drink like that anymore i m an introvert i m not jealous not getting invited to a drinking night with strangers what might be a bit petty is that i don t want that game going anywhere i m not going
he lies about where he s going and tries to take her shit and it s not cheap shit either that s a game also if they re drinking there s no way in hell they ll understand the rules it s complicated and in no way a drinking game
being in a relationship doesn t mean you get unchallenged free reign to all your partner s shit what are you on about especially when it s a expensive b fragile and or c shit they haven t even played with much themselves yet
op replied further up that it s eldritch horror
long complicated games aren t even good drinking games and they re pricy nta
hell no drunk non gamers will destroy
for a second i thought that was your emotion at hearing that he was planning on taking it to a drinks night
a buck board game that they d probably ruin forget it
yes it s still very new i ve played it maybe five times and it s just a surface scratch haven t even tried all the scenarios or characters yet
my wording was bad but i didn t mean you were jealous about the drinking but rather jealous that your bf was spending the night away from home without you and playing your game without you if it s a valuable game edition and you don t trust him to take proper care of it that s valid otherwise it s kind of a petty power move
yeah complex games cause a lot of wires to be crossed even when sober lol i would not play like robo rally drunk when basically programming a computer i like knowing what i m doing though i own mysterium and that would be my exception because it is all about vibes lol op if you see this deck sleeves are made in a lot of sizes and could be a good investment signed a magic the gathering horder
deck sleeves sound like a good idea i ll look into those thanks
lol i commented elsewhere about no drinks on the table when i draft my expensive mtg cube with friends sleeving cards is a must and my cube is double sleeved
yeah my husband and i have a couple deck builder type games and sleeves are great for those some sizes might be hard like the really small cards but anything relative to standard card size should be available somewhere

nta i think your feelings are valid and it sounds like you made a genuine mistake but in my humble opinion and apologies if i m being presumptuous it sounds like you and your wife might benefit from an honest conversation about the whole ring situation it d be a shame for something so small to cause unnecessary bitterness in your marriage
nta it was unintentional does she not wear hers bc she s afraid of damage could she wear like a silicone band and save the wedding ring for special occasions i don t blame you for being a little hurt i would be too offer to buy her a simple silicone band even just to cover up the tattoo she should want to cover it up i would think
my partner passed before we married and i had his first initial tattooed on the inside of my finger if i ever decide to marry in the future i will wear ring and it will be covered i understand your discomfort because it seems like it s an actual ring tattooed on to her finger what is her response when you tell her about your discomfort seeing her ring from her previous marriage has she offered a compromise to get it tattooed over i do find it hypocritical on her part that she doesn t wear a wedding ring but then gets on you when you didn t wear it one day nta
nta and honestly i would be very ticked if my partner rarely wore our wedding ring but didn t bother to remove or cover her tattooed ring from her marriage to someone else her having the audacity to call you out when your merely forgot once is a red flag i wouldn t feel inclined to wear that ring every day if i were you maybe more like on special occasions match her energy and see how she reacts if she has an issue with it show her a mirror
info did she get tattoo wedding bands in her previous relationship precisely because she doesn t like wearing jewelry rings or because she s afraid she ll misplace it it just seems notable that before she chose an option where she wouldn t have to wear a physical ring and now also seems to not want to wear her ring have you two had a conversation about this and her feelings on wedding bands
nta and your response was very fair same rules for each of you
nta whatsoever why isn t she getting her tattoo removed regardless she s not wearing her s stones glasses houses also i normally hate these types of comments but it s weird how quick she was to be suspicious of you leaving your ring at home anyway she is projecting feeling guilty for something
i would say no as someone who rarely wears theirs mostly because of my job i never get upset at my wife when she doesn t wear hers for whatever reason i can t expect her to do something i don t if she expects you to wear it all the time she should have the same expectation about wearing hers honestly the simple fact she has the tattoo she should be wearing her ring to cover it up
nta her double standard is weak
nta part of her journey my ass she is willfully ignoring how the constant reminder and showyness of her first marriage coupled with the fact that she simply can t be bothered with the symbol of your marriage is a slap in the face to you and your marriageto each other her reaction to you forgetting your ring one time is ridiculous the very least she could be willing to do is alter her ring tattoo so it does not resemble a ring she sounds incredibly insensitive at best and exceptionally self absorbed and hurtful to most and i won t even say what she sounds like if you want to think the worst
you re nta this is totally a double standard if she isn t going to wear her ring for whatever reasons she may have she should not be questioning you if you don t wear your ring
nta
info ages this sounds too immature a conversation for marriage you married her with the tattoo get the hell over it
nta
info why do you habitually remove your ring when you go to bed i don t get that the only time i can recall taking mine off is a few years ago when i injured that finger and it began to swell figured i d better get the ring off while i still could it s a part of me i felt awkward as hell without it
yta there s no double standard here yet she questioned you because you suddenly changed your habit not because you didn t wear the ring specifically then you started questioning her even though she didn t change any of her habits
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** for context my wife has been married before and they chose to get wedding bands tattooed on their ring fingers after years of being together we eventually tied the knot ourselves i d never really liked seeing a constant reminder of her previous love and commitment but hey life goes on once we were married i noticed my wife rarely wore her wedding ring and only put it on for special occasions always with this attitude like she was doing it for me and i should feel grateful i wear my ring every day and am proud to do so i generally take it off before bed and put it back on in the morning one day i forgot to and left for work when i got home i received a bit of a grilling as to why i d left it home and probably didn t respond ideally as i was pretty resentful at the obvious double standard i said i d start wearing it when she wore hers i still put it on every day but each time i remember how i felt at that moment aita in this situation i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta what s her reasoning for not wanting to wear it
nta considering she got pissed off at you for forgetting to put yours on whereas she only puts hers on for special occasions her reaction to it was weird i get not wanting to get laser tattoo removal because it hurts but you could always wear your new wedding ring over it
nta i d be pissed about the wedding ring tattoo who wants to see a permanent reminder of a past marriage she then doesn t wear the ring for your marriage and has the nerve to question you for not wearing your ring yeah she s a massive hypocroite
i wouldn t stay married to someone who wouldn t wear their ring id also want them to have that tattoo removed nta
nta your wife not wearing her wedding rings is a valid reason to be annoyed now if its because it doesn t fit or she works a job its a hazard this is different but if its just for no reason yeah she s an ah
info is the tattooed band from a marriage where her previous spouse died or just a divorce
i feel like your wife s reaction while hypocritical is more a reaction to your change in behavior ie forgetting to wear the ring she knows you like wearing it so it might seen suspicious to her that you took it off have you asked her about getting a new ring tattooed for your marriage instead of a physical ring
nta if she doesn t wear hers she has no right to demand you wear yours
i have a question did they divorce or did her first spouse pass away
nta big double standard and i don t like that she won t have a conversation with you about it the tattoo rings in general etc my so and i are always taking our rings off and on no judgment from either person as to why or how long we ll joke about being each other s side piece if we notice it but it s no big deal for us and that s because we ve talked about it and are on the same page about it
nta i think i understand her perspective though wearing the ring is important to you so you not wearing it feels significant now that is bs you re only human but imagine that is how we felt as people it s often easy to these things accidents when they are our own actions but assign intent to other people that said her not wearing the ring is clearly a big deal for you you guys need to work something out that makes you both feel loved and appreciated resentment is a relationship killer and your feeling this every day when you put your ring on
tried to have a conversation she said the tattoo was part of her life journey no real response to why she doesn t wear our ring
i mentioned maybe getting it removed once and she replied that it was part of her life journey end of conversation
she s never mentioned an aversion to wearing rings owns quite a few and recently asked for an eternity ring
lasering off tattoos hurts much more than getting the tattoo i have ink i would never go thru that laser process
i get not wearing rings if they are a safety issue at work not the case here though
indeed i did and if she wore her wedding ring and didn t have an issue with me forgetting to wear mine once i wouldn t have brought it up
i have high blood pressure and get quite hot at night my fingers swell
op didn t suddenly change his habit he forgot once and she went off
she s never really given one kind of just ignore ores it if i bring it up
divorce
based on the fact that she got the original ring tattooed i m willing to bet she just doesn t like wearing rings and it may not be more complex then that however if i were in her shoes i d probably get that original tattoo removed or reworked at least depending on the tattoo or at the very least not hound my husband for forgetting his ring one time i agree with nta btw
it s a part of her life journey that is a constant reminder she was previously married to someone else and since she doesn t wear her wedding ring its very visible every day it s like she s still wearing the other guys ring instead of yours fuck her life journey i don t blame you for being hurt she needs to either get the tattoo removed get something tattooed over it wear her ring from you
sounds like something you could gently follow up on at some point maybe just focusing on your own wedding rings and leaving the tattoo out of it since she already addressed that part
she s ta what does that say about her life journey with you then sounds like she doesn t value your relationship
can you get a tattoo to match hers maybe she feels since she has a ring on she doesn t need to wear her new wedding ring
that is very strange i think you two need to have an open discussion about why she is unwilling to wear her wedding ring not in a judgmental or accusatory way just from a place of curiosity and wanting to understand since you wear it all the time i suppose she thought it odd that you didn t wear it that day but that doesn t warrant her grilling you and you didn t do anything wrong by just forgetting it also comes off as hypocritical from her end since she does not wear hers nta
not saying it would be pleasant but i d prob consider it in this circumstance and finger tats are some of the least painful going on at least ime
i just used that as an example of expectations with my partner
you are right in this situation
i concede you re not in the wrong you re right
well that on top of getting mad at you over not wearing yours isn t right you should push for a reason so you could come up with an alternative
i get the assumption that she may not like wearing rings but she recently asked for a ring as a present
this
don t think i m comfortable with that there d be people in the world with that design
ha hope the conversation stays friendly and productive
op sorry i must have missed that maybe she wanted to try and start wearing one i m assuming she s wearing it over the tattoo either way you re definitely not wrong here she does not have a right to get upset at you not wearing your ring one time while she not only early wears hers but also still has a tattoo of a ring from a previous marriage she s missing both legs to stand on here
that doesn t mean she likes wearing a ring all the time though she might have wanted the other ring for special occasions and it does sound like she wears her wedding ring sometimes info does she work in a job where rings might not be a good idea like healthcare or manual labor
oh easy solution get your ex name tattooed on your ring finger cars already on fire might as well see how big the explosion can be
rarely wears the new one either
could you suggest her putting it on a necklace

nta tell your dad s wife that while he may have been waiting a couple of months it took years and you doing a dna test for any kind of contact at all while you re at it tell him his i had my reasons is a cop out and he needs to own up to his abandonment of you years ago
nta x200b there is no need to love your deadbeat dad he never was there for you so why would you love him hes role was reduced to absent sperm donor
he really said i feel like if i don t reach out to you first you won t contact me at all when the sole reason you have a relationship is because you reached out in the first place the audacity nta and your dad sounds like a loser for guilt tripping you he needs to gain some humility and understand he s lucky to have you in his life in any form
nta what on earth you went birthdays without hearing from him if you are still curious maybe you could reply to them both at once with something like the following i feel like there is a wall between us that will never come down until you can give me some honest answers about why you left my pregnant mother and why you never tried to be in my life for years you ask what more you can do well you can have an honest conversation with me and give me those answers i feel very uncomfortable that you were fine with not knowing me for years only met me because i did a dna test and now you put it on me to patch things up and make an effort you are expecting too much of me way too fast without giving me an honest explanation for why we first met when i was already an adult in the first place
nta you need time to deal with all this and digest the newly created bond with your siblings and father and it doesn t seem like it s being acknowledged or respected it seems like he s trying to make you go at the pace he wants to set the pace he thinks is the right one not the pace that is actually right for you maybe talk to him to actually make this clear so he knows you re willing to give this a bond a chance to thrive but that you need time to adapt to it also who the hell does this lady thinks she is telling you the one who got left behind by your father that you have an opportunity to patch things up that s a real ah ish thing to say
he can complain in years he s being manipulative impatient and self centered he made this situation now he can marinate in it until you feel ready if you ever do you don t have to love him ever he donated dna and has done nothing else to love you for more than two decades you do what is best for you
nta this guy is a complete stranger and he s trying to impose himself on your life i d want my space too and if he wants you to love him he needs to allow you to get to know him he seems desperate for absolution draw boundaries and stick to them
nta sounds to me like your father is guilt tripping you it is fine if you don t feel love for him straight away or even not at all at this point in time your father is no better than a stranger or at most acquaintance for lack of better word if you ever decide to accept your father you won t be betraying your mom your mom is supportive of you to decide what you want in life relationship isn t an instant thing despite him being a biological father it takes time and trust
nta i think you and your dad have different ideas of what s happening here you wanted information and possibly closure oh hey new family members cool but you re an adult with your own life they are on the periphery of that life your dad seems to want to play happy family and have you be a daughter i mean he made a bedroom for you at his house when you re a 23yo stranger who has only met him a handful of times his goals and expectations are pretty unrealistic especially since he s not giving you the information or closure you wanted you might need to just talk to him and point out that you are moving on your own timeline and not his it s been years that you and your mom have done this without him you re happy to know him but the relationship that you have with him should be on your terms not his he lost all rights to dictate what that relationship should be when he left your mom out of curiosity how is your mom handling all of this please don t get so wrapped up in your new family that you accidentally neglect her this has got to be really difficult for her
nta no healing can even begin until he accepts responsibility for his actions
nta you don t love him yet and that s fine that doesn t mean you never will but you didn t grow up even knowing him give yourself some time if he loves you he ll understand
nta this guys only just appeared in your life in real time terms he s barely just got out of stranger territory it sounds like your father is love bombing you with all the gifts almost like he s trying to make up for lost time or worse its just a cynical way to win you over if you re able to have a conversation with him and say how this is difficult for you you might be able to get him to take a step back and let the relationship develop naturally at the moment it sounds like he s pushing for developments way too fast love isn t something you can just activate by blasting someone with kindness no matter how pure the intention
nta he had years to get to love you you need years from now to decide if you need this shit not saying all his gifts and advances wouldn t be close to cover even child support he has stolen from you and now this shitty ignorant couple yes his wife too is trying to make you guilty for not loving him instantly wtf
nta why would you he s effectively a stranger
nta wtaf none of this is on you he made the relationship one sided and now he s projecting that onto you i m sure it makes him feel better but also shows he s the same prick who left you you don t need that kind of shit in your life
nta this jerk ignored the fact he has a child for years and is accusing you of not putting in enough effort no just no go at whatever pace makes you comfortable if you want to talk to him at all he owes you more of an explanation that he had his reasons
nta jeeze a month or two you need to siit down with him text email write a letter and say dude chill it s been yrs i am still reeling from feelings and emotions i don t even know what i am experiencing maybe you can explain why it took years for me to hear from you i know what you want but i don t know what i want yet why are you making it all about you and not about me
question did your dad provide your mom with child support while she raised you or did he completely ghost all responsibilities he needs to explain why he didn t reach out over the years when he could have chosen to be there for you growing up if he wanted a relationship with you why did he choose not to make any effort to do so until you matched blood relations via a dna test you have known him for one month out of your entire existence how many weeks pregnant was your mom before he bailed he doesn t get to dictate how you feel about him or to try and accelerate your emotional connection to him when he is not being honest with you and seems to want to buy your love with gifts rather than earning it and willing to build a relationship on your terms
nta this man is a stranger to you he s your biological dad yeah but he s never been your parent who raised loved and supported you you are an adult and can make your own judgements about his character he can t buy your love with presents and promises and he s going overboard trying this may be through guilt or whatever or it could also be because he s a manipulative piece of work who abandons a pregnant woman time will tell and you have every right to take this in your own time and on your own terms
nta you ve had no relationship with him your entire life he didn t even reach out to you until you tracked his new family down he hasn t earned a better relationship and doesn t deserve one if you don t want to give it he just wants you to tell him he doesn t need to feel guilty for being a shitty deadbeat dad
nta that s a whole lot of love bombing you should not be pressured into anything be it declarations of love feeling love or even a relationship of any kind if you want to continue this relationship let them know what you said here that presents and nice words for a month are not going to make the past disappear he should be the one reaching out because he s the one that needs to earn your trust i would also point out what you did here even though the answer might sting if you had never done the test was he ever going to contact you either he accepts things on your terms or he doesn t but he and his family don t get to pretend you are all one big happy family
this dude abandoned you and your mom years ago and a month after meeting him he expects you to tell him that you love him nah and that i had that my reasons is bullshit what good reason do you have for abandoning your child why hasn t he reached out to you in the past years he obviously knew about you my mind is screaming he s manipulative abandoned you trying to make up for years of radio silence and is expecting happy family after a month i d be very careful about this next thing you know he ll be dying and needing a kidney from you nta
your dad is an emotionally manipulative asshole the wife is weird af for enabling it but possibly has fallen victim to his crazy too but your siblings sound nice no reason you can t get to know them without the sperm diner when will i hear the kick i abandoned tell me they love me like the year old i actually raised when you re again and he s put in years being a present parent and not a deadbeat edit nta he s trying to buy your love and guilt you whatever he gives won t be enough and you d still not be an ah pocketing all of it and giving nothing back
nta you have your reasons
nta i have my reasons should be your response
nta no one can force feelings of love for another it only builds resentment him expecting you to love him after years of nc is ridiculous the fact that he refuses to even discuss his abandonment of you is also telling he needs to understand that his expectations of you are unhealthy tell him flat out how you feel and what his pressures on you are effecting you negatively you also need to tell him that he needs to answer your questions if he wants to move forward with a relationship with him tell his wife she needs to stay out of it
nta you ve known this guy for a month he s barely more than an acquaintance at the moment he s certainly not a parental figure what makes him think he can immediately have all the good bits of being a parent when he hasn t put the years in to earn them
wtf it s only been a month he s fracking delusional to think he can make up for years of radio silence in days you re right op it is too soon and far too quick do not let this man push you into erasing the past years of radio silence from him take things at your own pace and if you need to take a step back for a while do that hugs to you
info did your dad know of your existence before the dna test
nta it s been one month since you bet this literal stranger he s not your dad just because of blood if he wants you to treat him like one then he needs to earn that a parent child relationship takes your whole life to build and this man is trying to start yours off by refusing to take accountability of him abandoning you but still expects you to treat him like he s been there your whole life when he suddenly decides he wants to be a father and no less using guilt and manipulation into trying to force you to pretend you ve always been this happy family look i reached out to my dad in my 20s after he abandoned me in my preteens it was rough real rough and didn t go well my biggest advice from living through it myself first make yourself boundaries and make them rock hard no compromises he made his bed now he has to lay in it you hold all the power and he cannot make you feel bad for not giving him what he gave up and secondly you need to sit down person or not whatever s best for you and you need to lay it all out on the table do not worry about if it will hurt him he didn t care when he abandoned you and you have tried to do it nicely he needs to understand the consequences of his actions tell him exactly how you feel the hurt the apprehension everything that s on your mind and what you told us and i m not telling you this for the intention of hurting him although if it does that s the weight he has to bear but if you want any chance at having a relationship it has to be honest from the beginning because if he can t accept the hurt and pain he has put on you for your entire life and refuses to try and heal that refuses to take accountability and start to slowly fix it then you re just setting yourself up for more pain down the line you need to know where you stand best of luck truly ps there is nothing selfish about needing to take a time out break as well as often and forever long you need ok this whole thing should only be for your benefit right now not his he willingly gave that up
yta your dad already learned his lesson he wants to show  he can be the father he deserves don t hold anymore grudges

nta
even if your dad were somehow innocent in not being involved in your upbringing as opposed to the current scenario where he dumped you before your birth never paid child support and never looked back it d be normal not to love him after a month you barely know the guy in your specific case dude doesn t seem all that lovable nta
nta this dude is delusional presents and enthusiasm can t make up for all the time he wasn t there and all the things he missed it s been one month he is basically still a stranger love doesn t happen over night it may not happen at all there s a lot of emotions for you to work through first
nta you can tell him if you want a fake i love you you can tell him now but if he actually wants you to come to love him he needs to give you time and space you had so many years without him best friend and i treated father s day like a holiday we called it happy abandonment day parents are supposed to love you unconditionally to be rejected is heartbreaking and when you find out when you reconnect with your parent hearing that there was no miscommunication this person actively rejected you as a child or anything to do with you is another blow as an adult i really recommend therapy just to come to terms with that aspect of it you found your father and it was confirmed that you were not important enough for him to consider a part of his life as i am sure some part of you wish that it was a miscommunication of some sort take the time you need is crazy to expect to love someone you just meant that isn t a baby or a puppy or kitten
nta tell him rome wasn t built in a day years is a long time he cannot snap his fingers and make it disappear
yikes nta had you never taken that dna test chances are he never would ve reached out himself anyway don t let him make you feel bad the guy s basically a stranger a deadbeat dad who went on to have more kids only father them
uhhh he abandoned you of course he s the one who has to put in the effort nta don t let him guilt you you ve done nothing wrong you re a month talking to stranger it s natural if you don t love him don t let him pressure you into saying it either or pressure you to do anything you re not comfortable with
nta i had a deadbeat mom never once told her i loved her she thought remembering my bday yea really was something to pat herself on the back for he s doing what a lot of deadbeats do putting the onus of a real relationship on the child they willingly abandoned he didn t bother to see about your entire life had you not done a dna test you wouldn t be talking to him right now he won t even give you a reason for why he abandoned you but a month of being in your life warrants a i love you yea ok seems like dear old dad is going above beyond because he has probably lied about how you were conceived to his wife he doesn t wanna look like the deadbeat he is
nta how could you ever possibly love someone who threw you away for 23yrs and when asked why the only thing they can say is i had my reasons not even a sorry a month is not long enough to get to know someone let alone love them you need to let him know that after being neglected by him for 23yrs and just finding him a month ago it will take more than a month for you to feel anything for him than indifference or anger you need tobremind him that if he wants to have a relationship with you and for you to form a bond where one day you might say i love you then he needs to come clean and tell you why he left your mom and why he chose to not have anything to do with you you need to remind him that your probably never going to say i love you to someone who abandoned you who s a deadbeat father and can t even say sorry let alone tell you why he left in the first place he needs to stop trying to force the relationship and instead be honest about why he chose to leave you
aren t you related to your siblings because of your dad s blood not implying that they d be your siblings either way just wondering
years of abandonment by one of two people who should always be there for you and of course they think a mere month will resolve it all he s not resolving anything if he doesn t answer questions you deserve then and he doesn t deserve any consideration where was he the entitety of your life where was you father when you needed him oh but now he thinks she should get the benefits of the work your mom put in by herself um no
nta he s had years to reach out first and he didn t do squat until his other family found out about you and he couldn t hide it
nta would you accept this from a guy you had started dating would your father want you to accept this from a guy you had only been dating a month it s been a month you barely know him you probably wouldn t tell a boyfriend you loved him after a month and if a guy was pushing you to that would be a red flag showering you with gifts messaging you if i don t reach out you won t is a red flag in a relationship it s been a month thats not a lot of time i advise you to talk to your mom about this ask her to help you draft a text message to your father and maybe his wife it seems like you re on good terms with her thanking them for all of their recent attention but you need a little space all the sudden family is very overwhelming and your father is not giving you the space to process all of this
it feels like i m putting in effort and am met with radio silence he abandoned you before you were born years ago you found him only a month ago where were his efforts all those years and he has yet to explain why nta
tell him after years of zero effort he needs at least years of actual effort before complaining about the relationship being one sided nta
nta run do not walk from this situation this person is not a good person these are all traits of a narcissist and you do not need this drama in your life
nta he knew where to find you he didn t bother now that you found him he s making a big show of making up for lost time for his new family gross your deadbeat dad gives me the ick
nta explain to all of them he has known about you your entire life you have known about them for a month and you need time to let this all soak in and make it clear there will be no i love you for a long time
nah he s putting in a lot of effort so i m not going to fault him for that i believe in redemption you don t have to just jump into his arms either take your time let the relationship build as it does after all it s only been a month
nta this is pushing you too fast it s worth communicating your feelings to him something like this is a large adjustment for me i grew up with a single mom who acted as both my parents for my entire life and one month doesn t change the complex feelings behind meeting someone who abandoned me and the person dearest to me as a child with no explanation i appreciate that you re trying now but it doesn t wipe away the past i hope someday i can be more comfortable but i can t go from being no one to your daughter in one month
nta you can t erase years of absent parenting if he wants that relationship he has to put in the effort it is not up to you to fix the issue when he was the cause you only have to be receptive if you want the relationship to work maybe let him know that he chose to walk away and know you get to chose the pace and if he can t cope then that s fine he can leave again it might be worth considering though if you can still facilitate a relationship with your sibling if you don t have one with him is it possible would they be open to it
nta you can t force this what s the sone you can t hurry love you re both trying to move towards each other but he has to understand this takes time and things like i have me reasons puts up further barriers keep moving slowly let it happen and let him know you re not rejecting him but are getting to know him if he really cares it should be enough for him to understand it s the price of him not being there for all those years having to wait now
nta he abandoned you and had yet to give an explication much less an apology he had no right to make any demands of you go at your pace and if he isn t ok with it that s on him
nta when he asks why you won t say it tell him you have your reasons
nta he is love bombing you and wants you to worship at his feet he gives no information no depth no accountability if you don t act the way he wants you to immediately i wouldn t be surprised if he starts with berating guilt tripping and little threats he has already got his wife manipulating you i really think you should take a step back to assess and think
nta he didn t make an effort for years and now wants to rush you in a month of knowing him soooo weird
maybe you should tell him what you need is to hear actual reasons and some time to process it that sounds like that s the barrier right now that makes what he wants impossible it may not be possible after but it seems like its gonna get in the way if it s not resolved nta anyway tho he owes you some answers
nta i m glad your relationship with your siblings is going well so far i personally think it s worth trying to work on having a relationship with your dad and his wife but that s entirely up to you if you decide you do want to give it a try i really recommend therapy or mediation you have every reason to feel hurt anxious and distrustful and your dad doesn t sound like someone who knows how to even acknowledge those feelings let alone deal with them
nta a month is too close to say i love you already to him
nta things to say to your dad you cannot make up for years in a month i don t know you enough to tell you i love you relationships take time and trying to pressure me into a relationship we have not had time to form is not helping spending money on me doesn t mean i know you stop trying to create somthing at hyperspeed try getting to know me properly instead you had years without contact is it any wonder your reluctant to trust things after a month don t feel guilty he was the adult he made these choices he cannot expect to throw some money at you and have years old nothing erased from your mind
think about this if you and your half sibling hadn t taken that test he would had never reached out to you this ah never caref for you nor your mom your mom is supportive because she may think you finally got the attention she wanted for you to get from your dad but truth is this ah is only suddenly being so pushy because his wife and kids are watching pretty sure your half siblings were so excited he didn t dare to disappoint them because he has probably been a model dad to them but he was a non existent to you and wanting to make up for lost time is only for his own peace of mind and his image it isn t about making it up to you you couldn t avoid him re entering your life but i don t think it is a good idea to keep enabling him it will only hurt you
nta narcissistdad needs to allow your relationship to grow organically he s trying to force it you should imho tell nd and wife that you are where you are because of choices he made you need time to process p s your mom sounds awesome you are a lucky lucky girl
i want to say n t a but what were you trying to accomplish by reaching out i understand you re hurt from the past but why get in contact if you re not going to put effort into a relationship
has you father ever paid child support to your mother you are jumping into a blended family they are the hardest to navigate take it at youe pace not anyone elses if you want to chill out do it keep askling the hard questions too your father if he is not willling to talk how can he expect you to be open after all these years and look after you ma are you hte only son with you gone who does she talk to look after her over your wayward father
he had years to make an effort he can put you first for once and let you have the time you need nta
i feel like if i don t reach out to you first you won t contact me at all tell him he had years to reach out first his wife also reached out telling me he s upset and feels like our relationship is one sided and that since his birthday is coming up i have an opportunity to patch things up he had years of opportunity to patch things up just tell him you re not really interested in adopting your mum s sperm donor as a parent you just want to keep up with your siblings nta
love bombing you makes him look better to everyone else i would tell him that you would prefer his presence as opposed to presents that you would really like to talk and get to know him on a deeper level and this would help you sort out your feelings with him nta take it slow kiddo
nta op if he truly wants to establish a relationship with you then he needs to understand that you need to deal with this new parent at the speed and intensity that you can handle he needs to understand that pressuring you to make platitudes that make him feel good and absolve him of any negative feelings he might have for abandoning you just won t work it will in fact potentially drive you away from him instead of gifts and pressure he needs to get to know you and let your relationship grow into whatever it will be slow and steady and how you feel about that progress is frankly more important than how he does also let him know that you are not comfortable with his wife s comments about his feelings to you if he has some kind of feeling he needs to be a big boy and talk to you but again this isn t about him i get that you want to build relationships with your siblings but he can t use that to guilt you into feelings you either don t have or are not ready to express the burden is on him to finally be a good parent to you and you aren t betraying your mom a relationship that strong won t break so long as you communicate and give it the attention it needs
nta rome was not built in one day he knew of your existence yet he did not do anything to meet you the only reason you met was because you took initiative tell him that you need time to adjust as you grew up fatherless and need time to process since love cannot force
do not force a yourself to say something your not feeling fuck his feelings where was he when you and your mom needed him screwing someone else is what he was doing in which he doesn t want to be the asshole in this story so he uses the i ve got my reasons bs you owe them nothing
tell dad that he bailed years ago you went years with out him he can give you more to get used to him you owe him nothing abolutely noting either he does things your way at your pace or cut him off you have years of abandonment and anger with him it doesn t go away in a moth s time
nta pretty shitty of him to guilt you for lack of effort when he abandoned not just your mother but his child as well years ago and never looked back you don t just suddenly have a father daughter relationship upon meeting each other my bio dad has never had anything to do with me and i don t believe i could ever see him as a father if we did try to have a relationship
nta how he is trying to manipulate you right away is crazy tbh at this point id tell him id need more space and time that s absolutely insane you met all these people within a month and they re family you never knew of course it will take some maybe even a alot of time to adjust jumping on i love you roght away is just totally overboard take your time if he s really the father he claims to be he can wait
nta a month it s been a month and he s expecting shit to be hunky dorey he s got years to catch up on it ll take a lot of hard work to build a relationship with you and it may not even reach the point where you re comfortable calling him dad or having a familial relationship with him he needs to tone his expectations down hard it may be best for you to tell him you need to step back because he s coming on way too hard then establish boundaries
nta you ve barely known this man a month and he expects you to say i love you eugh and he may have his reasons but by not sharing them and acknowledging they were shitty he s not helping build the foundation of any kind of relationship he s using the i love you as status and gifts as currency yes he needs to do the work here because he s the one who abandonded you
nta i ll suggest a gentler approach than some of the other folks on here because you don t actually know why he left your mom or what kind of person he is now i suggest telling him that you appreciate how welcoming he s being but this is all new to you you re glad he s in your life now but you need to take things slower and get to know him over time if he responds reasonably great if he pouts or has a fit you ll have learned something valuable about his character and can make decisions accordingly good luck
nta op you are not crazy what he is doing now is not okay just like leaving your mother and yourself wasn t either to me he was unhealthy then and still is now he is manipulative watch out for yourself don t let him hurt you those who are saying he is a narcissist may have a point
nta
nta tell him that you have your reasons
ewww i m so sorry but everything about him is a red flag this feels like some combination of guilt and maybe performance in front of his real family to try and save face were his wife and children aware of your existence before you reached out and what reasons did he give them i also feel like he isn t acknowledging that you are an adult with your own life and feelings and not some 13yo dealing with coparenting he wants you to fit in a box of his making also what exactly do you want out of all this i think you really need to have a big think about that first before replying to him i m petty so would totally respond with i have my reasons nta
tell him you have your reasons he wants to look good for the kids he has now if he truly wants to be forgiven then he needs to do alot better than that pathetic excuse and his wife has alot of nerve considering she was the one who had him all these years but she wants to act like you were rapunzel in a tower nta
this man let you down all your life by not being there for you he went radio silence for years he can t expect to waltz back in and for you to love him he is pressuring you for something he has to earn the temerity of the man to say he thinks the relationship is one sided you owe him nothing move at your own pace and you are allowed to be honest to him nta
info did he ever pay even one penny of child support when you were growing up
nta you re you just met him why the fuck would you say to a grown ass stranger you share dna with i love you what the hell is his problem
i feel like a month isn t long enough for me to forget the past years inform him that it s going to take more than knowing him a whole month to make up for him missing out on years of your life just because he had his reasons if he wants to hear those three words tell him he needs to come up with more than he just has his reasons nta
nta all this within a month of meeting him that s expecting a whole lot from someone who is virtually a stranger cripes
nta since when is it the abandoned child that needs to patch things up she wouldn t even be in touch with him now if she hadn t gone looking for relatives everything is on the father including being patient and understanding that the child has years of being ignored to get through history shows dad leaves when something gets tough he won t even explain why he left why should daughter feel any surety that he will stick around this time working through all of the feelings around her father and determining that he is actually going to stick around this time will take time father and stepmom need to give her that time however long it takes and not rush it
nta i suspect your dad is coming on so strong laying it on so thick out of guilt he needs your validation of the father daughter relationship so as to validate his years of absence it was a choice on his part do not let him manipulate you for his own purposes a relationship takes time to build you guys are literally strangers for you especially the trust one would need in a child parent relationship is nonexistent if he s serious about building a relationship with you he will be patient about the possibility it might take years of being there for you you re nta
nta he s still a deadbeat
nta he never even apologized for abandoning you he doesn t want to explain his reasons because they re most likely selfish bs
nta you need to have a conversation with your dad and his wife explain that while you re open to continuing to build a relationship they need to stop pushing so hard you lived your entire life without a father because he chose not to be a part of your life moving past that takes time they don t get to form that kind of bond on their schedule
nta text him and say you had years to be part of my life and you chose not to stop pushing me to feel something when i ve only known you a month
nta but you need to be upfront and tell them he hasn t been in your life for years and can t expect you to welcome him with open arms after a month you ve experienced an entire life without him and have complex feelings to work through his and his wife s expectations of you are completely unrealistic
nta your dad only reached out when his kids connected with you he didn t initiate contact and sounds like his motivation is to look like to good guy in front of his kids if he was really concerned with your feelings he would talk to you about why he hasn t been involved instead of brushing you off with a bullshit i had my reasons sounds to me like he wants to appear like he is making it up to you without actually doing any work to repair the damage he did in essence setting you up as the bad guy for not embracing and loving him for all the effort he is putting in when it is really the bare minimum and takes no account of what you want and need my advice send a message to the group chat that you had years of not having a dad and he needs to take things at the pace you are comfortable with without trying to guilt you for not meeting his needs if your father and half siblings are decent they will understand this if not you are not missing out on anything by erasing them from your life i hope it works out for you
nta how dare either your bio father or his wife try and guilt you into making him feel better you owe him squat you don t need to reach out to him ever again if you don t want to and so far as you have said he s shown no remorse no real regret it s been a month and they expect you to stay with them do they not understand that they are strangers to you still and may remain that way
jfc what the hell does he think you re dating i d recommend a response of spend years being the adult in this relationship then we can talk about how it doesn t feel fair or even or can t wait to see how you re going to explain and make up for not being there through my formative years donor of almost half of my dna or this relationship started with a huge negative balance on your side you abandoned me for twenty years you ll need to make regular deposits of love and care to fill up that negative balance and show me that you re actually dependable and caring these days because the last twenty years taught me the exact opposite and that s your fault not mine
nta tell him that what he can do is explain himself and if he can t do that he should stop trying so hard because you aren t going to consider reciprocating anything like this until he explains himself

info why didn t you inform her via email or when the kid was picked up that would have been the responsible thing to do hey your kid brought in an inappropriate item today can you please talk to them easy simple straight forward no one gets mad
yta first of all you don t get to scold a parent she isn t your student you get no say in how she stores her sex toys she definitely doesn t need you harping on her for something she already know ie she made a mistake not storing it in a place that her kid couldn t access second of all you had to touch it to throw it out so your logic for throwing it out isn t tracking you should reimburse her for the item they are expensive and you really had no right to toss it
you scolded a grown woman for leaving her vibrator in her bathroom do you think that women with kids store them in a safe it didn t have to be so taboo yta
yta kids do crap like this you could have put it in a baggie and called the parent instead of throwing it out
yta you could have wrapped it up in a plastic bag or paper towels and returned it to the mother you shouldn t just throw people s stuff away what if she kept it in a dresser drawer and her kid found it while snooping would you still have thrown it away and scolded her for owning a vibrator
yta sex toys are not cheap and you just tossed it away instead of privately contacting the mom to let her know that her kid took one of her toys by accident kids get into things and don t realize what they re doing sometimes i would be just as pissed as the mom was if this happened to me mom needs to find a new place to store her toys and you need to replace what you wrongfully threw away
yta i get being a bit grossed out but throwing it away was a very immature response you could have picked it up with whatever material you wish tissue paper towel and later discreetly alerted the mother have a chuckle together and go on it wasn t a big deal you threw away an expensive personal belonging
yta it wasn t yours to throw away it s also not your place to teach her son that it s gross
nta i m surprised at all the yta it s not an educators job to make sure you have your sex toy and if it s brought to school they need to throw it away its not an educators job to preserve it and send something like that back home these are children sorry a child does not need a vibrator in their fucking backpack maybe mom should have been more diligent
you didn t need to act like it was poisonous just let the kid know that he should ask his mom before taking her things politely give it back to his mom later it is just a vibrator not a vial of ebola and you definitely should not throw away things that you know belong to others yta
lmao what is this
yta yeah inappropriate but it isn t your property how would you like it if someone threw something of yours away
removed
yta i mean you couldve just let it in his backpack and ignored it its not the mothers fault that tom got it from the bathroom her having left it carelessly in the bathroom does not excuse you throwing it away
yta and i m pretty sure you already know it
yta it s fine to confiscate it from the kid but as it s not your property you have no right to throw it away if you don t want to touch it use a damn tissue but that doesn t mean throw it away that s pretty much theft
yta for making a big deal about it and making it seem so horrible and dirty and wrong kids get into things sometimes those things are personal and realistically it s probably not the grossest thing those kids touched that day there were so many ways to deal with this problem and you should know how to do so because dealing with kids is your job you re supposed to be trained to calmly and respectfully work through issues that arise with kids and parents today you did neither
yta preserving it da fuq this isn t evidence in a crime scene
yta you could have put it into a bag and given it to the child at the end of the day and told him to take it home those things can be expensive he didn t know what the thing was she thought it was interesting and he found it in the bathroom where are you supposed to wash the thing the kitchen sink
nta i completely understand why other people are saying you are because you could have easily wrapped it up and gave it back to her since it s her property but people are forgetting you re in an environment with children and if other staff saw the vibrator they might have diciplined you over it other parents may have caused a fuss about it as well
nta because it is a bio hazard potential too who knows what germs could have been on it and you can t just keep something like that on your desk for mom later lol
yea it s an awkward situation but you didn t handle it well he is in kindergarten so blanketly stating it is inappropriate without explanation will make him confused i m sure also you had no right to scold the parent for it it isn t like they kept a weapon out for him to play around with it was an honest mistake just throw the thing in a baggy email her to pick it up and maybe make some humor out of the situation when she did don t shame a parent who is probably stressed about this i m sure you have needs too just saying
yta for making a mountain out of a molehill it should have been a crazy funny story you tell later on but instead you went psycho also don t throw away something that s not yours as a grown adult you should know better
nta i can t believe it s so split here the parent put you in a difficult situation and you handled it fine if they didn t want to lose their vibrator they shouldn t of let their kid take it to school the other kids will definitely remember this and will have questions for their parents what were you suppose to do wash it and bag it up for the mom to take it home
yta i d have loved to be a fly on the wall to hear you explain to the kindergartner how this item was inappropriate to bring to school but at the same time you said it was perfectly fine s kids get into all sorts of things at home and for all tom knew it was simply a harmless item you had no right to throw it away as it wasn t your property and you were even more out of line by scolding the parent you should have just packed it back up yeah you already touched it and sent it back home with the child
esh you didn t want to touch it but touched it to throw it away you could ve put it in a bag with a note attached or send an email that tom brought that to school and if she could be sure that mistake doesn t happen again she sucks for her response but it s also not your place to scold her for where it was left it s not a gun it could ve been hidden under the sink in the bathroom kids that age are nosey so it may not have been out in the open or maybe she used it the night before and cleaned it in the bathroom left it out to dry and forgot to put it away before little tom came through
yta high end vibrators can range between bucks
so much bait
sex ew s yta
esh she shouldn t have left it somewhere her kid could find it but you shouldn t throw away something that isn t yours but rather wait to discuss it with her after school and if you didn t want to touch it place it in a bag of some sorts etc
nta the mom shouldn t have left it somewhere her kid could get to it and why didn t she check her kids backpack before dropping him at kindergarten also gross
nta i wouldn t have wanted to touch it either and imagine having to explain this to other parents i d hate to be in your shoes she ll be fine and can buy another or in the future lock her shit up
nta what were you going to do just keep the vibrator at school thats gross
nta that kind of stuff shouldn t be left laying around for a child to grab up kids touch stuff put their hands in their mouth and also touch everything else that s just gross i would ve thrown it away too
this sounds too ridiculous to be real but i ve seen enough ridiculous things be real i ll give the benefit of the doubt yta you had no right to unilaterally decide to destroy someone else s belongings by throwing it away the mom had every right to be angry with you over that you have no right to be lecturing and scolding an adult about things that should remain their private lives and in the long run is none of your business she has more rights to be angry over that you have no place imposing your beliefs opinions ideals on other adults the only time you could do that would be if there was clear evidence of abuse no a child finding their parent s sex toys is not abuse which then gets reported to the proper authorities for them to investigate and take appropriate action she was probably already completely mortified by the fact that her kid found her vibrator and took it to school with him as a playtime toy she did not and does not need to be lectured like the children you teach about something she already was aware was inappropriate for her son to have even seen the correct and appropriate response should have been and will always be wrap bag the item in a discreet bag then inform the parent s in person by note sent home or by email of the incident if informing them in person or by note sent home return the item with the note or at the time you speak to them if by email politely ask them to come retrieve the item either from you preferred or at the principal s office in any method make every effort to be a discreet and low key about it as possible
yta regardless of what the item was you threw away a students person property in this case it was their parents property you either turn it over to the parent or your supervisor but you don t get to just throw away someone else s property
nta y all that are saying he should ve kept are disgusting a f
couple things do you have a mentor teacher to ask these sorts of things to a better way to approach the situation with tom would be to tell him it s a toy for grown ups and you ll keep an eye on it for now good to have them wash hands and give him another toy bad to tell him it s inappropriate since he has no context for what it is it is not ok to throw away something from home that isn t trash you should have set it aside wrapped in a paper towel or plastic bag or something and called home to let them know about what happened and that someone could stop by to pick up the item you let your own emotions run that interaction rather than taking the time to regulate yourself and prioritize the child and family yta
esh kids get into everything i know there were times my kids got into some embarrassing things when they were that age thank goodness they didn t bring any of it to school i m sure mom learned a valuable lesson here to keep more private stuff on a higher shelf but there is no reason you couldn t have grabbed some paper towels and wrapped it up sent it home with a note and discreetly handled the situation
nta who are these idiots
yta i totally understand but wanting to touch someone else s sex toy but you knew it was something he brought from home you knew or should have known that it was the property of someone he lived with it would be no different if he brought a phone or something else that he shouldn t bring to school take it away let him know it s not appropriate to bring to school then give it back at the end of the day
esh she should keep it in a more secure place but kids get into shit easily and that was her property you should have wrapped it up and put it in a desk drawer before letting her know about the incident urging her to be more careful and returning her property just apologize and move forward and pray she doesn t demand financial compensation or tell your boss
esh because some people just can t handle sudden exposure to used sexual toys but you should have put it in a bag and contacted the mother and handed it back neither of you should have had an argument about it kids get into everything especially the things they know are being kept away as a teacher you need to realize they do this because they don t understand but want to know and also they will tell you things about their families you didn t ask to know and may wonder if you should say something about usually you shouldn t
yta dont throw away that which does not belong to you period put it in the kids backpack but not you are rude and just threw it away if i were the mom i would have told you to reimburse me
yta you have no right speaking to a parent like that i hope she puts in a complaint you should have put it in a bag and given it to the kid on the way home and just emailed her and let her know what happened politely without humiliating her
yta for writing out a whole post based on a viral video going around for karma
yta you need to reimburse her and apologize
yta and owe her a new one it was not yours to do with as you please taking it from the kids that s ok but throwing it away was not your right nor is it your right to scold her where she keeps it you are not this mother s teacher and it is not a dangerous object
yta kids are chaos goblins and as a kindergarten teacher you absolutely should know that a vibrator is not a gun there s absolutely no requirement to keep them locked up you should also know that scolding a parent is almost never going to achieve a result you want that s cuz scolding parents isn t your job and you have no expertise in parenting you don t sound like you have much expertise in small children either you created this negative situation btw you chose to handle things in a way that led to you getting yelled at by a pissed off mom try to learn from this situation as you will be dealing with parents for your entire career
yta all you had to do was tell the kid it wasn t a toy and put it in his backpack to take home you made asssumptions that it was gross and full of germs you made him wash his hands and you didn t want to touch something like that it was in the bathroom so it was probably just cleaned you made a moral judgment that had nothing to do with you it wasn t your property and it wasn t your busines if the mother uses a vibrator or if her child plays with it your reaction to a vibrator makes you sound very uptight and prudish the mother should report you to the principal and make you pay for it

nta i swear redditors are the biggest morons a child takes a sex toy to school and you want her to take it store it safely and nicely had it back to the mother most parents would be horrified to find out a child was introducing their children to sex toys it s the mothers responsibility to store it safely
i m going with nta this is so above and beyond of things a kindergarten teacher should be dealing with mom s focus on the material aspect shows she failed to grasp the point or the awkward situation the teacher was put in makes me think she d have the same reaction to a kid bringing a gun to school
yta for sure i teach 1st grade if you can t handle kids bringing weird shit to school and just having it as a hilarious story to tell at the bar later then you need to stop teaching younger kids here s one of my favorites i had a 1st grader come to school wearing a hat that had colorful pot leaf decorations on it it s well known this student s dad enjoys his smoking i asked the student why he wore that hat his response i like nature and leaves are nature after school i pointed the hat out to his dad told him the story of why his son grabbed it and said no judgement but can we just make sure he get s a different hat tomorrow just because we have middle schoolers who will know what those are dad laughed and said sure sorry about that seriously all you had to do was say that s not a toy we use at school throw it in a ziplock bag and send a note home explaining their kid brought it to school seriously get used to this because stuff like this is going to happen a lot
i m a grown woman with kids and very much think it s inappropriate to leave a sex toy in a bathroom where your kid can get a hold of it that s just gross put that kind of stuff up out of sight and out of reach of children mine go in a box stored on a closet shelf
leaving a sex toy within reach of a child is extremely inappropriate and not ok keep it in your bedroom drawer where they won t reach it
yeah teachers get paid enough to have to make a call that includes the message i have your sex toy s can t vote because it s strictly a matter of what the law and school policy say but i hope it goes in op s favor protecting parents sex toys should not be any teacher s responsibility a minor child got it on his guardian s watch which makes its loss the responsibility of said minor s guardian aka mom
a teacher has zero responsibility for returning adult toys when the kids bring them to school the onus is on the parent for keeping those things away from their kids
i think that objects inserted into orifices easily qualify as gross that s kind of a modern sanitation thing it s not unfair considering op didn t introduce the vibrator into the situation wtf is wrong with the mom wanting it back no one should be lacking shame enough to ask for a sex toy back from their young kids teacher you take the l and buy another
agreed this post is honestly hilarious nta maybe the mum should check her kids bag before sending him to school and no doubt embarrassing op
i m with you its really not on the teacher to keep an object that could be considered a potential bio hazard on hand for the mom it could ve been considered considerate had if been put up but i feel that s at the teachers discretion if this had been me with my kids i d have gotten an apology card for the teacher and taken the l here
way with you i was a kindergarten teacher for a long time and there is no way i d be stopping what i m doing to find a way to store a sex toy and then figure out a way to meet up with the parent to give it back to them aside from how busy and chaotic a classroom of that age group is if the toy were found in my classroom or someone saw me handing it to a parent on school property i d be fired and maybe worse
there is a reason any healthcare professional will tell you not to share sex toys they can absolutely carry diseases and we re just supposed to trust that this woman cleans it properly before putting it in a common area treating it like something poisonous is absolutely the right call
there was a comedy video on my reddit feed this morning about a little kid bringing a vibrator to show tell at school thinking it was a rocket ship toy sounds familiar
this too
why am i envisioning pickled eggs and shit
agreed esh
no esh the mother being irresponsable does not make the teacher any less of an ahole
hehe kids get into everything at that age the only way to prevent it is to put the item into a lockable container like a safe and that s pretty overkill for a vibrator it s not gross assuming you aren t in 6th grade anymore it s just a vibrator
why the fuck would she explain this to other parents is your whole life only worth anything if you tell all about it to everyone because normal people dont tell everything to everyone
i mean we don t know if it was in a drawer or not i agree leaving it out on a counter isn t a good idea but we aren t hearing her side of the story i have little kids and although i feel like mine is is in a pretty safe spot it isn t locked up this kid could have been going through her drawers
maybe she had just washed it and didn t put it away yet and was rushing to get her kids to school we have no idea where she regularly stores it
we don t know if tom is mom s first child or not if he s her first this might be the time she learns that lesson
while i agree with this sentiment i m just saying kids are curious and can get into anything if she left it in a bathroom the child regularly used that definitely wasn t okay
there is no reason a woman should be ashamed of owning and using a vibrator
that s what i m saying teachers don t get paid enough for all that it is a biohazard people are just gross
i m trying to think of a disease that could be passed from a sex toy to someone s hands when said sex toy has been away from bodily fluids for an extended period of time and i m coming up short
sharing sex toys no one meant for op to pleasure themselves with it before putting it away for the owner to pick up the vibrator can be safely handled using adult common sense throwing it away is not being safe it s being a prude
if the original post was aita for sharing my student s mom s vibrator then you would have a point however unless i missed something pretty huge in the post i think it would have been pretty safe for the teacher to simply put it in a bag pop it into a locked drawer and then give it to the mom later
nobody is telling op to share it she s a teacher to small children and probably exposed to way more germs on a daily basis picking up with tissue would have spared from whatever residue if any was left
okay im still not buying it this post how does a kindergartener wake up eat breakfast have his little school bag packed along with his lunch and get driven to school without the mother noticing a fucking dong in his possession no edit fine let s assume this shit really happened op could have found some tongs two fucking sticks a pair of gloves or just stabbed it with a pencil if the material is forgiving enough and slung it into a bag box jar or back into the backpack
if my kid came home from school describing something that sounded like a vibrator as a toy they played with i would have questions for the teacher that she would have to answer i think you misunderstood this response
if other children saw or knew what it was and reported it to their parents then she would definitely have to deal with the concerns of other parents not sure why you re asking about my life this isn t about me
and it s fair to add that we don t know which bathroom it was in it s possible it was the mom s own bathroom instead of the kid s
i think that s kind of the point kids that age go through drawers if not taught otherwise i don t think anyone is assuming she left the thing on the counter that s why medicine is child proofed batteries taste sour tide pods are not for eating they get into everything i m not saying lock the thing up but it s not unreasonable to put it out of reach i m sure mom learned a valuable lesson here
a dresser drawer would be one thing but a sex toy has zero business in a bathroom drawer if the kid found it while brushing his teeth it was somewhere it did not belong i wouldn t store something that goes in my cooch with the toothbrushes or wash rags or q tips besides a box of tampons
can t argue that it is a lesson learned lmao
i didn t say that men or women whose sex toys end up in the kids grade school should be very ashamed however
there s plenty reason why a woman should be ashamed of leaving her vibrator within reach of a child
would you handle a strangers sex toys without gloves do you keep sex toy sized bags in your office should the occasion arise people are really expecting op to go above and beyond in a bizarre and abnormal way
not all vibrators are dongs
and a reasonable response from the teacher that there was a misunderstand that has since been corrected should be quite enough for anyone with any sense
kindergartners dont have enough memory to do all of be interested in the object be confused by it remember its properties we ll enough for it to be described to word out that descripcin un a way that the parents can understand it
they are kindergartners
exactly clearly if it was a bathroom the kid regularly used then that was not an okay place to store it i was thinking more if the mom has her own bathroom the kid rarely used in a drawer put away it s still possible a curious kid could have found it
certainly not a shared bathroom drawer i agree it s best to do whatever you can to keep it out of reach i m just saying we are only hearing one side
very learned bet she went home and moved a bunch of stuff around the house i know i m taking notes
kids find creative ways of getting into things when i was five and it was raining so i was bored and stuck indoors i found my parents condoms
sex toy sized bags what

esh you are right that she does need to help around the house she is also right that your son also has to help around the house just because he has school doesn t mean he doesn t need to learn how to perform basic chores he is not more than old enough for most of the housework
esh she should at the very least be doing her own cooking and her own laundry cleaning whatever else for herself but she s also right that her brother should help too years old is old enough to do some basic chores even if they re in school she works to that s just as time consuming as school and sports he can do the dishes or his own laundry not teaching him to do those things is just preparing him to be a shitty partner to some poor girl in the future she s also an adult so you can certainly tell her to move out but you can t ground her that was a stupid suggestion and you know that you don t get to parent a year old you re just hurting your relationship with her let her live there or don t but stop this stupid squabbling
at and they should both be taking care of their own spaces and things they use
esh your daughter is being lazy however did you ever teach her these things growing up or did you just do them for her at the very least she should be doing her own laundry cleaning her own room and cooking her own meals your son should also be doing his own chores that s how children learn to be responsible and develop basic life skills needed as adults
nta but you ve been doing the cleanup cooking and laundry for a year old that s part of your problem when my kids turned around i made them start doing their own as a youngster i had to help with the laundry and chores for as long as i can remember but i digress at least you re trying to turn it around she is a lazy spoiled mooch and it s high time she learned to pull her own weight her brother is a child so his chores should reflect his age try not to make the same mistake with him and the younger kids teach them how to cook start with prepping food and work up from there your future children in laws will thank you
nta laughed so hard at the adult living for free at home thinks she should have anywhere near as little work to do as a year old child op you re setting up a mooch good on you for the grounding and try not to let it get any further than that maybe if she wants to be an adult give her the choice between chores and rent not to mention the fact that i don t think she could afford the live in maid she seems to treat you as
esh you could first try not doing her laundry or taking her breakfast in bed before you jump to grounding her stop doing everything for her children learn what they re taught start teaching your son before he ends up as entitled acting as his sister
yta i m reading your comments you should have seen this coming you raised her for years like you re raising her brother to believe that if she s working or doing schoolwork or playing football she doesn t have to do chores why do you think her behavior will suddenly change when she turns or even now you re acting like her servant making her breakfast bringing it to her doing her laundry etc you even clean her room wth your parents in law have a point you treat her like a child then are mad that she acts like one
nta i don t agree with letting your kids get to with zero chores or responsibilities around the house personally that being said she is not making an accurate comparison while she was in high school she had the same expectations as her brother as long as when he turns stops going to school his rules change too you are not being unfair insisting she do her own laundry maintain her space pick up after herself is the bare minimum that you could expect i think collecting a few hundred bucks a month rent and putting it away for her as a savings account would also be a good idea but obviously that s up to you i think your daughter needs a reality check of what the real world is like
nta she s an adult and she needs to act like one and that means mommy isn t your maid anymore your son is he should have some chores but he s still a kid i m honestly surprised you d do the grounding thing an adult doesn t get grounded they get it together or they get out admittedly i moved out at so it s incredibly likely i m biased on this issue but i also had a job since i was and worked full time when i was in college i just don t think you re asking for that much especially if she s not paying rent but working full time
esh you ve made it clear you don t make your kids do chores while they are in grade school so i m not really sure how you expect your now adult daughter to magically know to do the things you ve done her entire life for her poor parenting on your part it was your job to teach her adult responsibilities so she could be prepared to take that on when she reached adulthood yes daughter needs to step up but you need to step up and guide her through this don t make the same foolish parenting failure with your other children especially with the boy don t make his future partner teach him or worse don t create a man who expects women to do the chores for him because that s how his sahm raised him
nta she s an adult now and needs to contribute
nta she s an adult frankly it s embarrassing that she still expects you to cater to her like a maid you and your husband need to have a conversation with her about what your expectations you have for her going forward since she s an adult and not paying rent or going to school to give her future opportunities at the very least she should be washing her own laundry cleaning up after herself and learning how to cook basic meals for herself so that she isn t fully depending on you for that
nta part of adulting is doing your own laundry cleaning your own room cooking your own food all of that while paying bills she has a full time job and is not in school unlike her brother let her move out and see what it s like to pay her own way as an aside to help your son not be the adulting slacker he should also learn to do his laundry and cook for himself and clean his room and be expected to do this regularly as a part of learning to be a good human in the world
nta however y all need to sit down and discuss expectations
esh i was with you until you suggested football somehow equated to chores wtf are you talking about he plays a game why should he wash his own clothes or sweep wtf are you talking about she works she earns money all your son gets from football is head trauma why the fuck should that buy him a pass your daughter should help out and pay rent sure but your reasoning for why your son shouldn t have similar responsibilities are dumb as fuck making you an asshole too
it sounds like dau grew up not have chores around the house now of a sudden she is expected to pitch in t is an eye opener she grew up entitled mom took that away
nta she s time to grow up
esh that your son is on the football team and has good grades has absolutely nothing to do with not asking him to help out around the house the fact that he s does though he should still clean his own room and have some chores or you ll be creating the same situation for the future as you now have with your daughter your daughter is an adult deciding to treat her like a willful teenager and ground her is not helping treat her like an adult don t warn her she needs to start helping just stop taking care of her meaning don t clean her room don t do her laundry don t cook for her unless it s a special all family meal and you want to if you and your husband think she should be contributing to the household in other ways you need to actually communicate that to her
esh both kids should be doing chores my brother and i started helping around the house when we where its crazy to me to hear about kids not doing laundry or dishes or vacuuming
this has nothing to do with sexism your son is a young teen your daughter is supposedly an adult but not acting like one does she contribute anything to the household finances tell your in laws that an independent adult pays rent and does their own dishes buys their own groceries cooks their own food washes their own laundry etc and they the in laws can go piss up a rope nta and good for your husband for siding with you on this
at she should be able to look after herself that s an independent adult if she is living rent free she should be doing all her own laundry clean her room ect nta
i am leaning to esh here because although you re right that your daughter needs to step up i think she s right that it s not fair to expect nothing from your son he should be responsible to keep his own room clean and to do a fair share of household duties even if it s limited due to his schedule even the year olds should contribute i think an important part of parenting is to teach children how to be a contributing part of a family you are failing at this it doesn t happen by magic when they turn
there s a lot going on here for example you re supposed to be a stay at home mom so it feels like your trying to push your responsibilities on this kid you also don t say if she contributes to anything else like bills or pays rent and if she is then you re already on a slippery slope you also are showing favoritism by not asking your year old to help out as well i had a full time job on top of regular school work and house chores your son can make the time esh a household takes team work both your son and daughter should have chores
esh she is lazy but she s an adult she can pay rent and she can act like an adult she should move out you should expect that she will resent you you are treating her differently than your son who is younger and hard working it s your house and you can require her to do things to keep her food and lodging but she s an adult you can t ground her she s an adult
esh i know people will come at me for this but everyone sucks your daughter should be at least responsible for herself as she has to be more independent and start acting like an adult but it reads by what you are saying that you never implemented a chore system or never expected her to take care of her own things and you going from to will obviously be met with resistance while i don t think you are sexist by wanting your daughter to be more independent i can see her jump in logic since in theory he could do chores as well i started doing chores at years old to a certain extent clean the table make sure your toys are picked up etc so the age shouldn t be an issue if you don t want your son to possibly repeat the pattern i would suggest enforcing chores and i will say you make it sound like her job does not tire her trust me some receptionists are almost like personal assistants and depending on the boss or area of work it can be exhausting tl dr she is an ah for not wanting to become more independent and taking advantage of you in a way but you are ah for enabling it in the first place and not teaching her how to be more independent
esh your daughter is entitled but you failed her and are failing your son by not instilling proper work ethic regarding chores if you raise your children to never lift a finger you can t expect that to magically change on their 18th birthday
esh because all your kids should have chores even the four year olds you start them young with age appropriate tasks and build as they grow
yta for expecting her to share your duties when you are not expecting the boys of the household to do anything in my view you are trying to shape your daughter to be a sahm because you have no imagination for anything else you are n t a for not wanting to be your daughter s servant however she should be picking up after herself doing her own laundry breakfast etc as should your other children in an age appropriate way my general recommandation would be for your daughter to move out because you are being a bad role model for her
why are you doing all these things for her she can make her own breakfast so stop doing it she can do her own laundry so stop doing it she should have been responsible for cleaning her own room for many years now so most definitely stop doing that nta for expecting her to carry her weight as an adult getting free room and board but you need to stop overfunctioning for all of your children not just your daughter my son is in college and in the years that he was home he was responsible for cleaning his own room i usually did his laundry but he put it away and i made a point of making him do his own laundry every so often so i was certain he knew how to do it now when he comes home for breaks he always does his own laundry i taught him how to cook basic meals how to stretch his food budget when shopping how to balance his bank account and other life skills that i wasn t always going to be around to handle stop being a doormat and remember your goal is to raise functioning capable independent adults not spoiled entitled ungrateful eternal children
esh stop doing everything for her make her do it herself but she s right that if she works full time and her brother is a student they should both be helping out around the house and not just her
yta for infantalizing your kids and then being shocked when they stay infants this is your fault the fact your daughter is acting along with being grounded is frankly weird and unhealthy you can set boundaries not control a boundary is you must keep your room clean and take care of your own laundry and weekend meals or you are not welcome in my home she gets to choose what she does there is no reason you should be cleaning the or year olds room doing their laundry and serve breakfast in bed on the weekends you have made your year old helpless and entitled and are now reaping what you have sowed your son is and no more capable of caring for himself than his year old siblings what the hell is he gonna do when he s if he doesn t know how to clean a toilet or how often sheets should be washed or how long meat takes to thaw you need to treat your daughter like an adult she does her own laundry she keeps her own space clean she cleans up her own mess in the common areas discuss meals and food no more breakfast in bed nonsense you can still make her stuff if you feel like it but it s not an expectation and she eats at the table i m assuming dinner is a family affair and made by you it makes sense to continue that just to prevent kitchen fights but i think adding that some nights are year old or year old makes dinner or fend for yourself nights are appropriate iron out why she s living at home and for how long it s intended is she saving for something looking for a place high cost of living culturally inappropriate to leave until married whatever the plan is make you all explicitly lay it out your son needs to start doing some or all of his own chores especially basic cleaning and laundry you can ease him into it but he s old enough to do it himself
nta you re not asking for anything unreasonable
nta she s an adult with a full time job living at home for free contributing nothing and expecting you to be her servant she is lazy and entitled your son is and still in school he is entitled to free room and board she isn t either she pays rent does the chores you ask or moves out
she is a product of your parenting since she was a kid you have to take some responsibility for a year old who s been served all these years yta
be honest with yourself now you raised her to be this way the fact that you still bring her breakfast at clean her bedroom do her laundry why would she expect to have to do anything when you never required her to she s acting like a younger teenager as that s how you treat her when will you be able to let her act as an independent adult how will she learn to be independent you have bigger problems other than worrying about whether or not you are an ah
she didn t have to do it when she was so the whataboutism doesn t really work esh for the grounding and a little for the parenting that allowed it to get to this point her for acting like a child
yta i know some won t agree but y t a for not having her or your son helping around the house my kids are and one is in high school and organizations outside of school the other has graduated college and is working full time while saving for the future both have been helping around the house and doing chores since ever even your year olds can help by picking up their toys and putting them to bed at night as part of their routine you should have started long before now and now you get to deal with the aftermath good luck
yta for threatening to kick her out over chores it s extremely hostile and mean spirited to threaten someone with homelessness over something like that i do agree with you that she sounds entitled and that she needs to improve herself as a person if you had said you re an adult now and you have a decision to make you need to contribute to this household either physically or financially or you need to find your own place that would have been reasonable making it a threat is very not cool
nta she can at least clean up after herself and keep her space clean and do her own laundry
nta your house your rules either daughter abide by the rules and start contributing chore wise or it s time to make her grow up and move out
kind of an esh here no you and your husband are good parents but soft at the same time breakfast in the room wth if i was late to any meal i had to roll the dice maybe it was an ass whooping for not coming to eat when i was told food was ready or sometimes i got lucky and had to serve myself my food so your kid is a brat because of how you raised her my dad would probably kick me out if i wasn t going to school or doing anything but work and hanging out with friends your son is and playing football and good grades kudos to him sounds like a great kid what is he doing in between the times he doesn t have to be at football or getting good grades he can help with chores as well i was outside learning how to disassemble a bike to its last ball bearing and reassembling it so i could fix up old bikes and sell them for profit all in all you re at fault for not being strict with your kid but you re doing alright now and your kid is behaving so that s good and your son still needs to learn to do some chores my sister was just like your son now she s a massive gaping asshole with a huge ego cause she was the golden child with good grades and i was the bad grades son with discipline beat into me guess who s thriving disclaimer please don t beat your kids it worked for me won t work for everybody results may vary
esh your daughter should be helping around the house however so should your son even though he was a lot going on and has good grades it s beneficial for him to learn to clean up after himself and do chores around the house chores are also really not that time consuming i was in multiple clubs played sports and had great grades all throughout high school and i still did loads of chores around the house
you are doing a disservice to your children spoiling them is not helpful teaching them how to live their lives independently is helpful that includes so many things but just a few are knowing how to cook clean do laundry handle finances and change a tire if they do not know how to do all of these things by the age of then you have failed as a parent
info did your daughter have to help with a chores when she was

info what did you try before did you start with a treath
so basically you house is her free hotel with maid and room service etc first throw her out and she how she likes it on her own maybe if you let her back in she ll have a more realistic attitude about life in your house next tell your in laws the next time they open their trap about things that don t concern them you ll go nc on them and why you were cooking breakfast for your lazy slob of a daughter and even serving it to her in her room is quite some mystery
m m
nta she is an adult now she can either belly up and start helping out or she can act like a child and be treated like a child
nta but why are you still doing her laundry much less cooking specifically for her and at y o your son should also be doing his own laundry
independent adults clean after themselves and cook for themselves so you are giving her a choice act like an adult and contribute to her living arrangements or go elsewhere she has to learn
id say nta i m sure if your daughter decides to go to college you wouldn t expect her to do chores as long as she was keeping up her grades too deciding not to go to college and get a job means she either has to pay rent or help around the house this doesn t seem unreasonable to me all the people saying its sexist because your notbasking the year old boy to also do chores are clearly ignoring the hes in school so no chores if you keep your grades up rule you have this was the same for me when i was growing up when i left school i had a choice go to college and continue to be supported and live rent free with at my mother s or get a job start paying rent and help around the house
nta her argument that her younger brother should help out first before she will consider it is a bit desperate she seems very entitled also she has accepted the grounding in preference to helping out clearly you need to stop doing her washing stay out of her room and let her make some of her own meals you should also ask for rent
esh yes she should either help out or financially contribute however you suck for thinking you can ground a year old no matter how immature they are you are lucky because i would not comply in her position honestly what would you do if she went out anyways lol and she is right that it is sexist to only expect it from her as she has an actual job she likely works harder between the hours of to than he does and many his age are expected to do chores along with maintaining good grades so you are not treating him like a proper teenager to begin with work is a necessity football is not thus it is not a valid excuse to relieve him of chores many parents would say he would be expected to drop the team if he couldn t keep up with chores because of it as long as he gets away with doing none sorry you are one of the a holes here
esh she s right your year old should also be contributing to help running the household and it does appear sexist your daughter should be cooking her own meals doing her own laundry and cleaning up after herself beyond that if you want her help with certain tasks sit down with her and talk about it and decide as a household how she will contribute make it a discussion not a dressing down
esh but not because you grounded her even though she is an adult it s because you set her up for failure your year old should help around the house he is old enough to learn the basics and maintain his own house with you nothing big that affects his school but he needs to learn some independency you not doing that to your year old caused this issue you need to treat her like an adult have her pay rent give her a list of chores and stop cooking for her let her fence for herself if she doesn t do her chores add a cleaning tax on rent then after x months tell her she has to move out tell your year old he will have to do the same thing or you will have this situation again
as a mother 55f to adult son s once they when they were living with me they had to help out it could be anything from washing up after dinner to mowing the lawn and once they were working they handed up a week towards their keep a d still had to help out we live as a family and a family means helping each other out by contributing to the household you are her mother not her servant she is old enough in full time employment and she can help out and still have fun hanging out with her friends
esh she should help out but so should your son you are being unfair
nta she can either be an adult and help out either via chores or monetarily or she can be a child subjected to children s rules she can t have it both ways she s too old to be living rent free you are the a h because you say she expects you to do everything cook breakfast clean her room etc if you do those things for her then that s on you don t do those things for her she s a grown person stop
yta didn t raise either of your kids smh
esh you re right that she needs to help out around the house at the very least she needs to be doing her own laundry and cooking if needed but she is also right that her brother also needs to be doing chores when i was i was doing my own laundry changing my own bedsheets cleaning litter boxes for my cats and keeping my bathroom tidy i did that all while going to school and having large amounts of homework from all my classes your son is old enough that he doesnt need to be coddled by you anymore show him how to do things himself and then let him take care of it he needs to learn how to do things for himself
nta she doesn t pay rent or board she doesn t contribute to any chores she never had to do chores at her brothers age or until now so bringing him into the argument doesn t work in her favour she needs to grow up and help around the house dishes her laundry etc and at the very least stop expecting to have food delivered to her room otherwise she can pay to live somewhere else where she has to do all the housework
your daughter claims you are treating her differently than your son and you are but by law he is still a child and she is an adult your ils want you to let her be an independent adult but she isn t doing that an independent adult would at least be responsible for their own cleaning laundry cooking etc she earns money but pays no rent she expects you to do all the labor to cook and clean and serve her but gives nothing in return she is acting like a child she deserves to be treated like one you are no longer required to support her if she doesn t want to help out around the house by at least cleaning and cooking for herself she can move herself elsewhere to get the benefits of adulthood of coming and going freely with friends etc cleaning cooking paying bills and the rest of the stuff that goes with adulthood maybe her grandparents should take her in if they feel you are not giving her what they feel she is entitled to
esh your daughter is why are you cleaning her room for her and doing her laundry good grief you should really give kids chores earlier in life so they are functioning adults hint hint your son should have chores to hopefully you start earlier with your twins
esh yes your daughter needs to help out with some house work like doing her own laundry maintaining her own bedroom and at least cook a meal or two a week for the family but you have set yourself up into that position to were she isn t and hasn t learnt that independence she grew up with you wanting her to focus on school and nothing but school and school activities with the occasional chore thrown in but rarely which hasn t done her any favors you haven t set her up to be a adult and the same thing will happen with your son if you don t change something up school is the priority for your year old right now but get him to start doing a load of laundry get him to help cook a meal have him start cleaning and maintaining his own room set him up to be a adult your job as a parent is to set you children up to be a independent adult that means starting young with reasonable expectations and responsibilities for example your year old twins a reasonable expectation would be get them to pick up toys and put them away obviously make it fun and help out but that helps set them up to do it in the future
esh you re not wrong to expect her to contribute but you created this situation by not having her contribute from a younger age there is no reason for you to be cleaning your children s rooms beyond the age of they may need help with like vacuuming and making their bed fresh sheets but they should be learning how to pick up after themselves and contribute to the house by cleaning the bathroom doing the dishes or taking out the garbage to an extent your year olds should at least be picking up their toys and putting them away you re raising kids to become incompetent adults
no rating but this bothered me my son is in the football team he needs to practice and has good grades there s not a reason to ask more of him oooh your son s on the football team that s nice whoop dee doo your daughter has an actual job claiming that one kid can t help out around the house because they play a sport but they other one can because they only have a full time job is banging head against wall insane to me
nta contribute or get out your a grown as woman take care of yourself
esh if anything your daughter s work schedule sounds tougher than your son s school and activities schedule and you do realize you re setting your son up for failure right in a few years he might still be living with you and expecting you to wait on him hand and foot because you ve been babying him this whole time by not making him do chores or he ll expect his future roommate or partner to do all the chores the fact that he s a student and athlete doesn t excuse him from doing chores you sound like you favor him over your daughter or maybe she s right and you really are a sexist either way both your kids should be doing chores and you should have done a better job parenting them
my kids learned how to do laundry at the age of from them in they did their own for the most part i would have them do chores like dishes and clean kitchen or pick up and vacuum i was not a stay at home mom maybe that is the difference
esh ok you as parents create and control the environment of your household whatever it is it sets a precedent that your children follow and get accustomed to when you decide to change that you re going to have pushback you didn t mention if their where prior conversations about this topic beforehand so i m going off your post you didn t require chores from her before and now you randomly are without having a proper conversation about what is now expected of her and the first time you mention it you threaten to kick her out if she doesn t you re an ahole for that point blank your daughter is too but to a lesser degree cuz honestly it seems she s like that because of how you ve raised her you can t expect your kids once they turn to just automatically start doing things differently if you haven t prepared them for it or spoken to them about it your just setting them up for failure give your younger ones chores so that they are prepared to do chores when they re older it will only help them
nta you re not being sexist you expect your daughter to help out because she s an adult living with you for free and you re not her maid your son on the other hand is still a minor you re obligated to support and is pursuing his education if your in laws are so concerned with letting her be an independent adult they should have no problem with you kicking her out no better way to be an independent adult than by supporting yourself
esh yes she needs to help out more but your son should also help with things such as laundry dishes etc so he knows what to do when he lives on his own
yup it s also like op is trying to re create the current situation that so frustrates her with her son the daughter would probably not behave like this if basic age appropriate chores and some self sufficiency were an expectation through the years
i mean it sounds like the yo benefited from this same attitude whilst in school after turning and getting a job she s now complaining about having to help out because the yo doesn t i think the yo is definitely old enough to help out but if the parents don t make their kids do chores whilst in school that s kind of bs on the yo s part in my opinion
agree op also sounds resentful of her daughter somehow she doesn t need to wait on her cook breakfast bring it to her room etc reasonable to expect her to do things like that for herself if she expects her daughter who s working full time to help further around the house then should definitely also expect the son too as well
but that s the thing if she wants to act like a teenager exactly like her brother acts then she ll be grounded because she s not an adult
as a small child i learned to leave it ready for the next person so if i made a mess in the kitchen i had to clean it so the next person who comes along also gets to use a clean kitchen of course that started off as helping clean until i could handle it by myself but come on why on earth are these kids not even washing their own clothes the gen x in me is finding their lack of independence alarming
this i assume the answer is no since the son is and not doing anything most people i know where doing chores as young as and by the time they were they were absolutely doing their own laundry and such seems to me op may have set herself up for this to happen
not only that if her year old decides to go to college he is fucked he will not know how to do anything
i agree there is a difference between a y o and a y o also it is clear that at op s daughter didn t do any chores it is pretty bold to live at home after high school and have your mom still do your laundry and cook your breakfast she should move in with her grandparents if they think her behavior is okay bet you they get annoyed real quickly too
this
we think that our son keeping up his good grades is enough of a chore for him we also never asked more from our daughter while she was at school
that s what my dad did sorta i was expected to do chores simple ones mind from like never mind that i did three sports at the same time while my much younger half brother never was expected to do anything because he was so busy with his after school activities he s an adult now and can t even wash dishes properly i feel so bad for his poor girlfriend
you re right i forgot to say she s not contributing to groceries or paying rent we didn t asked her to help around the house when she was a student either why would we ask that from her brother it would be unfair
yeah i wavered between esh and nta but
only small chores that my son does too like keeping their room clean
i have adults kids at home they pay nominal rent and we essentially live as roommates when it comes to the house every does their own laundry and we all have chores i told them these are the same things they would have to do if they lived alone we all clean up our pun dishes takes turns with the bathroom vacuums moping cooking yard work etc it s time for your daughter to behave as an adult
yes op admitted in the further comments that while her daughter was in school housework was not required of her and then suddenly at she is supposed to figure it all out her son is going to be the same at he ll be staring at the washing machine and asking what all these buttons do and googling how to cook rice
i had sport and great grades but i also made the family breakfast every weekday and helped tidy the house on weekends including sweeping and washing the floors started doing that before i was years old
yup op should have started on kids getting involved in house upkeep much earlier
she is an adult she is just not mature enough because you didn t teach her how to be independent before
you can t just flick a switch and make them independent at you should have done this much sooner and need to start with your son too if they won t help and aren t independent that s your doing not their fault
that s just not how it works she s literally an adult and you have no control over her in that way all you re doing is damaging your relationship with her which i can t imagine is something you d like to do on purpose but that s what you re doing if i were you i would be asking her to either help pay rent or find another place to live but trying to parent an adult is just not appropriate
you re going to have the exact same problem with your son someday if you can t comprehend that they need to be taught these skills that they are expected to do them taught by you their parents if you had started with your daughter by you probably wouldn t have this issue now
she s not an adult because you never raised her to be one it s your house but yta because you raised children that don t know how to clean or presumably cook
well you are just as much at fault you allowed that behavior for so long then suddenly u want to ground her if she doesnt do all those chores then charge her rent its not that difficult or she moves out
op she was an adult the moment she turned unless i am mistaken and age of adulthood where you are from is in that case my bad however you are showing favoritism towards her brother using your logic both are teenagers if you expect her to help out around the house you should expect her brother to do the same

im going to say nta bc talking shit in public does warrant a public call out that being said not the route i would have taken just because its not my friend and it made it awkward for other guests i would have talked to my partner and asked why tf they are friends with ppl like this but i mean hey she opened herself up to it so hey
nta i think airing this stuff in public esp the dude s alleged appearance sexual performance and stuff is trashy and she deserves to be called out on it nobody wants to hear it and yeah you re right it s easy to see the dude you re with as a real man when he s not providing for her
she sounds gross i d say both the ah because you could have just said you didn t want to hear it without taking a side sounds like you don t like her anyway so cut her out of your life if your wife still wants to hang out with her tell her you re not
eh she clearly didn t care to have any tact or decorum when talking the way she was sounds like she meant to be having girl talk and should ve done it when you weren t around gonna go with esh you didn t talk to her about partner shaming or anything like that or how the term real man can be damaging to the mental wellbeing of growing and grown men vis a vis toxic masculinity and such as you specifically targeted and attacked her specific life circumstances you went for the jugular
esh what an awful group of people

sometimes op it is easier to remain quiet this was one of those times
nta few things ruin dinner like a woman going on a rant about what a real man is like
yta you clearly like the husband better problem is you didn t defend him you attacked her
esh this is a situation where two things can be right at the same time she shouldn t have siad what she did about her ex but she is your wifes friend so maybe that is why she felt comfortable complaining about her ex because mistakely thought she was among friends the world is full of people who talk crap about their exs with their friends the problem is you are not her friend so she should have saved talking about her ex to when she knew she was truly amoung her friends i don t like what she said about her ex either however i would have just said the conversation is making me uncomfortable and request that we change the subject there was no need for you to say what you did to her you said it because you don t like the woman none of us truly knows what goes on in someone else relationship because we aren t there for conversation or interaction you seem to have some strong opinions about her not working without providing any context for what their agreement was as a married couple was she a stay at home mom did they have an agreement that she wouldn t work and raise the kids or take care of the house did the husband change his mind
nta ok fr wtf is a real man like people just throw around when you have a perfectly good male partner taking care of your needs yea they might not treat you like a queen but guess what queens go down with the monarchy seriously they wonder why their new guys considered a real man treat them like shit truthfully a real man wouldn t even take that kind of abuse of being insulted i m just happy the ex husband lost pounds of dead weight because sounds like that s what the friend is
esh you don t know their marriage issues an appropriate response i m glad this is working out for you so how about that weather huh
yta jesus christ you have zero idea what actually happened in their relationship perhaps she is heartbroken and this is her way to cope either way the dude wasnt there so why the mra jargon to purposefully ruin a night and make things more awkward have some tact change the subject act like you are civilized next time
yta this whole post reeks of misogyny you admit you don t really know him but you ve already decided the issue is her because she wasn t putting effort into her appearance or making her own money you know nothing about their relationship dynamic or what went on behind closed doors but you ve decided the gold digging fat lazy woman is the issue
nta but sometimes its best to let people like her just flap their lips she was looking for validation and you gave it to her next time reject the invite to go out anywhere that she ll be
seriously she shouldn t be talking about stuff like that with her friends
all honestly people like the friend are the people that most likely will cheat on their partners
she was for a while her kids are older now though and the guy had vented at a while back to a closer friend while i was present that had been asking her to go back to work or school for a while to help out
have tact she literally brought up the guys penis size at the table and made fun of him playing pickle ball as a hobby like fuck him for not liking something cooler am i right lol
why does anyone have to hear about it though it s just bad etiquette it s nobody s business and nobody asked
lol a post about a women making fun of a guys penis is misogyny i m totally sure if this was a post of an exhusband talking about his exs tits and vag and a woman calling him out you would call it misandry by the woman totally not a double standard here
this op tone is full of resentment when he talks about this woman not working op is acting like he was the one that had to work to support her also nobody knows what truly goes on in someone else marriage
at least you won t ever see her again i m sure your wife can find new friends if you allow it
yes literally have tact just bc shes being horrible you have to be overemotional right back just say thats not cool lets change the subject and move on if she starts getting angry remove yourself and go elsewhere to have a good night
well first off not every criticism of a women is misogynist people are able to be criticized for their actions separate of their genders also it s not personal but it did rub me the wrong way because i know for a fact the ex had been asking for a long time that she help out and she didn t put forth the effort to alleviate any of the burden from him and instead waited until they got a divorce to go back to work kind of a fucked up thing to do to someone who is supposed to be your partner
you seem strangly fixation on this one aspect of someone else s marriage i m starting to think you didn t really have a problem with what she said you just saw it as your excuse to lash out at this woman because she wouldn t work
for real this comment section is ridiculous and op is real emotional about shit that has nothing to do with him

i suggest you go back to the city and find a new boyfriend here s why he s gone most of the time yet he s forcing you to live where he wants to without any interest in how you feel about it you are the only one sacrificing and you re sacrificing a whole lot you get that discount as a perk of your job he would not get it if you weren t working there so he s not entitled to it you no longer earn as much as you did and if he takes that money then you are essentially living in a place alone with out support and without finances he ll have completed trapping you in a seriously difficult for you situation he s not trying to see things from your point of view he doesn t care how you re struggling he s not worth your time and sacrifice nta
nta the perk of having a month rent reduction falls into the category of being your benefit alone you should receive the full monthly reduction to your portion of the rent
nta your boyfriend is being unreasonable and greedy he s also not very concerned with your comfort happiness he makes much more money you sacrificed you job and salary to move to a town he wanted to live and then when you take a big pay cut he won t cover the rent keeping you broke is a form of control financial abuse is a thing you may want to rethink this relationship as it seems to be all about him
nta your boyfriend is being selfish and greedy when you couldn t pay ur part he didn t bother to pitch in but he gets to dictate how you use a perk from your job idk you need to have a serious talk with this dude idk if there is more details needed but at least from what you wrote he doesn t have your interests in mind
nta your job is giving you to apply to rent you are still making a lot less than him but this guy sounds pretty selfish he s not being considerate of your desires or career goals if he insists on living somewhere where you can t pursue your chosen career then he has to understand that he has to help make up for that either that or you should move back to where you can find better work hell if he s there most of the time anyways why are you making the sacrifice to be in his small town why can t you too stay there where you can find better work and a few days a month he can go stay with his family
nta it s your job that got you a deal on the rent so it should be your half of the rent and seriously he couldn t chip in for a month making you take a loan from a friend
nta it s a perk for your job you make considerably less he fucking knew that fact coming in don t get me fucking started on wouldn t cover your portion of the rent what if you became ill injured or incapacitated just an fyi it doesn t have to be like this no matter where you are man s not even decent
nta you took a pay cut so he could live in his home town although i d hardly calling bring home days a week living some place he wouldn t even help you out when you were looking for work the fact is his desire to live there is ruining your finances and mental well being and he doesn t even care that s not a healthy relationship
nta move leave him behind
nta you should only be equally splitting rent if you re roughly equally compromising you re making more of a sacrifice and still paying half the rent if you account for take home so not divvying this up is just getting you closer to an appropriate split for your circumstances most importantly and both of us buried the lede on this he s only home days a month the home for which you re compromising
how long have you two been together why didn t he want to just pay a portion of your part when you were out of a job for weeks a partnership is about picking up the slack when the other is down and the should be deducted from the total and you rework how much you both pay again based on income are you happy in this relationship you both seem more like roommates than a couple you re also sacrificing your happiness for his and that s just not okay either
revised my original comment because i misread the post nta your boyfriend sounds like he doesn t really respect your feelings or what would make you happy based on the wording in your post it also seems like you re starting to resent him a little bit assuming that the is supposed to offset what seems like a low salary for you as the employee so therefore it should apply to you
nta but your boyfriend sure is he s deliberately forcing you into a situation in which you are dependent on him if i were in vegas i d be laying odds this relationship grows abusive on his end you re being isolated made financially dependent denied opportunities for income and success on your own terms you re not going to be happy in this relationship in the long run if i were in your position i would cut my losses and leave he wouldn t even cover you when you had no income despite the fact that he could easily afford it he doesn t care about you he s out for what works best for him and him alone he s selfish at best
nta it is a benefit given to you because of where you work it is considered part of your pay but be careful because you may owe taxes on it at the end of the year
why are you with him nta
nta he s making 75k has the job he wants and the flat he wants he had no complaints before right you found a job that allows you to pay less for rent the benefit should go to you you re not at the flat you want and from the sounds of it maybe not the job you want he s not considering the position you re in here you deserve an opportunity to build up some wealth of your own
nta and honestly what did you get out of this move you moved for him because he wanted to be in his small town but he is only there about days a month so you move to a town where you have no friends family or job prospects for him and he s barley even there and you barely have enough money and he is acting like you owe him this haven t you done enough honestly if i were you i d go back to where you loved living and get a job you love and can be around friends seriously this seems like it s about more than just money to me it doesn t seem like it s feasible as a long term relationship when you give and give and he takes and takes edit when i lost my job and was living with my soon to be husband he took care of the majority of the bills until i got in my feet again because financially he could him not being willing the help you out speaks volumes to me
nta i don t see why you need to give him a benefit at your own expense is he trying to make you go into debt he s not offering to lend you money move home do not go into massive debt for his guy he s home days week loneliness combined with financial issues will mess your relationship up be prepared to leave if necessary
the four hundred dollars is part of your compensation
so he moves you to a small town where you can t make any money he s only there days a month he thinks your perk from work should be taken off his portion it sounds like he s really controlling he wants you isolated with no money it doesn t bode well for a future with him consider this if he truly loved you wouldn t he want you to struggle less financially he s making more than twice the amount you were making why isn t he happy for you you re nta in this situation with him but if you continue sacrificing yourself for this guy you will regret it
nta it s your benefit not his
nta so when you couldn t cover rent to live in the town he wants you to live in he wouldn t even loan you money he s awful please think about leaving him you re young move to a city and live it up he s selfish and greedy and will get worse once he gets more comfortable or when you re trapped by marriage or kids
nta that is a perk of your job and therefore part of your income it should only be applied to your part alone but i honestly think you re so focused on the trees you ve missed the forest the real issue here is that every decision he has made is entirely self centred and has not accounted for the sacrifices you ve made in following him what has he compromised for you this man is not a keeper
after re reading the post a couple of times i have to say nta the is your part of the rent payment because you work there and not him he is being the real ah here and it is sounding like financial abuse they could pay you more per month instead of that discount and it would be the same but they choose to discount your rent rather than pay you more it s your income perk that you earn and not him he is really the ah for not covering your portion while you were unemployed that is showing his true colors i would really rethink this relationship if he cannot see that this discount is what you earn and is your contribution to rent every month it sounds like he will always have the extra money to do what he wants while you are living paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by and not able to afford extras
nta i don t know what calculator you used but a percentage split based on income is very common saying it should be equal when he makes over double doesn t check out for me it also is one of several signs he doesn t have your back you sacrificed a lot moving to the small town for him meanwhile he still gets the benefit of city life really think about how you want the next couple years to go you gotta look out for
you should move back to the city so you can see him more esh
esh there s way more here than just the issue of evenly splitting rent he seems to not respect your feelings at all with that being said you should be redividing the updated rent price instead of just taking off of your portion
what gibberish y all sound less like boyfriend and girlfriend and more like roommates with benefits but without the benefits either pay into the partnership or get out of the partnership in the meantime yta

nta i am assuming you are getting this discount because this job isn t paying what it probably should so realistically this is your income in the form of a rent credit no your boyfriend doesn t get the discount if he wants it then tell him to get a job with you
nta the is compensation for you therefore comes off your part of rent if you didn t work there you wouldn t get it
nta he seems like he s self absorbed and doesn t care much about what you want but to be fair if the rent reduction is an employment benefit it should be included as your income when calculating the percentage you pay of expenses so no he shouldn t be entitled to anywhere near half but that per month should be added to your pay there s a comment above that was a reply to me that explains it better
update us after you let him know thar your benefit will be part of your share or you can go back to the city
nta mathematically it would be equitable for you to add x to the annual compensation you are using to determine a fair split of the original rent with the being deducted from only your share monthly the two of you are also making big life decisions together while also behaving in ways that show a low level of commitment to each other to me it seems your boyfriend is behaving very selfishly good luck
nta but your boyfriend really sucks you deserve a lot better
this i said something somewhat similar but you said it so much better go back to the city and be happy before he has her trapped
it may also be taxed as income she should ask op you re alone most of the time why are you putting up with this situation that makes you so unhappy
that part stuck out to me like was he unable or just unwilling
that part really pissed me off too
that is the part that really pissed me off they are supposed to be a partnership but nope not helping you out even a little
this exactly the discount is a work bonus for the work that op does if she loves the town she should get a cheaper place and lose the roommate
days a month not days a week
but since that is part of her income it needs to be factored into calculating ops real salary so op gets the full credit for the but when calculating a proportional split the 5k rent discount needs to be counted in her salary so instead of basing on 30k it needs to be 35k
i disagree that is a portion of her salary she has sacrificed income and opportunities to live in a place he chose and he refuses to consider moving so that she has better income and opportunities this isn t just about rent he s being incredibly greedy and selfish
the rent decrease is part of ops job benefits she is being paid less in exchange for this benefit why should she split this benefit
he gets to freely keep his extra salary while she does not get to keep a salary perk of her job it s basically a way to add to the salary tax free how is that fair
roll back living on 40k in the city might not be the high life 30k in small town can be decent living
but i mean yeah he definitely had the ability to front me for a week
kinda both he goes to restaurants and bars with clients employees all week and needs the money to pay for that his company pays him back but he pays up front
thanks
you are right op should not split this benefit but then that benefit needs to be accounted for in the proportional rent split if bf is making 75k and op is making 30k plus the so ops real income is so 75k so in a proportional rent split op should pay of expenses instead of
i thought of that too but in general she just doesn t seem to get much out of this relationship and she left a place she loves for him and he is never home
living in a small town while being financially emotionally and maybe other types of abused and isolated with increasing mental health is worse and op can get a different job there
except credit cards are a thing
the only reason i don t feel like that is fair is because i have to pay for my car and insurance while his parents pay for his on top of him receiving family help in general i don t have a supportive family he has money to buy new clothes and fun things he enjoys meanwhile i don t have more than after paying for my expenses
that actually sounds fair to me
no i get that but op might be having some euphoric recall of city life let s be honest city life has alot to do but is expensive him not being home is an issue but it is no more an issue than anyother traditional job like trucker construction sales ect i mean she wants out by all means get out but consider your decision based more than i am not happy at this very instance if relationship does not work bail
this is why people are commenting that it is financial abuse he buys everything that he wants and you have nothing
then you need to sit down with him and explain all this to him you both need a certain minimum amount of fun money
just so it s clear i m saying you keep the full credit for yourself but just that you count it as part of your income so right now if income is 105k proportionally you are making of the income if rent is then you should pay but due to the rent benefit your income really is 75k meaning you bring in of the income so your portion of is in rent minus credit so you end up paying out of pocket his parents paying for his insurance is separate and immaterial to a proportional split of shared expenses like rent
girl wtf are you doing nta but come on why are you sacrificing yourself for this boy
that s a fair point although i d say most of their positions you mentioned except for trucker are home more than days a month

yikes i think this family has much bigger issues than whether or not the oldest daughter is sneaking out at night i know your boyfriend doesn t want to put young kids into the system but if she s leaving a seven and eight year old alone with a toddler for multiple hours and the oldest isn t at home to keep an eye on them they could get themselves into danger you might need to make that call if something doesn t change nta
your neighbors if they have been paying attention know what kind of a person she is and how she runs her family i am sure your neighbors take her badmouthing you with a big old grain of salt nta for keeping quiet about her legally adult daughter hopping the fence out back not your problem not your business about feeding the little kids obviously you don t want them to go hungry and she could have thanked you for feeding them talk about biting the hand nta and if you see the kids being hungry fuck it i would report her it will take a lot for them to take the kids away maybe the authorities will even get her some assistance
nta she is definitely in a tough situation but her kids are not your responsibility calling cps yourself would be a difficult choice but cps would definitely like to know about the situation of an year old being the responsible one left in charge of the other kids child care is expensive and she probably feels as if she has no choice but she is failing in that aspect of motherhood
nta i think people are smart enough to make their judgements based on reality and what they know of you both rather than this one rumour she is spreading she put you in a difficult position she shouldn t have even asked but everyone has a different idea of closeness so maybe she thought you two were closer than you are i digress for both your sakes i hope you will at least mend fences it sucks being neighbours with an enemy even if you were right i d apologize and try to at least be cordial again
nta her kids are her responsibility not yours i get it that she is in a hard situation but she has overstepped your reasonable boundaries
nta i m always wary of the sweet neighbour with the baked goods and who immediately offers a little favour and then starts demanding pretty constant child care lifts and other big asks they are not kind or nice they are just baiting a hook to reel you in it is not your job to watch her toddler it doesn t make you entitled because you don t want to get involved if you are not careful everything will be palmed off on you
nta boundaries yes you could have lied to her but she would eventually have another ask and another your neighbours probably already know about this woman s parenting and most will probably understand the real reason
call cps please i know the system sucks and it won t be very nice for them if they end up there but i d argue its better than something terrible happening and of the kids dying we re talking about an year old being responsible for a year old and a toddler that is just crazy it s all kinds of wrong i really hope you report this
nta she needs to find an actual baby sitter she also needs to talk to her oldest daughter about getting a night job so she can stay home with the kids and in return maybe give her more freedom so she could go out without having to tiptoe around it she s an asshole for just assuming you have the time and capability to watch a toddler just because you re at home you could also tell her that you have an online job where you work at home to try and get her off your ass at least a little bit and when it comes to cps i get where your boyfriend is coming from but sometimes it s best to get them out of that situation cps might not even take the kids and even if they do they ll give the mom a chance to get her shit together because for them rehabilitation is easier and better for the kids in the long run just try and hang in there it can be difficult having a neighbor that likes to twist things in their favor
barely nta its ok that you set the boundary to not spy on her behalf she s already displayed she can t handle the word no when someone is unable unwilling to take responsibility for her kids but you send mixed signals by checking in
nta this mom sounds like a nightmare to live next to especially having to worry for her children all the time she has some nerve for sure and you re kind to worry about them the absolute gall i m trying to make you responsible for her children because you re home in the daytime wow she needs to manage her own life and leave you alone whatever help you give her you certainly don t owe her more just because she thinks you do and you definitely don t owe her policing her teenage daughter in fact you owe her exactly nothing fwiw i don t think you would be off base calling child protective services but i don t know where you live i m in a state that houses foster kids in office buildings so i certainly get your boyfriend s perspective
esh the mom for obv reasons but i don t think you are helping here at all if you are concerned that they don t have enough to eat then you have grounds to involve social services giving someone else s kids food without permission isn t super cool and choosing fast food is worse the cameras always recording in the backyard is also pretty creepy when you get a bit more life and parenting experience i think you ll find that calling out someone as a bad parent is a waste of time what was the point of that whole exchange to make the mom feel bad that s an ah thing to do esp since it sounds like she lives in grinding poverty if your motivation was to help the kids making her feel defensive about what she needs to do to survive isn t going to change things also what do you think she ought to do differently she already tried to get your assistance and you set a boundary you are not entitled to simultaneously criticize and refuse to help if it s not your problem you should mind your own business
nta
yta this was a stupid thing to pick a fight over the whole thing could have been avoided by saying nope haven t seen a thing and moving on with you day
holy shit yes obviously yta here your neighbor who you ve always had a kind relationship with and who hasn t done anything wrong to you asks you to let her know if you see her daughter sneaking out and spoiler her teenage daughter isn t sneaking out to work a job but that s besides the point you could have said okay you could have said i don t feel comfortable doing that you could have just continued to lie and said sure but not followed through instead you antagonized her by saying it wasn t your responsibility and when she gave you an equally sassy retort you called her shitty mother and told her to be a better mom you went nuclear on this single mother working multiple jobs because she dared ask you if you d noticed her daughter sneaking out at night yeah you re absolutely the ah here
esh you were good up to the point where you said it s not your responsibility to keep an eye on the teenager then with the shitty mother and stop having kids remarks you became ta it s not a good situation but poor people don t have a lot of choices your bf s right that the kids would be worse off in the system i think you were right to set the boundary of not being her free on call babysitter and you re certainly not an entitled bitch for that
esh yta for snapping at her yes you could make things a lot worse for her kids you ve inserted yourself into their lives so you ve taken on responsibility either drop it all or go gung ho but don t do this wishy washy bullshit if you re that concerned for their safety that you ve installed security cameras and you re dropping food off you need to report it to cps yta for seeing children in danger and not involving relevant authorities
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** aita so i moved into a townhouse in december with my kids my immediate neighbor and i have always been friendly she baked me cookies when i first moved in i had to set some boundaries when just a few weeks after moving in she asked me if i could watch her two year old so she could run to the grocery store i didn t mind that but she just kept asking me to watch them for her to do tasks and i didn t want to be responsible for essentially a strangers child when i did set my boundaries she got very upset saying that im home all day while my boyfriend works so its not like i wouldnt be doing the same thing i felt uncomfortable after that so i stopped speaking to her she has a teenage daughter who ive seen sneaking out through the backyard we share a few times on the weekends but i mind my business and honestly couldnt care less im myself so i remember sneaking out her daughter has also told me that her mom works a lot during the evening and nights and she also has to work a fast food job to pay the bills so her mother leaves her toddler in the hands of her six and eight year old to take care of during those hours i was so shocked and felt like reporting it to cps but my boyfriend said not to and that he was raised in the system of our city and it sucks ever since i always keep an ear out and even feel compelled to knock on their door some nights with food to make sure theyre ok and have set up cameras outside in case anything happens theres something recording the eight year old is very mature and they all sleep in one room shes told me but its a sad situation last night my neighbor knocked on my door to ask me if i ve ever seen her teen daughter sneak out since another neighbor said they saw her jumping the fence to the backyard and she knows i spend a lot of time on the deck out there i said no and she said to keep an eye out and let her know and i said its not my responsibility to do that she laughs and says but i think its my responsibility to bring her kids food and i snapped back and said thats because shes a shitty mother and to be a better mom and that she should be more concerned that she has her child working a job so they can pay rent than if she sneaks out and to stop asking me questions she called me a bitch and said to not bring her kids fast food and that shes a better mom than me that stays home all day with a toddler shes now telling neighbors that i cussed her out and ruining my reputation aita i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta that s an actual yikes edit just saw the top comment also said yikes everyone is in sync
she called you a bitch but is telling neighbors you cussed her out for saying she was a shitty mom and because you won t watch her kid she doesn t want you to feed them where is the logic in any of this do your neighbors know that she leaves the little kids home with no childcare or does she leave that part out would be interesting to hear everything the neighbors have been told about her situation
nta don t worry the rest of the neighbors know what s going on over there and won t take her word for anything about you it is not safe for the three youngest children to stay home without adults supervision for hours on end despite what your boyfriend says i think you should call children s services if you do that be prepared for the mom to accuse you and probably the rest of the building of reporting her and she could cause you trouble you should make sure you have cameras at your front door where you park your car etc
esh
she never said the teenagers age op said they are
calling cps should only be done for severe neglect or physical abuse i get why it s feels like the right choice but once you ve been in the system you know the truth it also follows you till you turn
this sorry but you didn t have to go there and she s was slightly correct you feel it s your business to give them food but not your business to rat out the older kid fair i wouldn t rat out the older kid either but i m not going to claim boundaries when i m breaking them myself esh she is clearly a terrible parent but you made is worse for yourself and the kids and even though she sucks maybe have a little sympathy for someone who is a single parent and has to work full time
your neighbor who you ve always had a kind relationship with and who hasn t done anything wrong to you did you even read the post op says she bombarded her with requests to babysit her year old and then got pissy when she said no why are you asking a year old to have more maturity than a year old
agreed she also came with a lot of judgement and considering she s only herself she should maybe calm down
she has a teenage daughter who ive seen sneaking out through the backyard her mother leaves her toddler in the hands of her six and eight year old to take care of during those hours we don t know how old the teenager is but it s still clearly not a good situation
you think it s ok for a and year to be alone for hours with a toddler not being properly supervised and kept safe is child neglect i get that she s a single mom to kids but that is not ok so many things could go wrong that an and year old would not know how to deal with
if she has a fast food job she s probably at least
it s not but sadly it s a reality for many when you grow up in a house like this one tends to mature fast i understand the instinct but the system is broken foster homes and group homes can be traumatizing are there good foster parents out there yes but the ones who do it for a check and or to have access to children is sadly higher than you think and many group homes boys will be sent there even when they are on the younger side are dangerous and a step below juvenile detention maybe instead of judging she could pitch in a help for a reasonable fee edit don t forget the siblings will also most likely be separated
nope that would lead to the mom wanting to drop the kids off all the time to run errands like before if the mom can afford a reasonable fee she should talk to other parents or see if a local teenager or adults would like to sit with them at night
i m not saying she has to help but this strikes me like those judgmental christians who love to judge but don t actually want to give a helping hand bc of said judgement she absolutely doesn t owe this woman anything but she ll be throwing those kids life into chaos if she calls cps edit it also bugs me that she seems more concerned about her reputation and if that s the case she shouldn t call cps bc y all need to ask yourselves why none of the other neighbors have at this point they will judge her for going too far for whatever reason they support this single mother
if she is indeed a sucky neighbor the other neighbors will find out without the single mom having to say a word i m mostly concerned about small children being left alone to care for a toddler
i m with you not arguing just more saying this is nuanced bc i bet all the neighbors know what s going on so i wonder why they haven t felt cps is necessary maybe this woman has a really hard luck story and they know she s doing the best she can that s all i m saying

n t a for letting the kids play but i wanna say y t a for your demeaning view against renters neighbors are neighbors regardless of their socioeconomic status
it was gonna be n ta until i read what you said esh neighbor is way unreasonable to request kids be quiet you handled this beautifully until i might be the asshole for saying that she s just a renter and she s gonna be evicted like half the people in the condo unit after the landlord decides to hike rent by after their lease ends but that s it
yta for thinking she s less than you for being a renter otherwise you were fine for doing nothing
esh her for complaining about kids being kids in their own backyard in the middle of the afternoon you for the demeaning comments against renters
your comment about her being a renter is classist af and earns you no respect edit after reading your original post summary your neighbour s behaviour pales in comparison to your own yta and the saddest part of this is that not many people won t read the summary and see just how bad your behaviour was
tbh it was a frivolous noise complaint that she raised with you but you were a not directly supervising children in a body of water and b just a renter is utter rudeness yta on your negligence and classism
i was with you until you got to just a renter with no permanent place in the neighborhood hahaha so her opinion on the noise level of shrieking children does not count it makes me question whether it was really just this one time that your children were being disruptive for her to lose it like that esh
yta just a renter
nta but ok i can t get over that kids were in the pool and you were gone for minutes and could barely hear them was anyone supervising them
nta she is not the person the world revolved around and can do what i do earplugs because shrieking kids makes my brain assume danger due to trauma and i know they are playing and have adult supervision so i can use my earbuds for tv ir music or plugs for silence this is just an angry person jealous they re not playing in the pool
nope i wouldn t either i might have called the police on her and told her to not trespass on my property again though i ve had ah neighbors like this before luckily she s a renter so potentially short term maybe you could give her landlord a call as well

nta kids should be kids and playing does no harm
nta she sounds like a real delight at parties s
nta it sounds like it was the weekend and not the norm for you to have a lot of kids out there making noise however were there other adults out there you could have been the asshole for leaving a bunch of kids outside at a pool by themselves as someone could have gotten hurt
oh yes you re a huge jerk for allowing children to enjoy their childhood with no regard for oscar the grouch living his grouchy lifestyle in his can across the street or you re nta one of those things
just say you re a renter lol
guys we found the neighbor
that is the perfect response to tell everyone that you have nothing to contribute to the conversation without saying you have nothing to contribute to the conversation

you re in a tough position but this is your issue not your son s yta because you tried to make him deal with your issue you should have contacted the school yourself to see what they could arrange i m sure they have a mechanism in place for this sort of thing
speaking as a daughter of divorced parents yta my parents hate each other they ve been divorced longer than they were married now but still won t speak to each other civilly every time they pulled this kinda stunt with me growing up it hurt for reasons one you ve made it very clear to your son that the first thing on your mind was how much you hate your ex not how much you re looking forward to seeing your son graduate not how proud you are of him two you asked your son to intercede on your behalf to satisfy your hang ups he doesn t want to get put in the middle it s a couple hours of your life you didn t even need to talk to your ex just sit next to him your son should be more important than your hate
yta this is not your child s job don t use him as your go between for things you can easily do yourself or learn to tolerate situations like this your son is going to have any number of milestones in his lifetime for which he ll want both parents to be present don t taint them with your selfishness
yta your son has been clear he isn t willing to be your go between handle it yourself or sit around his father for a bit
yta this sounds like the straw that broke the camel s back
yta for putting your son in the middle of your problem with your ex you
yta it s been years don t ask your son to do your dirty work
yta for everything you and your husband have put your son through i can only imagine how hurt he must have felt his whole life y all think you did a great job but you absolutely hate his father more than you love him if you need an app just to speak to him and can t even say hello i agree that he shouldn t have cheated everyone will but that doesn t give you a right to hold a grudge for years did you refuse to go to ball games if the father was there did you ever have a birthday party together this opens up so holes and i just i remember when my bio mom did that to my sister and she hated it there s no reason y all can t be cordial in person and you re the reason that y all are not
i m going to say yta for asking him to be the one to arrange it for you if it s important enough for you to bring it up you can be the one to do the legwork to get it done your son is not your brother he s not supposed to be a liaison in your relationship with his father
yta was it really worth being uninvited if your son feels that you ve always made him feel like shit for not hating his dad you have clearly been making some passive aggressive comments and guilt tripping your son he s had enough of your bullshit and would rather his grandmother attend
gonna have to say yta it s gotta be hard for your son to apparently have never had both of you in the same room for years birthdays celebrations other milestones with even bigger things coming i don t know if your husband has a similar stance as you but if the two of you could find a way to be civil in shared spaces for your son it seems it would mean a lot to him especially as he graduates and builds his own life either you both have this stance and one of you needs to be the bigger person for him or it s just you acting like this and he s run out of patience for it at minimum though if you don t want to sit next to him and you want an exception you should have been the one to ask the school not put your son up to it
yta what are you going to do at his wedding his kids birthdays holidays
please go to family therapy with your son it would also be a great idea to go to therapy yourself alone
yta you could have played nice for one day you made it clear to your son that you care more about not seeing your ex than your son and his graduation
and unfortunately in my state they don t take infidelity into account for custody so we split yta for thinking your child would be better off without their father because your feelings are hurt i haven t tried to stop my son from having a relationship with his father i beg to differ he got upset claiming i hate his father more than i love him he said i ve always made him feel like shit for not hating his dad and he s sick of feeling guilty whether it was your intention or not you ve put your son in the middle and made him feel like he has to choose between you and your ex grow up get over yourself and get to work on fixing things before your son cuts you out of his life
soft yta while it s ideal to set your differences and justifiable dislike of your husband aside for the sake of your son for one event if you can t you can t but you should have called the school directly to ask about seating and not made it your son s responsibility don t put him in the middle if your relationship like that
this may very well be above reddit s paygrade but i m going to go with yta your ex cheated on you that sucks i understand i am against cheating but based on your post that s it there was incident of cheating no abuse emotional or physical no harassment he cheated on you divorcing him get i would likely do the same i have no tolerance for cheating in a monogamous relationship but the fact that you aren t willing to even see him for your son s graduation i mean shit that s not fair to your son at all to explain a step further you are making your own issue a problem for your son do you know how embarrassing that has to be to go to the school and ask this questions my mom hates my dad so much she can t sit next to him
yta this is clearly a deep issue that your son has a lot of feelings about you need to improve your family situation another comment suggested therapy together for you and your son and therapy for yourself i agree also maybe get your son a therapist so he can talk to someone understanding about all of these feelings
yta it s one day and you were making it about yourself congrats now you ve been uninvited
yta you put your son in the middle and you shouldn t have you could have called the school yourself or you could have sucked it up for that couple of hours and sat next to your ex you don t have to talk to him just sit in a chair beside his
yta you should suck it up for your son he should never be put in the middle my mil was like this with my husband everything had to be separate she missed our baby shower because his dad came my husband had to divide the amount of time he spent with each parent and his own wedding because he didn t want to hurt feelings but you know what happened recently his dad died you know who he couldn t go to his other parent she always hated his dad everything always had to be separate and at the time when my husband needed his only other parent he felt he couldn t go to her cause it was about his dad just remember what you could be setting him up for
i m going to say yta for asking him to be the one to arrange it for you if it s important enough for you to bring it up you can be the one to do the legwork to get it done your son is not your brother he s not supposed to be a liaison in your relationship with his father
yta i get how tough and emotional that situation is the trouble is even though you said you don t ban things you are clearly very bias against him that is your issue not your son s asking your son to have the school change seating is making it your son s problem i would highly recommend therapy holding onto anger that like is like taking a daily dose of poison
yta btw infidelity has nothing to do with parenting and as to why you think otherwise is puzzling father can still be a good parent and not a great partner apples and oranges set aside your feelings for just one day for your kid you ve been divorced for eight years sorry but it sounds like you re still not over it opposed to leaving it behind why dwell on it if you ve moved on let s not make your kid s day about your bitterness and inability to be cordial with his father it s his graduation focus on that and don t pile that crap on your kid it s not his problem and never will be it s an unfair position to put your kid in in the first place
yta are you also going to skip his wedding possible grandchildren births because his dad might be there
yta you can t make every special occasion in your son s life ruined because he s got to worry about balancing the relationship between you and your husband instead of thinking about the joy of the occasion you think of it as just a simple request but it s not for him it s days of worry that you ll be upset that his dad will be upset that he has to keep you apart all day what will he do during pictures will you cry will his dad try to talk to you alll that will be on his heart instead of yay i m graduating whoever caused it the bad relationship is your problem not his why do so many parents do this
yta sounds like you ve made the last years of this kid s life hell and this was the tipping point reevaluate your priorities
yta if you were concerned about sitting beside your ex for an important event for your son you should have contacted the school yourself and inquired why do you feel the need to put your son in the middle of it i get being cheated on and divorcing been there the kids get to still maintain a relationship even if yours is severed it is wrong of you to put it on your son
yta cheating sucks but i assume your son wouldn t be saying you make him feel like shit for not hating his dad if you weren t making it seem like him having a relationship with his dad is a threat to you it s been years you can t just sit on your phone until graduation this reads like you hate your ex more than you love your son focus on him and his accomplishments
yta you cant get over yourself for a couple of hours for your son you have actively made him question his relationship with his father because you got hurt as a parent you should have set your hurt aside and encouraged your son to have a healthy relationship with his dad the epitome of a scorned woman
yta your son should not have been burdened with your inability to be an adult if your hatred of your ex is more important than your son s graduation maybe you should reconsider your priorities is hating him your main hobby in life what does your therapist say
yta act like a grown up for a couple of hours
whats gonna happen at his wedding you gonna ask to have his dad curtained off so you dont have to see him yta
yta you should either call the school yourself or deal with it my father cheated on my mother with her friend and left for her guess what they both walked me down the aisle at my wedding like grown ups
yeah you hate your ex more than you love your son yta
yta you could have just sucked it up for a couple of hours for your son yes you should have let to go but it s too late now think about your son telling you he felt like shit because he didn t hate his dad of course not all divorces are the same but good parents try to keep animosity at bay as much as possible it doesn t sound like you ve done that and you re paying the price as an adult your son isn t going to have to split his time evenly or decide between you i wonder who will be invited to his wedding who will get to spend grandparent time with his children you have a lot of ground to make up you need some therapy so you can try to have a better relationship with your son
yta and need therapy if you can t get over it after years you sound awfully inmature
i m generally curios what does infidelity have to do with custody
being cheated on sucks but you have taken it to an entire other level the fact that you seriously believed custody should be based on infidelity in a relationship is a massive red flag nowhere do you say your ex was abusive to your son so the fact you would base custody on your hurt feelings and not what was best for your son tells me everything i need to know you have had eight years to get over it move on and stop screwing up your kid massive yta
sadly yta by having an awful relationship with your child s father he doesn t really learn how a god relationship works you re both his parents and yes his father screwed up big time but so have you now you are suffering the consequences you could ve instead chosen one night very important to your son to set aside your differences for once but you chose not to
yta this was your responsibility not your son s
yta grow the hell up for one day both of you and let your son have his freaking graduation without the drama of his parents being utterly incapable of comporting themselves like grown ups it s one day that poor fucking kid
yta you shouldn t prioritize your comfort over your child i think this arrangement yall have had the past few years is going to have more of an effect than you realize down the road
yta was your ex shitty yes but that s no reason to take it out on your son and it s not the world s responsibility to rearrange everything so that you don t need to be uncomfortable
yta when my parents divorced the hardest thing for me as a child and even now as an adult was the fact that they couldn t go to anything if the other was there or if my dad did he stomped around and looked like a grouch the whole time and my mom trying to studiously look everywhere but at him it hurts when your parents can never be even close to each other put your crap aside and show up at the important things
yta you can feel however you want about his dad and want nothing to do with him but you are still both his parents it s really not okay to put your son in this position on one of the most important days of his teenage life you two should sit next to each other proudly watching your son graduate and the thought of him having to go and talk to the school to change seating arrangements all because you re bitter about his father is just ridiculous fix this your son actually believes you don t love him enough to suck it up i wouldn t want you there either honestly you don t deserve it
everybody else has handled how this has hurt your son so i ll point out that after eight years it would be good for you if you didn t need to never see your ex ever have you looked at therapy
yta it s been years and you can t even be seated next to him to celebrate your sons accomplishment and quit putting him in the middle of your hatred towards his dad no wonder you were uninvited
yta it is unfair of you to ask your son this this is something you could discuss with your ex and the school it is not your son s fault that you two are too uncivilized to get along
yta put the pettiness aside and celebrate your child s accomplishments this day isn t about you about your ex or about your marriage it s about the kid
what are you going to do for weddings babies if he has them etc yta is a harsh judgement because i think the adjective is a little off but you re the stubborn one here and you have to figure out how to move from your current position so you can be a present family member in your sons adult life edit to share my parents are divorced the grand babies brought the family back into the same room together the years between the separation and the eventual new generation did their damage though the kids aren t mine they are my sisters but we still prefer to not mix the two sides of our separated parents reserving full family get together for only special occasions like holidays once every few years for allllllllllllllll the times in between the spontaneous walks dinners moments our first choice is to go to dads house he s the parent who didn t put us in the middle of their mess and make us walk on eggshells
yta in your pursuit of avoiding your ex you are hurting your kid do you know how stressful you are making life for him this kid knows that every life event no matter how trivial or important will involve you or your ex throwing some immature monkey wrench into the works honestly do you even think about your kid at all or is it all about you
yta my husband s ex cheated on him and is an all around horrible person when i met him they communicated and did what they had to for the kids i have played nice with his ex for the kids the kids don t know how much we hate her for everything she has done to my husband and the kids we love the kids more than we hate the ex so when our oldest graduated she sat next to us and we talked like we were old friends we hosted the graduation party and invited her and her family it really does sound like you hate your ex more than you love your kid grow up and be the adult in the situation
as a child of divorced parents and a divorcee please do not put your child in the middle which you did you should have called the school and made arrangements without having to get your son involved try to see it from his point of view
nta your ex husband is the one who broke his marriage vows to you broke your trust broke your heart broke your family that s some seriously high level betrayal your ex is the asshole here to hell with him your son is an immature mini asshole for expecting you to act like that wasn t a devastating betrayal if it s more comfortable for him to pretend his dad didn t totally stab his mother in the back that s fine but for him to expect you to pretend it didn t happen shows his lack of empathy you were hurt bad no one with a heart would ever expect you to tolerate the presence of your asshole ex husband
nta my parents have a similar situation and my brother and i made the arrangements ourselves for them to sit separately at each of our high school and college graduations it shouldn t be a big deal though it sounds like the issue might be more about other things than just this situation overall though imo he will understand more with age it was annoying at first having parents who refused to see each other but over time i grew to understand and respect why they had those boundaries
meh to the y t a comments do people ever consider how big of an ask it is to ask divorced people to be in the same room and smile like it is their wedding night if my dad hurt my mom i wouldn t demand that she seat next to him at my graduation for my sake what about her feelings op is nta don t dwell too much on not attending your son s graduation go have fun by yourself
yta it s been years you could have sat by this man for an hour or two also it s clear that you have done things that could be considered as trying to keep your son from having a relationship with his dad why else would your son claim that you ve always made him feel like shit about his dad
nta you are hardly asking for a lot here i don t understand the y t a at all you asked if it was possible and said you would suck it up if you had to sit next to your ex your son is an 18yr adult not a small child he s more than capable of asking for separate seating i m sure they come across this a lot if your son is struggling with your divorce then maybe he should have some counselling no doubt your ex has been shit stirring behind your back to come out on top you are under no obligation to re traumatise yourself if anything you ve shown your son an important life lesson that cheating won t be tolerated
nta your husband betrayed you and you shouldn t have to deal with him your son is old enough to understand what your husband did and why you don t want to be around him
yta you couldn t deal with him for one day for your son
yta i get he cheated and you had every right to leave him but shit you gave two shits about your son you still can t see it you made your son wait outside you made your son go through hoops made him live two different lives made him choose you did that for eight years i am so sad for your son my brother and his ex hate each other but they show up for their kids and don t put them in the middle
yta your ex cheated on you and that hurt move on be there for your son and be civil
i m inclined to say nta i can perfectly understand not wanting to sit next to him for a prolonged time however i don t think you should lay this on your son go to the school and explain the problem i m sure they ll accommodate you alternatively you could just wait for the event to start and find an untaken seat there always seems to be a few
nta
nta you just asked him if he can ask wtf since when is asking a question a big deal op you should email the school yourself but i guess your son will also not want you doing that if her ex was abusive i m sure these answers will be different her boundaries can be what they are without abuse she has every right to be involved and present in her sons graduation and not be seated next to a cheater she hasn t seen in years op did nothing wrong by asking her son to ask the school
nta he needs to understand it was dear father that fked up his life and not you
yta did you ever think about how you went about this effected him his normal life just suddenly changed one day and from his statements it doesn t sound like you ve always been positive about his dad you say unfortunately you still had to do because you are thinking about your relationship with your ex more than your son s relationship with his father this is a day that s supposed to be totally about him and you still in turn made it about yourself where he d have to split which group he goes to who he is taking pictures and spending time with ect take the cheating out of the equation does he have a good dad if so just be happy for him get some therapy for yourself and take accountability for any conflict how you ve chosen to coparent has caused
yta that s a really awkward place to put your son it isn t fair to have him go in and ask them to move one of you because you can t get along for your son your son is right you need to suck up your hatred ignore his presence and go support your son instead you chose to make your issues his problem and he decided that it was easier to not have you there than to deal with your issues he clearly feels like you have made it his issue for the last years and this was the final straw you faafo also his infidelity has nothing to do with his relationship with his son and should not have had any bearing on the custody arrangement anyway
nta you are not the one who cheated your son is old enough to know better
nta and anyone saying she is either never got cheated on or is a cheater themselves my father cheated on my mother when i was and my parents had the exact same routine as op and her husband guess who i live with full time now the one who didn t cheat on her spouse contrary to what most of the comments seem to think infidelity actually does reflect on you as a human not just a partner my father turned out to be a pretty dreadful parent which was easily predictable based on the fact that another woman was more important to him than the family unit i would have said n a h but the son uninviting her makes him an ah
nta
did your son s father beat you are you in imminent physical danger sitting next to him do you have a restraining order on him if not then yta my parents are divorced and they do not get along great but i have always been extremely grateful that for my sake they manage to get their s together and act like rational adults when they need to when i was still a child and even now that i am an adult because i am still their child they both attended my high school and college graduations they both walked me down the aisle at my wedding they both attended their grandchildren s baby dedication ceremonies birthday parties and special school events they didn t trade off events or make me throw two separate birthday parties just to accomodate them grow up stop making your son choose between his parents and start acting like you do actually love him more than you hate his father otherwise you ll be sorry when you have to miss your son s college graduation and wedding as well as his high school graduation
nta your son can t comprehend your trauma and that sucks
nta son is sucks for taking the side of cheater disown him
too late now unless more to this story your son way over reacted who if anyone is paying for his college and if you were my daughter i would not go in your place

yta you are never gonna get your ex out if your life so you might as well deal with it your son is gonna get married have kids have holidays and i can garuntee he is gonna get sick of accommodating both his parents can not be in same room together source divorced parents wifes parents divirced and so sick of their bs
i understand it is a difficult thing but there are going to be milestones that you are going to have to be in the same place for it s not like you expect your son to have to have two weddings or anything like that you don t have to talk to the man or even look at the man you are just near one another both appreciating one of the things you did right together i will say yta for going through your son as that had to feel pretty terrible for him you aren t the ah for struggling with this but you are if you let the simple existence of someone else spoil the enjoyment of this moment for you and your son my mother divorced her first husband for the same reason and i can attest that it was a bit tense as both new couples sat at my sister s high school graduation but it is something to weather for a short time the relationship between my sister and her father deteriorated soon after that for another thing he and his wife tried to do to her but now he has passed we don t know when such things will happen so for your son s sake it would be best to claim your seat and stare straight ahead at the graduating class and enjoy that over paying any attention to who is sitting beside you they don t matter for anything between you and your son
yta divorce is hard enough without parents being able to even be in the same room with each other it sounds like you haven t made it any easier on your son by making him feel guilty for still seeing his father as his father just the fact that he said it and the fact you can t talk to his dad makes it obvious that it s true it is a couple hours for your son seriously put it aside for a few hours to give him a good day and celebrate your son s accomplishments it has been years you should be able to do that by now just sit next to the guy you don t have to get back together or anything i say this as a child of divorce my parents were divorced when i was around the same age as your son was it sucked it was not an amicable divorce it was bad but when i graduated my parents sucked it up and sat near each other to make it easier on me why cause they could put me first on that day they did the same for my graduation party for college graduation my wedding etc you have so many other big events coming up that you and your ex will both have to attend it s better you start interacting now
you can t ask the school yourself or just adult your way through the ceremony and be proud of your son yta
yta my bffs mother in law is like that with her ex it s exhausting and so much work for her children at major life events like weddings and grandkid birthday parties she would throw a fit if they ever tried to include their stepsisters who they love and have known since they were kids get therapy do better
yta for immature way you ve handled the entire co parenting situation you should have prioritized your son s well being over your ego and hurt feelings if there was abuse that d be different but the only thing he beat was another woman s vagina not you you need to grow up i ve had a best friend since childhood with divorced parents and the way they made it so difficult for all her big life events really stuck with me so now as i co parent myself i always remind myself to put my child as my top priority and part of that means being respectful civil and friendly with her cheating father
yta your son is right you literally say it s unfortunate that you have custody because your state doesn t consider infidelity but why would it infidelity is between you and your ex has nothing to do with his ability to parent you need to realize that your behavior is affecting your life as well as the people around you it s been years you need professional help to move on if you re struggling to do so on your own also you could have called the school directly there was no need to involve your kid in this
yta you wanted your child to ask for you that s bs you need to grow up as for sitting next to your ex suck it up and sit he messed up big time and deserves the treatment you ve given him but when it comes to your child you need to put that behind you for those few hours and support him someday he may get married or have children and he shouldn t have to worry and wonder about whether his parents will behave or fight over not wanting to be in pictures together
yta if your ex was abusing you this could be justified but you are holding onto a weird amount of hate for infidelity it sounds like you need therapy to get over it
yta it s been years it s time to move on and heal is there any reason you couldn t call the school on your own why did your son even need to be involved you don t have to like your ex but you ve been short sighted in how this is affecting your son it s hard enough to have your parents divorce but this level of complete detachment is unhinged he needs both of you and he needs you to get along because he loves both of you as it is he s stuck in the middle feeling awful
yta i get it was a horrible moment in your life and you don t want to see him but that s your problem not your sons and if you want to support him there are times when you are gonna have to see your ex you need therapy or something to get over this
yta because you put this on him you shouldn t have asked him to ask the school
yta grow up it s been years you can be an adult for a few hours
yta how were you planning on handling other major life events throwing a temper tantrum every time if your ex his dad would be there
yta for one day you couldn t pretend to sitting next to a complete stranger well doesn t matter now since you ve been uninvited but recognize that you son is correct your hatred is far more important that your son
your son clearly explained it to you yta grow the hell up and stop making your son a middle man
yta grow up and don t make your child do your dirty work
yta don t put the fact that you and your ex are more immature than toddlers on your kid ewwww i can t stand seeing people use their kids against their exes
yta grow up
yta yta yta grow the f up everything your child said is spot on
you re wrong not because you don t want to sit with a cheating ex but because you asked your son to do it should have called yourself now apologize to your son before you lose him forever
yta he cheated get over it if you re not willing to move on and quit letting this run your life you re going to lose your son you made it so your son couldn t talk to you about half his life suck it up apologize and hope your kid can forgive you

info is marci emancipated or not if marci is legally considered an adult by the courts after proving that she is fully capable of supporting herself and she is better off without parents then you are right marci is not a child and gets to live how she wants within the bounds of the place she is residing of course
info what precisely does your daughter want to do that your stepdaughter is allowed to do
nta tell your daughter that if she wants to get emancipated she s welcome to talk to a judge about it of course that means paying her own rent cell phone car college clothes vacations other nice things that you can t afford as an emancipated teenager yes there are privileges to being treated as an adult but having a functional family that provides for you is nice too
nah you re all dealing with a complicated emotionally fraught situation i think you should try to explain again that there s a difference between guests and residents but not muddle the topic with age or loaded language about family apologize to your wife i understand and agree with what you were trying to express but i also understand why it would be hurtful to her as for your daughter i don t think she s ta as long as you sort this out before marci comes i have a few guesses about what she may be feeling first is that she could be projecting some anxiety about the fact that she ll become a legal adult soon perhaps feeling under prepared in contrast to marci who is already self sufficient second is that for one reason or another she might ve already felt that you were treating her as younger than her age and the situation with marci simply brought it to the forefront third and here s where you may potentially be ta how much input did your daughter get in planning marci s visit have you given her the chance to set boundaries about what she s comfortable with does she feel pressured to view marci as a sister moving two strangers unfortunately that s probably what marci is to your daughter or an acquaintance at best into the house for three weeks is a big deal i m not saying your daughter should get a flat veto or that it s the case here but oftentimes parents unfairly shift the brunt of inconvenience and discomfort onto their children some hypothetical examples are expecting her to set her schedule around marci and the partner or to share personal spaces with them your daughter may have deeper concerns about the arrangement that she doesn t feel permitted to say so she s beating around the bush with the topic of age
info the two examples that you give regard smoking and having her partner with her which one of these is your daughter the upset about or is there something else that she s looking for the ability to do that you don t allow her to
info does your daughter want to smoke vape does she have a bf gf is she having sex with them it s clear that because of marci s upbringing she engages in various adult activities that you d rather she didn t and you don t want your daughter to do does your daughter actually want to do these things what boundaries does your daughter actually want you to relax
esh i think you re only the ass a bit for how you talked about it in front of your wife mostly i d definitely encourage you to talk with her and get a gauge on how you can help her feel better about the way you handled this and what she might rather you consider saying or doing instead in that moment so you can figure out a way to address it better in the future in regards to your daughter children especially teenagers are often obsessed with the concept of fairness at least in their own home i think because children often are exposed to a lot more unfairness outside of home than our society is willing to admit so it becomes all the more important in the place they feel safest this isn t to say i think your daughter should be able to smoke or have a date around or anything so much as an explanation i m genuinely curious as to what it is exactly that your daughter wants to do but can t at home is it smoking or being able to have a date over is it something else what privileges is it that she wants that she can t have exactly depending on what they are maybe there s room to be more flexible than what we can see here but it s hard to guess without knowing exactly what it is your daughter wants
esh this is a great way to ensure the girls pretty much hate eachother congrats also you really hurt your wife by implying her girl is adopted thus not really hers a way to avoid this would be to find out what your yr old almost adult anyways daughter wants to do then negotiate sex get her an iud and a big bag of condoms make her swear up and down til she s blue to use them everytime no matter if a doofus says he doesn t like the feel smoking your other girl can t buy a pack herself so unless you are supplying well nah some for booze growing and using a lil mj it s reasonable to say not in my house if it s illegal and could risk you if not relax a teen won t have enough money to actually grow much
info what happened between marci and your wife that she lost custody and visitation for so many years
info what does marci being emancipated have to do with respecting the rules in your home i m adult and i don t allow guest to smoke in my home i don t care how old they are if your in the us you are not allowed to drink until your being emanicipated doesn t change that year olds are legal adults who can join the military but they still aren t legally allowed to drink in the us until they turn maybe you don t live in the us so that isn t issue for you also her being legally eminanicpated has nothing to do with her partner being allowed to stay in your home again i m an adult and if i don t want someone staying in my home they won t be staying in my home so please stop using her being eminacipted as the excuse for why she will be allowed to do these things you are allowing her o do it because your wife wants her to come visit and marci said it is a deal breaker if you don t allow her to do these things it is what is but be honest with your daughter this has nothing to do with her being eminicaptied her being being eminicpated allows her to make choice of whether or not she comes to visit without needing her father s permission her being emincipatied does not mean she gets to do what she wants in someone else home adults are still required to respect other people s rules when they are a guest in someone else s home
i m trying to wrap my head around her smoking emancipated or not if she can t walk into a store and buy her own cigarettes and alcohol don t supply them otherwise nta but ywbta if you re supplying a physical child drugs and alcohol
nta i don t think the way you worded it with pretending that marci is an adoptee was the best way to word it especially with your wife present i understand why she would be hurt by that though i also understand that you were trying to help your own daughter realize why things are so different have you talked with your wife about what would be the best way to help your daughter understand the situation she may be able to help you think of a better way to get her to understand marci s life and emancipation have nothing to do with your daughter i understand that it may be odd to see someone that is her peer being treated as an adult but at the same time the concept isn t wholly different than what is taught to elementary school students fair doesn t mean everyone gets the same thing fair means everyone gets their needs met marci grew up in a way where she needed to be emancipated and become an adult earlier than she needed to your daughter grew up in a way that guaranteed her safety and stability and is able to continue to live as the minor she is different life circumstances cause different outcomes for different people
nta but it sounds like your daughter has had an entirely different upbringing perhaps you should highlight the ways you are treating them the same you give them both the compassion they need you meet them both where they are hoping the best for them you accept their faults and want to help them improve you get what i m saying like yea the standard is the rule of no smoking no sleepovers or whatever but that s the implementation of desire of the heart for that person you desire the best for both your daughters failing that call your daughters bluff tell her she can smoke and that she can have her boyfriend for a sleepover my gut says she won t actually do it cause she was raised better
nta this is a pretty tough spot to be in marci knows she has the power in this relationship and she s flexing her muscles for sure i would love an update after the week visit as i m sure it will not go smoothly for any of you
nta and your daughter has to understand that her situation is completely different from your stepdaughter as she is emancipated she should be treated like an adult however she would still have to abide by house rules as any visitor would as your wife and her daughter have obviously gone through a lot ever effort should be made to make her feel as welcomed and accepted as possible
nah man that sounds like a mess sorry i think if there s some way to emphasize to your bio daughter that she is actually lucky to have rules and restrictions even if it feels unfair that it means she has grown up in a loving responsible household and even if it seems like her stepsister has more freedoms it s not really a good thing and the result of an unfortunate situation
nta although it was kind of mean to say what you did in front of your wife it probably hurt her feelings a lot your daughter really needs to get it into her head that it has nothing to do with fairness you need to have another sit down and explain that the circumstances are completely different and she has grown up in a different household with different rules
i feel for your daughter that s a tough way to learn that lesson but it s a lesson worth learning young circumstances are different for different people and a good decision can be made by acknowledging that nta
nta sounds like your daughter is having trouble with the concept that life isn t fair and sometimes things aren t simple
nta but i guess neither is your daughter she s still young and probably only seeing things from a that s not fair kind of view rather than it being an incredibly legally complicated matter i d hate to divide yourself and your wife but is there any way of showing your daughter the real implications of being emancipated compared to her own life she s probably thinking of all the fun things we all thought adulthood would involve as a teen when in fact the reality isn t quite as cool as that
info given that this will very likely be something your daughter holds against you for a long time are you comfortable with the potential damage to your relationship with her being treated to blatantly unfairly by your parent sticks with you
nta you need to continue having conversations with your daughter about why marci s situation is different include that legally marci is an adult and that this makes things different help your daughter understand that you and your wife are trying to build a relationship with marci and are having to make compromises to do this and are fighting hard to figure this out because you love marci and that if your daughter was in a troubling situation you d fight just as hard for her too open up to your daughter about the fact that there s no playbook for parenting and for such a unique situation and you re just trying to figure out how to bring marci back into the family also maybe plan some time with your daughter to show her that she s important to you she probably feels awkward and insecure about the situation too
i can see why your daughter is upset but she had to understand that legally marci is an adult whole she s a minor nta
nta marci is legally an adult op s daughter is not
nta marci is emancipated so legally she s like an adult and she lives on her own she just came for weeks even if it s her mother house she s like a guest plus marci will only come if she s allowed to do as she want and her mother is ok with that a sad since she doesn t live with you and you are not her dad it s not your job to say something to her the girls are not in the same positions

nah this is a really tough situation there s no perfect way to handle it because it s the result of shitty circumstances you might think about using a family therapist you all care about each other you just don t have the map to navigate this situation and having a navigator to help get to the other side could be really helpful
nta but your daughters concerns are legit got to hear her out admit it and listen more
you know that being emancipated doesn t mean she is legally allowed to drink alcohol and smoke don t you the emancipation decree does give her certain legal rights as an adult but it doesn t change age based laws honestly it sounds like you re using it as an excuse it s still your home if you don t want her to drink or smoke on your property even outside or you don t want her partner to stay with you then you can tell her as a legal adult she can decide if she agrees with those terms she could always go to a hotel esh because you re acting like your stepdaughter can do whatever she wants and your hands are tied and your daughter isn t seeing the other aspects of the situation
she is she won the emancipation
but being emancipated doesn t entitle her to smoke drink etc
have you given her the chance to set boundaries about what she s comfortable with i m not sure what this means does she feel pressured to view marci as a sister i don t think so we ve never called marci her sister expecting her to set her schedule around marci and the partner or to share personal spaces with them we do expect her to clear her schedule on some of those days for family activities and time but it s around all of us my wife works from home so she ll never be alone with either of them ever share personal spaces we re setting up marci and her partner in the basement bedroom which has its own bathroom the expectation is that they shouldn t really be on the 2nd floor without my wife or i and since there s a separate entrance as well as a microwave and minifridge down there there s not really a reason to go on the main floor after we ve gone to bed either all that to say that she isn t sharing private spaces with them at all
i do see why dad is not comfortable with his daughter having her so stay over in her room for weeks
i won t either it has to be outside the thing with that is that in any normal situation i would never just be chill with one of my kids smoking as a child in my house at all
we aren t doing that
marci grew up in a way where she needed to be emancipated and become an adult earlier than she needed to she didn t have to we would have welcomed her home the second things were final she even made us believe that was her plan until suddenly it wasn t
what should op do when his daughter shows up with a boy carrying an overnight bag
that doesn t make it legal for her to smoke and you re still allowed boundaries i say nta but all relationships need healthy boundaries even when you re desperate for tne person to choose you more so then because your kids both need those skills kid we don t allow anyone to smoke indoors and you re underage so i cannot allow you to smoke inside word it how it works for you and be gentle but firm i will say vaping isn t necessarily on the same level but if it s cigarettes you are also allowed boundaries for being forced to breathe second hand smoke so vaping may be a flexibility option as long as you again make sure she knows it s not infront of you you re allowed to be uncomfortable with her substance use and you can still ask any guest to respect the space it may actually help with connecting because you approach this in adult language to someone who is legally speaking on their own don t baby her she s survived and emancipation requires proving she can fend for herself it s a really difficult process trust that to include some maturity
then nta marci is legally and adult your daughter isn t if your daughter wants to be an adult right now too i guess she is welcome to prove she is better off without you and can also fully provide for herself but it sounds like neither of those statements are true so she won t get very far
right because the drinking age is and smoking age is or depending on location but it means only the law can bust her the owners of the place she is staying can make rules about what is allowed to happen inside their home and about what kind of guests they allow into the home and as an adult if marci doesn t like those rules she is allowed to simply leave as emancipation grants her the right to live wherever she wants so if she wants to drink and smoke somewhere else the only adults that can prohibit bust her are law enforcement and the people actually selling those items where as for op s daughter if she is caught doing those things her parents can enforce punishments and she cannot just leave their house because she is legally a child still
i m not sure what this means i was using the word boundaries as a catchall for any houseguest rules she might want to negotiate similar to how you have a no smoking in the house rule i don t think so we ve never called marci her sister we do expect her to clear her schedule on some of those days for family activities and time that s a bit of a contradiction it sounds like you have a decent set up for privacy all that said i m an adult with my own place who can establish whatever rules for houseguests i feel to be necessary i would still be hesitant and probably decline to have someone stay with me for three weeks living with somebody is a whole new minefield of potential conflict even when you know them well i wouldn t let someone s so that i d never met stay with me unless it was an absolute emergency your family s relationship with marci comes with a ton of emotional baggage on top of it so my point is if i were a year old girl whose parents are already fighting months in advance and i get zero say in the situation it would be extremely anxiety inducing your plan for the summer visit is risky and imo spending time together in a lower stakes setting first would be a better way to go i m concerned that there may be a belief if not intellectually then emotionally that these three weeks will magically make up for lost time frankly you need a backup plan in case it doesn t go well i understand why your wife is willing to bend over backwards to accommodate marci i understand that you re trying to support her and are caught in the middle i understand why marci rightfully expects not to be subjected to the same rules she would ve been if you d raised her but i m also positive there s something more to what s bothering your daughter that you don t understand yet i haven t read through all the recent comments to see if you ve already answered this but it s a good idea to ask her whether there s something she actually wants to do but isn t allowed to in the bigger picture she probably needs reassurance you ve got to make room for her to speak freely though an attitude of this is how it has to be where a single poorly worded sentence sets off a screaming match is not conducive to problem solving and compromise the three of you really really need to get on the same page before marci s visit because the situation will only get more sensitive from there
honestly i can t imagine asking my parents to even have my so in my room at all at i would laugh in my daughter s face if she tried it
again her being emanicipated has nothing to do with her respecting the rules in your home so stop using that as the excuse as i said even adults have to respect the rules of someone else s home when they are guest there you and your wife are allowing her to do this because that is how badly your wife wants her daughter to come visit the only role her being emanicpated plays is that she gets to decided whether or not to visit your wife why not be upfront about that with your daughter explained the only way marci would be willing to visit is if she is allowed to do these things in your home and you want her to visit so badly that you are not holding her to the same standards that you would give other guest in your home like not being allowed to smoke stop acting like legally being an adult means you can do what ever you want in someone else s home that is not the norm people still have to respect other peoples rules and bourdaries when they are guest in someone else s home i m saying yta because of the excuse you keep using with your daughter your adults and it is your home you get to establish the rules for guests in your home if the guest don t like them they don t have to stay so stop acting like you don t have a say or a choice in what goes on in your own home
so i did some of my own research and i don t know if you re aware but being emancipated does not mean that she is legally allowed to smoke or drink so ywbta if you allow her to even have them in your home if she can t obtain them legally on her own she shouldn t have them at all and you allowing her to expose your daughter to illegal activity isn t okay
with all due respect marci lived her whole life waiting for the legal processes to allow her mother custody you yourself said it d be a dice roll of if her most recent file would be accepted or not i absolutely understand why emancipation was the route she went down and it sounds like a logical decision on her part
ask him what size condoms to get
ok what does this mean your daughter can t hang out with her so in her room with the door open if that s the case no wonder why she s mad
moved in with my boyfriend s family at boyfriends parents were extremely kind about it some situations normal conventions just don t apply
eh i don t know about you but i was actually pretty well behaved as a kid with my sos in regards to being alone with them more than a few times with no parents in the house even i remember as a teenager feeling weird every time i heard adults talking about how everyone expected teenagers to be hypersexual all the time including my parents something about this clear vision of what they saw me as sexually felt objectifying and like projection of their libidos i suppose considering my parents had me at respectively that s probably not too far off the mark the irony i m a late bloomer only became active in my 20s and not because of lack of access i think we do teenagers a disservice with these assumptions based on that experience because i know i m not the only one i m not saying let go of all rules but that stance sounds pretty strict for someone who is and about to make her way in the world and be significantly more exposed to these types of situations
but you re going to let a girl who is younger than her do that in front of her
i would laugh in my daughter s face if she tried it yta for this alone don t laugh at and ridicule your child what s wrong with you
she s already agreed not to smoke indoors it s not the indoors that the special thing it s that we re letting go that she s doing it at all it s not okay for kids to use nicotine
it seems like you keep missing the point where she s allowed to smoke outside not in the home a lot of parents wouldn t allow their own minor child to smoke even outside but if they invite their adult friend over they ll tell them no smoking in here and they ll step outside to smoke marci is an adult
i don t know if she drinks at all but she won t be here i m not confiscating cigarettes but i m not buying them i m just not asking questions
it s not illegal to smoke cigarettes at you just can t sell cigarettes to someone under it s actually illegal for someone under to drink alcohol
that definitely what i meant is that we would have been happy to view the emancipation as the technicality to bring her home she didn t need to actually live as an adult that she chose to do
tell her there s no smoking on your property if it bothers you you re allowed to set that rule
ah i see that makes sense then i understand your perspective here though at the same time it seems natural for her to experiment with this new sense of independence and live life as the adult she legally is now it really is an awkward and delicate situation i wish you and your wife patience in navigating this i know it can t be easy

info when you said you talked to your mother about it did you mention to her that your brother and his girlfriend are having sex is the girl on birth control are they using condoms that could very easily lead to a teenage pregnancy very soon if she is on some sort of birth control like implant or iud at least that is not a worry
nta i get that the girl needs help and a stable family example is really important for people in her shoes both my brother and i were in similar spots years ago but your parents are being a bit permissive with all of this they re young teens and dating that s a disaster of a recipe they re already smooching in front of the family what s going to happen when her and your brother get the beach house for the summer she ends up pregnant this year or next what s worse what happens to her situation if the relationship sours what if it doesn t sour i don t think it s particularly healthy for a and yr old to be stuck in a relationship because of their living situation there are just so many boundaries being crossed here look it s great your parents want to help this girl out but they re effectively playing with a loaded gun and setting both of them up for failure when she does get pregnant and young do your parents even have a plan for what s next what kind of liability or legal issues are your parents opening themselves up to with this situation there are right and wrong ways to do this and from what you ve described your parents are doing it a very wrong way imo
nta your parents could have child services called on them what are they thinking when they have a grandchild within the next year by a year old girl will they finally rethink their parenting methods and when they re sick of each other within a year of having a crying baby and your parents are raising their child will your parents rethink this decision it s time to be the adult age you are and have a heart to heart with your parents
while i commend your parents for helping the girl out they really are doing a disservice to the kids unfortunately they will probably be raising their grandchild in the near future i don t think you have a right to be mad that they are helping her and allowing her to live with them you should have a heart to heart with your parents about the sex they both need a sit down and a talk about what is expected while living together this isn t your expectations but your parents ultimately its up to them again helping is good but setting them up for failure can only end poorly
that s quite young to be having sex
nta but it is a lot on my parents since it s almost like they have a new child now yah they are gonna have a grandchild soon too x200b i get your parents are trying to be nice but they are cruising for a mess
i didn t tell her to call cps i told her that cps could be called _on her parents_ if this lifestyle continues yes i get it the older sister doesn t want kid brother s little gf hanging around all the time that s the skinny but it s more than that when the deets came out it s barely teen kids having sex with the newly formed teen girl essentially shacking up there bzzt bad for family i don t care if the op s parents are deadbeats or wealthy or in between what they re doing is wrong because it is illegal _other_ people can call cps like neighbors teachers the gf s grandparents if she turns up pregnant parents of their friends etc there are so many people in a community who can see this and think this is wrong stop thinking the op or i m trying to bust the parents we re trying to protect them from losing their family these barely teens don t need to play house at such a young age they can wait like the rest of us to live with their lover and screw
nta almost went with nah this situation is ripe for so many problems teen pregnancy co dependency family bonding to a non life partner criticism comparisons to a future life partner you can have compassion for her situation and still not want her to live with you you cant control over what your parents do with their property obviously but you can let them know that you are a member the family and you re uncomfortable by how serious the relationship has become they are welcome to spend the summer at the beach but you won t be going with them because you don t want to live with your brother s middle school girlfriend anymore make your parents make a choice they can have you around a lot or her around a lot what they choose will allow you to factor that knowledge in when making life decisions it would be different if you demanded her not be around at all but you aren t your parents are opening your entire family up to a lot of risk beyond teen pregnancy they re not her legal guardian but are acting as if they are what if she was in an accident while your parents were driving the car when is she heaven forbid died while swimming at the beach who s liable for that who s liable for her
nta but please tell to your parents before they have a baby at a young age your parents could cause her grandparents to lose full custody over her despite they are unaware of what s happening your parents can get into some trouble for having a minor in their home none stop
nta your parents are asking for trouble if cps caught wind of this living arrangement they d be in some deep shit i m not saying call cps on your folks they re just exposing themselves to a lot of risk edit get out of there asap so you don t get swept up in the legal shit storm your parents are about to get caught in
when i read your post it gave me flashbacks of my childhood and first boyfriend my mom who i honestly think had good intentions would let my 13yo bf stay over allll the time eat with us go to alllll the family functions etc he did have a good family life dirty house mom was a druggie stepdad was a druggie siblings were neighborhood terrors u get the picture he would also stay home after school with me alone hmmmmmm what exactly do you think happened fast forward a year i was tired of my mom putting his feelings first over mine my poor dad agreed with me but didn t want to stand up to my mom so when i broke up with him i think my mom cried more than i did then he became manipulative and started blackmailing me into favors that if i didn t do he d tell my mom about our previous physical relationship which for the record was consensual at the time for awhile i complied because i was terrified of my mom finding out eventually i told her everything and she felt horrible that she put me in that situation to begin with i say all that to say this i was put into a situation where i had to make decisions i wasn t ready to make as a year old thankfully no babies came from this but if things would have continued who knows your are nta and i hope maybe you can show your parents this to see exactly how this could play out in the future it s no good for anyone while it may seem good to be the fun parent it s setting everyone up for failure best of luck op and to your brother and his girlfriend
nta ask your mom if she s trying to be a grandma and if so she s sick
does a yo actually think they will get a summer job in many places they aren t even old enough to babysit
nah you have every right to be upset but you are not the decision making adult here your mother is there may be other factors you don t know about you right your family feeds her all three meals many days doesn t that smack of neglect from her grandparents have an adult conversation with your mother about your concerns about your brother having sex there are legal and physical repercussions to what he and his girlfriend are doing talk about what new family rules you d like to see so you can feel comfortable in your home you have the right to ask for them not to make out if front of you because you re how much longer are you going to live at home are you going to college
nta yikes im sorry you have to deal with this but your mother shouldn t complain when they tell her that they are pregnant bc children having sex is def going to end bad esp since i highly doubt they are using protection
nta hope your parents are ready for grandchildren
nta but make sure you are firm when you tell them that you will not be part of the babysitting services and they are going to need to figure it out for themselves your parents could possibly get in trouble especially if she ends up pregnant
nta 14and with your parents knowledge that s not even legal in most states and also so vile they are going to get pregnant
nta wtf who let s their year old son have his gf stay the night when it s very obvious they are gonna have sex your parents suck
if your parents are allowing them to have sex they are going to be liable to prosecution depending where they live but your parents are not supervising these children appropriately really you need to tell them what is going on here before these children end up having children nta
yta for not telling your parents that literal children are having unprotected sex under their watch
yta they re helping a child in a shit situation and you re just jealous you re an adult now so if you don t like it you re welcome to leave
lol you have a lot of privilege thanks to the generosity of others what you re don t have is a say in who else gets to benefit from that generosity part of being an adult is sharing what you have with others and part of being an adult is making your own place that you don t have to share if you don t want to years old is well into the time when you should be internalizing and applying these values yta
soft yta it s your parents primary residence and beach house and they can invite who they want sounds like your brother s girlfriend is trying to earn her keep by working
yta you are being completely inconsiderate and are acting like a child not to mention your complete inability to communicate also i found it funny that your having this big a reaction to someone who practically lives with you half of the time staying with you for months and its not like shes vacationing or something its for a job opportunity i commend your parents for giving her these great opportunities and helping her through life i do feel they could have discussed this with you but ultimately it is they re decision also doubling back your upset because your brother and his gf whom you already know are having sex might have sex at the beach house this is the real issue why have you not informed your parents that these barley teenagers are having likely unprotected sex what do you think is going to happen if she gets pregnant who is going to raise the baby tell your parents your brother and gf are having sex so they can have a discussion with your brother and his gf because this is not normal
yta it s pure jealousy your and an adult
so the only real problem is something that you re not actually going to tell your parents about yta
esh except the girlfriend you re annoyed for the wrong reasons she s a vulnerable child and if your parents were giving her a safe space that would be great however she s a vulnerable year old girl who s having regular sex and is dependent on the parents of her boyfriend for the roof over her head someone needs to protect her
yta you can t control what decisions your parents make on this issue you can have a conversation with them about your concerns but you don t get to dictate what they decide to do they may have information you do not you can however control how you react to things and what you do next have you had a chat with your brother about the importance of birth control this would be my primary concern because becoming parents before the age of is a real concern here as the older sibling and given that your brother has confided in you that they are sexually active having a conversation about the responsibility that goes along with having sex would seem warranted
yta honestly it sounds like you re just jealous of your kid brother
yta you re an adult and adult who s aware of certain behaviors unfolding under adults who are basically unaware the situation won t end well and when things start to unfold serious questions about who was aware of what will come about and you better be ready to step up and explain the role you played in this corrupt situation
yta you re not paying the bills and it isn t your business what your brother and his gf do sorry but unless there is something about this situation that is actually impacting your life in a real material fashion you are simply being controlling
yta if you know they are having sex you need to inform your parents they also need to make sure that they are legally allowed to have the gf live with them they may have already done this but you can ask about it as far as caring about seeing your brother kiss just don t look at it you don t seem to care about the real potential issues just are upset that your brother s gf is living with you
yta your parents are fine with the situation and it s there property and there lives involved in it your plenty old enough to move out if your don t like it she can apply for a job and live with your parents if she so chooses and your parents are fine with it not your house not your rules
yta you sound like a nosy busy body for one are you sure they re sexually active with each other because i don t see either of them telling you and if they are why haven t you told your parents so they know and can limit the nights spent over or force them into separate rooms two she said she applied didn t say she had the job yet so cart before the horse here and finally it s not your house it s your parents and as long as they re okay with it and her legal guardians are okay with it she s allowed to stay and yeah you say you re not mad but somethings got you sounding a lil salty towards a yr old

nta
nta who in their right mind would allow a year old to have a live in girlfriend tell your mom that you re not babysitting if she gets pregnant
nta i smell a teenage pregnancy your parents are weird for allowing this
nta you need to have an adult conversation with your parents don t scream and shout try to have a civil conversation point out that they have essentially assumed all responsibility for this girl but are not her legal guardians if they haven t already done so your parents need to have a serious meeting with the girl s grandparents to talk about boundaries and responsibilities if the girls parents become aware of the situation they might petition the court to get back custody by proving their daughter isn t properly supervised and is being sexually molested depending on laws in your state your brother could face statutory rape charges you don t need to disclose that the couple are already having sex but just ask your parents what will happen should a pregnancy occur are your parents prepared to raise that baby your parents appear to be well intentioned but they are letting the teenagers spend all their time together mostly without adult supervision this is a recipe for disaster
no i didn t i didn t really think it was my business to share that with my parent s but i m now realizing i should and i m going to have a conversation with my parents when i get home from work
thank you so much this is exactly how i feel i don t mind if they hangout or if she stay s here a couple times a week but the whole summer is crazy to me
why would they have child services called on them
thank you i appreciate the advice and i will talk to my parent s about this
lots of teenagers have sex and don t end up pregnant
yeah exactly
the sexual contact between the children combined with the fact that she s living with them and completely dependent on them could actually result in a child sex trafficking charge as it should because that s literally what they re doing
plus if the boyfriend wants to end the relationship he s then trapped with someone living with him who has nowhere else to go
thank you so so much i feel like you know exactly where i m coming from i will definitely have a conversation with my parents about this
wow thank you so much i m so sorry you had to endure that and i really appreciate the advice
i will be going to college in september and thank you for the advice i realize it s ultimately up to my parents and i will inform them about my brother having sex
yeah they will all be sharing all right sharing the care for a baby from barely teen parents
i m going to tell them thank you for the advice
they are and yes op is an adult apparently the only adult with any sense in this situation
i wouldn t be an asshole if i told my parents
thank you i will
wow u got me there
if the kid brother has a kid then it will become op s responsibility and she will get the blame for not telling anyone about the sex she s not jealous she s scared because shit might hit the fan very soon
please do at least they ll be aware they might become grandparents soon
please make sure to bring up the legal liabilities with them they need to understand all the possibilities
please update us on the conversation
this situation is horrible and you need to tell your parents that they re having sex constantly and if they don t get the girl out and stop helping enabling her then they will be in serious trouble soon you need to remind them the following cps can be called they could be arrested and investigated and lose their son and you the grandparents could call police on them claim kidnapping and that your parents won t let the girl go home they cant legally just take her 2hrs away or more without her grandparents consent the girl can t legally consent when she gets pregnant cps will be called your parents will be investigated you and bronwill be forced into foster care and your parents could be arrested for allowing them to have sex and a baby they will more than likely be raising the child because their son won t do anything nore will he know how or even want to what happens when the relationship sours and bro wants her out but she doesn t want to leave or your parents don t want her to leave or grandparents don t want her back where do her grandparents think she has been all this time what do they know what she s been up to have they already called the police thinking she s lost your parents are opening up themselves to a lot of legal and liability issues you need to have a serious talk with your parents and let them know what is going on and if they don t get her out they couod end up in serious trouble with the law
my husband worked in social services i just read this case to him he said the parents could be prosecuted because both the kids are so young and they re allowing this to take place in their house with their approval he said if someone else heard or sees this or if the grandparents find out their granddaughter is having sex or if teachers found out the parents can be prosecuted
they have an underage child they do not have custody of who is under the age of consent consistently spending the night and having sex under their roof
and some do what do you have against teaching young teens about the choices they make might have unintended consequences there is more to sex than just having a baby there is also the emotional maturity that they have not yet developed most likely
you summed it up perfectly
please do because the last thing that needs to happen is your brother getting this girl pregnant
and as they are very young teens guess who will likely be expected to be a free nanny
thank you i literally am not jealous at all i m just uncomfortable because i know they will have sex if she stays with us the entire summer
no you would be stopping a 13yo from being pregnant bc unless you are providing them condoms they re doing it unprotected they re going to destroy their lives and possibly even your parents that girl s guardians can sue your parents for negligence and possibly even get cps involved tell them
the asshole part doesn t matter she s and your parents are responsible for her while she s in your home her life is only going to get harder when she gets pregnant
the fact that they may become grandparents soon is something they should get a head s up about nta but tell them
i want to say op is ta for not trying to stop them but i know that s not realistic you can t really stop teens from having sex make sure they re educated and tell them not to but make sure they have access to contraceptives anyway because they re going to
op said she was so cps won t have a say over her
jesus christ omg will definitely be telling my parents
i don t think the parents know or approve of the sex
maybe under writing that s how it s supposed to be but atleast here in philadelphia cps would at most tell there mom to not to do that and go on there way i promiseeeeee you cps does not fucking care that your kids are having sex there fucking teenagers your parents have a beach house they not getting taken out that home like idk wtf ur husband is on abt
removed
removed
downvote downvote downvote please let my comment be seen more get me to a thousand downvotes please cps is fucking satan in america
why are you harassing me calm down
and a year old body is not really ready for pregnancy not that girls that young don t get pregnant but they are higher risk over the period of their pregnancy
some other persons parents as they will just continue this shitty cycle of poor parenting
i will thank you
i agree i ll talk to my parents about it
that s worse she becomes homeless or goes to stay with family if there is any willing to take an adult child in
true butbif she doesn t have family who can take her in or friends she can stay with then she becomes homeless and then what

and at you are an adult too
off one conversationin which he may have been lying
one of those children isn t their child it s someone else s child yes cps would care unless these parents want to enter the foster care system and become their son s gf s foster care parents cps would take her out and put her back with her grandparents you don t write like an adult are you sure you have a full comprehension of how the law and children s services works or do you only know it from inside the system as an underage individual
whoa man i understand you have had a sh t life but do you know their husband no just because you had a bad time doesn t mean you get a free pass to project your insecurities onto someone else who you don t even know you are the one who has the option to choose to work towards making your life better yeah the cps system in america sucks but is that all the fault of the commenter your replying to s husband nope it s the government that doesn t give a crap about kids in bad situations you had a crappy childhood but now it s you that has to be the one to self advocate and get yourself the help you need projecting your bad experiences onto some random person on the internet isn t the way to go about it
my husband worked that job for years before he left it he thought it did good for those children who were being physically or sexually abused but even then if they could he d still try to get them psychological help and see if the family could stay together because children would prefer to stay with their family even if it s f ked my fil is schizophrenic so my husband understands growing up around this as well you re being triggered by the letters cps or the words child services and not bothering to actually read the posts at no point did i say someone should call cps in fact i cautioned the op that cps could be called in their case their family _doesn t_ want that to happen as you ve said no one wants cps to get involved i agree you re trying to argue against me saying cps doesn t care but i m saying don t do things that will get cps called to the house because one doesn t want cps involved in the family you know they re like glue sticky and hard to remove i will fuck my husband thank you
no sex for them makes there lives as hard as possible yeah abstinence is a horrible burden it s right up there with abuse hunger neglect addiction childhood pregnancy lack of education and emotional trauma s take that kid out the house not cause his parents are letting him have sex but because he lives in a good house and has a beach house did i ever advocate taking either of them away through cps i advised the op to talk to her parents so the kids _wouldn t_ be taken by cps maybe you should slow down and actually read the posts you should go thank your husband for doing such a great fucking profession in this world i said my husband _worked_ see worked in child services the ed implies the verb is in the past tense this means my husband worked in this capacity in the past dude you need to deal with this cps trigger you re not able to even ascertain the rudiments of the conversation going on here because you read three letters strung together c p s
i m not sure why you need to downvote did i say i _was_ cps or that i advocate calling cps i don t recall either of these things i stated that the op s parents needed to deal with the issue in their home _before_ cps became an issue no one wants cps to become a part of their lives my husband quit after two years because he said it sucks your soul away he says cps is necessary for the child abusers harming their families or those who need financial help but families should try to never get cps involved if they can avoid it once they re involved it s hard to get them uninvolved
i m harassing you tilts head when i answered a question from what i knew then i asked my husband for his expertise and passed that information along that s considered harassment interesting
how did they harass you lmfao
it s a bad situation for sure no way should she allow the girl and her brother to stay in the beach house with just her in charge that s a recipe for disaster i wish her the best
op is the girl in question is

nta your dad is correct but it should have been him that told her so
nta dad is right and all of you should stop feeding this behaviour your mother should know this
younger child privilege is real as hell nta i feel like younger sister mom just mad because there s truth to what you re saying
nta your sister is the one who involved you mum was probably just embarrassed that you said the things she doesn t dare to say
my sister started saying that my mum always gave me more nta sister brought you into it so she can deal with you having your say in return
nta it sounds like your sister has some entitlement issues and you were just telling her the truth about how you earned your own money it s not your responsibility to coddle her and it s good that your dad supports you in this situation
nta neither you nor your father but your mother and sister are so it seems that your sister is your mother s golden child hopefully your sister mother will change their way of thinking you earned everything you have you worked for it she didn t
nta your mom needs to stop giving her money and tell her to get a job does she even do anything to earn that money like help around the house cause damn when i was that age i got a week and only after i did all my chores hearing her just get for shopping and complaining it not enough dang she s spoiled
nta she throws a fit and gets corrected typical sibling relationship
nta your sister is a typical popular teenager that always wants to be on top ugh
nta you did the correct thing
and now you see your mom is the root of this entitled bratty behavior nta
this is relatable as hell with me my mum has become a complete push over and let s my sister basically bully her she gets her way and lives a grand old life with all her rich friends yet me and my brother have had to work hard since the age we legally were allowed to and pay our way for a lot of things we got disciplined and given the cold shoulder for stepping out of line but with her my parents basically grovel at her feet of she raises her voice nta she needs a huge reality check as does your mum
nta as someone with many siblings sometimes you need your siblings brutal honesty in order to get a reality check
nta you re not parenting your sister you re correcting her assumptions about your teen years and she was being a brat about it so you were entitled to a little bit of a spicy reply to her
nta the entitlement needs to be nipped while she s still young
nta you re just telling her what you think and she needs to hear it i suspect your mum heard it as a criticism of her parenting
nta once i was old enough to work my parents rarely if ever helped me out with finances outside of necessities your sister needs to grow up and your mother needs to stop enabling her
nta she asked well accused is probably more accurate and you told her the truth other posters are right both your parents are correct it s not your job to parent her and she did need to hear it that said you do get to tell her what you think of her as a big sister and i feel that is what you did and only when prompted
nta dad is right and he needs to shut down your sister
your mom says you shouldn t parent her someone has to nta
nta i m with your dad your sister does need a reality slap
yta give her more money s but seriously how could this story possibly end in anything but an nta there s no ambiguous moral conflict here
my mum got angry at me saying i shouldn t parent her my dad however says that my sister needed a reality slap both your parents are correct here it s not your job to parent your sister and she probably did need a reality slap but it shouldn t have been from you but i wouldn t go as far as calling you an a hole but i would recommend you to stop trying to correct your sister it s your parents job and if they don t to it she will have a very difficult life but that s not your problem so nah
nta and unfortunately your mother is the ah she needs parenting classes or perhaps it s too late

nta your sister cornered you to complain and you gave it to her straight no you re not her parent but your mum needs to start parenting her instead of giving in to her if your parents had done that already she wouldn t be whining to you
nta you just told her the truth lol
nta
nta and the fact your dad sided with you showed that before you came here
nta you corrected her when she brought you into the conversation she throws tantrums because your parents let her
nta mom failed to parent and older sister gave a reality check good for you op better for little sister to learn now
my mum got angry at me saying i shouldn t parent her my dad however says that my sister needed a reality slap we can tell which parent has a coddled favourite here nta
nta
nta your parents will always favour her presumably your sister is pretty pretty and popular go hand in hand at that age the good news is that she s in for a rude shock after unless your parents are going to beggar themselves satisfying her requirements
nta your sister brought you into it and you responded
nta
well tell mom that if she parented her you wouldn t have to nta
nta she sounds spoiled as shit and needs a reality check
how you have a masters at you some super genius fr
nta
sounds like you are a loving brother telling sister about reality get a job or find a sugar daddy and kill him off before he realizes his mistake see how your mom likes that version of life sorry i should not have said that i have seen too many women with no way to support themselves in a bad relationship and had o stay because they had no other way of supporting themselves or found themselves out on the street making ends meet the only way left
nta i mean your parents are who have enabled her to be this entitled i mean if they have the means and are happy to be generous that s fine but if she has no gratitude then it s become a problem
nta you didn t say anything that wasn t true
nta but it kind of bugs me that your parents both parents gave you anything i mean college is expensive yes but who let their kid work different jobs and let them pay for everything they suck
nta you shouldn t need to parent her but here we are lol
nta mom is enabling brat to be brat dad sees the problem you are not parenting her you are correcting her incorrect victim narrative that you were spoiled more than her with the fact that you learned to work to get the stuff you want while she is just being spoiled and expects even more
nta as a fellow older sister with a mum who coddled the youngest sister if no one else will parent who s supposed to do it
nta for telling your sister your reality
nta i don t have the total picture but my kneejerk is your dad rocks
dad s right and mom is creating a monster
nta she brought her problems and her mouth to you not vice versa if she doesn t want schooled she needs to keep herself to herself that wasn t parenting that was trying to be a good sibling you told her exactly what she needed to do if she wants money not your fault that she d rather sit on her ass play the blame game
nta
nta she did need a reality check what she got was enough and asking for for a single shopping trip was bratty however your parents are somewhat of ahs because they seem to treat her better than you and she now expects it the both of you have had a right to some allowance growing up not giving you anything and making you go to work from a young age while also still being in school needing to focus on your education was wrong
nta sister brought you into the argument and you just corrected her
nta here sad to see you have to put up with what your parents have done keep it up she needs to see what life is really like
nta she brought you into the fight she s just pissed that you didn t agree to worship at her feet i hope it s not too late to turn her life around and make her a better person
nta
nta she s gonna have to figure out eventually that she s gonna have to work if she wants nice things unless your mother wants to take care of her for the rest of her life
nta but your parents are not doing your sister any favors she will continue to be an entitled brat
nta your mum is confused you weren t parenting her you were giving her a good swift kick in the backside i have done the same thing to my little brother on multiple occasions she s she s old enough to have a job and earn her own spending money your dad understands this and realizes they re at risk of having to support her the rest of her life if she doesn t feel the cold hard slap of reality now to prepare her for the future
nta your parents need to grow a spine
nta you weren t trying to parent her you were responding to her rant if your mom is mad that you were parenting her tell your mom you wouldn t need to if she had done the patenting job herself in the first place and taught your sister about earning her own money
how is that parenting her you didn t forbid her from going shopping you didn t ground her for being a brat you simply explained how the real world works how your world has worked the fact that your mom calls it parenting makes me think that she realizes she should have done that a long time ago nta
your mom is ta
nta sounds like your mom views your sister as the family princess your mom and dad need to have a talk about the kind of person your sister is turning out to be and how they can adjust their parenting to help her grow into a better adult
yeah i actually agree with the mom wholeheartedly here about op not being the parent it was not op s place to say that really however it s such normal behavior to check a sibling on something like this siblings call each other out all the time that i think it would be unreasonable for me to say op was being an ah
you re allowed to defend your own honor if someone claims you got things through means that aren t correct
it relates to me as hell my mom became a total jerk over and let my sister basically bully her he gets his way and lives a grand old life with all his rich friends yet me and my brother have had to work hard from the age we were legally allowed and pay our way for a lot of things
removed
sometimes your siblings need a brutal honesty check for reality
removed
younger child privilege what is this is it that younger children are given more of a pass on the rules or something
i feel though my sister feels she is in the right my mum gave her everything nothing ever happened to her i always had strict rules she never had to follow one example is she cheated on her boyfriend my mum didn t even look up and said he d get over it my ex cheated and she told me i had to have done something wrong
i disagree her sister brought her into this she wasn t even gonna entertain it until she was brought up and idk how other sibling relationships work but as an older sister why wouldn t she give guidance especially if her parents weren t just cause her parents suck doesn t mean a child doesn t deserve parenting like imagine being able to help your sister but you stay silent and let her turn out the way she is cause you re not her parent yea but she s her sister doesn t a sibling bond count for anything
i dont think she was being a parent she was just being a straight up older sibling as a teenager i would definitely listen to my older sister over my parents my parents could say something times and it not get through but as soon as my sister said it it would sink in
i disagree this was a discussion between the sisters younger one accused older one of getting preferential treatment because of what she has so older sister clarified the facts that she worked for everything she got and it wasn t handed to her so why not get off your butt and go earn some money mom is crippling younger daughter does she plan to financially support her for the rest of her life if not then she better make some changes and quick like have her get a job and learn the value of money nta and good for you you ve demonstrated a good work ethic and this will serve you well while your sister will view herself as a victim of circumstances brought on by her own behavior and mom s spoiling
i disagree if the parents were talking to the daughter and op butted into the conversation that would be him interfering she was complaining to him about how she wasn t getting anything and he had all these things provided to him and op corrected her assumptions and shared his opinion of her siblings have their own relationship and call each other out for behavior they don t like all the time without involving parents this is exactly that nta
nta
it was ops place to say because the sister had it coming when she antagonized op over money
mum probably wouldn t like it op mentioned that if mum was parenting op wouldn t need to check her sis
telling a younger sibling who is complaining that mom gives you more than i get that what she is saying isn t true and you got jobs to pay for the things you wanted instead of your parents giving you money isn t parenting them nta
i d be willing to bet mommy gives the brat most of the money the father just ends up finding out after the fact hence he wasn t too upset meanwhile mom was being criticized since she lets this happen
oh yeah but it should not have gotten to that point in the first place
if her parents dont do it who else beside op
even when she s saying something completely untrue about op that s what started it sis was saying their parents gave op way more than her this is untrue as op has been working to afford her own things since she was she pointed this out stating if sis wanted to have as much as op did when she was that age she should like op actually get a job too us just a blatantly obvious continuation of that sis dragged op into it to use as a prop to get her leverage to get more she just didn t think it through nta if i was op i couldn t just ignore someone trying to use me like that
yes as the baby of the family i can wholeheartedly agree that i had it a lot easier than my older siblings and even my older siblings
yep new parents are often strict on rules for the first kid then as more kids come along relax a bit as they know what they re doing now plus less strict with money as they re earning more relaxing become less strict as more kid come with some of the teaching behaviour aspect getting load of onto the older kids
yes the baby of the family is usually spoiled more and given more freedom i m the oldest and i can tell you my sister the baby is by far the most spoiled child in many ways
oh yeah i m the baby of my family and even i know i got a lot more crap and got away with a lot more stuff than my siblings i admit it nta op
yes usually the younger child or children will be given a pass on the rules the younger children are usually able to get away with things the older children can never get away with just to give a few examples here stay up way longer than the older children or no curfew get anything and everything they want break any and all the rules and the parents ignore the younger child the younger child children can wear what they want go where they want get all the money they want no questions asked i m sure their is more but that is basically it the younger children are spoiled get what they want etc
i don t understand the golden child philosophy i seriously don t it does nothing except bring bad things
those two experiences aren t really parallel if you had cheated on your ex and your mom said you were wrong and then your sister cheated on her ex and your mom said he would get over it that would be a fair comparison
you sound jealous which is fair but you also have to understand expecting you to pay for all that you do is the unfairness that s on your parents not your sister can t comment on the other stuff though parenting tends to change with time but the cheating stuff is too much thar being said does sound ungrateful and that should be taught out of her
yes her sister brought her into the argument looking for support but she could have just corrected her and explained about her jobs and own money op is four years older which makes the sister only when op begun her first job most 10yo especially those that are priviliged doesn t notice all details about an older sibling they see things but not how they re paid for op s initial explanation was fine telling her sister that she has worked for her own things but then she took it too far x200b i then told her mum and dad have been more than generous as a i bought all my own stuff while she demands stuff and has tantrums until she gets her way and that she should get off her stuck up butt stop being a brat and put effort into life let the parents be the parents
the sister is totally a brat and doesn t seem to respect the money she has been given but does she plan to financially support her for the rest of her life i don t know they financial situation they live in a nice area but for all we know they could be house poor she s also sixteen a lesson needs to be learned but still getting money from their parents isn t being financially dependent on them for the rest of her life she s a minor op probably shouldn t have had to be dependent on herself to buy all the things she did
op interfered because sister brought them into it while she was in the same space i m pretty sure if sister would have kept her name and situation she obviously either knows nothing about or is deliberately twisting around the facts op wouldn t have gotten involved i m pretty sure if you walked into a room and hear someone lying about your situation you would set them straight that s all that was being done along with a lot of truth bombing mom is an enabler and dad seems to be deferring to what mom says but they both need to be on the same page with raising this girl
her
so real by the time i came along my parents were older 40s and had spent the past years getting my older siblings to behave i still had rules to follow but way less than they did they also had more disposable income by the time i was a teenager so i definitely got a bigger allowance on the flip side when my siblings were buying their first houses my parents were guarantors for their loans when i was buying they could no longer do that having retired also my siblings had a lot of childcare time from my parents whereas in my case they no longer have as much energy for it so win some lose some

nta she should line up a job before quiting her present job if she lived on her own this would be her reality welcome to grown up
nta she clearly has a problem she needs to address and instead of addressing it she just wants to keep skipping work and making you pay for it
what i m guessing will be an unpopular opinion nta specifically because she won t see someone about her anxiety that literally causes her to be unable to go to work and function properly hating a job and physically making yourself too ill to go are very different things
you are nta she needs to seek help if it is affecting her like this she is responsible for her actions despite her illness if she isn t trying to manage it then it that shouldn t fall on you if she was doing everything she could and still couldn t manage that d be a different story
nta living together is like a trial run for long term commitment together whether marriage or just wanting to spend your lives together even being generous and assuming over a year means closer to two years she s spent a lot of it unable to work and refusing to do anything to help her uphold her side of the commitment if she was seeking help it would be different we support loved ones who are doing their best she is refusing to do anything to try to improve her medical situation and just expects you to cover for her i d say this is a trial that shows how your life will be if you stay with her when things get hard for her she wants you to pick up the pieces presumably she managed to pay her bills before she had you to step in it s up to you if that s something you can accept and if not a breakup now rather than dragging the relationship through resentment and acrimony is best
nta don t let her work you next year she ll have a meltdown and ask you to pay and then she ll want to get married and divorced and have you on the hook for life the tell is that she is withholding her savings
oof nta i wasn t sure up until you said she refuses to get help or treatment for her anxiety which is now affecting her ability to hold multiple jobs she needs to see a doctor or therapist
her savings are for specific things such as
nta also think long and hard about where this relationship is going if you marry and she decides not to work what then if you have a child and she says she wants to stay home what then throwing up her hands and saying i m quitting and using you as the financial backstop rather than taking responsibility for her mental health is an issue worth looking into
nta and good for you for putting your foot down what if she was single how would she address this issue relationships can be good because a partner can step in and help a situation but that should be temporary which already happened otherwise it can start to be abused which it sounds like your gf is doing now
nta you are correct in that she has an anxiety issue if she agreed to get help for it i might think differently but as it sits since she refuses the rent should stay as it is
speaking as someone who developed anxiety from a bad job situation and which worsened after another job situation nta your gf needs to go back into therapy and get her medication reviewed brain chemistry changes with different stressors and what worked in the past probably won t always she will probably need more support if the meds change but she needs to make the change first
i m going to say nta because she isn t addressing that her meds aren t working for her i ve gone through similar and it took time to get the right meds dosage that worked for me she needs to be willing to work on it or else she will never settle in a job without knowing other details like the length of the relationship i think you each need to discuss your expectations for the future and how finances will be dealt with
nta i was in a relationship where i paid for everything and he never got his shit together we re not together anymore i live a life where i can afford what i need of the time and i m never living with anyone ever again they can stay over for a week or so but that s it
nta this is now a pattern of behavior and if you cover it this time there will be a next time she needs to deal with anxiety and learn that you can t just start calling off whenever you don t feel like going to work bills still need to be paid
nta she is refusing treatment for a known issue besides which she took advantage of your agreement the first time one month is generous and supportive on your part to ask for more is too far on her part
nta you can t help so body who refuses to help themselves
nta you aren t married your finances aren t combined you don t owe her more however if you re going to be a serious long term couple you better figure out the money
nta what would she do if y all weren t together
nta i m not trying to read into her motivations or your relationship but i ve seen something like this before in my personal experience if it doesn t apply disregard my ex would look for jobs during the day i cut him considerable flack because he s physically disabled he can work but it can be hard to find the right place with accommodations he looked for a job for years he got one it was a typical ninety day situation you can t call out in the first three months he made it one month before he called out because he was tired got fired was shocked fast forward another year gets another job goes in fine for a month or so and then starts to make excuses as to why he can t go that day he s not well he s still tired he was up playing video games til but you know tired his co workers don t like him the drive is stressful etc etc etc he didn t want to work he wanted to stay home and have me work while he hung out with his friends and played video games i took him to counseling the doctor encouraged him to get out and volunteer nothing he did not want help i couldn t fix him if he didn t want fixing so i left him suprise as soon as he needed a job because i wasn t paying his bills and putting a roof over his head he had one and he makes sure to tell me every now and then how great it is and how well he s doing and how he has no problems getting to work every day he shares it almost too much if you understand what i m saying look again i m not saying your girl is like that and she really may have anxiety problems but if she refuses help if she doesn t want to get better and just wants to keep feeling this way you can t help her and if she just wants you to foot the bill something s up you gotta stop it before you get in too deep and it takes extreme measures like it did with me
nta it sounds like she s taking advantage of you and this will only escalate the longer youre together
nta you had an agreement and were willing to bend a little to help but it seems like she s trying to take advantage of that things might be different if she was taking steps to address her issues but she s not keep in mind though this is probably the first step to the end of the relationship for good or bad
nta maybe she should ask the landlord and utilities companies if you can only pay of the bills instead of expecting for you to take over the cost
meds alone don t always help she s being treated for depression not anxiety completely different things if anxiety is causing her to not be able to work then yes she needs to see the doctor it s awful that she expects you to pick up her slack nta your girlfriend needs a reality check you probably need one too about your gf if she s not going to get help this behavior will only continue you ll be taken advantage of
she has a spotty record nta
get out while you can bro
nta if she wont see a therapist to help the problem than she is being selfish to expect you to cover her half when its ust going to continue to happen
nta it d be one thing if she lost her job and that s why she was looking for a new one but just wanting to quit that s on her i have diagnosed anxiety get incredibly stressed and beaten down about my job no matter which job it is usually as a result and have managed to keep this one for years because the only alternative would be placing undue hardship on loved ones and now i have enough money saved that i really could quit and easily get hired somewhere else before running out of money wanting to quit and then just expecting everyone around her to pick up the bills is selfish like i said it d be different if she actually lost her job for reasons outside her control but wanting to quit is her responsibility to plan for
nta and maybe you need to reconsider this living situation
nta run please run
nta you already were very considerate by covering more than your share for months she needs to match that and be considerate of you and the additional burden you took on to help her by making some effort to solve the problem that led to this whole issue in the first place yes of course it s normal and good for couples to just do things to help out their partner even if it s a burden to them because they love them and want to help them without it becoming too transactional that would have been the case if the first incident was just a one time thing but now it s become a recurring thing and she s expecting you to again take on the extra burden caused by her problem that she s taken no responsibility for fixing or preventing it s not a favor it s just unfair i understand getting help for mental health issues is scary and hard i ve been there but there s a difference between being supportive and considerate vs someone just shoving off their problems onto you
nta she really needs to get over herself and see a specialist immediately i m wondering if it s social anxiety how is she in a group does she go out with friends i m asking because i know someone else i know is like this he can t work has gotten to the point where he can barely leave the house my point is it can get worse again nta she needs to admit she needs help
i have severe anxiety too therapy helped me cope with it your girlfriend doesn t want to go to therapy because it s easier for her to just stay home and avoid her responsibilities her anxiety may indeed be extreme but it also sounds like she doesn t want to work i wouldn t be surprised if she eventually says that her anxiety is so bad that she can t work anymore but there s only so much you can do if she refuses to pay her fair share reconsider living with her nta
nta it was reasonable to help her once but this is a pattern she either needs to get her meds adjusted or learn some coping strategies to deal with her work related anxieties our body brain chemistry changes over time so meds should be reviewed regularly how is her physician writing her a prescription for the medication without completing a yearly re evaluation is she on other medications that may be negatively interacting with the anti depressants she needs to get re evaluated or she needs to learn new coping skills bottom line she needs to pull money out of savings if she can t afford her rent out of her wages
nta mental health issues arent her fault but her responsibility and its high time she gets help or looks for a less stressful job it was nice that you helped her out that one time but she cant make it a habbit what if she was single who would she mooch off of then her parents dont let her take advantage of you thats not fair
nta kinda you need to explain to her the end game and the entire thinking here how does this conflict end what if she drains her savings what if she just refuses to pay is this a deal breaker in your relationship can you break your lease i think you agree that if she seeks help you will help cover part of the expenses until she s stabilized you also need to talk about the plan if she takes years to stabilize or never does and i think you need to lay out what will you do if she does not seek help i would also be open minded she could ve jumped from one horrible job into another one that s just showing it s true colors or she may no longer be able to work in whatever industry because it makes her crazy if you both agree that changing jobs industries working hours etc has a good shot of resolving the problem you pursue that instead of psychological help and the key is to be gentle firm and clear i need a partner i can trust to manage their health and wellness i can t make you do anything but i am asking you and if this is something you will not do i need you to understand i can t stay in this relationship for my own well being focus on what you will do what you need and not judging blaming you don t want to coerce her into treatment that s infantilizing and breeds resentment
nta but she might come to resent you what you should think about is income disparity yes i know you mentioned your incomes are similar but similar is a broad term and whether that is fairly split and who is doing more of the household stuff or taking care of pets ideally you want to sit her down and talk to her about her seeing a therapist not because you want her bringing more money in but rather because you love her and want her to get better maybe even review how you both feel supported in the relationship your stance is a bit more like a roommate s rather than a loving partner s what if something happens to you and you cannot pay she will have the same right to refuse to cover the bills and she won t be ta either but you know where i m going with this
info how do your incomes compare proportionally speaking
info how much do each of you earn
what are your incomes income to rent ratios nta regardless since she refuses to get help for herself
nta but are you prepared to pitch in more if she does get help getting help can be intense med changes can be awful i was suicidal due to a med change last year it doesn t fix things in the blink of an eye if you aren t prepared for this go your separate ways relationships aren t always over the course of a relationship you are going to be etc i don t think this is about the money
bwah a difficult one as it is complex would say nta but can be handeled differntly gf need to get therapy jus tmedicaitons alone will never be enough that usually means lifelong ab use of medication and addiciton we always paid equal amount into the joint account f e which was used for all joint expenses so if i earn more i pay more but equally in but this is secondary get your gf get therapy and off antidepressant under medical oversight anxiety is not treated by antidepressant medications you can say you will pay bit more if she gets treatment therapy

nta
nta gf needs to set her new job before she quits the old one take a good look at your relationship can you deal with this if it keeps happening on her if she won t get help
nta she s an adult and she needs to stick to the agreement if her medical condition is stopping her from functioning she needs to address that
nta move out as soon as the lease is up she s a user and doesn t respect you save yourself
nta
nta your gf needs professional help if she refuses it s on her that doesn t excuse her from her responsibilities if your gf can t or won t pull her weight perhaps you need to move out on your own
nta you re nor married and didn t sign up to pay her bills
nta
nta she can help herself she can change her medication and talk to someone she just doesn t want to so she can pay
nta she s got as pattern of behavior and she s counting on you covering her
nta i believe in helping people when they are doing everything they can to help themselves but your gf is not doing that she is not going into work because she is anxious so she should see a doctor and seek therapy instead her solution is to have you pay her bills she isn t even going to use her own savings so no she needs to put some effort in first
nta
she needs to see a doctor
nta she won t get seen for it cause then she won t have the excuse not to work
nta and you may even be enabling her which means it could get worse in the future as she clearly has issues with working in general
nta
nta honestly this is becoming a frequent reoccurrence don t see it getting better she wants you to bankroll everything and refuses to seek professional help i would end things
nta idk if i ll get downvoted for even saying this i ve had personal experiences with mental struggles and there are people out there who will exaggerate or straight up fabricate their symptoms to use as an excuse to not hold up some sort of responsibility and not just to get out of working it could be anything really i m not saying this is what your gf is doing because i don t know the ins and outs of your relationship or her personality but just be aware that there are people who do have some sort of mental health struggle but it s not to the extent that it s on the level of being debilitating and they could be more productive but they just choose not to hope you figure out what s best for your life good luck
nta your gf needs to get some help keep encouraging her to go and get evaluated if she continues to blow you off then you know where you stand that she is not interested in getting better but simply in someone else taking full care of her including all expenses
nta can you see where this is going
nta when people repeatedly show you who they are a user believe them
nta your girlfriend lost her leg in this fight as soon as she became unwilling to try and get better if you love her be patient as she s clearly going through a hard time however helping her when she has no desire to heal will only burn you out she needs to accept that while it is an uncomfortable and scary process her life could be so much better if her brain was working with her instead of against her she needs professional help to get her there clearly her meds aren t doing what they should be it s very common for ssri s most popular category of daily depression anxiety meds to need tweaking changing every so often some people are lucky and take the same dose for forever but i don t actually know anyone who has had that luck the trial and error game of finding the right meds is awful remember that if when she does come around she will need your support it isn t an easy job to be the partner of someone who suffers with mental illness be kind to yourself as well good luck op
nta your girlfriend needs help
nta drugs stop working after awhile and the dosage needs to be adjusted having anxiety to the point of daily impairment is something she should want to improve if affordability for proper care is an issue i d offer to cover the office visit since it will lead to an improved quality of life but subsidizing her while she refuses to take action to be healthy is just enabling her
nta she s using you
nta you should ask yourself if you are prepared to cover of her finances that is where i see this going if she persists in this cycle of being sick from work if she thinks you will take care of her completely it lets her continue to mismanage her depression and not responsibility for her own health the fact she won t consider therapy speaks volumes ask yourself honestly what benefits you receive from this relationship it may be time to end the relationship or at least move into your own place while you rethink the situation
that s not a relationship that s an arrangement
i think it depends on how serious the relationship is if you intend to get married then you guys should be a team where one picks up the others slack if the other can t perform and vice versa like if you were married and she got physically ill which made it difficult to work would you insist on her contributing just as much a mental illness should be looked at no different than a physical one
nta her anxiety is interfering with her ability to function that is the exact right reason to go to a doctor for help
nta she is not entitled to your money period end of story please consider moving out or this will be the rest of your life
plus there s no anti depressant out there that is substantially better than a placebo the data usually show mild improvement at best a therapist may be more effective at teaching her coping methods to deal with her mental illness and if she refuses consider if you can put up with it for a life time
yes so unpopular it s of the consensus
we support loved ones who are doing their best this no amount of love makes up for a drain whether it s financial or emotional without effort on the loved one s part all you re doing is enabling
depends on where you live but usually it isn t for life just the length of the marriage unless you have kids then it s child support separate to any spousal support also it varies on property investments prior to marriage some places is the spouse gets half the day you marry some are not all great reasons to have a prenup though prenups can t overwrite child support moral of the story is know the financial impacts before tying the knot
this is the key indicator she has the money but won t touch savings that can be reasonably be assumed to be for fun expenses
i have sat her down and mentioned therapy outside of talks about money when i have been off work and had less income i have still paid the and just had less money to spend for the month in terms of the house it is a fairly even split but i would say i probably do slightly more i work from home so i tend to do most of the cooking then i ll do things like laundry during my lunch break etc
our full time incomes are both pretty similar
irrelevant they aren t married
yeah so our full time incomes are both pretty similar
i ll be a lot more willing to help if my gf gets help to an extent obviously since i can t afford to help with any more than i have done previously
this is wrong can you cite this
well this seems wildly unscientific but okay
especially since her current issue seems to be work related anxiety and anti depressants won t solve that problem she really needs to speak to a professional about this especially if the anxiety is new since she went on the anti depressants in addition to developing coping methods a therapist could help her get reasonable accommodations at work to help mitigate her anxiety that are better than just calling in sick

or you take a look at when this was commented and look at other comments that were posted the same time and you would see that the other votes were nta but they were downvoted so it was an unpopular judgment when it was written
how sad is your life that you have to throw shade at strangers on the internet for not being psychic lmao
thanks okay well in that case you have set a boundary here good for you and ultimately her nta she needs to get better for herself and for your relationship
she s not taking your well being into account you haven t mentioned if you love her and if so do you like her do you feel responsible and that you must care for her you re giving quite a bit and not just monetarily she s not being fare you must take care of yourself
personally id split it based on income find out the percentage you both earn and split the bills like that
not irrelevant just because you aren t married doesn t mean you can t split your bills evenly if you re cohabiting if one were to earn of the household income and the other only earned it s hardly fair to split them
just saw your edit does your girlfriend s psychiatrist not require any check in appointments when prescribing her meds not even once or twice a year
absolutely nta then it was nice of you to cover that first month even nicer to cover all months anything more than that is just being taken advantage of
good good this shit is hard i m sorry you are going through it with her but she does need to take responsibility for her health
the issue is that a lot of people develop a tolerance or rely entirely on ssri s to treat their depression when the fact is that therapy is an integral component of treatment because depression is a whole brain disease not just depletion of serotonin engagement in emotion processing and mindfulness exercises with antidepressant therapy may modulate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hyperactivity and subsequent neuroinflammation associated with depression some practitioners say that the ssris nsris facilitate engagement in therapy especially in the severely depressed the rest is up to you evidence is always mixed because mental health conditions are heterogenous but there are functional mri findings that support this theory
how sad is your life that you have to ask strangers how sad their life is on the internet lmao
they were the ones who assumed it would be unpopular what was that based on it could not be a more popular opinion

nta you had one clear request and he didn t give an f about it now he s calling you childish because you held to a clear limit when he blew off your request best thing about dating is that it s one big long character test you re definitely learning things about his character
nta you had a pretty easy condition to give to him about your car and he disrespected your wishes directly i imagine at least half of this is about trust but the other half is that this feels oddly targeted to me it just gives very much i should be able to do what i want without any consequences and you can t stop me the fact that he continues to double down as if that s ever convinced anyone to change their mind is very telling i m not sure how long you ve been with this guy or if he s otherwise not shown any other major issues but i d read the incident last month and his continued inability to understand that he should respect your rules about your property as a red flag
nta sounded like he intentionally made the dog as smelly as possible to be petty find a new boyfriend
nta and i say this as a huge dog person you allowed him to use your car with one stipulation and he violated that you can t trust him to respect your wishes when it comes to your property
nta think long and hard if you want to tie your life to someone who stomps on your boundaries
nta you had one rule he ignored said rule he is now facing the consequence of his own actions
nta he chose not to respect a perfectly reasonable and logical boundary you set and is pissed off that there are actual consequences for his choice this says something about his character and his expectations of you he expected you to let him get away with it he s pissed that you didn t just abandon your boundary because he either thinks the boundary is ridiculous it s absolutely not or he thinks you shouldn t have boundaries with him either way his lack of respect for the boundary and for your decision to enforce it is unacceptable stand firm on this boundary i wouldn t let him drive your car again until he proves to you that he understands why he was wrong genuinely apologizes and proves that he s capable of respecting you and your boundaries if he refuses to respect other boundaries i would rethink the relationship
nta your feelings about the dog are irrelevant what matters is his blatant disregard for your one rule in my 20s i allowed my now ex boyfriend to use my car despite the fact that he ignored all of my requests when it came to the use of it it was red flag among many but looking back i really should have paid more attention the guy is already living in your house and now he wants to assert dominance over your vehicle it s not as if the dog had to be rushed to the vet a trip to the park is a luxury when i m sure that the outdoors exist within walking distance of your home it may seem like an overreaction to some but i think this is cause for serious contemplation about the relationship
nta some people have few boundaries and those people seem to not respect the boundaries of those who do your request was not unreasonable maybe someday you will trust him with your car again maybe not but it s his fault that he s in this predicament not yours op good for you for standing up for yourself
nta your car your rules the fact that he didn t follow the one rule you had shows that he has no respect for your boundaries or your possessions if his truck is the vehicle for doggy dates then he should have just waited until he had his truck back he owes you an apology and should also pay to have your car s interior cleaned professionally to get rid of the odors
nta you had a rule about how your vehicle should be used and he didn t respect it dude needs to get over himself
nta he agreed to follow one rule and then broke it and clearly will again so he has to suffer the consequences of his actions
nta
nta but what are you getting from a man who is irresponsible with his own things and blatantly disrespects you
nta your bf should have paid to get your car detailed once he realized the boundary he thought want a big deal was in fact a big deal instead he doubled down on being an entitled jerk not a good look in a long term partner
nta but he owes you to have your vehicle professionally cleaned
it s ironic that he is calling you childish but he is the one getting upset and whiny about a boundary you set that he ignored and broke all while expecting you to forget that and let him use your car seems childish of him to do that nta your car your rules he has shown he doesnt respect your rules so he gets to figure something else out as a result

nta he is probably also not on the insurance so he shouldn t drive it to begin with but he trashed it and it s your car so tbh how dare he he can get a loaner or uber for a day
nta but maybe he and the dog should move and you should meet a guy who respects you
your car your rules if he respected you he would deep cleaned the car before you got in it you are not responsible for his car issues
nta
dog lover here and i say you are not tah you had one request and he chose to ignore it
nta your boyfriend doesn t seem to have respect for your thoughts and opinions and has no boundaries when it comes to private property is this really someone you want to have as your life partner if you still want to be with him you guys need some serious conversations about rules for your home possessions and the relationship overall you might benefit from seeing a counselor or a mediator
nta you had one rule and he broke it he should pay for a full interior detail on your car to help get rid of the smell
i ve been with him for like a year and months at this point he moved in months ago and honestly so many things have changed i can t tell if it s because i m not used to living with someone this closely but a lot just isn t setting well with me
him and his dog live with me in my house i never said i don t want to be around his dog i m entitled to have my own space that isn t overwhelmed by smells and hair though and that s a perfectly reasonable boundary
i mean idk about you and your experience with dating or living with a partner but in my experience it is in the first six months to a year or so of living with a partner that you start to really learn who they are it s part of why i always advocate for people to at least live with their person of choice for a year or two before they decide to do anything like getting married there s just something about the compatibility aspect of living with a person in a relationship that can be important such as respect for what items they own having at least a similar idea of how everyone wants the home kept in regards to cleanliness getting an eyeball on how they deal with stressful situations and finances all very important things
part of the reason to live with someone before committing more permanently is to see what s hidden behind the curtain your bf sounds dismissive and disrespectful of you please believe him when he is showing you his truth
nta but sounds like your bf got used to the hair and smells and for your sanity he needs to learn to groom the dog or take it the groomers regularly for a good blow out so it s shedding less
i would think the part where op says he replied with it s not a big deal ensured he never gets to use op s vehicle again he just doesn t see her requests or concerns as valid

back out rather than doing his pizza party at school invite some of the kids home
nta what psycho insists on individually boxed pizza slices
nta surprising how stupidly entitled people can be do the pizza party just not at the school
nta that s ridiculous cancel and tell them why or you could do a party for him outside of school hours you could even do something in the school playground after hours with exactly the pizza you had planned in the first place happy birthday to your boy
e it was always a nta i was just curious lol info who s making those demands lol like other teachers or admin
nah they re forced to make it the lamest party ever because of dietary restrictions and preferences but gluten free and vegan pizza is made with what hopes and wishes and soy your son doesn t even want it anymore so it s fine to say that s not what you signed up for
ywnbta isn t this a textbook example of the old adage no good deed goes unpunished the preposterous set of restrictions has turned this potential party from a happy event into a farce
nah it s the school policy that s nobody s fault just don t do the pizza party
nta i feel bad for kids these days the whole zero tolerance bullshit and beyond has ruined a lot it seems some of it is justified most of it seems like people who aren t capable of writing policies with reasonable exceptions
you will have to forgo the school based party nta sorry for your son
nta the school is run by morons with their ridiculous requirements
ywnbta tell the teacher that unfortunately you re unable to follow through with the expectation have something with family and friends and just relax gosh must be fun having parties with the who came up with those specifications
nta frankly that party doesn t sound like much fun i know my kid wouldn t eat gluten free vegan pizza anyway better off to just invite his classmates to a birthday party outside of class
nta lol beggars can t be choosers if they want some complicated meal they can pay for it
i would ve responded w never mind i m sure they can figure out why you changed your mind the fact that your son is no longer interested makes it easier to be succinct
gluten free vegan pizza where each slice is individually packaged and water that sounds really depressing nta you offered to do something nice they got picky and demanding tell them you re sorry you can t make that work with your budget then invite just a few kids from the class out for a regular pizza party for your kids birthday
nta the party the school wants is not the party your son wants they can have the one they want on their own dime and you can invite some friends to do what he wants it s his day
nta at all i would also question it with admin since it is a new policy if they still insist on this and i am a parent of a child with multiple food allergies so i do understand having a food safety in place but not to this extreme i would explain to the teacher that this unfortunate exceeds your budget and you can not provide the gf df pizza the school demands you do if they insist you send in something to uphold your promise send in some annie s fruit or made good granola that is free of the big allergens
nah the school had to come up with a food policy without much notice and since they are the ones who would be liable if someone got sick or if they violated a student s plan assuming us insert whatever the equivalent is if a different country it is unsurprising that they want more restrictions rather than fewer but if the restrictions are too onerous for you you are not an asshole for saying you can t comply and therefore will not be providing pizza
wtf is gluten free vegan pizza isn t that just tomatoes nta
how insane of the school to tell you how to bring the food you offered to bring i would tell them their demands for the pizza party you offered to throw are outrageous and you are no longer willing to do it if the only way is their way nta
ywnbta have a pizza party for your son after school those restrictions are probably in place for a reason but that s absolutely not what you signed up for you signed up to spend not
to donate a pizza party was the plan for his son s class a gesture that was thoughtful but now the situation s turned into a mass the school had different requests and it s causing quite a fuss gluten free and vegan pizzas and no juice only water for the class the price has now jumped up and the boxes are a problem too for a simple pizza party it s become quite the to do the purpose of the celebration is now lost in the fray and the son s lost interest so the question s asked today would it make them the asshole to back out and cancel the party or should they go along with it and still feel unhappy and sorry in the end it s their decision to donate or to rescind but it s important to remember that kindness shouldn t come with strings
nta beggars can t be choosers and i highly doubt every kid in that class is vegan gluten free if anything maybe have one of the pizzas accommodate those issues but to demand all of that is wild and the entitlement is real
nta this isn t something you can accommodate with your budget i could understand if they asked for only cheese pizza so no arguments could be had over someone not getting their favorite thinking tomatoes and bell pepper are a weird combo but these restrictions are likely why they don t have pizza parties in the first place it s okay to take a step back and say you can t comply with those parameters because it s prohibitively expensive and ask if you can instead invite the whole class to a birthday party outside of school more hassle and maybe more pizza because omg my parents never once came to a classmate s birthday party and when did that even start but you can specify what will be offered so parents will know if it lines up with bobby and sarah s dietary restrictions and send their own food along if they like
ywnbta nta it is reasonable to back out your son is in agreement and they sucked the fun out of a great idea consider thank you for responding to our inquiry to pay for a pizza party for class x to celebrate my son s birthday unfortunately the party won t occur since the requested accommodations increased this activity and the type of pizza was not found favorable to several students
nta beggars cannot be choosers when they are not paying for it their demands are too costly
burn the school down celebrate with the two pizzas you originally chose
school sets policies to protect the children and to protect themselves from liability if a child with celiac disease it s the pizza and get sick the school is liable if a child is lactose intolerant and eats pizza with the cheese the school is liable if a child is vegetarian and their parents find out the school is liable a lot of schools no longer have soda or juice just water some schools no longer allow peanuts anywhere in the school because a child might suffer anaphylactic shock from contact
of course nta you want to donate what you can afford when they want to more than double the price you are free to say that doesn t work for you i would ask some other parents and the principal about this who expects pizza to be vegan even gluten free for the entire class is a bit much pizza is a staple of school lunches i would be surprised if they no longer serve those because some kids are gf so if there is gluten in the lunch room on what grounds can they say they don t accept it maybe they insist you have a gluten free option for the kids that need it but for the entire class naaah
schools have policies for food being brought in based upon the students in the class there might be a reason they are making those requests because it could be a student in that class could have celiac disease and another could be a vegan in those cases it s a reasonable request to ensure everyone gets a slice the individual boxing is a bit much and doesn t really make sense to me regardless nta back out tell them their requests are unreasonable when you re providing the food
soy products are bad for boys men might aswell feed testosteron to girls and warch them grow beards

nta they are being demanding and your child no longer wants it tell them the plan is off and create a celebration that your child does want
nta have a pizza party at home with his friends
nta ridiculous rules invite the whole class for the pizza party at your house inform the parents what will be served happy birthday to your son
doesn t sound eco friendly
some school boards have the rule in place due to covid protocols because it limits the amount of people touching the food
not even sure where you would get individually boxed pizza slices
the teacher spoke with administration and they came up with this impromptu policy for food being brought in for events for the children
speaking as a mother of a celiac lactose allergy child gluten free vegan is made with sadness just kidding but i agree this is not what the child wanted i would back out also
no most crusts have gluten so they need special crusts too
not really an applicable use of that term as the school isn t the one asking that pizza be brought in the policy isn t you must bring in pizza and it must be this the policy is if you bring in pizza it must be this and the reason is allergies and student safety not entitlement weirdly angry take
this is not true
seems bogus lol since it s admin i d just drop it probably not worth the headache especially if your kid s not too passionate about it anymore if you feel like explaining yourself hey this got pretty complicated and expensive let s see if we can work together to figure something out for next year is a response no human could find unreasonable great thought though my man
i d be scared of vegan pizza having soy or sesame seed oil in it somewhere those allergens are becoming more and more prevalent and while i personally enjoy pineapple on my pizza i m the antichrist whatever my fianc is mildly allergic so i only get it when i don t want someone stealing my leftovers the administration is just trying to head off a lawsuit with this bonkers shit and i understand i work in insurance not this kind most of what i touch is boat related rental car fleets security guards and hoas my job is weird if you still want to do something for at school sending cheap crayons and coloring book sheets for everyone to use could be kind of cool art parties are a thing my adult friends have done byo project and you could always ask someone at staples or whatever how much it would be to make little booklets of pictures as an end of year gift for the classmates or the free print services as zero children will mind advertising
do kids not bring in candy bars to share with their classmates on their birthday any more
yeah i d just drop it completely
as someone who does not eat gluten i agree my non vegan cauliflower crust pizza is sad a vegan gluten free pizza must be depressing
oh no my heart goes out to you and your child i hope there are lots of delicious options for that baby but yeah pizza just doesn t sound like one of them if the only authentic part of it they can have is the sauce
i have had one and only one nice vegan and gluten free pizza vegan coworker made it and from my understanding it was expensive as hell tiny as hell and even then i d rather just have normal pizza ingredients were for a single 6inch pizza there is a lot of good vegan and gluten free food pizza is not it
it was a hyperbole friend i am not that big an idiot
is it not strogen in soy products sorry cant remember what its called in english the female variant of testosterone
yeah my kids school has rules about bringing in food personally for this reason valentines always had a reminder not to give out food items
or cupcakes bet those would have to be vegan and individually wrapped too i can kinda get the individually wrapped thing i mean i think it s stupid but there is at least a logical ish argument for it but why vegan
soy products have phytoestrogens its plant estrogen its chemical structure is like estrogen so i believe it can attach to estrogen receptors in humans but it isnt actually the same chemical its like a house made of wood and a house made of stone they are both houses but the things they are actually made of are different theres no evidence that phytoestrogens have any kind of negative effects on humans male or female
super different from when i grew up i was born in but it kind of seems like everyone who had really bad allergies back then just died there were no epipens and i think we ll eventually figure out why allergies are so deadly now when they didn t seem to be before either unearthing new data suggesting it was part of the high childhood mortality rates in the past or us now having micro plastics in our bodies fucking shit up all i know is that i checked in with hr at my office to say that i regularly bring in a pb j for lunch on my in office days and to contact me about it if it s a problem to keep them in the communal fridge or eat in the break room i m personally allergic to oranges but unless orange oil or juice touches my skin i m fine we have a gym on the first floor with showers and soap so the worst case scenario is me looking bedraggled leaving early to go work from home not anaphylaxis
i actually googled it after your response and youre right it said when eaten in normal amounts it isnt dangerous but as with everything it goes downhill from there
you should google how wrong they got it about expectant new mothers avoiding peanuts in the early 2000s
as to your comment about figuring out why allergies are so deadly now i wonder if it s linked to your comment above it people used to die more often from them in years past so i wonder if we can assume there were fewer adults passing on those genes to their children
were we supposed to avoid or eat them nobody mentioned it in the 90s peanut butter sandwiches no jelly was one of the only things i didn t violently puke after
they said avoid and it didn t turn out well

nta your son is a bully your wife sounds like a piece of work
nta and thank you for not buying into the boys will be boys bullshit mentality your son absolutely needs to understand that actions have consequences and it doesn t sound like your wife will instill that
nta this is disgusting and i m glad you re not accepting this as normal see dogfight early 1990s film your wife s comment about good genes i am speechless
nta that is not a harmless prank it s downright cruel also i hate your wife and your in laws you might want to look into what she tells your kids as it sounds like he acquired this mindset from her and her parents
nta imagine if you hadn t found out about this prank and the girl your son s pranking actually feels as if someone has feelings for her and begins to develop feelings too only to find out the whole relationship is a scam he felt sorry for my cousin he was mature enough to understand to not pull the prank any further bs if your son was mature enough he d not pull a prank so hurtful in the first place she simply said that won t happen because she has good genes also what the hell s up with your wife please don t take back your son s grounding op
your wife and mil are ok with how your son treats girls like that that s pretty disgusting nta you need to stop that right away
you are nta but your wife really is wow glad she won the gene lottery bc she lost the empathy and kindness lotteries i would have done the exact same thing to my son too the entire world needs to realize that looks really are only skin deep and however many surgeries one has to try to change it it doesn t i hope you re questioning your wife pretty hard rn at least your son is still a child
this prank is in no way harmless definitely nta
nta raise your boys to respect woman i think you handled this appropriately from waiting to speak to him not embarrass him in front of friends to a fair and appropriate punishment boys will be boys can still hold true but not at the expense of a poor girls feelings nta and perfect parenting
nta your wife and her parents however holy cow good genes hurting their baby wtaf did you hear about the youtube prankster moron who got shot by the guy he was pranking
my son argued back that it was just a prank that wouldn t hurt anyone yeah except that girl she simply said that won t happen because she has good genes well now we know why your son thought it was acceptable ground him for two weeks he said that i shouldn t have any say in this when the whole thing had nothing to do with me yeah that s how being grounded works i was grounded for skipping school my parents had nothing to do with that mil and fil are blowing up the family group chat about how i m hurting their baby for normal teenage boy behaviour tell them to grow up it s two weeks of grounding it s not like you re planning to humiliate him by having someone who has no actual interest in him ask him out nta
nta your son sucks and is a bully i was the target for this kind of prank a lot in school you know what happened i ended up withdrawn with horrible self esteem not dating anyone because i was afraid it was a joke too and getting groomed by a man years older than me because he was the only person who wasn t family who told me i was beautiful and treated me like a women i was when he started this and at he took my virginity only showing up for the act and leaving right after then we spent the next years with a friend s with benefits type relationship it wasn t until i had the opertunity to move across the country that i realized that was all he was after a pretty young girl to get his rocks off with because no one else in his age group was interested in his alcoholic ass another red flag i ignored and now because of all of this i m in therapy my self esteem is still horrible but i m working on it and even now fricken decades later i still don t believe people when they try to ask me out or hit on me this kind of shit sticks with you forever after a silly prank like this next time someone tells you it s just boys being boys or typical teenager jokes ask them would they react this way if someone did this to their daughter to his sister to them why is it ok when it probably just effected that poor girls entire life this was not a prank it was basically a cruel hazing your kid was paid to do that girl needs a genuine apology from him and his friends but since i doubt that ll ever happen grounding him to make him understand what he did was horrible it as good as you re gonna get
nta you shut down some hateful abuse wife mil and fil what s wrong with shutting down hateful abuse don t you realize the hideous statement boys will be boys has been trotted out to excuse assault and rape it s best to curtail hateful behavior from the get go so it doesn t develop into something worse if a son of mine did something like that i d be so ashamed i do not understand why your family members are defending him wife mil and fil what s wrong with telling someone especially a relative that it s awful to be mean to other people and the fact that your wife thinks your daughter won t be harassed in her life because she has good genes is stunning naive nta
omg this isn t normal and people who are saying it is are opting themselves as bullies
nta your wife and in laws are douchey i feel sorry for you since it seems like you ll be the only one who knows the right thing it will be an uphill battle
nta your wife and fil are the ahs here it is not acceptable to prank people like this shame on your wife for making excuses for him just because he s a boy doesn t mean he can mistreat people like this for assuming that she s too pretty for this to happen to her you re not hurting him at all and this prank is bullying imo
nta it s only a prank if everyone laughs asking someone out on a prank is hurtful bullying and can destroy a person s self esteem not exaggerating that teenagers have suicided due to being the victim in situations like this it doesn t matter how you found out the fact that your son was involved and you know about it is enough to give out a punishment your wife is totally in the wrong boys will be boys is a glib statement excusing terrible misogynist behaviour
as a former ugly fat nerdy girl whatever the boys felt was a qualifying target thank you op i had a little glow up but that damage lasts forever nta you re a great father and all that chatter shows they re ta
wouldn t hurt anyone you can tell your son that i a 40yo woman vividly remember being asked to prom by one of the popular boys only to find out the entire thing was a huge joke and everyone was laughing about it
nta your wife is a walking red flag though
nta your wife sounds kinda self hating shallow anti woman too
nta any type of prank on someone with whom you are not friends is wrong many pranks on people with whom you are friends are wrong too
nta i don t see that you mentioned your gender so i m going to assume that this is a hetero relationship you re the father of those children and are a man i could not imagine the audacity of saying to a man who is appalled by a boy s behavior boys will be boys
nta in fact yath you are the hero boys should learn to be good men fighting the good fight shouldn t be such a fight you are dadding right and your son years down the line will thank you
nta i ll be banned if i write my opinion of your wife
nta this is the appropriate response to finding out your son might do something cruel to a classmate your wife s attitude is concerning and your in laws need to step back significantly if your son was truly mature he d understand the gravity of what his plan could do to someone hold the line op and make sure your sin knows this behavior is not funny and not acceptable
nta that s not a prank it s bullying
nta your son is disgusting this happened to me in high school and it was super embarrassing i was basically the laughing stock of the school your son needs to learn his actions have consequences and that he should respect women
nta but you are married to one and she is raising one in her image and likeness good luck with that you ll need it
nta i find myself filling with rage when i read about how harmless all this bullshit is grounding your son puts him on the receiving end good for you
nta i am 60f and i still remember boy schoolmates insulting my appearance and mocking me from 5th grade on i am not beautiful but i m not a gorgon either and i have good genes what is said to that girl now may scar her for life my god your wife s attitude is offensive
nta ask your wife if because of your daughter good genes that a boy touches your daughter butt without her permission will it be okay for boys will be boys
nta got to say it s nice to see good parenting in these posts cuz man are they rare you did everything right giving him proper respect by not bringing it up in front of his friends and then reasoning with him about it yeah pranks happen and boys will be boys but he needs to learn there limits teach him to respect women your wife s response is pretty immature so basically it s ok for that to happen to someone with bad genes come on red flag
it is horrifying that your wife and her whole family of origin has this unscrupulous moral code would it be boys will be boys when it happens to your daughter your inlaws need to keep their faces out of your business as they are wrong and have warped morals you are a good dad you are correcting your son before he really hurt someone as for your wife s parenting not a good one there nta
nta that s disgusting and cruel behavior by your son and disgusting responses from your wife i m horrified by this post
fascinating your wife is literally a cartoon bully nta
nta might i suggest having him talk to your cousin to see how she felt and how it affected her for something so harmless maybe it will change his view to see how much harm it can cause
nta in high school i was that girl that was asked out as a prank a few different times its one of the few things i vividly remember from high school it was devastating knowing that i was not only ugly but ugly enough to be used like that on some level the boys that did that to me did not process that i was a human being with a heart and that it would break under those circumstances they saw me as less than and unworthy of basic decency you re a good father for calling out that kind of behavior and you should absolutely stand your ground i promise that the girl on the other end of it would appreciate it even if she never knows about it
nta stuff like that needs to be shut down you did the right thing
esh except for you your wife and your son aren t the good people you think they are the prank did hurt someone the girl you re mil fil are also awful enablers not shocking
nta your wife though oh man she s an obnoxious ah good genes wtf is that what your sine did was cruel and he s probably seen his mother behave that way
nta but sadly you ve married on and thanks to her genes you not have a son who is an ah as well
boys will be boys pertains to dumb things like putting dish soap on a slide
nta at all your son did a cruel thing and you punished him accordingly unfortunately it sounds like your wife and in laws are enabling his shitty behavior
nta tell your wife i said she is disgusting i would absolutely punish my boys for something like that they are around that same age
nta i was on the end of one of these in high school and it did hurt me your wife son and in laws are all wrong thank you for sticking up for that girl
nta but it sounds like everyone else in your family is
did you marry a mean girl or something op you are absolutely correct for being concerned about this prank your son needs to learn to be respectful to people and not do things like pretend to ask someone out then presumably later on ghost them or something that behavior really harms a person s self esteem your wife s response about your daughter having good genes made my jaw drop nta take charge of this situation or y w b t a
nta your son clearly demonstrated shitty behaviour and lacking in the ability to understand consequences for his actions however he is still a child and needs to realise this was wrong but at the same time allowed to own his mistake and grow from it your wife s comment makes me think maybe she might be culprit as to why your son would think this is ok pretty wild comment about the good genes
remind your wife that the same excuse of boys will be boys is used in sexual assaults also nta but i d definitely say your wife is however i am not sure i d grounding is the best option here he may just learn to hide things better he needs to understand the impact of this
nta you re a very good parent that is such a cruel thing to do to another teenager and an excellent call on your part for discipling him and pffft to listening to private conversation in your house its called supervision your wife and in laws are ah s but you def are not
boys will be boys is how rape culture happens thank you for shutting that shit down
said that while he felt sorry for my cousin he was mature enough to understand to not pull the prank any further a mature person wouldn t have started the prank in the first place and just how is he planning on ending the prank to keep it harmless my wife claims that boys will be boys and that it s something harmless ah boy moms that won t happen because she has good genes yikes nta but your son wife and ils are
pranks are not funny pranks are done to embarrass harass threaten hurt physically or emotionally a totally unsuspecting person they are cruel i don t understand the whole boys will be boys attitude so it s ok that the boys pulling the prank are cruel assholes your wife is great with her baby boy being a bully you are defiuninately nta your wife son on the other hand
nta just the other day i said to my girlfriends there are two types of women those who got asked out as a joke as kids and those who didn t and you can tell the difference we re in our 20s it s not something the girl just forgets about
naw man i d be pretty disappointed in my boy if he pulled shit like that good on yah
nta oh my gosh thank you for trying to raise your son to be respectful to young girls how far would she allow that boys will be boys attitude would she or your son want a boy to pull this crap on your daughter one day
as someone who was asked out as a prank and still has scars from it years later nta op this is not a harmless joke i guarantee the girl that he was talking about won t find it funny please please don t back down
nta and you are the only non asshole in this entire situation apart from the poor girl your son pranked i d seriously consider showing both your wife and your son this thread your son so he understands that yes he did indeed hurt someone with a prank like that your wife because it may be the only way to get through to her that her behaviour is like a teenage mean girl
nta i think you handled this pretty well but you need to make sure your son realizes that the girl getting pranked is getting hurt by this and ask your wife if she believes that conventionally unattractive girls deserve to be messed with and pranked like this if she says yes or repeats that boys will be boys i d rethink your marriage i m serious
nta at all and thank you for addressing this with your son this happened to me when i was in middle school some boys passed me a note saying will you go out with _____ circle yes or no i could also see them laughing across the room i wasn t interested in the boy but he was popular and all i thought was how boys only did that to the ugly girls it destroyed my self confidence and impacted how i saw myself for years they probably don t know how much something like that ruins your self image but it s not an excuse being a teenager teen girl is hard enough without having some boys trashing your appearance on top of it
back to back posts i ve read where the mothers excused their son s horrible behaviour towards women as boys will be boys mentally as a mother to a boy this is just beyond anything disgusting and disrespectful kudos to you your definitely nta thank your for parenting this way
nta sounds like your son got more of your wife s genes
i have a year old son and i d be so disappointed and angry if i found out he did something like this your instincts to curb this kind of behavior are right on this is not boys will be boys info does your son play sports or have any extra curriculars he is really into have a friend of yours call the house and pretend to be a coach from a d1 or d2 school that got sent a highlight video from your son s coach talk him up and say he is invited to a camp run by some celebrity alum and that he will be invited to attend for free and possibly lead to a full ride scholarship let him wnjoy that feeling for a week brag about it share it on his socials then let him know it was a prank and he was foolish to believe he was good enough to get noticed by a d1 school or get a scholarship clearly you aren t the type of dad that would do that to your kid because you see it s cruel and damaging the point though is that he needs to learn empathy i don t know that i would go the route of typical punishment but i would make him do something that will help him develop more empathy towards others volunteer at a soup kitchen or a burn ward or something similar good luck
nta i dated a guy in grade young fat ginger me thought it was great it took two weeks before someone told me it was joke and everyone was laughing at me this was years ago and i can recall every detail of that moment and how utterly shattered and defeated i felt my entire grade and i was the butt of every joke weeks of being grounded vs years of insecurity and doubt that this girl will experience
nta i ve been asked out as a prank before by someone i had a huge crush on for years it was absolutely crushing and has definitely affected how i ve seen people who show an interest in me since what your son s doing is not a prank it s cruelty plain and simple don t give in to pressure from your family here you re doing the right thing trying to nip this behaviour in the bud
nta at all honestly i would take this further and make your son apologize to the girl this can be so much more serious than just this one incident this girl could be getting severely bullied by your son and or his friends or the rest of the school kids have attempted suicide over incidents like this because times it s also public or spread around the school your son is a bully and this behaviour needs to be addressed seriously or your son can very easily turn into a person you wouldn t be proud of i d try and contact both the school and girl and make sure your som truly realizes how terrible his actions are because with your wife s family telling him he s perfectly fine and your overreacting he s not going to learn his lesson
nta but your wife sure is this kind of thing was done to me in junior high and i can still feel the humiliation all these years later thank you for doing what you need to raise a decent human being
nta that kind of prank really messes people up and is extremely vile to pull on anyone would your wife still say oh boys will be boys if he went and did something worse you need to have a serious talk with her about the kind of behavior she s allowing before it devolves into much worse things than his little prank
nta and i would seriously consider having a chat with the other kids parents so that they can nip that behaviour in the bud from their end
god why are boy moms the worst your wife is terrible nta and i hope your son actually learns not to be an ass
nta your wife sounds like a selfish idiot thank you for trying to save that poor girl pain
nta sit this little shit down and make him watch carrie
so nice to see a parent doing good parenting nta
nta and your wife i can t even it won t happen to my daughter because she has good genes what is wrong with her on the other hand when her parents behave like they do i understand this is a whole family engaged in a cycle of bullying others zero empathy normal people do not do things to others that they do not want done to themselves regardless of the probability of it actually happening to themselves are you sure your children are well behaved normally because if i were you i would be concerned they may very well be the schoolyard bullies but you haven t noticed
plz show the comments to ur wife and son looks like ur son learned his behavior from ur wife
i was the subject of this prank so often in middle school and it only got worse in high school to the point i started avoiding everyone i still suffer with my self esteem today and always wonder if someone saying they like me is a joke it s not a joke or a prank it s a way to bully people and i m glad you re trying to teach your son better
nta that s some toxic ass behavior right there and what s supposed to be the end result of this prank exactly what s the punchline not showing up to the date yelling syke in front of everyone no you did the right thing you need to sit down and have a real heart to heart on expectations you have for him not only as a guy but just as a human being in general that this kind of prank isn t harmless and isn t acceptable and with him being you re short on time to get this ship righted before he heads out into the world then who knows what kind of shit he could get up to involving women and his treatment of them now i m gonna lay into your wife and her family for a minute so sorry if this might upset you i m not gonna be pulling my punches much either they re assholes they re toxic they re the kind of people that foster this kind of crap and help create the next andrew tate the boys will be boys excuse is how you end up with a sex offender for a son and apparently they don t seem to see this or think it s a problem your in laws are overtly stating they see nothing wrong here and that just shows me they don t need to have access to your kids for a while until they can grow up or at the very least join us here in and leave the 1950s behind and as for the good genes comment what the hell is wrong with your spouse she seems so far up her own ass that she could see the backside of her uvula she lacks empathy and frankly it has me concerned for your daughter as well because she could end up like that in the future you don t need her turning into a mean girl type or someone that will enable other men to be toxic towards her or other people because boys will be boys there s something really rotten here and i d say you need to figure out what s going through your wife s brain when it comes to all this one kid is already off to college so hopefully they haven t been affected by this sexist and self important attitude that your wife and her parents seem to be fostering the other two though you need to make sure you keep on top of this stamp out any of this toxic and negative personality stuff from taking root fully or embedding any deeper than it already is sorry if i ve come across as a huge jackass but speaking as a parent this really infuriated me to hear if my son were to try something like this you bet your ass i d ground him too my daughter has also been on the receiving end of bullying in the past so i take stuff like this kind of seriously especially because of the effect it can have on anyone but kids especially and if my ex wife were spouting the kind of stuff your wife is i d have more than a few select words for her in regards to parenting hopefully things improve best of luck to you
nta and thank you for talking to your son about his behavior as with many of the commenters i was a victim of bullying and it still affects me at btw unwanted pranks are bullying it s amazing how people call this behavior it s just a prank it s harmless boys will be boys or normal teenage boy behavior this attitude is crazy i m not the victim so it s harmless i guarantee that everyone of your family that is singing this tune would feel different if they were the victim good for you for trying to stop your son from being a bully so sorry that everyone around you feel that your son being a bully is ok
nta i m the same age as your son and i treat girls with equal respect bro it s natural my parents would have killed me if i pulled off some shit like this boys will be boys is a true narrative but it shouldn t lead to misogyny boys will be boys should mean how boys are satisfied with simple things and harmless stuff like that your wife seems like a piece of work your il seem to have passed down that gene let the son learn his lesson
nta asking someone out as a prank is embarrassing and humiliating the fact he thought it wouldn t hurt someone just shows he doesn t see that girl as a person because they don t deem her attractive if that happened to him i bet your wife wouldn t be too happy about it and the fact that she feels your daughter has good genes and it won t happen says a lot
nta you should never apologise or regret doing what is necessary to teach him to be a man it s your duty and responsibility to teach him what s right from wrong
nta you re doing the right thing your wife is a huge gapping asshole though not to be this guy but let me paint your wife a scenario there s a girl in an accident that leads to some disfigurement but thankfully she is alive a few years go by and she s really making some headway with her confidence because it s never been the same as before the accident then a couple of piece of shit teenagers decide to ask the girl from the car accident out as a joke because they think her scarring makes her unattractive good genes don t save you from the cruelty of life or others also i have a little boy boys will be boys isn t supposed to condone asshole behavior it s for dumb a little rough or slightly reckless but over all harmless stuff not choices made with malicious intent to hurt others
nta that boy is nearly a man he needs to learn that playing with people s emotions is not a prank
nta that was not a harmless prank that can mentally mess up a person thank the unicorns you understand how much that can affect a person hopefully everyone else in ur household and fam understand odd they don t see how u see it when ur cousin had it happen to them in school and they know about it
nta i know all too well what it s like to be on the receiving end of mean jokes like this one it s a prank is never a sufficient justification for intentionally hurting someone and boys will be boys is sexist nonsense that excuses hurtful and misogynistic behavior and ultimately sets up for locker room talk and she was asking for it type narratives in the future this response was clear enough to send the message that this kind of behavior won t be tolerated but not so harsh as to alienate him completely and is the perfect age to really crack down on this behavior old enough to fully understand why it s unacceptable young enough that punishments like grounding are likely to be effective
no man you are absolutely doing the right thing nta
i am sad for the girl i sympathize so much i hope they do not go thru with it are you reporting to the school
boys will be boys boys will be boys will be held responsible for their actions his actions are only normal for bullies nta but your wife our son and his friends are
nta and if they have to resort to boys will be boys they know that it is not entirely ok just because it might be considered normal it does not mean that it should be allowed separate but equal used to be normal too but thankfully people stood up against that old adage too keep holding your son up to standards that require him to treat others the way they should be treated not like toys for him to damage or break as he chooses
boys will be boys encourages toxic masculinity
nta your wife is shallow not only that she sounds like the kind of person who will enable toxic behavior from your son because he s a boy she might be someone you love but i m sorry op she s got a twisted mentality
nta at all it s not harmless and overhearing something is not eavesdropping i salute you for being a good father and your wife etc are disgraceful
nta asking someone out as a prank is cruel
nta the only harmless pranks are ones where everyone including the victim is legitimately laughing at the end i fail to see how the poor girl who is the victim of your son s prank would find any humor in this situation it isn t a joke it s intended to insult and humiliate the victim and is downright mean the only thing more despicable than your son and his friends behavior in this whole scenario is your wife s response boys will be boys is fine when we re talking about boys thinking it s a good idea to ride a shopping cart down a poorly executed ramp off the back deck it is a terrible excuse for mean spirited bullying behavior that encourages traits of toxic masculinity and this same prank would be just as awful if done by girls as well your wife also suggesting that because your daughter has good genes will prevent her from receiving this kind of treatment by her peers is also disgusting it implies that kids who lose out in the looks lottery somehow deserve to be bullied and ignores the fact that even good looking kids can end up being bullied the complete lack of empathetic maturity here is astounding leads me to believe your wife was the mean girl growing up and has never grown out of it frankly if i were you i d be reevaluating exactly who it is i married and the son would have a far harsher punishment than two weeks grounding the fact that you eavesdropped on their convo is irrelevant and that he even thinks it is tells me you have bigger issues to deal with in regard to his behavior he got caught being a jerk and deserves every bit of punishment you deem fit
nta tell your wife you want a divorce jokingly when she doesn t find it funny tell her boy will be boys for real though that s a horrible thing to do to anyone you need to have a serious talk with your wife and son don t let them think this is okay behavior
boys will be boys always makes me sick nta
boys will be boys oh you mean like brock turner right your wife and son are abhorrent no wonder why he doesn t take this seriously you are nta and ask your wife if boys will be boys is okay if some boys sexually assaulted her or were cruel i simply cannot with your wife s attitude
my wife claims that boys will be boys the reason for the phrase women are women s own enemy

nta this girl isn t qualified to decide how you identify weirdly enough i am a first generation russian american and have had some challenges like this because i use the russian name since the ukrainian invasion i have had some harassment but most people can t tell the ukrainian from the russian and just get confused when i don t answer to the english name because i didn t realize they meant me dead naming is a big thing for not just trans persons but anyone who is having their identify invalidated you are ukrainian you are having identity questions because of the horrific attack on ukraine you in fact have every right to your name without that and it does effect you or you wouldn t be effected this girl sounds like a bad friend they re the sort who think they re the arbiter of all experience my college roommate one of them anyway did this i am autistic and i have allergies she repeatedly did things to cause me medical issues and sensory issues because allergies and autism aren t real you just want attention i wanted less attention and to not die but because she had never experienced anaphylactic shock she didn t care low empathy people come in a spectrum and they aren t guaranteed to be bad friends but anyone telling you that you re not you is unsafe do not erase yourself for someone who doesn t live with you as it stands i will never go to russia again because i don t want to die for being not straight enough i also refuse to support the oligarchs funding this war there s grief there even though i barely remember any of it and mostly i remember the food and anaphylactic shock from the cucumbers in all the food i still needed to grieve because it s a loss of the things and people who are not complicit and are there i cannot compromise on my safety your own choices here aren t different what is different my fellow slav the borders we landed under please take care of yourself and don t discount the trauma that attacks on places one is from hold if it was harmless there wouldn t be support for ukraine
nta your friend can shove it its literally your fucking name you were born there you were bullied because of being born there you are estranged from your family not your country and heritage
speaking as a romanian immigrant nta it s your cultural heritage and your literal legal name and your friend can fuck off
how on earth are you the asshole in this it s literally your heritage nta
aita for wanting people to call me by my literal legal name obviously you re nta
nta if someone wants to interpret things the worst way possible they will but that s on them to me it seems obvious that you want to feel closer to the country you re originally from especially now
nta your name is who you are you are the only one who gets to decide who that is
nta one girl in particular didn t like the idea at all in life there are always those few people that assume the worst of every scenario in time you learn to respect their opinion for what it is worth zero
nta this has been a really hard year to be ukrainian anywhere and it s been a time of conflicting feelings for those of us who are first gen diaspora and highly assimilated into our non ukrainian communities a lot of us have made much more active efforts to reconnect with our heritage and make new connections including reflecting those changes in the names we go by i m a bit older than you and across the pond and female but if you ever want to talk to a fellow gay diaspora ukrainian just know you aren t alone
that s such a weird take for your friend to have because regardless of her opinions which are bs anyway it s already your name like yes you go by a nickname but it is literally already your legal name nta at all
nta but there s really not a conflict here you re the only one who gets to decide what to call yourself

nta i am a proud ukrainian and a proud second generation american never touched ukrainian soil but still proud use the name you want to yse
nta your name is your name you get to choose if you want to use a nickname or your legal name
it is a name and you are entitled to be called what you feel comfortable with that applies whether it is the anglicized version or the ukrainian one i doubt when you connect with other ukrainians that they will care what your name is but they will care that someone has extended them kindness at a difficult time so use what you feel fits you nta
being from a country you re not from is incredibly hard and complicated to figure out i ve always not been from where i m from and lived somewhere i m from but not from it s totally totally totally normal to try to assimilate at first and then later try to find a balance between your two identities i think there s something to figuring out who is safe to do that exploration around not everyone deserves to know every thing you re working through and i think your friend has shown she s someone who you can trust with much less personal information than your identity exploration work doesn t mean you need to cut off the friendship or cut off the exploration just separate the two you might consider introducing yourself to a new community with your ukrainian name get a feel for it explore your ukrainian identity and then decide if you want to integrate your identities more this is an exciting moment in your life regardless of what you conclude it s great that you re opening up this prt of yourself to see what s there like i said it s hard and complicated but it s worth the effort nta
nta tell her she is has no business having opinions contradicted by facts even without a war most children of immigrants feel anxious and conflicted about where they truly belong your feelings are not just your feelings but are likely the most common combinations of ambivalent identities among all the second generation of ukrainian immigrants there is lots of sympathy around the world i am not in the uk and have no connection to ukraine but donated last year and still display a small ukrainian flag in my office and no i am not trying to seem ukrainian or seek sympathy small independent countries that were former colonies deserve our support if former empires try to reconquer them what if the uk decided it needed to re conquer ireland what if the us decided to reconquer the philippines ukraine deserves your support regardless of how many generations removed you are
thank you so much i don t currently have anyone in real life who can relate to what i m trying to figure out it means a lot to feel like someone understands
this is a great answer they re the sort who think they re the arbiter of all experience and that is a very good way to understand what your friend is doing by telling you not to use your name and also why she doesn t think you should use it nta
itym affect and affected otherwise agree percent nta op and i m sorry you re going through all this
thanks that s a really good way of describing it
also i relate heavily to wanting to be closer to your culture and wishing you had assimilated less
i am glad i could help it s definitely a lucky internet moment this sort of treatment is also really hard to process because it s so illogical and emphemral but a lot of us with first generation or young migrant experience deal with things like this and while it gets better it comes around again for me personally if i can ever help you again i hope to do so
it s your name you re allowed to use it for pretty much any reason you like getting a bit closer to your ukrainian heritage sounds like a great reason at age you may be involved in some transitions leaving school going to uni getting a job etc lots of natural opportunities to introduce yourself to new people as fedir and see how it feels if you want to learn a little about ukrainian history here are some resources timothy snyder an eminent historian of eastern europe including ukraine taught a class at yale last year on ukrainian history the lectures are terrific entertaining and informative and are on youtube here is the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plh9mgdi4rnewfxo7lhboz\_1mx1mao6sw\_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plh9mgdi4rnewfxo7lhboz_1mx1mao6sw_) snyder has written some books on ukraine and related as well bloodlands is excellent but is also very grim serhii plokhy is a ukrainian historian writing in english he s at harvard he has a one volume history of ukraine called the gates of europe that s a pretty easy read he has other books about ukraine and russia including a pretty good one about chernobyl which is obviously in ukraine bloodlands is about the huge number of people who died in poland ukraine belarus etc from about to which includes the holodomor stalin intentionally starved ukraine in the early 1930s killing about 3mm people and the holocaust a huge fraction of jews who died from nazi race hatred were from ukraine if i had one wish for ukraine it would be that people leave it the heck alone it s suffered enough
thank you it s so hard to find people that understand so i m really grateful

nta not legal advice you can t put up traffic cones on the road outside of your property to prevent people from parking in front of your house even if its resident only parking you can t limit it to your household you don t own the road moving traffic cones doesn t make you an ah but you should have called the cops anonymously and had them remove the cones and cite the owner
nta this is harassment sustained repeated targeted and slander defamation of character with malicious intent since she already has multiple complaints and she s been banned from the bar you might have a case document everything and if the harassment continues file a civil lawsuit she targeted your professional life she berates you for using your own personal property she even set up cones which isn t even legal wild lady
i m sorry you have nothing better to do with your life than harass me but just because you hate me doesn t mean i m responsible for every bad thing that happens on this road maybe get a hobby instead of focusing on someone so much younger than you yes its petty i know
i m pretty sure you can t place your own traffic cones on a public road i doubt the rule applies to random cones people just put up in front of their own home it s more likely that if they were reported to your city or town or whatever she would have been fined for putting them there in the first place nta
nta the neighbor is focusing in you because you re younger than she and obviously your parents and she s on a power trip honestly she d probably implode if she came over to talk to you and you called her behavior childish maybe keep that in mind the night time you re bored carry on
document everything weird she does and if need be get a restraining order nta
nta but she is your coworker is ta for illegal dumping it also goes without saying that the miserable lady is very very much ta
nta and there is no possibility of jail time for moving cones placed by a private citizen and not by the city unless the cones were made of gold and cost enough that the theft would require jail time i can t just put out traffic cones and send people to jail if they move them even then she has no proof document her behavior and get a restraining order you re correct about her not being rational enough for a mature adult conversation to work she can post on facebook all she wants it doesn t do anything but make her look crazy
nta the repeated harassment of you and your colleagues by this person is uncalled for also does your community allow private citizens to block the road with traffic cones mine doesn t i would screen capture her posts and forward them to authorities if she was blocking the road with her cones
nta if anything you need to report her and have em send her a cease and desist because she is outta line with how much she s harassing you
apparently moving cones can result in up to years in jail i m sure that is traffic cones put in place by the municipality not by rude ladies like no you shouldn t have stolen her cones but they shouldn t have been there in the first place nta
nta unless she has proof let her sound the alarms lol it s literally traffic cones lady sounds miserable
nta you didn t do anything but this problem isn t just going to go away document everything you can the way this is heading you re going to need to apply for a restraining order sooner or later
nta i would start documenting this harassment and eventually get an ro or no contact order
your neighbor sounds like mine miserable with nothing better to do i m sorry you re nta
if you re inside your house with the windows closed you have to be really quite loud to be audible in the next door house if you re outside in the back yard you ll be audible at a much lower volume particularly if the neighbors are already in bed because there s probably a direct line from your back yard to their windows if your voices are clearly audible from their bed you can probably understand why they are upset right if you re drinking friends in the hot tub on a friday night you were drinking weren t you then you re probably louder than you think you re being now the traffic cones moving cones might attract a jail sentence but that applies to traffic cones lawfully placed by the dot to direct traffic close lanes of a road etc not some random cones a private citizen puts in front of their house what is she doing with these cones has she put them out to try and stop people from parking in front of her house is she replacing the kerb and these cones are out to protect that work sounds like your friends stole her cones which makes them ahs but the same kind of low grade ah that steals random lawn ornaments if they d stacked up the cones on her lawn rather than stealing them there wouldn t be an issue esh
eh nta
yta asking you not to be loud outside after 10pm is pretty reasonable more than reasonable in fact

info she already confronted me once about going in after work it was past midnight so i admit i probably shouldn t have been out in the garden making noise were you alone was there music involved how much past midnight was it and i moved on from that you admit that you were wrong and broke noise ordinances here how is this something you would move on from if you were taking accountability i had a couple of friends round on a friday night and we were in the hot tub from just after 10pm around she came out banging on the fence and yelling for us to keep it down we turned the music down and kept our conversation quiet but she came out again just after 11pm doing the same thing so we got out and just decided to watch a movie instead is starting up a hot tub party with music after pm normal in this neighborhood how often are you doing this in my suburban neighborhood people tend to give neighborhoods a heads up if they have a pool party that goes longer than and they tend to do it once a year or less you turned the music down rather than off and kept it on until after the city ordinance final question you state that your parents have your back on this do you have the same number of guests at the same hours when your parents are home
now she s posted on facebook asking for advice on going to the council or the police since apparently moving cones can result in up to years in jail ianal but i would bet a decent amount of money that if there is such a law it only applies to cones placed by emergency services police fire ems or workers who have a permit to block redirect traffic if anything she is probably the one breaking the law by putting cones on a public street
nta she s harassing you i would get clarification about the privately placed traffic cones obstructing the street the penalty is likely for cones that the city or their contractors place
judge case the charges are checks notes petty theft of two mid sized orange traffic cones not issued by the municipal it s quite clear you re not the ah and if she was already banned from your bar i wouldn t worry about your job security
i really regret not sending a photo of the cones to the local authorities and inquiring if they were there for a reason tbh it wouldn t solve the harassment issues but it could have avoided the facebook post and gotten rid of the cones in a less petty way
we had a couple of drinks but i wouldn t say any of us were drunk i agree it s tough to tell the exact volume level but i think having a chat in the garden isn t out of order if we were screaming and shouting then i d understand being upset but we definitely weren t about the cones i have no idea what her intentions are in her facebook post she said they re out because of remedial work that s due to start with no time frame but i don t believe that if the cones were in front of her driveway then that s fair game but they re past the pavement and on the road her driveway isn t even directly on the road since it joins up to a big shared driveway that houses share from what i can tell she just doesn t want any cars anywhere near her house regardless of whether it s her jurisdiction or not
it sounds like neighbor doesn t want her even using the hot tub which hot tubs don t make tons of noise unless for some reason you have a hot tub that screams like it s being boiled alive j and so long as she s not yelling or playing music super loudly or anything she has a right to be using her hot tub if she s being loud sure ask her to keep it down but demanding they don t even use their backyard hot tub at all at night is unreasonable as hell
when quiet time is between 11pm and am 10pm is unreasonable

i was alone the first time and there was no music her complaint wasn t about the noise levels it was about the underwater lights shining through one of her windows and keeping her awake since then we ve had a gazebo cover installed to prevent that issue character limit prevented me adding more context but she was actually caught on our doorbell cam looking for a way to enter our garden through the gate my issue wasn t that she complained but that she was trespassing on our property at no point did i say i held a hot tub party i invited friends over to come and chill i never told them it was a party and we never behaved like it was a bit of quiet music and conversation isn t abnormal at night but if we were planning an actual party it would be respectful to inform neighbours i personally don t have guests round when my parents are home but that s due to my mum having a disability she s happy for me to have guests but she often doesn t want to see people so i don t invite people over much i ve been fully upfront with my parents about the entire situation and they re still on my side they ve been in the hot tub at similar times and at louder noise levels without my neighbour interfering
or use the defense of they were on the public road and the city didn t put them there so i saw them as trash therefore since they were a hazard i removed them and disposed of them in the garbage
let s be honest here you are a year old bartender working across the street from your parents house you bring the party home when your parents are out of town which is what of year old bartenders would do your late night hot tub chat in the garden which you admit went on past city ordinance time of was a actually a party with music this has nothing to do with traffic cones you aren t getting complaints because of age discrimination since your parents are out of town you are getting complaints because your parents wouldn t put up with this shit either you just don t try to pull it when they are around
she literally asked them to not use it after 10pm
i disagree
op admitted that in both cases he was after pm first interaction with neighbor was after midnight neighbor then kicked up a fuss at pm but kicked up more of a fuss after pm when op admits he still had music on and guests over op isn t following the law quiet time or not being an ah
what is quiet music your city noise ordinance starts at there isn t a decibel level that can both be enjoyed be a group outside and isn t a nuisance to neighbors at that time playing music outside in your neighborhood isn t the same as playing it inside not surrpised your parents are supporting behavior that they aren t subjected to
i d suggest using the true defense of i didn t do anything with them
you can t simultaneously claim you know with certainty that the city didn t put them there and that you didn t know who to return the property to
that s pretty unfair i think having two friends over isn t having a party and i had full permission to invite guests and use the hot tub i ve had the same permission when my parents have been at home i get your point about what most year old bartenders would do but that s not the case
yes which she doesn t have the right to do you can t ask someone to just not use something you can only ask that they be considerate while doing so sitting in a hot tub after 10pm is not an unreasonable thing to do
uk noise laws allow a certain decibel level but obviously i wasn t measuring the decibel levels her first complaint that night was aggressive and before noise laws come into play my issue has gone way past whether or not her complaints about the hot tub were valid what i have a problem with is openly slandering me to my managers and claiming i ve made her feel unsafe those are serious allegations and i don t think it s appropriate to bring a personal dispute into my workplace
true that s probably smarter because they ain t investigating on that though op should remove the post if so lol
well city traffic cones accompany city work city doesn t put up random traffic cones without a reason this situation seems like the classic you can t park outside of my house on the side of the public road which isn t lawful
have the good fortune to have had zero neighbors with music and guests in their backyard after pm as pp noted can t hear my neighbors in their home but can hear music and conversations outside you admit that both times your neighbor complained you were outside of the legal limit for noise you were not abiding by the law nor were you respectful
of course she has the right to ask
thankfully my managers have seen my interactions with her and know her claims have no validity but i m worried she ll take it further and put my job at risk she s already been banned from my work for two years after harassing staff over people parking on the road instead of the carpark and she emailed the ceo begging to be allowed back okay so you are really worried that the woman who has been banned from your bar for two year is making serious allegations to the ceo of the bar i mean pub i mean
the pub is owned by a larger chain company and the entire incident with her getting banned happened before i started working there she s allowed back and usually comes in at least once a week so it s a pretty valid concern that she might take her complaints further
the establishment you work in is suddenly a pub interesting change in language her two year ban suddenly doesn t exist anymore interesting change in narrative in spite of all of these linguistic gymnastics you have yet to address why your neighbor is unreasonable when you have been over the legal limit for noise in both instances of her complaints
i m in the uk a pub a bar and a restaurant means the same thing we serve food but we also have a regular drinking clientele i never stated that the two year ban was still in place i haven t changed my narrative once you ve just wilfully misinterpreted me in the worst possible faith my neighbour is unreasonable for bringing a personal dispute into my workplace and telling one of my managers that i ve made her feel too afraid to go to the bathroom the complaint isn t the problem anymore it s how she s acted after that
she s already been banned from my work for two years i never stated that the two year ban was still in place you did state that the two year ban was sill in place your use of tense in the first sentence is explicitly used to emphasize an event occurring in the past that continues to the present if this complaint is about your workplace your managers and bathrooms why is your title and op about cones and hot tubs

nta your brother isn t an ah for grieving but rather for not getting the help he clearly needs to be there for his kids who lost their mom and for stealing cash he knew wasn t his
nta you might need to take him to court and get custody of his kids cause its clear as day he can t take care of them or even himself he might even need rehab
nta i get that grief is a long road but it s been three years he needs to get therapy and learn that he still has two children to take care of his late wife wouldn t want him neglecting them
nta tough love for your brother if you won t do it who will
nta you were being taken advantage by a man who uses his dead wife as an excuse he isn t a man really he doesn t take care of his children so yeah nta
it sounds like you reached your breaking point and frankly given all you ve done that s understandable nta
nta he refused to improve himself neglected his own children essentially cornered you into a position where you had to look after them leached off of you and your money while refusing to get a job and stole money from you his dead wife isn t an excuse for all of that major ah
nta not sure where you live but maybe you can get custody of the girls
nta take him to small claims for the money he owes you
i think in the grand scheme of things you re nta he does need the wakeup call but it definitely should have been handled better but i ll let you off the hook for that one he s grieving but he s also using it to just hide away from the world and lock himself in a grief loop he will avoid everything because his wife is dead he doesn t need to be fully moved on but he does need to make steps forward no matter the reluctance if not for himself then for his kids who lost a mother he lost a wife but for as long as he avoids reality they have lost both parents he will probably do the same thing at the in laws and that is going to have a worse meltdown than what happened at yours why because he will be the son in law mooching off a couple that lost their daughter also thinking a money jar with two s in it is a household spare change jar is just absurd and even if it was who the hell just takes money from another family s change jar
this is a tough one on one hand two years isn t a great deal of time in terms of grief on the other you have been incredibly supportive over those two years and he s had longer than most grieving people have to get to grips with living again you can t be expected to keep up this level of support indefinitely i m most sorry for his daughters in an ideal world you d have sat him down and had a discussion calmly once you started to feel this resentment rather than allowing it to fester and then reach a flash point however hindsight is overall nah maybe leave it for a bit and then apologise for being so blunt it s probably good that you ve got some distance for now

esh you have a valid reason to be upset with him but you have not handled this well you let an intolerable situation go on and on until you couldn t handle it anymore and exploded in a cruel way healthy compassion is where you say hey buddy i know you ve been suffering and i m really sorry but now s the time to pull yourself together for the sake of your family and keep on living let us help you do that it is not where you bottle this up inside for a long time while you watch someone decline and then explode at the same time he needs to get his shit together i ve been through horrific grief myself so i m understanding of what he s going through but one of the hardest and most necessary parts of the grieving process is coming to the realization that life goes on whether you want it to or not the bills still need to get paid dog still needs to be fed kids still need their needs met collapsing into dysfunction has consequences so he needs to pull it together and you need to meet this situation with compassion and healthy boundaries
nta but i said that the last time i saw this exact same post
esh
yta for the delivery but you re also correct to call him out if his wife could see him now would she be okay with it is this how he s going to honor what they built together before she died he needs to go to therapy badly he s also ta if he refuses to get any sort of help there s no excuse for that
yta but he s an even bigger one he s in his rock bottom and you just encouraged him to stay there with your loans while he doesnt actually fix himself yk what you have to do instead tell him to work out it always works at least with guys so tell him to work out and get a job make sure he actually works out even maybe hire someone to help him this might seem outlandish but it helps with self esteem a lot worst thing that can happen is that he becomes a tate fan but id argue thats much better than being an alcoholic leech sadly you cant change the past so now hes a useless old slob that steals from his own family because you encouraged that behaviour
nta losing a love one is never ever easy having said that life goes on as harsh as it is it s reality plus in this case he has children and providing for them needs to be his top priority though you prbly were harsh it s deserved there s only so much help you can give someone if that person doesn t want to help themselves or don t show signs of improving then cutting off support is the best i would also add to keep tabs on his children they don t deserve to suffer for their fathers mistakes
nta your brother needs a therapist
nta he needs to get his shit together for his kids you need to stop supporting him any further than helping the kids if absolutely necessary
nta grief and depression are real problems and they don t have a set timeline that being said your brother wasn t just a husband he s also a parent he owes it to his late wife and his children to get his shit together and start parenting that means putting their needs ahead of his desire to self medicate therapy grief support groups antidepressants he needs to be taking steps to heal so her can be a father to his children instead of relying on everyone else to take care of him
nta he wasn t working helping around the house or taking care of his children in your house he was drinking and stealing to continue that wouldn t help anyone now his in laws can take care of the girls and he can get his shit together or not but it wasn t working at your house if something isn t working it s asinine to think it will work if you keep doing it
nta jewelry and electronics was next make sure he hasn t already sold any gaming systems you don t have out in the open this was going to end badly don t be afraid to say that you bout your family above his drinking and reckless finances
nta i feel like your brother needs a healthy dose of reality and to wake up before he loses the rest of his family i feel for him that he lost his wife but i m sure his wife is pissed at him for neglecting their kids and drinking what was once their future away
nta shit happens you have to move on
this
i don t think that is necessary for the time being he and the girls are with his late wife s parents so i know they are in good hands but thank you for the advice regardless
its gonna be so much worse now that he s at the in laws place mooching off the people who lost their daughter
this too
deleted
but the girls will have their grandparents while he s off drinking and that s a good thing
never is an acceptable answer how long would it take to be able to be a functioning adult when you have two kids to raise is a more appropriate question yes he lost his wife yes that is tremendously hard however that s not a free pass to behave like that it should not be an excuse to be a drunk go broke neglect your kids steal give up on life
a life time but i m not going to drink all day while my children languish
i meant the eventual meltdown between the dad and the in laws the kids having grandparents there for them is a positive and they ll probably push to keep them once the mooching meltdown happens again
and honestly grandparents have a better chance of getting custodial rights especially as they are the deceased mother s kin so when he screws up the state can grant them some legal ability to be there for them
i hope they kick him to the curb and keep the girls it might be the wakeup call he needs
if i were the grandparents i d give him days to get a job or get out and keep the girls
he definitely needs to hit rock bottom and is hovering just above
yup and make sure call the cops if he ever tried to drive drunk or such he s desperately in search of his bottom

nta you standing up to someone who s effectively being bullied is the right thing to do sounds like your stepmum aussies eh needs all the help she can get
nta your grandma has no place in the raising of other people s children it sounds like you were trying to protect your little sibling and his mother
nta sounds like you re the only one on your step mums side i think you need to have a chat to your dad and tell him what your grandmother is being like if he s working all the time he might not realise
your dad having a child at already wild nta for trying to defend your stepmom even tho it blew up in your face
you re nta your stepmother needs support right now not unsolicited advice and judgmental condescension she has a newborn baby the last thing she needs is more stress your grandmother has most likely worn out her welcome and needs to go home eta good for you standing up for her i m sure she s glad to know someone in the house has her back
nta and it is not harder on your dad
nta being a new mom can be rough unsolicited advice or flat out instruction usually doesn t make it better your grandmother obviously successfully raised a child but that doesn t mean her advice is welcome or even still good my spouse s grandmother swore by rubbing some whiskey on the baby s gums for teething we did not apparently she had done this for her kids and my spouse it did prompt some joking that he still prefers whiskey your grandmother stating that it s harder for your dad if he s working a lot then how is taking care of the baby harder for him i get the vibe that your grandmother doesn t really like your step mother
i think you need to stay out of their business you may have had the best intentions but it still wasn t your place to be involved nta although you should have known better about playing a guitar in a house with a baby that shits just ridiculous

haha fair play was an acoustic tbf in the middle of the day
babies get used to noise at first i insisted with my oldest that everything had to be quiet when he slept huge mistake we quickly realized that he should become accustomed to noise the other kids we got them used to noise from the beginning we think that babies need quiet to sleep before the baby is born it never has quiet they hear the mother s heartbeat her digestion her voice so many sounds from the point it can hear it has constant noise they don t need quiet just adjusting to the new noises
if you try and make everything silent so your baby can sleep they will never learn to sleep through normal background noise i vaccuumed played music watched tv and my kids slept through it just fine an acoustic guitar not attached to a speaker would not have disturbed them you are setting yourself up to be hostage to your kids sleep if they can only sleep in absolute silence
no it isn t tbf use some damn common sense i would have sent you home after that
theres a difference between watching tv or having a conversation and playing a guitar nice try tho

nta it doesn t sound like you are taking over the conversation with it
nta your parents should be glad that you two are close enough to have this kind of shared connection
nta your elders just don t get the meme culture and they probably never will because quite likely in part they don t want to because they brush it off as game stuff speaking as a parent and a kid of parents myself your parents are not giving a good example i was like you when i was a kid teen my family were never interested in my interests they wanted to talk only about their topics topics they found interesting topics they could understand they would not even try to understand my topics or engage in any of my interests and that s shitty so i understand why you feel they are being unfair and in my opinion you re right you have a few options now and you should sick the one that will work best for you go on with your memes and piss them off every now and then or even on a regular basis cut it down with referencing to memes for a while or permanently to keep the peace which can ruin family meals for you and your brother i guess talk to them about how you have own interests and family time is not only about them but also about you and your brother and family conversation is not a one way track
nta i think it s cool to have that kind of relationship with a sibling and your parents should be happy that you do
most parents would be delighted that the siblings weren t arguing nta
they are prolly upset they do not understand it don t really want to since you say you have tried to explain it maybe keep the memes away from the dinner table
nta you re teenagers doing normal teenager shit it s not like you re making fun of them or purposely excluding them you ve made an effort to include them that they weren t receptive to so what else can you do
nah your secret code is essentially inside jokes no one likes to feel excluded inside jokes foster an us versus them mentality or at the very least make outsiders feel more like outsiders this isn t to say that what you and your brother are doing is wrong or rude i just understand where your parents are coming from they are feeling excluded
nta but if your parents say not to do it at the dinner table try not to it might be difficult i know our family conversations are riddled with secret code which can be confusing to others listening in i got upset at them because we ve tried to include them in our secret code so many times but they just don t understand or they get bored of whatever we try to show them as a parent of a teen i can relate to your parents funny and interesting are subjective terms your parents don t find what you re watching to be amusing and as such it s boring perhaps you could introduce your dad to something that would be useful and then he could be in on your secret code without being bored this perhaps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbfzjygchek
nta you ve been trying to explain everything to your parents and attempt to include them but they don t want to learn plus this is how you bond with your brother it s not right to take that away
nta if your perants don t see an issue speaking in a different language at the table to keep something private i see no issue with you and your brother having a secret code
nta
it s a bit rude going into private jokes in the middle of a family dinner you and he know it s harmless but it s still a bit rude i can t quite go so far as to say a h on this one nta
i disagree with the n t a judgements being given because it implies the parents are being assholes not understanding context and feeling frustrated at being consistently feeling left out is going to affect anyone adults and children alike that being said i don t think it s wrong for kids to have jokes among themselves either that are slightly generational in nature it s just that having everyone gathered around a table together then excluding people from the conversation can come across as a little mean if it s quite so consistent nah for me but maybe consider whether there s a better time and place for conversations that could exclude others
nta
nta you re allowed to have a secret code with your brother and friends and whoever you want on top of that you ve tried to include them and they don t care enough to learn the code so that s on them enjoy having fun with your brother

yta you guys have the rest of the day to talk about whatever you want when you are with a group of people it s polite to make an effort to include everybody
no kidding some kids are at each other s throats at that age they have no idea how lucky they are nta
i fell this to my husband all the time we re in our early 30s and i feel like he doesn t understand that teenagers will like what they like and whatever their parents like will be uncool old boring etc he thinks his music and interests are cool and i keep reminding him it s fine to share our interests with our kids like showing them star wars or whatever but getting interested in their specific kid interests now sets the stage for them sharing their interests with us as they become teenagers my mom thought a lot of my teenager interests were dumb and i remember how is stopped sharing those kinds of things with her but she did make an effort to read books i liked and i loved suggesting books and having her enjoy them and we d talk about them together so no i m not a fan of pokmon but my 8yo is so i put pokmon go on my phone and we play it together sometimes when we go on walks hopefully i can continue this
exactly
i agree with you in general it would be the nice thing to do for most people my sticking point is that the parents retaliate by speaking another language to each other when they want to exclude the kids at least the kids have offered to explain their jokes nta
you sound like a good parent

so i am thinking that the hair is the straw that broke the camel s back so to speak it isn t the braiding as much as the intimacy you don t see it as intimate but it seems that your wife feels like she missed out on some intimacy with you in some way why didn t your wife go on the trip there are some missing pieces nah
nta i do think braiding playing with hair is an intimate act but we are intimate with our friends intimate sexual i think your wife s behaviour was not ok i think it s ok for her to ask you not to do it but to treat you like you did something wrong and harass your friends is gross
nta just out of curiosity could it be a cultural issue she went a little extreme contacting others and if it were cultural it should have been discussed i m native american and no woman other than your wife sister or mother can braid your husband s hair
nah i ve got long hair a co worker a woman has braided it on occasion french braid i actually made a point of showing a photo of that to my wife she wasn t even slightly bothered but some women are bothered by it some consider hair care to be sensual while not everyone will be bothered by it it s hardly freakish to be bothered by it you didn t know this would bug her so i can t call you the ah here but now you do know so if it happens again that ll be different
nta it s okay that your wife is bothered by this but instead of communicating like an adult she decided to question your faithfulness and on top of that called your friends to cross check your story there by involving them in your drama she is a major ah because of that
now you know your wife doesn t feel comfortable with another woman braiding your hair you didn t know this before as long as you plan to respect your wife s view about that in the future nta your wife however is the ah in this situation quizzing your friends that s no go territory you want to speak with her about that she either believes what you tell her or she doesn t trust you which is it you need to know
nta this behavior is insane and this thread is insane you not being comfortable with something does not mean that that something is suddenly inappropriate and you re justified in lashing out over it
i m so sorry but the people excusing the actions of the wife here are making my head hurt okay you might find hairstyling an intimate act and all that but the wife here went absolutely overboard like incredibly so even if you were bothered by it which i have done my friends hair a lot with no romantic intentions lol contacting your partner s friends to question them about your relationship with a friend only because she braided your hair is incredibly concerning nta and i would have a serious talk with your wife about this honestly
for some women brushing and styling their partner s hair is considered an intimate couples activity i comb and braid my husband s hair when he gets out of the shower it s couples time where we just talk together and bond much like you described doing with maddie if someone else did that for him i would not like it primates groom each other maddie isn t a hair stylist i presume i guess if maddie was picking lice out of your fur it would be a stronger indication of intimacy but it is what it is wife doesn t like other women having their hands on her husband it really doesn t matter what you or i think of this apologize and make a note for next time nta but you might be if you continue to do this thing wife obviously has strong feelings about
your friend who happens to be a woman braided your hair for practical reasons upon learning this your wife grilled you grilled your friends while insinuating you re a cheater verbally abused you and is now emotionally abusing you your only crime is being a man on this subreddit where these things are normalised when it happens to men and where you will get little sympathy so many people are assuming that you must have cheated or done something else because they want you to be ta here and excuse your wife s abhorrent behaviour the sexism on display is rampant and disgusting and i m sorry you have to deal with it nta
well til there are a lot of weirdly possessive folks then again this subreddit has a way of educating me and making me grateful for my wife nta
i might be seriously strange but i don t understand i don t let my partner see other women be touched by other women talk or text with other women etc etc if he s going to cheat he ll do it regardless of me trying to control him or possibly because i control him i do what i can to be a good partner i make sure he feels loved and respected i would never tell him what to do or not do
whoa that went bad real quick are you sure this is out of nowhere because this is quite a drastic and lasting reaction to something that s never come up before
there are several possible scenarios as i see it but likely nta a there is more you are not telling us such as suspicious behaviour on your part and your wife has good reason to suspect more than hair braiding happened either with maddie or someone else in the past this is the one likely scenario where yta b your wife is projecting she was the one who was unfaithful in some way and tries to alleviate her guilt by trying to accuse you of the same thing you are nta c your wife is may be insecure overreacting or finds the hair tying far more intimate than it actually was nta but communicate your wife op has not given any additional information it seems which would be helpful to accurately determine what is going on
i m going to withhold judgement but my husband has long hair and a long beard and i d definitely feel weird if some other woman was braiding it hair is just intimate to some people i know personally i only allow like two or three people to even touch mine you might need to figure out why it s bothering her before you worry about wether or not you ta
nta jealousy happens naturally but her reaction is over the top
nta a friend of mine and my husband s who i actually do have a casual history with from before i met my husband braids my hair for me sometimes literally just because he s good at braiding hair my husband knows about the history and is absolutely fine with it because it s no big deal it s just hair i think i disagree with the commenters saying that your wife s feelings are valid she s entitled to have her feelings but also she s a grown adult and it s not fair for her to be giving you the cold shoulder cos of her feeling insecurity you let another girl braid your hair feels so childish to me unless of course it s a culturally important thing but from the post i don t get that vibe it reads more like insecurity
as a social experiment i would love to see reddit s reaction to this situation with all of the genders reversed nta for the record which should be plainly obvious to anyone but apparently not
i think nta based on the fact that i am a woman that has braided her male friends hair in social settings many times without it being even remotely weird sexual too intimate i just loved braiding someone else s hair and for a lot of guys it is usually a new and different experience if nothing happened between you and your friend this shouldn t be the basis of a disagreement i hope you will be able to talk this through
nta everyone else in the comments is just reading too deep into this lol she braided your hair she didn t birth your kid its genuinely not that deep if having your hair braided by a woman is what makes her insecure she needs to some introspection and ask herself why that of all things pissed her off
nah she has the right to be upset i wouldn t want anyone braiding my man s hair it s not sexual but playing with his hair is a form of intimacy i enjoy you have the right to hike without your hair in your face a hair tie could have had the same affect
nah though i kind of understand your wife and how she feels like i am one of those who consider taking care of partner s hair as a form of intimacy i can get quite excited when my partner tends to my hair so you know it s personal talk to her you seem to be a reasonable op wish you luck
nta but you guys need to have a real talk about what s going on and soon
nta that she contacted your other friends to quiz them about you and maddie is above and beyond
nta i can see how braiding your hair can be viewed as intimate i retwist dreads and it is a rather intimate act so i can see why she felt some type of way about it i d be upset if someone other than me or a professional hairdresser did my babe s hair for more than one reason she was out of line calling you a pos over it tho
so all the girls i asked to braid my long hair secretly wanted to have a piece of me there is still hope you need to talk with your wife man nta
your wife has issues or a twisted perspective on intimacy nta you did nothing wrong
no not the arsehole if she s fine with you going away with your female friends i m surprised she has an issue with the hair braiding

nta my friends braid my beard all the time seems perfectly normal to me
i m confused as a person who loves to braid hair men and women i m not sure what the problem is
perhaps unpopular opinion but nta i mean if you go to a hairdresser to get it done and a lady does it will your wife also question it it s not like you both slept in the same bed are you your partner usually all good nothing playing in the background
nta and your wife is the insecure i ve braided a male friend s hair before learning to braid your own takes time and effort
nta it s just hair your wife s reaction is bewildering and over the top usually when a partner accuses the other one of cheating it s because the accuser has been tempted but this scenario is a can of worms you may not want to explore in any case you ve done nothing wrong let your wife stew in her own drama you can t apologize for a thing you haven t done
nta i m sure she s braided a friends hair children s hair perhaps did she view that as intimate just because it was done by the opposite sex doesn t mean a simple thing
nta and it s very extreme that your wife is calling your friends to check out your story is she normally this insecure she knew you were going on this trip with female friends present right
a lot of possessive women in this thread it s your hair man you and your partner do need to have better communication though
nta it is a totally normal thing if your hair being touched by another woman is a boundary your wife has then she should have communicated that to you it isn t your fault that you and most other people consider it to be friendly and platonic
nta that is a very strange thing for her to be upset about maybe she personally has some sexual fetish around hair or an otherwise strong connection between hair and intimacy that s seriously all i can think of my husband let his hair grow over the pandemic i would have thought it was funny and sweet if one of his gal friends had braided it for him to keep it out of his face when they were out together
nta for people saying that she s setting a boundary you can t set a boundary for on something like this you can say i don t like it but setting a boundary is ridiculous your wife seems really controlling paranoid and no one else seems to pick up in it like she was literally quizzing your friends to see if you were telling the truth
really for braided hair nta
nta maybe it s just me but i don t find this at all strange i can t braid my hair almost down to my rear so if i had a guy friend come over to do it for me my husband would be completely fine with that i do have a male friend who can do this by the way neither of us are the jealous type and have been married for almost years is your so the jealous type i don t know how to ask that question without probably sounding like i m accusing them of being jealous i m not though everyone has their own boundaries so maybe they are just that uncomfortable with the whole thing
nta sounds like she s projecting or you aren t telling the whole truth about your friendship with maddie
nta hair braiding and hair in general can be a touchy subject i find hair braiding to be incredibly bonding but not in a sexual way and i ve braided friends hair before as long as it wasn t a only maddie can braid my hair thing i d be fine but now you know your partner finds hair to be sexual or intimate and do you can do differebt in the future
nta but this sub isn t a great place to ask because this sub is really sexist and will find a way to blame you
nta unless you ve given your wife reason to suspect you in the past that reaction implies that she doesn t trust you huge red flag here
nta and if your wife is so concerned about potential cheating it may be because she herself is cheating obviously this may not be the case
nta your wife is looking for infidelity perhaps she cheated on you and is trying to do a misdirection and pretend to be the victim it sounds crazy but weirder things have happened have you ever cheated on her
info if your wife is not normally like this have you tried to find out why it is such ana issue does she normally do your hair have you refused to let her do your hair if she normally does it does she feel this is personal and special to your relationship do you relax and chat with her if she does it or are you wanting it over and done with there are lots of reasons your wife could feel this way what is the relationship like between your wife and this female friend my hubby had a female college friend that he didnt realise was the reason his past relationships failed and why i nearly walked away she was determined that she knew him better and deserved to be treat better than his partner
nta reddit is so strange about bodily autonomy sometimes it s do what you want with your hair until stuff like this comes up tbh it s not romantic or sexual to have someone else touch your hair by default it s your hair not an extension of your wife s desires
wow these comments are absolutely bananas you got your hair braided your wife not only went in on you about it she went full investigator mode on your friends she clearly has some insecurities we all do maybe ask her why she s feeling this strongly about twisted hair and see if there s a hidden deeper reason if not i would seriously talk to her about her trust issues nta
your wife is so damn insecure if someone can t braid your hair without her worth plummeting nta and she needs a lesson in trust and security
there is a deeper issue here your wife might be dealing with her own baggage and is mistreating pos calling you at the same time and does not trust you you need to have a frank heart to heart dialogue with her her reaction is something she needs to own and if she cannot do that so both of you can talk about what happened you would be well versed in seeking help it wont be good for you to be in a relationship where you have to walk on egg shells so that your wife does not explode wife and she cant be happy since there is clearly no trust from her towards you
so i think there is nothing wrong here at first glance just a strong need for some communication about what her and his thoughts on intimacy are at however her extended reaction makes me worried that she has experience in cheating whether it s been cheating or cheated on it tends to work like other trauma where it has a tendency to turn you into the abuser or gravitate you towards them if the guy is cheating then he knows he s the ah but what she s doing is gravitating towards the ah unless they can communicate people who consider cheating often look harder in their partners actions for cheating if it s all just smoke and mirrors than communication should solve it
maybe she s cheating and projecting onto you many cheaters start accusing their partner of cheating because they feel so guilty about what they re doing that start to see things where there s nothing
nta ur wife sounds insecure
nta she can be bothered by it all she wants but nothing inappropriate happened and your body your choice right ladies lol she went overboard by contacting your friends and acting weird you say this isn t normal behavior for her so i d ask her what she s hiding from you
nta and i m pretty sure your wife has cheated or is thinking about it nothing you did was even remotely close to crossing a line i have learned that when someone accuse their partner of cheating when there is zero evidence they are the guilty party and placing their guilt on you
nta her reaction is irrational to the point she spent the time calling people i m sure you can find better i personally don t have the patience for that kind of jealous nonsense
nta your wife is jealous and this triggered it she just needs reassurance and if that doesn t work some working out on trust issues
so can he also not get his hair cut at a salon by a female stylist nta
i m going to go with nah i ve had my hair braided by friends before i do think it can be seen as intimate by folks although i personally don t see it that way i m guessing your wife feels like it s something that only she should be allowed to do and she became very upset now i don t agree with calling you a pos but once she calms down i hope you two can discuss this further apologize to her for making her upset clarify that you only thought about the logical side of keeping the hair braided out of the way and not the intimate implications and promise to not allow for this to happen again
nta but you need to sit your wife down and get to the bottom of why she is making such a big deal out of this braiding hair isn t something that i see as an intimate thing because my friends and i used to do it all the time as kids you definitely need to work this out with your wife
nta that is weirdly insecure
nta if it s like you described no one is a ah for having their hair braided
nta it s totally normal for friends to braid each others hair sounds like there s a deeper issue here
nta i ve had guy friends braid my hair girl friends braid my hair anyone who asked i braided their hair it doesn t bother me it s just a nice gesture my partner really doesn t care about it so that does make me happy
some of you women remind me of the one i ve run across i see a man with his shirt collar messed up i say excuse me let me fix your collar he says sure woman goes ape shit at me saying i shouldn t be touching him i smile and say you shouldn t let him go out looking a mess basically get over yourselves if your that insecure talk it out like adults or get the divorce you re looking for btw not ta
nta this is insane levels of paranoia and insecurity can you get a massage from a female can you get a checkup from a female doctor reverse sexes to check your insanity level
nta hair braiding in my eyes is a purely platonic gesture no matter who s involved girls braid each other s hair all the time parents braid their children s hair etc it s not a romantic gesture a close friendly gesture sure but not romantic
nta your wife sounds insecure
nta based on what you said your wife doesn t trust you at all this behavior isn t normal interrogating your friends to see if you are cheating is uncalled for until you have given her enough reasons to not trust you
nta your wife has lost her mind
nta you can share close moments with friends without any sexual intentions behind it regardless of gender
you mentioned that maddie braids your hair before each hike and claim there s no intimacy or romanticism between you your wife may feel insecure b c you haven t asked her to braid or bun or tie up your hair before you leave but you make a point to save and share the experience with maddie
nta while i guess i can understand that this act is seen as extremely intimate by some folk if you didn t know that i don t think you were at fault for anything just maybe don t let a woman braid your hair again being that you know your wife is upset by this will say i think her reaction is extreme af and that is something y all might wanna talk about contacting the other folk on the trip and questioning them about your interactions w the braider is pretty inappropriate and should be addressed at some point
men and women go on a camping excursion i am married and pretty easy going i don t know a single married couple who would be totally okay with this scenario op is definitely leaving out some details
nta hair braiding is not an intimate activity sorry it s just not i let a woman that doesn t speak the same language as me braid my hair at work before does that mean me and leslie are fucking absolutely not it means she said she would braid my hair and i wanted her to lol
nta unless letting someone else braid your hair is a euphemism which i m fairly sure it isn t
nta
nta as long as there was no overt flirtation then no it s ok for another human being to braid your hair
i ll say nta my brother has braids and his gf doesn t braid it all the time because their work schedules conflict a little so he goes when she s at work to get his hair done so they can spend more time together when they re both off maybe it s just a black thing but many guys get their hair braided by someone thats not their partner
is your wife that kind of partner that stands over the barber hairstylist shoulder while you get a haircut
nta shes over reacting
seriously i have had dozens of people male and female braid my hair and i have never been intimate with any of them that is not even where my mind goes i get regular full body massages from both male and female massage therapists never been intimate with any of them husband gets full body massages too and i have never thought anything about it and sometimes my husband gets his haircut by a woman and it has never concerned me i guess some people see the world from a totally different perspective nta
nta so i was a hair dresser for a while and i don t see fixing anyone s hair as a romantic or sexual thing it s hard work and it usually stresses me because i want it to come out right but i know other people can and will view it differently i think you should talk to your wife and maybe let her braid it next time you go hiking
nta does she think you fuck your barber too jeez
nta i just watched a married women braid my adult son s hair in front of her husband no biggie to hubby i get why a woman might not like the idea but your wife did not handle this well she s acting like a jealous arse i ve always felt the intimacy part of hair braiding only happens when you are already intimate with each other your relationship makes it intimate otherwise it s just braiding a nice thing to do among friends your wife should have calmly told you how she felt about it and you two could have agreed in a boundary that you both can live with you didn t do something inherently wrong she did with her anger then silent treatment talk to each other
nta hair braiding between a guy girl can be seen as an intimate thing but you wife is completely overreaching if one of my guy friends asked me to braid their hair that s all it is just braiding their hair even if it s my boyfriend if she was playing in your hair then yeah it could would be seen as more
i mean boundries are different i guess this wouldn t bother me personally sooo nta for getting your hair braided but maybe kinda a little the ah for not recognizing your wife holds a different standard apologizing for the unintentional hurt doubt you caused her
honestly i think you re leaving pieces of the story out to make everything seem okay i think it s understandable for her to be uncomfortable with that but her reaction is way outside the norm if there weren t already fidelity issues concerns in the marriage also you really didn t need to have your hair braided to be out of your face pony tail bun would be fine as i man with long hair you know this so i think you need to ask yourself the real reason you wanted maddie to braid your hair you don t need to be honest on here but i hope you re honest with yourself nah
nta but now that you know your wife is bothered by it ybta if it happened again in the future
nta could she be projecting might need to call all her friends and see if she s been behaving inappropriately with anyone
and here i m now thinking every time i go to my female barber i m skirting the line with infidelity my daughter has a cosmetology license and has cut my hair a few times as well is that incest i m sooooo confused now of course my hair has never been long enough to consider braiding so i guess it s totally not the same thing and i ll never understand the potential insensitivity there
esh your wife for reacting for contacting other people and checking up on you that way however i think it s inappropriate to let another woman brush stroke and braid your hair girls braid each other s hair mainly when they are close friends it is a sign of closeness between couples it is an act of intimacy info why didn t your wife go on the trip and were the others also married unless there was a solid reason it seems odd to me to go away with this group were any of them couples
nta but my bf did this lol it was not okay for me made me uncomfortable tbh
my current judgment is nta because this is something i ve done for male friends before and it s never been anything romantic for me or my friends i am wondering if this is your first trip away since being married and your wife has seen doing your hair as something special between the two of you and she didn t expect anyone else to braid your hair i do think her reaction is somewhat over the top still has she ever met maddie because if she hasn t this could be case of her thinking the worst and her anxiety getting the best of her
nta but it is strange that your wife behaviour changed so drastically all of a sudden do you know if something happend is she sick hormonal imbalance maybe pregnant
your wife is a fucking jealous maniac leave before she starts getting violent with you

nta you only have three spare tickets that s just reality they can accept your kind offer or not when it s on your dime you can invite whoever you want
nta bil can pay for himself if he wants to go
nta if my sil wanted to take my wife and kids to disney or really anywhere on an all expense paid trip i would worship at her feet i would of course try to also go but if i couldn t afford it i would still thank her profusely if your bil or sister make a stink about this invite other friends hi friend here
nta you can only take three other people and if they all really want him to go they can pay for him and still get a trip for most of their family for free there s no downside for them
nta your bil can pay for himself if he wants to go it will be so much cheaper than trying to take his whole family on his own
ummm you won the tickets girlfriend you are going lol simple as that lol don t you dare give your ticket away you won that you enjoy disneyland you will have a blast
nta but be upfront about only tickets available for them
nta i would have a convo with your sister see what shakes out i would offer the tix for her the kids to come with you they can either accept or decline if she doesn t want to go with the kids w o her husband they could pay for him or alternate idea maybe they would consider just you taking the kids with your mom or something idk i would not be willing to split the costs of adding a person primarily b c you are gonna be paying the income tax on the value of your winnings
just have a conversation with your sister and bil about what you should do
nah because there isn t any conflict you won tickets and it s kind of you to extend the invite they can decide if they want to go at all and decide if it s worth it to buy more tickets so both adults can come
nah have a back up if they can t go if bil wants to go they can pay the cost you winning a trip for shouldn t cost you money for your bil to attend also look at what the prize says about the accommodations it may be one room with beds and a 5th person isn t allowed in the room edit changed from nta to nah congrats and enjoy
nta but speak to your sister and bil before mentioning it to anyone else explain the situation with the free ticket and offer them but say you understand if they can t afford to pay for another ticket and if they decide not to go because they can t go as a family that s a fair decision
absolutely nta it s logical to invite your sister and nieces if there were five tickets bil could join you but there isn t he should be thrilled his kids get to visit dl and you sisters get time together if he wants to go then he needs to pay for it if he gets upset then he has a lot of maturing to do have fun
nta it s your tickets the first one is for you and the other three is for whoever you want to bring
nta you won the tickets and are willing to give to sil and nieces to enjoy if bil wants to go also he can pay his own way it will still be lots cheaper than taking a family of
nta talk to your sister about the options and see if they d be willing to pay for him to come if he wants to also check accommodations if they ll work out for people vs still going be cheaper than them having to pay for all four of them going also perhaps your bil would prefer to come instead of your sister just a thought too
nta congrats on winning if they ask you to contribute money to him joining the trip take friends along instead
you won the tickets you did not intentionally plan a trip to disney with the thought to exclude bil don t just give your tickets away as another redditor suggested this is a gift from the universe to you so enjoy it it is awfully sweet and gracious of you to want to include your sister and nieces there is nothing wrong with taking a little girls trip just tell your sister you really want her and her daughters to share the experience with you but that you tried looking at your finances and you can t afford to foot bil s stay as well you never know bil might love disney but he still might thoroughly enjoy a weekend to himself while you all live it up with mickey mouse i hope you have so much fun eta nta
nta when you invite your sister and nieces make it clear you would also welcome bil but cannot afford to cover his trip so they have the option of him coming along if they can swing the costs
nta but if they say no don t make it a problem just find other people to go or give them the tickets if you can t find people so that way it s not wasted or expired on you
big time nta this is a truly kind gesture first you do not know all of their financial situation or at least you should not who knows maybe they can afford to bring bil around or perhaps he is not a big disney fan and would not mind having some quiet time while you are away with his family secondly as a father myself i would be disappointed not to go but i would be totally thrilled for my children to have this opportunity hopefuly bil can see this congrats
nta but explain this to your sister
yes take the nieces and let your sister have some alone time with her husband
yes you are always the asshole if you have to ask if you re the asshole
honestly i would give the trip to their family but i guess i m just a bette person than you are

nta but i would add that when you tell them about the trip make it clear that you re not snubbing bil out of dislike or anything like that it would be easy for him to feel slighted in this situation so i would make sure he knew why he needs to pay his own way
nta you take whoever you want to take if that is your sister and nieces great if that is a group of bffs great if bil complains too bad
nta bil can pay if he wants to go nothing wrong with a girl bonding trip either
nta talk to your sister say you d like to extend the invite to her and the girls and bil is welcome to join if they pay for it that you only have three extra tickets one is yours and you will not be paying any additional money for him as this is a free trip that you otherwise would not be able to afford
ywnbta you won the tickets offer to your sister and her kids bil can either have the house to himself for a couple of days or he can pay for himself
nta
just say to your sister i won tickets hotel and air to disney land and i want you guys to come i can t afford the extra ticket for all of you so how do you want to do this nah but overthinking a bit
nta if they can t accept that there are only extra tickets then they can t go and you should go with some friends or other relatives and have fun
nta but i would recoment to tell your bil something like hey i just won tickets for disneyland and i would like to go you can go but i only have tickets so you would need to pay yours
nta but it sounds kind of sweet that you would all split the cost one of the tickets and go as a family i definitely don t think you have an obligation to
you are giving sister and the two children a free trip it s up to them to pay bil s fare if he wants to go too nta
nta you ll all have more fun without him
nta enjoy your trip
nta you only have tickets you re not obligated to pay for anyone else
i would just be upfront that you only have three free tickets bil is welcome but he will have to pay for his ticket and flights i wouldn t assume to know their circumstances his family might put money towards it instead of birthday and christmas presents they might have been putting savings aside for a family holiday they can t afford yet but will cover the cost of just bil to disney he might be able to swing some overtime second job to make it happen he might have to miss out but the important thing is he isn t excluded and you let them decide if he can or can t go
nta but please talk with your sister privately and ask her help to arrange it ie no surprise announcement in front of the kids until arrangements are worked out with her and she has had time to plan with her husband
worst case scenario he gets alone time at the house nta
thank you
nta if someone said they wanted to take my kids and oh to disneyland leaving me alone for a few days i would worship the ground that they walk on i love disney as well but a peaceful quiet clean house the ability to spend time in the gym and drink wine every night that s invaluable ps op is definitely nta
right the dad just needs to view his ticket cost and divide it by four then be very happy his who family went on vacation for so cheap and op shouldn t pay for a single one of their own drinks all trip because they are so thankful for the multi thousand dollar gift
vacation with nan and the kids sounds better
he might get very limited time off with the whole family and if they decide not to go then i don t think he s immature it s just a decision for the sister and bil to make
depending on the bil relationship i would feel awkward sharing accommodations and taking the kids with just him like replacement mom for the trip it makes the most sense to align with my actual sibling
really you sound like an ah rather than a better person
i would make it clear you expect them to pay without being rude of course op won the tickets op should pay nothing more than she would if she went by herself
he may enjoy that anyway good point
be aware if the fact that you re going to owe taxes on the value of the entire trip nta and just have a conversation about it and consider that you may not be able to afford the taxes which could be more than an extra ticket
my aunt and uncle asked to take my girls to disney next year and i worshiped the ground they walk on my girls are obsessed with disney and my wife and i hate amusement parks with a fiery passion and my wife and i get days with no kids for the first time in years
most parents would want to see their kid s experience disney it would be more hurtful to exclude the parents and better to be up front on the invite being for everyone if bil pays his own trip nan can come too but nan pays herself
nope giving away a entire vacation for sounds like an ah move i d hate to see what you don t consider an ah then
nah calling yourself a better person than someone because they didn t want to give up their spot on a vacation they paid for makes you an ah

nta i hate to suggest this but you may want to get your mom screened for alzheimer s sudden aggression like this can be one of the symptoms
paranoia and violence like this is often the first sign that dementia has advanced have your mother medically evaluated immediately do not give her the money until she has passed an evaluation my guess is that it s going to be time to consider additional care options nah since your mom is probably not in control of her actions
nah from your description of your mother s behavior these may be signs of early dementia it is common for people with dementia to become paranoid and out of control with their emotions and to say shocking and out of character things can you get your mother to the doctor for an evaluation if she does have dementia there are a lot of medical legal and logistical decisions that you and your sister need to work out
nta get the mother evaluated for psychological neurological issues her new behavior is a classic sign of dementia alzheimer s if she was generally kind and decent but is now suspicious and verbally abusive she needs an evaluation
info when was the last time your mother visited the doctor paranoia and behavior changes can be early signs of dementia please talk to her physician about this and please reach out to your community elder care services if available caregiving long term is really hard and your sister likely needs a break and or additional help
nta that can be a symptom of dementia or alzheimers my late grandfather hat that too for the last year of his life when he had to be moved to a hospice he even acoused the cargivers to steal his money that he didn t have
nta as a person advances in aging personality changes like this can occur i ve lived through it and am sorry to hear that you are now no you should not give her the money she is probably not of a right mind and there is no telling who would target her if they knew she had cash best of luck to you
nta the poor dear wouldn t be able to properly manage her money and i truly believe that you and your sister have only your mom s best interests at heart your mom sadly is clearly suffering from some type of mental decline it s obvious considering the paranoia and verbal abuse i wish i had better advice than the usual she needs a doctor and maybe round the clock professional care i can only assure you that you are doing the right thing good luck
absolutely nta i m so sorry for you and your sister it sounds like your mother may have had a medical problem come up that is making her act this way i would start with her doctor and go from there being a caregiver is the most exhausting job on the planet and you and your sister are incredible
nah it sounds like she may be starting to suffer from dementia or something similar i would see about an evaluation then go from there
if your mother isn t under a conservatorship you have no right to withhold het money from her
time to get mom into gov t funded living your sister doesn t have to listen to that edit to add nta
nta but this is above reddit s pay grade maybe create a ledger something you can help her track the transactions strange as it sounds get her checked for a uti if it is sudden it could be a symptom of an infection happened with my grandmother
let me just tell you that what your mother is fearful of is something that happens quite often my aunt did it with my late great grandmother she had dementia her doctor had to provide a note to the cops so they would stop coming to her house or filing a report regarding my mom having her car when she legally could not drive herself it caused some shit in the family the police were involved while your mother may be suffering from a mental illness in her old age she might be justified all the same until her doctor can give you a form diagnosis you should heed your mother s insecurities your sister needs to provide you your mother with monthly statements from the bank that you go to the bank watch her receive from the teller nothing against your sister but this should help your mom feel more at ease it is your mother s money she can call the cops if she doesn t receive it it is her right to have her money regardless of how you feel about it all make sure she has a book ledger to write everything down in she can check against her own notes about the money make sure she keeps every receipt unfortunately yta give your mom her money get her an evaluation at her doctor s

nah but i m with the other commenters she needs to be evaluated by a doctor because this isn t healthy behavior if she can t take care of herself physically or mentally then you also need to talk to a lawyer about getting something put in place to give one of you power of attorney as well if the doctor says nothing is wrong with her then give her the money and find a care facility for her because no one should have to put up with this if the doctor says something is wrong cognitively then it s still time to look at a care facility your sisters kid could be at risk
nah the aggression and paranoia may be symptoms of a burgeoning mental disorder
nta your mother definitely needs a full physical and screening her behavior is very telling she may need more care than she is able to receive in your sister s home good luck
nta but your mom might be suffering from dementia she might need to live where she can be taken care of if your sister is being targeted have your mom seen by a doctor
this is bigger than the money imho i think you might want to get your mother looked at for early signs of dementia paranoia is a common sign nah
nta she needs a dementia screening not a pile of money stuffed in her mattress she could also have a uti they can cause delirium in older people
nta i agree about the dementia testing also uti s
nta if she can t clean herself you should look into having your mother conserved and tested for dementia it s not cheap but an argument could be made that legally what you re doing is wrong as it s is technically her money
nta dementia can present like this get her evaluated
nta have her screened for dementia and also a uti
nta sounds like dementia maybe time to look for a care facility
nta but i would tell mom that if she wants the pension payments then she can go find somewhere else to live and stop mistreating your sister
this is very sad and i m sorry it s happening nta at all and i agree with everyone else that she needs to be evaluated for dementia
nta but your mother needs to go to a neurologist she is almost
nta paranoia is a classic sign of early dementia your sister by the way is fully justified in receiving a small amount of rent from your mother to cover the costs of basically putting a roof over her head but honestly i m not sure your mother would understand that logic depending on how bad she is the good news is you and your sister are united and this will be very important for you in months to come as you ll have some tough decisions please seek advice sadly this is a well trodden path for many of us
as much as it s also a sign of dementia and alzheimer s sudden behavior changes in the every can also be a sign of a bladder or urinary tract infection please get her checked out by a doctor
nta i also second a medical screening for your mother but as she had uncontrolled diabetes i would recommend getting her kidneys checked as well if her kidneys aren t functioning properly toxins build up and can cause dementia like symptoms utis can also cause neurological symptoms
nta put her in a nursing home
yup this is very common in old people when they suddenly start hiding money here there and everywhere accusing people of steal from them my gran bless her soul accused the meter man when he came to check the meter and she hid some money in the toilet cistern in a plastic bag it wasn t a lot but still
exactly the earliest signs of my grandma s dementia were her continued accusations that my grandpa was stealing her money that continued for at least a decade until my grandpa died nta
that was my thought too behaviour like this is very common with alzheimer s
this
in the medical community there is increasing support for type diabetes which is dementia as person who has been severely ill for years nearly amputated limbs would be prime candidate for such an out come source mother has dementia is diabetic as is my whole biological family from my grand parents down so i keep a deep personal interest even if i am not good at controlling my illness
i generally agree sounds like she may be cognitively declining and having a conservatorship would be the best for her also maybe a conversation about compensating the daughter for the cost of housing and care
i was caretaker for my grandmother and i had to start keeping cash only in my purse if it was left out anywhere she would take it hide it and i wouldn t find it again for months if ever lol
i came here to say this definitely sounds like dementia lived through it with my mother i finally gave her and change in small bills and coins to keep in her room my daughter took me aside as she was leaving from visiting her gram saying gram has all of her money and all of her chocolates in bed under the cover with her because she s afraid you re going to steal them thought you d want to know before the candy melts i went into my mom s room and told her i didn t want her money or her chocolate she could keep her money wherever she wanted i also gave her a very fancy gaudy bowl and told her the candy needed to be kept in the bowl on her nightstand not under the covers and we were cleaning out her house i almost threw some shoeboxes away after i put the shoes in a bin to be donated something made me check under the tissue paper in all there was more than in about shoeboxes she was wily

she is a scammer and you should not get suckered by her sob stories nta
no and this is why you get a property manager rentals are doable solo tho you are much kinder than most rather than work on a mutually beneficial solution the tenant is trying to guilt trip you you are a landlord and she is a tenant if there is a contract in place the moment she tried her bs she should be getting a notice you have given her one too many chances to come up with a solution send her packing
nta i ve been a landlord and this tenant needs to go if it s this bad on month it is only going to get worse i used to live in the duplexes i had and know how a bad tenant can give you anxiety there is a housing shortage from what i understand and you can do better
nta she played stupid games and she lost this is on her
nta
nta she signed a contract and didn t go about adjusting it with you if her finances changed you gotta do what you gotta do
nta
nta i don t even like the concept of landlords
nta and if she acts this way in the first month it definitely does not bode well for the future you re better with her out
nta the player couldn t handle her own game
nta she s trying to play you she doesn t have the rent money it s normal to feel bad evicting someone especially with children but she broke the lease you sound like someone who would have tried to work with her if she would have been honest with you
nta there are a lot of single moms out there who pay their bills on time and don t shove questionable repair fees at their landlords does it suck on a humanitarian level sure but if i am reading this correctly this is month one it s like being several hours late to your first day at a new job the fact is if you don t get that rent you can t pay the mortgage and she d be homeless anyway when the house forecloses
yta for landlord
late fee is reasonable every day is not that is excessive i don t think any judge would award you that you re not out of line for refusing to pay for repairs that weren t approved but those late fees are outrageous

just because it s in the lease doesn t mean it would hold up in court california for example says late fees have to be reasonable if is that means rent is and after days you d be charging two months rent days would be three months rent owed abd by the end of the month they wound owe you months rent absolutely no just would award you months rent when the renter missed one month and why did you say it s in the lease unfortunately it s your lease it s not unfortunate it s the terms you chose

you have a teenager who has a stepparent and half siblings that you excluded from a fun family day all because you assumed not only would she not want to go but that she wouldn t even like to be asked to be part of the family yta
yta even if she was still feeling insecure you should at least ask her if she wanted to come don t decide for her
very very soft yta you were trying to be considerate but a little communication could have solved this next time just ask do not assume glad your daughter is feeling better about her body image issues
yta she doesn t need to tell you about her therapy for you to ask how she s doing and to invite her to join also yta for just not inviting her instead of helping her gain self confidence
it s always nice to be invited my younger son hates going to the beach but i still invite him when i take the other two kids and make time later that week to do something he does like instead
yta but i don t think it was intentional of course you still ask her to join you for things it s how she eventually gets over her insecurities she already feels awkward about her body she doesn t now need to feel like an outcast from her family
when you are talking about a teenager anything and everything can change over night it is always best to just ask because if they turn you down then they have no room to complain honestly i think you daughter came out ahead because while you were swimming she was shopping but i guess she doesn t feel that way nah just ask next time there is nothing insensitive about just asking
nta based on the fact that daughter was unavailable to go swimming bc she was out shopping at the time would it have been nice to shoot her a text yeah but unless she was able to drop what she was doing i don t think it s fair to the other kids to not go or to wait until everyone could
info is there something stopping you from just saying okay good to know next time i ll definitely ask and moving on
you said she felt like that before she started therapy months ago why did you assume nothing changed why wouldn t it at least be worth letting her know so she could make her own choice with it there literally is a way you could have know asking her yta
nah effective communication is a learned skill and she a teen who needs to learn to communicate properly which will hopefully happen in time you respected her boundaries as the last time she communicated she felt uncomfortable maybe as a parent explaining the importance of communication and setting a good example might be helpful but you arent an asshole this all comes down to a lack of communication
yta don t make decisions on other people s behalf unless they ve told you previously their feelings on the subject specifically i get that your intention was to prevent her from feeling bad but avoiding difficult situations isn t a good way to get around that you could have just said you were thinking of going swimming and asked her if she d like to join but leave it open for her to decline depending on how she felt that would have been the ideal solution
nah yeah you could have asked but i don t think you re ta for not doing so she said her bit about swimming costumes so you took it on board and acted accordingly now she s told you otherwise it s time to act accordingly again
nta you re not psychic i find it a little odd that people are claiming yta here
yta you should of invited her and if she said no then there you go at least you reached out but to just not say anything is rude and plus sounds like she was just telling you how she feels about her body doesn t mean she doesn t want to be involved in family activities geez
nah you respected her privacy and feelings that includes acting on old information you are the stepmother to an anxious teenager you both deserve grace here i think the answer is going forward invite even while expecting decline
well now that you know she would be comfortable going swimming and wearing a bathing suit in public you can absolutely invite your daughter to go swimming with the family but you aren t a mindreader and her therapy sessions are private how could you know about her change in attitude you aren t a mindreader don t feel bad you went swimming and you did it when she was out doing something fun too it doesn t seem like she was too upset you went and did something you know she had been uncomfortable doing and it doesn t sound like she has been trying to stop anybody else in the family from going swimming either nta
nta just invite her since now you cannot read mind and sometimes teenagers are really sensitive about this topics
nah she told you she wasn t comfortable wearing a swim suit and you responded by not trying to get her to go swimming instead you did that activity when she was doing something else she has now told you that she is fine with that activity so you ll invite her in the future you are not a mind reader if she doesn t tell you things have changed how were you supposed to know if you had asked them the odds are the reply would have been something along the lines of i told you i don t like to do that why don t you ever listen
yta while you were trying to be considerate not even being asked probably made her insecure as well as she feels she s not apart of the family even just asking her would have fixed the problem as then she gets to choose whether she d like to go or not
nah you were being sensitive not wanting to bring up a subject you knew was difficult for her if she d wanted you to know she should have told her i mean if you tell people you don t like meat they aren t going to invite you when going to a steak house now are they
nta you just have a teenager it s impossible to please them ny advice wait years before talking to her full stop
nah apologize again tell her you truly didn t mean to exclude her and that you plan on taking the whole family swimming again very soon maybe you could even offer to go swimsuit shopping with her and get her a new one to make her feel nice
yta what s wrong with her wearing shorts a t shirt to swim
nah simple misunderstanding and now you know teenagers change their minds about everything all the time and you can t always win you had good intentions that didn t go well and now you both can communicate better in the future
nah but next time check in with her rather than assuming it s a single instance shouldn t be a big deal
yta always offer she can decline if she wants to
yta
nta but you could have quietly asked your daughter if she wanted to come when it was just the two of you and the rest of the family wasn t around teenagers are hypersensitive and you are obviously trying to do your best for your child apologize to her and make sure she knows about the next family outing beforehand
nta your daughter was doing something fun already shopping simple fix is to say i m sorry i didn t ask because you were busy but next time we can absolutely make a day of swimming together as a family
yta why don t you spend some time talking to her and if necessary looking at swimsuits together there are so many styles now some look more like little dresses some have long sleeves or shorts etc
nah it sounds like she had other plans anyways but now that you know she wants to you can find another time that works for everyone and go again
nah you could ve asked but you were being sensitive to a body image issue that you didn t know was resolved she told you she had an issue but didn t tell you it was resolved you could ask periodically but that would make me feel like i was being rushed in my healing
yta i get you were trying to be considerate but you should ve asked just to be sure you want her to move past her insecurities and letting her take the steps to do it is how it s done if you re swimming then it must be warm out so maybe you could all go swimming again soon that way she can be invited this time or you could ask if she d like to go swimming with just you
yta where have  been when she was suffering this
she s a moody teenager female at that it s highly normal for young women to experience poor body image time to time given today s value on beauty that should not be a reason for therapy alone my guess is deeper family issues going on no reason to elaborate how i d handle when i trust there are significant details lacking
yta all you had to do was ask but it seems you came up with a plausible reason to exclude her hits close to home being often excluded because you aren t liked but they still have to keep up appearances so they blame you for the reason you weren t invited oh i didn t think you could i didn t think you d like etc etc etc excuses excuses if you care you ask instead of assuming you know the answer even if she said no you would have made her feel included and she had a choice in the matter and worse you made it her fault for not inviting her over something she mentioned to you using her words against her this is how you alienate your kids step kids but either that was the point or you need to work on your people skills
yta she mentioned not liking the swimsuits not the actual activity get her a rashguard and some swimshorts and stop excluding her from wholefamily activities this is how blended families fall apart bc it s gonna be perceived as step family vs bio family
nta you can take her swimming the rest of her life
yta
she then told me that she doesn t feel like that anymore since therapy and i could ve asked so why is your daughter better at using her words than you are it s right there you could have asked
i said to her that there was no way i could ve known that and i just wanted to be sensitive to her situation so did you just totally ignore the previous sentence where she said you could ve asked yta you didn t have to say tell me what happened in therapy today all you had to say was want to come swimming later
way to exclude your daughter from your new family she told you she felt insecure about wearing a swimming costume so you excluded her from a family day out for this reason doesn t compute for me what about the fact that it was a day out for the family or that she couldve still gone swimming wearing shorts and a t shirt seems to me you found a great excuse not to include her and you made it seem right simply by saying she felt insecure about wearing swimmers yta
yta
yta you should have still asked
i said to her that there was no way i could ve known that there was one way yta
couldn t you have said to your daughter i wanted to let you know we are making plans to go swimming on this day if you want to come we would love that but it is ok if you do not wish to the decision is yours
i said to her that there was no way i could ve known that yes there is you could have asked her if she felt up for going with i had friends that were not comfortable going to certain events bars pool clubs etc but i always let them know that the event was happening and if they felt like coming they were invited sometimes they did more often they didnt of course we hung out at other places they wanted at other times but sometimes a group of us wanted to go to a bar and play pool going was their choice you didn t give her the choice that s why yta don t assume how other people feel or what they decide you might be surprised
i guess i just don t understand how hard it is to ask a question yta for not even trying
soft yta as someone who prefers to stay home over going out i still appreciate being asked thats just a nice thing to do also shes a teenager her mood will probably change daily might be fine today and insecure tomorrow thats just how teens are
yta hey we re going to go swimming this afternoon would you like to come takes two seconds is harmless if the answer is no thanks and doesn t give her the impression that you ve completely written her off as a failed member of the family
yta you could absolutely have know you could have asked
soft yta for making it about her insecurities if she is out doing something fun it is fine to do something fun with the rest of the family but that is all it is do not punish her for her insecurities also there are tons of forms of swimwear that are less revealing she should have had some choices a long time ago
yta you knew she was in therapy and honestly you could have said hey we are planning on going swimming how do you feel about coming along ans left the choice up to her but instead you completely left her out because she doesn t like wearing the costume she doesn t have to tell you about her sessions but you should always check how your children feel about things you know have bothered them
nah
nah you should have asked but you thought you were being respectful of her insecurities she should have told you she had made progress in therapy since neither communicated you were on different pages and it s a massive miscommunication
nah
yta
yta she could have come along and dipped her toes in the water or sat by the water and read a book while you all swam she could have just worn shorts and a t shirt so no you weren t being sensitive because you excluded her from something that the entire family did

the answer is not exclude her it s ask her if she wants to come with you without pressuring her or even find out what swimsuit she s comfortable wearing and buy her one look i m that person who spent years wearing swim trunks over a one piece because of assorted body issues the right answer was never excluding me from swimming for it yta
nta though even if you know she would decline you should still give her the opportunity i know someone who cant eat food yet they still appreciate being offered it at dinner
yta sounds like you want to punish her for not sharing her personal therapy sessions with you
it s going swimming at the local pool not going to paris they can all go again the next day this isnt some campaign if exclusion is the rest of the family supposed to sit at home doing nothing everytime teen does something fun with her friends just in case she feels left out nah
this she said she hates swim costumes not that she hates swimming it took me til i was in my 30s to feel comfortable in a swimsuit my whole life i wore shirts and board shorts to swim but just because i always stated i hate swimsuits doesn t mean i didn t want to be invited to swim yta but a soft one
err sorry where exactly did the teen fail communication wise did the teen ever ask not to be invited to swim events sure doesn t sound like that sounds like parent simply assumed saying that you struggle with feeling uncomfortable in a swimsuit is absolutely not the same thing as expressing a boundary in terms of invitations lots of people intentionally chose to participate in swimming stuff despite feeling uncomfortable in a swimsuit and would be absolutely crushed to be excluded when they d never asked for that if someone tells me about something they struggle with and doesn t give specific boundaries to me i understand that they re talking with me for comfort i don t assume that they re secretly asking me to change my behaviour if i m unsure i ask what they want maybe the daughter would have liked to go shopping for a cover up or different suit maybe the daughter would have appreciated invites being issued privately so she could decline without pressure or maybe she just wanted someone to listen and be understanding and supportive tbh i would expect this behaviour more from passive aggressive types who use anything you say against you then i would from a supportive parent from the daughter s perspective she confided in a parent and had it used against her and when she got upset was told that it was on her to update her parent about her emotional state so that the parent can decide what to invite her to or not that s incredibly patronising behaviour that s really inappropriate for a teenager and it s the parent here who failed communication wise not the kid
this is what my immediate thought was too that op is not a mind reader nta naturally things can change going forward i do not understand the y t a s at all
but you aren t a mindreader and her therapy sessions are private how could you know about her change in attitude you aren t a mindreader but the stepdaughter is a mind reader how exactly was the step daughter supposed to know that the stepmom had decided not to invite her to any swimming events in the future no the stepmom can t be expected to be a mind reader that s why she shouldn t be running around making decisions for her stepdaughter without even informing her about daughter of those decisions if the stepdaughter was so uncomfortable that she didn t even want to be invited to anything pool related she could ask for that she didn t because expressing discomfort with something doesn t mean you never want to do it much less that you never want the option to stepmom had every opportunity when the topic was raised to ask if she could help and how she could help she didn t of the time someone complains about not being able to be a mind reader it s because they made a giant fucking assumption on behalf of someone else and it didn t work out
probably the possibility of being the only one there wearing those types of clothes drawing even more attention to her when she s already self conscious better to ask the daughter on this one
deleted
to me the issue is that defensiveness creeping into her response just go with something like i m sorry and happy that you want to join us then plan another swimming outing
you don t even have to swim to hang out at the pool with your family even if she was still uncomfortable wearing a swimming costume she could have sat nearby with a book or something still being part of the family
well they are all well you can ask and can t they see how aggravating that could be to the person in therapy that it could be taken as pushy or intrusive
swimming costume means bathing suit in europe
exactly op said her daughter does not share what goes on in therapy with her

if this is you being slightly jealous i shudder to think what you re like when you are jealous yta you are a terrible friend to her and you re bitter and spiteful stop trying to get internet strangers to co sign on your hideous behavior
yta you tried to sabotage their connection because of an innocent crush admit it you weren t trying to protect him
yta you couldn t sound more jealous if you tried she hasn t wasted her talent she clearly just has many of them and you shouldn t belittle them to other people
yta you re envious to the point of damaging your twelve year old relationship it annoyed you that a person you re not married to or in a relationship expressed an interest in another person that you are not married to or in a relationship with languages and instruments are hobbies and they re not pretentious in and of themselves you let your innocent crush on a man you aren t involved with damage your friendship and you blame it all on her because she s better than you yta
i admit i m slightly jealous slightly remember comparison is the thief of happiness happiness is not a zero sum game something good happening to her doesn t have any negative effects on you oh yta
yta it s not her fault that she s doing something she loves or that she doesn t have kids or that you re not as thin or smart or whatever else you re jealous of her for you went out of your way to try to sabotage sonia s relationship with john even though you admittedly could never have a relationship with because you re married keep your bitterness to yourself if you spent half the time improving yourself as you spend complaining about sonia and probably anyone else you see that happens to be happy and or succesful maybe you wouldn t hate your life so much
yta with friends like you who needs enemies if your jealousy makes it impossible for you to be her friend just leave her alone also your husband gets to share the yta judgement my husband thinks i should ve kept my mouth shut he doesn t like sonia but he thinks john had a right to at least sleep with her if he wanted to a right to sleep with her ugh no wonder you re jealous that she s single and free to do as she pleases
yta what exactly did you try to explain that you re an asshole who shit talks her supposed friend
yta being a successful writer isn t a waste of potential learning instruments and languages literally are hobbies what else would they be her sleep schedule and deciding not to have children is irrelevant her goals are different to yours and your jealously around this bit makes it sound like you resent your own child for stopping you living your life how she lives hers she has a right to be angry and your husband sounds like a pig actually not a pig because they re smart and cute and he s just gross get past this jealousy or drop the friendship because she deserves better
yta this is dripping with jealousy
yta first of all learning a new language or musical instrument in your spare time as an adult is a hobby second you are jealous af of your friend third you are a hater and you told him she was pretentious because you are jealous you aren t her friend and all and i m glad she knows now everyone is right about you this was ugly and meanspirited
my advice don t apologize don t even call her furthermore block her on everything and block john as well then you will be out of their lives you are not her friend anymore well i guess you never really were her friend she can live her happy life with or without john and you can live your life with your jealousy problem solved and yes yta
yta sonia sounds like a lovely very interesting person you come across as jealous petty and self righteous
yta sonia is your best friend and you bad mouthed her out of jealousy your priority should ve been sonia rather than john you definitely owe her an apology and if i were your best friend i would ve distanced myself from you knowing that someone who claims to be your best friend has said someting like that is hurtful
yta for definite but your husband is a spectacular arsehole who the fuck does he think he is claiming that his friend had a right to sleep with her as if she s a dolly who doesn t get an opinion mind you he s perfect for you your entire post reeks of envy and spite you and your husband deserve each other try to keep away from other people
this can t be real but in the case this isn t some awful trolling info how are learning languages and instruments not hobbies what do you consider hobbies you decided to have a child how is that anyone s fault i don t have children does that make me selfish no my husband and i talked and our goals for life were not congruent with having kiddos neither way is good or bad it s just a personal choice it sounds like you regret jumping into something like motherhood and are sad others made a different decision that s not being selfish why should she be financially responsible for your personal decisions that part completely got me if you re financially struggling don t have any more kids these are things that should be well thought out decisions not spur of the moment let s make a baby convos jealousy is a bad look on you oh yea yta
yta of course life sucks the world is a hard place the best we can do is not be crap to reach other and you can t even manage to be decent to your best friend if you don t like her don t be friends with her but don t pretend to be friends with someone just so you can sabatoge them
yta you re also petty jealous and a lousy friend do better
yta she might have viewed you as her best friend but you re a jealous manipulative and pathetic excuse for a friend sonia has already proven to be better at you than so many things and yet by being a horrible friend you ve just proven another area where you fail in comparison maybe some self reflection and work on yourself would do you good
yta jealousy looks bad on you
why do you not think learning languages is a hobby
you know what the worst part is not only is she prettier than you not only is she smarter than you not only does she have a better life than you no even worse is i can guarantee she s nicer than you apologize and face your raging jealousy yta
yta you suck op
yta you let your jealousy take over here you definitely shouldn t have said anything at all and i feel like you do owe her an apology
yta sure you are also a loser
i love her to bits blegh you are a terrible friend yta x1000
yta you talked badly about her and it got back to her time to face the consequences it really does sound like you re extremely jealous of her in how you phrased everything you should do a little self reflection on that
yta and it s sad because she probably loves you just for you and instead you re jealous and judgmental of her
info do you even actually like sonia you sound like a terrible jealous friend
yta you sound awful your friend s life choices shouldn t bother you like this get some therapy you tried to ruin john s perception of her because you are jealous and it backfired on you you totally deserve it i hope sonia realizes she s better off without a friend like you and cuts contact with you
yeah you re a mega asshole and so insanely jealous of your friend it s actually sad yta
yta i don t think your innocent crush is so innocent this isn t high school grow ip
yta you re also not a friend
yta you should really stop calling yourself sonia s friend because you re clearly not her friend at all slightly jealous my ass the jealousy is just dripping off of you and honey it ain t cute because apparently learning languages or an instrument is a hobby to her why wouldn t these things be hobbies i m absolutely baffled a hobby is an activity done regularly in one s leisure time for pleasure if that s what she does with her leisure time why wouldn t they be hobbies most of my hobbies are along these lines am i also pretentious to you because i enjoy learning japanese and french and german and how to play the guitar and the fiddle frankly it comes off as though you re bitter about the life choices you ve made and how your life has worked out and you re taking it out on sonia grow up
yta for saying supporting yourself writing romance novels is a waste of potential writing is hard work
yta for your judgment on how she lives her life
if this is how you think about and treat your best friend how do you treat people you don t consider to be friends yta
yta you were not being honest you were being jealous and spiteful you re a damn adult act like one sonia needs to drop you you are not her friend
nott going to read past the title if she s your best friend you wouldn t gossip about her end of story yta
i mean yeah yta if this were a real post you d be a real ahole
yta you sound incredibly jealous of your friend and tried to sabotage her with your crush
wow yta the whole thing just reeks of jealousy and bitterness
yta sonia sounds like she deserves a better best friend instruments and languages can be hobbies is it that she is too much or is it that you feel you are not enough it s okay to be jealous but you should not be taking it out on her or letting it warp your view of her if she has what you would like think about how you might go about getting it honestly i don t think you could love your friend and speak about her so disrespectfully
yta i m honestly surprised she s willing to accept an apology from you considering you apparently simmer in a stew of your own bitterness jealously and resentment
yta not only to sonia but to your husband you talked shit about her because you have a crush on john and keep him for yourself you are emotionally cheating on your husband you are clearly unhappy with your choices and jealous petty petty petty don t worry tho keep up you nonsense and you will have an opportunity to start life over and make all new mistakes maybe john will be looking for a middle aged divorcee then
your seething with jealousy over her you re also not her friend stop pretending to be and let her go liver her amazing child free life
yta it is clear that you are insanely jealous of your friend and tried to sabatoge a potential relationship if you really were her friend you wouldn t have done that yoh would have been excited that someone else took interest in her sounds like your friend has a lot of amazing and interesting qualities you on the other hand suck
yta you are so jealous of her it hurts
yta you sound extremely jealous and bitter that this friend is doing things that you can t you can t call her your best friend because that s not what best friends do and you definitely wouldn t be my friend after a stunt like that you are not someone i would want to have in my corner this is gross middle high school behavior
hopefully her and john have a wonderful long happy relationship far away from you
yta and come off sounding incredibly jealous and downright mean waste of potential really with friend like these
yta if you hate your own life that much make changes don t sabotage your friends happiness because you re miserable by the way just curious what do you do with your degree or is she the only wasting potential
yta so hard sonia sounds like a bad ass and you re so jealous it s making me cringe she s fine absolutely nothing to you whatsoever but you have a problem with just about everything she s blessed with good looks it s not fair she s chosen a career she likes what a waste of potential she has hobbies that she can master so pretentious a gorgeous guy shows interest in her oh let me sabotage the situation and spew venom are you listening to yourself
yta i hope she has reddit and i hope she sees this post and dump you as a friend you are a miserable jealous insecure person and she is too good for you
yta she s living her best life while you feel like your stuck on the side of the road with a flat tire i feel sorry for your family being stuck with a wife and mother who hates her life and spends her life plotting petty revenge against someone whose only crime is enjoying her life what s next in your campaign to punish this poor woman because everything comes so easy for her maybe mess with the brakes on her car a horrible accident and life in a wheelchair will teach her but even then she d be happier and better than you
yta she isn t your friend and can do better than you you re just a jealous hater from the sounds of things it s pretty sad at your age good luck with that i guess
yta you make it seem like you hate her for having different interests other than john apparently lol than you and that automatically makes her pretentious in your eyes i feel a little sorry for her having a bff like you that seems to want to bring her down rather than root for her
yta
yta you re not her friend you and your husband deserve each other and your whole post is dripping with jealousy btw do you know where the hobby of language learning which is pretty common btw leads you to communicate with people from all over the world and to have your toenails roll up about the bad grammar and spelling of a native speaker in your third language while they belittle other s for expanding their horizon learning new skills and educating themselves
you are not her friend it s clear that you despise her simply because she chooses to live her life differently from you learning languages is not pretentious writing romance novels does not make someone high maintenance the fact that you got so angry that your crush likes her demonstrates that this is not an innocent crush you need therapy to deal with your jealousy and insecurities grow up and set a better example for your child yta
if you are not careful your husband might start picking up on the fact you have a crush on his friend that could ruin your relationship
yta with friends like you sonia doesn t need enemies why are you friends with this person if you dislike her so much you don t take accountability for the mean damaging things you said to john instead you continue to blame sonia and defend yourself because what she s prettier than you she s single and carefree you were petty vindictive and spiteful sonia didn t make you that way that s all on you by the way i m a mom of three and my body isn t what it used to be i m still best friends with my gorgeous child free friend from high school she makes more money she has her mba she s fit because she can afford pilates classes and tennis lessons multiple times a week she has a huge budget for clothing makeup nails hair etc i still love her and i m happy for her i m also incredibly happy with my own life so i m not hateful especially behind her back shame on you i wouldn t trade my time schlumping around in the backyard with my kiddos for the all the money and pretty girl privilege in the world ask yourself what s wrong in your life that makes you treat other people in such a spiteful way stop blaming sonia and look deep inside yourself
you are a major a hole and an insanely jealous woman yta big time you didn t gossip about your friend you talked shit about her you seem extremely jealous of her life and her choices
yta as well as a petty ass cow
yta could you be more spiteful and jealous if you want thin privilege work for it if you want to talk to cute foreign guys learn another language you hate yourself not sonia
you were the ass but you can changeable of that by bettering yourself starting today i suggest finding a good church and a good counselor my wise mother used to say that when you re at your lowest point you can only go up you don t have to beat yourself up as long as you take positive steps towards self improvement
yta you are not a good friend not even an acquaintance your behavior was grossly inappropriate sonia deserves better you need to deal with your insane jealousy of her and insecurities especially before they rub off on your child
yta you re not just a little jealous of her being thin you re envious of everything about her you re not fooling anyone by making it about the unfairness of pretty privilege you need to work on your self love this isn t a healthy way to live these things should impress you when it comes to your loved ones they should be reasons why you love them but instead you bitch about it sad
this was perfect behavior from you to let sonia know that you aren t friends i hope she finds a new friend who actually supports her celebrates with her when something good happens nothing you said about her was kind or loving it sounds like you resent her i bet she would be happier without your negativity jealousy i wonder how often you fish for compliments make her apologize for her weight i wonder if she shrinks herself to make you feel better you sound bitter exhausting yta
yta
yta and good for her tell her i m glad somebody s chosen to live her life with gusto never too late to make changes to live the life you want to live
jealousy doesn t look cute on you i hope she drops your ass yta
yta everything that everyone said here everything
yikes it looks like you are jealous of your best friend the whole post just reeks with friends like these who needs enemies scene not going to be suprised if she demotes your best friend status to mere acquaintance oh yeah yta
yta that s how you describe your best friend right don t want to be your enemy you sound so incredibly jealous is not even funny work on yourself if you feel so lacking when comparing yourself to others your level of maturity is around middle school catty girl
yta i can t believe you have to ask lol
who needs spiteful enemies with friends like you i m really curious to know what you think hobbies are if not trying to learn new languages or learning a new instrument yta lmao
is sonia your only friend because you don t sound as though you like her yet you call her your best friend i can only assume you have few other friends sonia is the only person who wants to spend time with you and you don t have other options your husband also sounds awful the comment about letting john sleep with whoever he wants is really quite unpleasant especially given that they are now actually dating stop spending your energy on disliking someone who has done you no harm and find friends you actually like yta
gross this is gross you ve strung this poor woman on for years having her believe you re friends now you ve shown your true colours which are many and varied shades of hateful green and are surprised at everyone s reaction love seek professional help and apologize to both of them but especially her for your despicably hateful actions
you re the asshole you re jealous of your friend so you turned spiteful and mean good for her for writing professionally good for her for having what sounds like a dream life you seem like a terrible friend
what should she be spending her time and money in your opinion i m genuinely curious
i think you seem quite insecure and unhappy you appear to be jealous of her life beauty hobbies everything you owe her an apology and you might want to go to therapy and work on your self worth
she isn t pretentious with her little hobbies that s you judging her through a lense of jealousy it isn t a crime to have many hobbies and her writing romance novels isn t a waste of potential she s doing what she loves and makes her happy what s wrong with that and how does it make her probably high maintenance jealousy is unattractive and your post is dripping with it she s done nothing to you but exist and be herself and you act as if she s a horrible person for it you backstabbed her but you you re a bad friend yta
pretty and thin privileged
yta learning new instruments and languages are in fact hobbies she s not pretentious she s correct she can t help her body type she doesn t have to be in a career she doesn t want and she doesn t have to have children and she can sleep wake up whenever she wants you sound wildly jealous and taking it out on her makes you a bad friend also but he thinks john had a right to at least sleep with her if he wanted to red flag no one has a right to sleep with anyone this is rape type shit no idea if that s exactly what the husband said word for word or if that s just her interpretation of it but holy moly whoever said it needs to do some serious rethinking
i love gossip as much as the next girl but this isn t gossip it s you trying to sabotage your friend you need to get over your jealousy learning new things is a hobby i think you shouldn t be friends anymore because she deserves better good on john for exposing you yta
gossiping by default makes yta
she s pretty and thin which i admit i m slightly jealous of and it makes it all sting even more john is a beautiful man and i have an innocent crush on him i m married i wouldn t cheat you my friend are a giant red flag and a toxic person god bless your husband i would advise that you don t apologize to her so that she can dump you as a friend yta
writing a fake bait post where you re obviously the ah just for reactions makes yta
yta wow with friends like you who needs enemies the next thing that should come easily to her is dropping you as a friend
yta sounds like she s not ur best friend lol ur just insanely jealous of someone who is pursuing her passion and making the most out of life gossiping over a crush that you have as a married woman is too much you are def in the wrong here
yes dear you are absolutely yta and i hope sonia ditches you as a friend you claim to love her to bits but then out of jealousy try to sabotage a potential new relationship with a man you have an innocent crush on because yes you are jealous
yta and incredibly self absorbed and jealous sorry you hate your choices and want everything she has maybe start working on yourself and your life so you are less likely to sabotage future friendships with jealousy life s too short to spend it eyeing what the neighbor has build a life you re proud of and don t worry about others in that regard comparison is a thief there s always someone thinner richer more fulfilled etc
i feel sorry for your husband this isn t an innocent crush you are actively sabotaging your crush s possible romantic flings you are jealous of your friend you gossip with a purpose yta
yta lol it s not her fault that she didn t have kids and wants to live a different way this is so cringey hope she finds some new friends because you only want worse for her
yta you re not her best friend your envy is dripping off every word here masked as condescension sounds like she s doing fine and she deserves better friends just let her be she s better off without you and you re better making the best of your own life instead of overly focusing on hers
yta so much yta and you re a terrible friend
yta for being jealous of your best friend s beauty and accomplishments instead of tearing her down work on building your self up if you want to save your friendship apologize
yta you spoke ill of her because you re jealous and have a more than innocent crush on john you don t love sonia because if you did you d want the best life can offer her you purposely told him those things so he wouldn t pursue her you re a bad person

nta she has options attend as planned stay home with the kids leave the kids with a sitter and bring someone to dance with or my favorite stfu
nta it s your wedding and your money if she wants to bring a plus one then let her pay the it s going to be to feed that person if your mom is all for it then she can pay for your sister to have a plus one
nta i would tell her she can bring her kids or a plus one let her choose you win either way
nta if she is taking her kids with her who she is expecting to watch them when she dances
nta i think you re being very generous allowing her four children to attend and she had the nerve to ask for an additional person wow she s a bit of a choosy beggar isn t she
nta i don t even know where your mom gets off on saying that s what you do for adults you re not obligated to give anyone a regardless of their age if your sister wants to dance with someone at the wedding she can socialize with the other guests because that s what adults do
nta your sister is not in a serious relationship people is a hard limit i wouldn t want to fill up a slot for some random person when it can mean that you would have to kick someone you actually know and care about off the invite list i m sure there will be someone at the weeding that she can dance with
nta she will be there with her kids and her whole family she doesn t need to bring some rando to keep her company
nta hell it s not even just your rules which would be enough on their own if the venue has a cap it has a cap fire codes don t care how old each occupant is
nta mia doesn t need to bring more people to the wedding she is already dragging kids who are all very young to your wedding so why does she think she gets to bring a random date to this event you are already wasting hundreds of dollars on her alone why don t your other guests get this special treatment
nta i ve been on both sides of this it s not like you are telling her no plus one because you dislike her partner or similar if no serious partner shouldn t insist and doesn t matter who you are as long as the rule applies for everyone then it s fine limited guest caps are real and it s your wedding and your guest list and your money being spent
so if she brings a plus one as well as the kids then i have to ask who the hell is going to be watching the kids nta
nta if she had a serious partner that s one thing but she doesn t so she doesn t need to bring a rando to your wedding she had kids to keep an eye on she ll be occupied lol
nta it s really cute that she wants to wine and dine someone at your expense a person you have never met and that she is not in a relationship with i think that the wedding is about you and your future husband and should include people that you want to share the occasion with if your sister can t have a good time without a date then she should pay in advance for her date to attend the wedding and reception are about the married couple after all who does she expect to babysit her children while she is dancing anyway are other people going to forgo the dancing and babysit so she can have a good time since you have limitations on how many guests you can invite and don t seem to have the extra money to spend i think you are being reasonable
nta she asked you answered hold firm
nta she can dance with her kids
nta your wedding you get to decide if your mum wants to cave to her then your mum can pay the additional cost also i get the impression your sister may ramp it up and turn around and say she won t come if she doesn t get a plus one do be prepared for that
nta the day is not about her and it s very sweet that you went out of your way to make sure your nieces and nephews are there explain that you had to bump a number of people off your guest list already to make sure your family is complete ask her for some understanding it sounds like she s touchy about being alone at a wedding because of her recent experiences which is understandable
nta kids is more then a plus one
nta you already caved to have the kids she either gets a plus one or the kids end of story
nta you have a hard limit on the number of guests and have invited the people that are most important i could maybe understand her being upset if she had been seeing someone seriously for a year or two or longer but its a pretty normal thing for people not to get a plus one when they arent actually seeing someone seriously
nta tell her if she really wants it then she can give you the money for it your already paying so much for just her and her kids
info in my culture it s normal for the guest to gift money that is equal or greater than the cost for them to attend the wedding for example if i came i d have to gift you which is for cost of my meal as an actual gift is your sister paying this as well i don t see a problem if she s gifting you x humans total you d get the you spent on her back anyways
nta
nta but sis is does she not get how much this is costing
nta she isn t in a relationship she has family there she doesn t need to bring a random date the only way i would give her a plus one is if she was already in a serious relationship when the invites came out
nope nta she isn t in a serious committed relationship so why would you invite them she s being entitled i am sure your sister can dance with family and friends
nta tell her she can either have a plus or her kids at the wedding that might give her some perspective and if she does find someone to watch the kids and prefers to come with a date maybe its for the better
nta tell her she gets either to bring her kids or get a not both her choice
nta she s unreasonable and you shouldn t be expected to pay for a random person to attend your wedding
nta
nta
aside from the outrageous price of weddings for an year old to not eat the food my goodness you are absolutely not the asshole honestly you re a saint for making this a kids included wedding
nta what is this thing with people being unable to attend weddings unless they have someone with them i ve gone to so many weddings on my own and had a great time you presumably know at least one or two people at any wedding you re attending and if she s your sister she knows a lot more and it s not the end of the world to actually talk to some new people why do you need a plus one
nta your wedding your rules nothing else really matters
she is of the total guest list and of your half of the guest list nta
nta stand your ground girl
i assume as an adult i also get a first of all as an adult maybe don t assume anything about someone else s wedding second of all you got a
i m curious you said you opted not to have a child free wedding after there being so much drama about it does that mean y all wanted a child free wedding originally and is this sister the drama that caused y all to relent because if that s the case she has already limited y all s ability to invite more adult guests in favor of children due to the capacity issue and as you said cost you extra dollars just for her invite alone and now she wants to add a plus one for a supposed date when she doesn t even have anyone in mind nta but you re ta to yourself for giving her and others so much power over yalls wedding day that yall are paying for
nta also the reason some people like to bring a plus is that they won t know anyone not the case for sister also who would be minding the kids while she was with date she can t just ignore whatever rando she drums up and it s not fair to pawn kids off on other guests
nta i hate the plus expectation at weddings i didn t want randos at mine
nta it s pretty common ime for the plus one to be limited to people in relationships not just bring anyone you want besides you have a hard cap on the number of people who can attend you have no control over that at all
geez you could afford to pay a babysitter to watch the kids for the wedding and still come out ahead
nta it is your wedding your money and your rules she needs to grow up and understand
kids dad of one of her kids nta just out of curiosity how many dads are there she sounds exhausting and she s lucky you re allowing kids at all
info would her kids even eat the catering food legitimate question i have a year old that i know the catering would be wasted on depending on their age would it be possible to arrange another meal for them
nta it s not her day or her money being spent
nta its your wedding and honestly at that point i would tell her not to come at all she sounds like a lot of drama and stress on a day that is supposed to be about you celebrating your love for your spouse set boundaries and stick to them and don t let anyone else manipulate you into giving in the sister isn t ever gonna be happy and will keep demanding more so no more as it is it sounds like you wanted a childfree wedding and had to forego that specifically because of her no its not her day its not about her and she isnt paying for anything personally i would uninvite her her kids entirely boundaries are hard but they exist for a reason stop stressing so much and focus on enjoying your special day
nta even if she did bring a it doesn t sound like she really has good judgement in guys to bring someone you d want around plus if you give her a how much time would she spend looking after her current she s already bringing plus no one else is getting a so it s not like you are singling her out for any reason
nta she s not in a serious relationship anyone she brings will be a stranger to you it s ridiculous to think that you should leave out someone you actually want to celebrate your wedding with you in order to make room for some random she brings it s not like she s your friend from work and wouldn t know anyone else there she ll know her your family and can hang out with them plus if she has four kids with her including a four year old then she s going to be busy parenting so what kind of date is she imagining having kinda kidding with that last one based on how you report her behaviour in this situation i suspect her plan would be to palm the kids off on your mum or just let them run wild don t engage in debates about the or who else is attending the more you justify yourself to her your mum the more you keep it open as a subject for debate or negotiation just stick to the flat out no it s you your partner s wedding you decide who attends and the answer is no
nta
nta when you have to count every single person you have to keep your guest list short somehow not allowing any plus ones other than serious relationships is perfectly reasonable
nta especially if you are shouldering the burden of wedding costs without help from parents
nta
nta plus ones aren t promised for weddings and she s obviously going to know people there already personal rant why is everyone obsessed with bringing a stranger to a wedding it s one thing if the person anticipates being alone without friends but in these situations it s just wild to me
nta i don t think you need to phrase it as the kids being here plus one it s enough to say that she s not in a serious relationship and you don t want randomers at your wedding on an unrelated but sort of relevant note people is quite a lot of people to have at a wedding imho my husband and i didn t have of our nearest and dearest that we were willing to fork out a head for and we had five family kids at our wedding with no issues
or the kids her choice
nta she has a
nta it seems like there s already been so much drama you ve been forced to cater to her needs just to keep the peace give her an inch and she tries to take a mile remind her that you re doing her a favour by not having your desired childfree wedding for her sake and that s where your charity on your special day ends because this day is not about her
nta but those kids are pretty young and you might find yourself extra irritated when she can t wrangle them all alone for the day
if it s so important for her to have a date suggest she pay for their cost but regardless i would special order those kids meals so you re not dropping alone for young children expecting to be allowed to bring kids and a guest at a pop is cray nta
omg nta if she doesn t want to come to your wedding without a date she is welcome to stay home with her spawn stand your ground
said she could easily find a date so she would bring a random date that would meet her kids on their first ever date those poor kids i wonder how many times they ve met mommy s newest boyfriend nta
nta your wedding your rules
nta she has an entourage with her already if your mom wants her to have a plus one then she can foot the bill
nta its your wedding why would she get an automatic plus one as an adult also its a family wedding so i assume she ll know a lot of the people there so its not like she needs a friend to talk to
nta mainly because mia will have her kids there to watch plus family and family friends that she can talk with it s not like without a plus one she will be sitting in a corner with no one to talk to
nta i get it may suck not having a plus one for a wedding but her children are taking up a considerable part of your budget after all and i gather one of the reasons you won t have a childfree wedding are indeed her kids so your choice doesn t sound unreasonable at all she ll pout for a bit but i m sure she ll eventually come around have a nice wedding
nope nta
nta your venue s occupancy is capped your caterer s cost per plate is set these are very clear constraints her attendance is already taking up a significant for one family part of both of those constraints given her romantic circumstances it s not like you re saying her long term partner can t attend your stance on this is entirely reasonable she can dance with another guest she can dance by herself or she can stay home
nta your wedding limited costs and you re already covering her kids it s bad form to bring a casual new person to a wedding
nta limited space and not in a relationship means no plus one
nta as soon as you said fire codes that should have been it
nta you already wanted a child free wedding and are not getting that because of her she doesn t need a plus one
nta seems like you didn t even want any children at the wedding from the start changing your wedding and allowing her to bring her kids and paying for them all is already so generous of you op
nta who is she planning to dump the year old on while she dances with her plus one is she expecting the your parents to ignore your wedding festivities so they can babysit the grandkids while she parties if she had an so it would be wrong not to invite them but she doesn t she s a single mom of little kids they are her responsibility during the party she can dance with her kids i do it all the time nta
nta she s already got plus four which is plus three more than anybody else gets
nta
tell her she has a choice she can bring her children or she can bring her plus one
nta give her an ultimatum with the monetary value of what you re doing do you want me to pay the extra for your kids or do you want me to pay the for you and your plus one cause i m not doing both
nta the can bring a plus if she has a sitter for all her kids i can t believe she d even be cheeky enough to make that assumption
nta
nta
nta
tell her to pay a sitter and then she can bring a plus one hell even if you paid for her sitter you d be saving money
no plus for her sorry but your sister is leeching
nta a simple no is sufficient
nta she s bringing people
nta tell her to find a babysitter and then she can have a plus it is either the kids or the plus one
nta she s already bringing people and she wants to bring another one like who even some random dude she banged the night before lol
it s your wedding you don t owe her anything in regard to this day it s about you nta
info this really depends on what you ve done for other people yes it s your wedding yes it costs a lot to have the kids there but at the end of the day you chose not to have a child free wedding and you shouldn t punish mia by scuse the pun singling her out if you are giving out plus ones to the adults you should give her a plus one that said with a small guest list i don t think there s anything wrong with not giving every adult not already in a social unit a plus one but the rule has to be consistent otherwise you re just punishing your sister for having children and from your comment about drama it seems like you re mad at her for having to invite four kids your wedding is the ceremony your reception is an event you host to celebrate with and thank your guests for attending your ceremony you should be working to make them feel welcome not resenting them for being there and counting costs the cost is the same no matter who takes that guest spot if you re going to hand out plus ones it s not your sister s fault she wants to be treated the same as other guests edit thanks for the award kind person
personally i m asking for kids not to be present at my wedding or after party
esh calling her kids a plus one was rude your nieces and or nephews are guests in their own right whom you invited if you didn t want them there then you should ve stuck to your guns about a childfree wedding don t act snide and resentful about a decision you made it also sounds like you re judging your sister for her relationship situation which isn t very kind especially to the kids who are innocent parties however you re in the right to decline her what should be request for a plus one i saw in your other comments that with the exception of one groomsman from out of town only people in serious relationships have gotten plus one invites that s a reasonable and common way of handling the matter i don t blame you for not wanting some rando you ll probably never see again at your wedding doubly so with the venue s policy and cost sister is ta for throwing a tantrum because she isn t getting special treatment it s extra absurd for her to demand to bring a casual date at a family wedding she ll know plenty of other guests i m sure she can find someone to dance with
nta we didn t even allow kids at our wedding except for the nieces some people got mad but i personally didn t care i did not want to go into debt for a wedding we spent about for everything and had it at my house in the backyard the grandma got mad at us for not inviting the uncle but i told her i didn t want conspiracy theories being spread around about chem trails not the time or day you re wedding is your wedding
info is it common to assume adults just get a plus one i ve never heard of that before
r choosingbeggars
nta your wedding your choices she should be grateful that her kids are invited
info who the hell would want to go to a wedding of strangers with some chick you just met and her four curtain monkeys and maybe that s why the sister is pissed not that she cannot bring a date but the implication she does not have one to bring

no nta if he has not fed his cats for two days at a time even once he needs to be forced to not have cats
nta that s animal abuse and should be reported poor things
nta even if he did have valid excuses for not being there on the regular there are still plenty of ways especially with cats to make sure that they are taken care of while you are away self cleaning litter boxes water fountains which keep the water fresh and also typically have more than enough for a couple of days and they even have food dispensers which can be automated and would ensure that he should really only have to do things for the cats like once a week or every other week if he doesn t have the money for those then he needs to just step up and start setting reminders on his phone maybe give him an ultimatum and make the suggestions but i m a softy with animals and am really just trying to be nice here i probably would have already called if you ve already given an ultimatum before then i say call and don t feel bad because you re doing what s right by the cats
nta that is just gross and the cat deserves better report
nta his behavior is beyond ridiculous and utterly repugnant i m not clear on how much you other roommates help out though assuming there was never an agreement made otherwise it is really not your job to take care of his cats at least it shouldn t be your job though tbh i don t know if i could even handle living in that situation and watching those cats be treated that way he is abusing and neglecting those poor cats and they absolutely deserve better perhaps give him the opportunity to rehome or surrender them himself before getting authorities involved but i d make it clear that if he refuses then you absolutely will call them obviously you would need to be ready to follow through on that if he does refuse also this might sound paranoid but if he does say he s rehoming them i d probably try to ensure in some way that he doesn t just drop them on the side of the road or something if he s doing shit like going days without giving food i wouldn t trust him at all tbh i m really suggesting giving him the option that allows him to not have to deal with authorities potential consequences for if you really think he deserves it and or really need to keep the peace personally i m not sure he deserves to avoid the consequences but if you want a route with potentially less drama that gets the cats out of there that could at least help them because those cats need to get the hell out of there they don t deserve this if anything you d truly be the ah by not doing anything assuming it continues soooo very much nta for doing what you need to do to stop animal abuse eta sorry for the length i m an animal lover and currently extremely medicated my brain isn t filtering too well or at all hopefully this was coherent at least lol
info are you asking if you would be ta if you reported it or have you already reported it
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** my roommate who was once a cousin by marriage doesn t change his cats litter for months at a time he doesn t even scoop it the cat feces just sit on top of the litter as well as leaving for multiple days without any plan for his cats just assuming one of us will take care of them he even went a whole day or two without feeding them recently i work two jobs so i can t and do not want to take care of his cats i ve talked to him multiple times politely and other times not so politely each time he makes excuses or tries to play the victim i m fed up and think the cats deserve better he is incredibly entitled and believes he knows everything it s not just me who is beyond frustrated two other roommates are as well and one has also thought about calling him in tldr aita for reporting my roommate for animal abuse neglect i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta that s neglect poor cats
nta he shouldn t have pets if he s not going to care for them as they deserve i would report him anonymously as well because that s horrible cats can get sick from filthy litter but also subjecting others to that as well it s incredibly neglectful
ywbta if you don t report it animals don t have a voice and they need people to speak up for them when they are being mistreated
nta i feel so sorry for those kitties i have three and i ve invested hundreds probably over by now in their comfort and care report him her now
nta not only is he neglecting abusing the animals he s creating a health hazard in your home report it
absolutely nta what s important is the welfare of those poor cats your roommate can go kick rocks however do try to find out how the local authorities handle these sorts of situations if you can are they likely to seize the animals and stuff them in the pound where they will be put to sleep in a few days or do they actually work with rescuers to get the animals to better situations if it sounds as if reporting is just going to get the poor things put down i would totally support contacting a rescuer the next time he goes out of town for several days i know i know i ll get downvoted to oblivion for suggesting this but frankly i don t give the smallest crap about his property or anything else those animals need decent care not neglect followed by execution
nta the dude is a terrible pet owner and should rehome his cats but no one s going to do anything if you report him people have this idea that the humane society or aspca can be called on bad pet owners like cps can for abusive parents unless an animal is being seriously abused like dog fighting an animal tied up outside in the dead of winter or someone throwing a cat out of a second story window animal control doesn t do anything to help i m someone who has worked at animal control facilities shelters so maybe just see if you can publicly shame him like posting photos of the cats box on facebook or something so others know what he does to his cats maybe he ll rehome them but really in general you re just going to make your life and his life worse find a new living situation you should ask to adopt the cats then rehome them
nta save those cats please report him he clearly cannot tale care of them so he clearly should not have them they deserve care from someone who loves them and will feed them and clean up after them
nta i have cats and i hate cleaning the cat box you know how i solved that issue i got a self cleaning cat box and now i rarely need to scope it by hand and empty the disposal container when it s full about once a day to once every days but you should report him for neglect if he wants them but doesn t like doing the nasty part of pet ownership he doesn t need to own them and not expect anyone else to help take care of the cat just because they occupy the same living space as the pet
animal control can nan him from getting animals from shelters but that s about it
at this point op is better off just reporting him i dont think an ultimatum will change anything since he has shown for ages that he doesnt care about the cats
i thought about this idea and it s probably what i m going to do this roommate and i aren t close so i ll have another roommate who is closer to him give him the ultimatum then if he doesn t see the problem i ll have to unfortunately find proper relocation myself because he said he ll clean the litter box before he goes home for easter but he ll just not clean it for another months after he comes back
it s if but after reading everyone s responses i m definitely going to report it i ve never had pets before so i didn t know how serious the situation was
i was thinking the same thing as you i m worried they ll just get put down so i definitely want to look at relocation

yta chores should be done before friends come over or after having a friend over is not a get out of chore feee card
info why can t your kid do his chores after his friend has left these aren t sleepovers so the friend is going home at some point why can t the kid do his room then is daily swiffering really necessary do you have a pack of dogs that shed hair everywhere or something
yta if your 12yo can skip chores about once a week then so can the 14yo it means the chores don t absolutely need to happen every day and you should adjust for that let them each pick a day each week to skip chores rather than basing it on when they have friends over or other plans it s a valuable mini lesson in budgeting time for responsibilities
yta you set up a system that clearly favors your more social child and continued to use it after it became clear it was unfair also how dirty is your house that you have to clean every day
yta you are effectively punishing your older child for not being as social these chores do not need doing every day it is reasonable to have a day off here and there so why not have the rule that if there is a guest over they don t do chores rubbish being taken out can be done after frie d s go home on an even basis
yta if one gets out of it all the time it is unfair when the yo has a friend over then they should get an extra day assigned to them during the week don t punish the 14yo for not being as social
yta why can t they do chores after their friends leave
yta if my parents had this system i d be with friends every single day
yta different kids can and i say should be raised differently but you can t have that result in punishing one child that s what you have here you have less than social kid being punished for not being more social
yta why couldn t do his chores while friend twiddles their thumbs i am more than a little certain the friend has a smartphone or video game or something to bide their time how long could that possibly take when you make them clean daily put a little thought into it what irritates me is that you re probably a really good parent but when you come face to face with something you didn t do correctly you just double down without actually thinking through the new information please learn how to consider new information even if comes from a child
yta why can t year old do the chores before his friends come over or just have a rule that if any friend comes over neither of them does chores
yta you are punishing a child whose introverted and rewarding an extrovert to be more extroverted which one of the two do you think suffers already from not having many friends so drilling that into his head by punishing him for it is beyond cruel do better
yta you re creating a divide between siblings for no good reason why aren t you telling them chores first friends second hopefully your eldest is old enough to know you can t really make them do anything you want it done so bad do it yourself
yta it seems like intentionally sowing dissent between the brothers to consistently hold one child responsible for chores and not the other chores can easily be done before or after company comes over but i also don t see any problem with visiting friends helping with chores it seems strange to give a child a pass on chores for regular playdates while essentially punishing the elder child for not having enough friends
yta you re punishing your year old for being less social than his younger sibling and surprised he s angry about it are you trying to shame into making friends or do you genuinely not see the problem with favoring your more social child
yta chores should be split equally regardless of who is more social you created a system where the younger one gets to choose whether or not he does chores by having friends over are you really this dense
yta i don t know why you would implement a system that has your less social children do extra chores unless your goal is to alienate them from each other
your kids have to swiffer their rooms every day what nonsense is that they learn only one stupid thing which isn t even making sense swiffers are wasteful expensive bullshit why don t you teach your sons how to use reusable cleaning utensils and have them do it once a week only but then properly and give them a variety chores so they have a proper repertoire give them their list of chores they have to do on certain schedules and then they absolutely have to do it if a chore isn t done in the expected time frame then friends cannot visit really easy but they still get a certain degree of freedom to plan when to do something learning to organize themselves yta
yta year old should get his chores done before he has friends over or after they leave seems like his chores can be done in like minutes you are punishing one kid for being less social than the other
yta tell 12yo chores and homework before friends you were wrong to ground 14yo apologize and tell him you guys will come up with a new systme
yta the chores should be equal you shouldn t be punishing you 14yo for being less popular
yta just give them the same amount of chores friends can t come over they can t go out with friends until chores are done it s really that simple
info why do you hate your year old kid so much this is clear favouritism for the golden child for being normal read like you given how you described his behaviour i can see why the year old is getting more and more angry he s learning that the rules apply to him but not his brother because his brother is more social i suppose it s one way to teach him that life s not fair hell of a gamble to bet your relationship with your kid over it though
yta the friend can either hang out for a few minutes or help
yta select certain days for chores to be done no friends over on those days this isn t rocket science
yta how is this even acceptable just because one son has more friends than the other their chores are different it s not a healthy mindset and you are the cause of it you can t punish a kid for having less friends than his brother you could go to the og way of doing things like you can t hang out with friends until your chores are done and why can t you make the child who is hanging out with friends do his chores after he s done why do they have to swifer everyday this is absurd
can you not do math they should have equal amount of days currently it s not don t use being old come on this is common sense and listening to your kid instead of being dramatic about it yta and stop favoring your year old your year old can already tell you don t like him
yta you are making it abundantly clear which child you favor and which one you dislike you have no problem with adding extra hurt to an already introverted child who likely is not at all happy about not having as many friends and social activities as a younger brother with this silly and clearly unfair policy when he bails on you as soon as he can and doesn t want to be bothered having anything to do with you as an adult you can congratulate yourself on having driven away the child you didn t care about anyway
yta why do you resent the year old so much
read over your post and look for all the ways you speak negatively about your year old yta being social popular doesn t make you better or automatically give a person a healthier mindset chores should be equitable and not a punishment for not hanging out with friends and getting out of them shouldn t be a reward for popularity this isn t about being old or out of touch it s about not accepting your year old as he is introverted you even knew he was getting angry over the unfairness and punish him for refusing to accept the unfairness of it do better
as someone who was introverted as a kid and seldom had friends over yta chores should be done before or after friend comes over
yta the point of giving kids chores is so they can practice balancing every day responsibilities like taking the garbage out alongside social responsibility like school or friendships you need to help your kid find time to do chores even when they are busy or have friends over otherwise you re not really setting them up for success not to mention all that animosity between siblings
yta friends weren t allowed over at my place until chores done homework too same goes for going to a friend s house except on weekends sometimes a friend would come over while i m still doing chores and my parents would let them in but i still had to clean or finish whatever friend was allowed to watch tv or play my snes instead of twiddling thumbs edited to fix my phones bad auto corrects
yta for sure you re just seeding resentment in that kid
yta you re effectively punishing your year old for being an introvert
you are very much yta my daughter was extremely social and involved in every club or sport she could wedge herself into she has adhd so keeping busy kept her out of too much trouble so i was the mom who had to have a huge suv because i worked for myself and had the time to ferry kids around to activities i also have adhd so am constantly on the move and am outdoorsy also can do an craft under the sun lol so i guess i was fun mom so my house was grand central station because a lot of parents picked up their kids from my house starting in grade school that being said i was no one s maid all the kids pitched in and helped if they were at my house because i was second mom to about kids and we lived on a small farm a few miles outside of town so always something to do if someone did not want to help they sat there and watched but that normally did not last long because the other kids did not put up with lol plus cute farm animals for the win you are playing favorites with your introverted child being punished because he is not as social you seem in my opinion too invested in your popular child and you are going to make your other one resent you take it from the child who was made to do all the chores m siblings would throw a fit over i am nc with my family and that started when i was younger than your children you coming across as a bullying dictator is not going to make your child no longer resent you you are not teaching him responsibility you are teaching him that you will only give him a pass if he lives up to your social standards if not he is punished and do not try to say doing his chores is not a punishment yes it is if his sibling gets out of them simply because he had friends over you are actually being very cruel and undermining his self worth and that is to your shame
yta you can have a make up chore they can do later or maybe they can do an extra chore next time
yta maybe ease up on their chores you re robbing them of their childhood and they ll resent you for it when they re older
how could you possibly think you are not the ah yta so much make it fair if either of them have people over then no chores introverts deserve equality ffs
since when the fuck does having having friends equal not doing chores when i have friends over in the house i own i still have to do my chores why can t he do the chores in the morning or after his friends leave seriously do you know how many goddamn times i had to clean the kitchen while my friends waited outside for me as a kid hell the cool friend would even help to get it done faster dude i m so mad for your kid rn wtf kinda favoritism ass bullshit is this oh yeah yta
yta if year old has a disproportionate amount of social engagements then get them to do their chores the next day or before they hang out with friends
yta you re literally punishing your son for not being social you are also affecting their sibling relationship congrats
yta if there is a visit why should one still do the chores why can t they both do it after playdates if one gets free pass the other has to get free pass too and shouldn t be punished for basically not having playdates
yta if one kid skips chores for a playdate then their chore day moves to the next day
yta you re effectively penalizing lack of friendships or social opportunities there is an easy solution here rather than you have to do chores while your friend is here just make it no friends over until your chores are done
yta if he goes to a friend s house he should have to do additional chores when he gets back or before he leaves
yta you are just punishing your son for not being social either nobody has to do chores when someone is over parent does the chores for them chores have to be done before after friend comes over or their day is assigned to a different day be consistent not an ass
yta chores then friends simple
yta not for having your kids do chores because that s important it needs to be fair though give your 14yo a break just as often as his brother gets one
yta why are you letting one son get away with not doing chores just because he has a friend over or goes somewhere they should still have to do their chores either as soon as their friend leaves or they get home you are literally rewarding your social son and punishing your other son you need to correct this immediately before your oldest son grows to hate you and resent their brother both sons need to do the same amount of chores every day
wow so you hate that your year old is not as social so you punish that behavior by sticking him with the chores and then act surprised he got angry every time i think i ve seen the worst parenting decision ever on aita another comes along
yta if the year old s floor won t get disgusting from skipping a day neither will the year old s i m not a super tidy person but it seems like these specific chores don t need to be done daily
yta as someone who didn t have friends growing up i d hate you if i was made to do things while my sibling got a free pass either give your other child the same free pass or make sure the year old still does their chores so what if their friends see them doing chores from what you ve said they do it d only take maybe 15mins
yta you want to feel like you are right but you are not their friends can twiddle their thumbs or help out chores are done daily by both kids no matter if the company is there or both boys get out of it you are playing favorites is the younger one the golden child
yta wtf is wrong with you
yta for essentially punishing your introverted child i m guessing you re an extrovert and just can t understand why your other child doesn t make friends as easily stop just stop and is this a freaking reddit commercial for swiffer or what
i what this chore list doesn t should like full day activity why can t they do it before after or switch days with their sibling you basically punishing him for not having friends yta jeez
yta some people gave great advice on how to fix this and i saw you acknowledge some but i just really want to highlight that you should apologize to your kid just making some changes isn t enough you have to show him you see and understand where he s coming from and be ready to admit you also make mistakes not once in my years of life has my mom gave me an apology and i m sure out relationship would be so much better and way less secretive if every once in a while she would be willing to admit she hurt me even my sister and i s relationship would be better she learned from mom to never apologize and having a conversation with her about her mistreatment of me is impossible
yta so your year old has a friend around there time before the friend come over of afterthought friend leaves your punishing your eldest child for not being social that mucked up
yta if the year old gets out of chores because a friend is over then so does the year old you need to be scrupulously fair here maybe on play date days the kids have to do their chores before bedtime
yta there s no reason 12yo can t get the chores done when their friend goes home
it s kind of awkward for the other kid to just have to sit around and twiddle their thumbs while their host is swiffering nope one you are the host not your child two the first thing i did at my friend s house and they did at mine was get our chores out of the way i did not sit and twiddle my thumbs i dusted while they mopped or i dried while they washed or i walked the house with them as they got all the garbage bags and vice versa everyone had chores so if you went to anybody s house directly after school you helped it s where i learned that i never minded dusting someone else s house i just hated dusting mine lol so either the yo still does chores and their friend can help or not or as someone said they have an extra day of chores or more the next day while your yo has less
yeah yta i think each should get a no chore day regardless of the presence of friends i read all your replies incidentally it s extremely funny to me that people were so annoyed with you about this post that even the one where you took the feedback and used their idea got downvoted lmao you ve got a lot of logic backing up your decisions as such why not put this up to a family meeting kids like to be lazy but they also like to feel like a member of the household have dinner in the living room one night and set up a big notepad and brainstorm some alternative chore rules so that isn t the only one getting screwed by this system
12yo me would purposely have people over all the time if i had these rules not fair to his brother at all also why shouldn t he do some chores when friends are over some chores take 10mins yta
yta you re essentially punishing one of your sons for being more introverted than the other chores should be set and fair not dependent on social calendars
for crying out loud if he has to pick up the brother s slack then the brother should be made to do extra time when his friends aren t there definitely yta and you are definitely showing favoritism i d be angry too
you need to chill on the chores did you want slaves is that why you had kids speaking from experience of growing up with helicopter parents unless you re on a farm where chores are important forcing your kids to do the majority of the house work could very easily turn them into a slob you re creating a environment of dread that can manifest itself when they aren t under your control chores are important and kids do need to do them but unless you have people coming over frequently the inside of your house doesn t need to look like you re about to have a viewing
how can you not see how unfair this is huuuuuuuge yta
you are the ah
yta kids are obsessed with fairness when the y o has friends over and doesn t do chores the y o shouldn t either
yta and will be again in years when the older kid goes no contact and you re wondering why
yta wouldn t it just be easier to say no friends over until chores are done
yta why do they need to swiffer their rooms and put their rubbish out daily why can t they do it when they need to my teen does her bin when it s full i sweep the lino floors when they need it a couple of times a week i feel like you are over doing it on the chore expectations and your 14yo absolutely gets to have a problem with it chill out a bit
without a doubt yta your system sucks and you need to change it and not subsidize your yo just because they are more social
i think it s totally fair to rephrase this whole thing as i punish my son for not having friends aita because that s the story and all the information you need to make a ruling of course you re yta how could you not be it has nothing to do with being old fair is timeless and one of your kids gets punished either for something that already sucks for him or simply for being different from what you would like and neither by any measure is fair if he wants friends and struggles to make them hey now he s lonely and he has extra work while watching you reward his brother for what he wishes he had fuckin great a or he doesn t want to be that social he s comfortable on his own with his thoughts doing his own thing and you re telling him you don t understand him that he s bad for not being something other than what he is and that you obviously prefer his brother that s not better it seems to me as though you re making no effort to understand your son you re certainly not talking to him you shared none of what he had to say when you asked him to break down his perspective for you likely because you didn t ask him that you re not trying to hear him out you re not even trying to reason him and then when that leads to escalation because you re flat out being disrespectful at this point you punish him unless you raised an asshole your kid is probably not being an asshole he has a super valid point and of course he s growing angry as you continue to give him the short end of the stick and expecting him to like it you need to apologize take action to change things and do something really nice for the kid you ve been kind of shitting on for who knows how long his labor and time have value and he s seen what years of that value being dismissed while his brother got more for doing less fucking lame make it right
wow you treat your son like garbage yta
yta why should a child s choice of having a friend over or not impact the chore schedule kids should be given the same number of no chore days per week
yta i did chores with friends all the time goes faster when we pitch in also sure you can go to x s house are you doing your chores before you go or leaving time when you get home don t punish the introvert for being an introvert
this isn t fair and you know it
yta it s not fair and you know it
yta how big are their rooms i honestly had the greatest respect for my friends and their parents if they had responsibilities they had to see to when they got home swiffering shouldn t take long nor should the trash having a guest sit there and watch them will make them go faster
yta i would recommend providing the year old with the same amount of personal time that the year old dedicates to socialise nothing wrong with not being social it s fair for him to get angry because you re punishing him for not being social
yta you play favorites and have you once stopped to consider why the one child isn t more social than the other maybe they have social anxiety or a hard time making friends in general are they having issues at school do they feel blatantly disrespected that you re letting it slide for the other one maybe you should have some self awareness and check in on them and their feelings and mental health also daily is overkill i get teaching responsibility but they are kids so let them be kids
yta i make my kids clean their rooms living room and bathroom before they re allowed to have guests over hubby too if you want to host you do the cleaning to make sure your guest is comfortable you don t get out of chores just to have friends over kind of curious when you implemented this rule if this was never the rule for your oldest son before and started when your youngest was old enough for chores that could be why he s more social he realized if he has friends over he gets out of chores so he socialized more to make more friends if this is the case you set your oldest up he never had to be social because it was never the rule now it is and it s not fair to him because he never had to be social before now
yta you admit waiting a day won t hurt the floors so why can t the year old skip when the year old does oh my mistake you ve made it clear that this is a case of golden child syndrome
yta
yta and someone is blocking my post
do you ensure the chores get done once the friend is gone they re home from the sleepover
yta your system is inherently unfair and you re sticking to it for no good reason why do these chores need to be completed right after school and not any other time during the day would it really make much of a difference to say that the garbage needs to get taken out any time between returning home from school and going to bed either let them skip their chores the same number of times per week or let them do it when their friends go home it s not fair to let one of them skip more than the other
you make the rule no friends over until you do your chores not if you have a friend over then you don t have chores it s not difficult you just favor your younger child yta
yta
yta give both a chore amnesty don t you think he feels awkward cleaning in front of younger kids
yta why doesn t he have to do the chores after he gets home or his friend leaves whichever the case is your older son shouldn t be penalized for not being as social as his brother not only are you punishing your older son but your telling your younger son he won t have to be responsible for his share of the household chores during his roommate years or when he gets married if he just stays away from home or has company in
yta my entire childhood i d have playdates at my best friend s house at least once a week and she always had to do her chores while i was there completely non negotiable i d follow her around and we d chat while she did them sometimes i d help out sometimes i d just watch tv or play with her toys while i waited she never complained about it and i never minded either tl dr doing chores with his friends over will not kill him or his friends can personally confirm
yta when they are adults the chores will have to be done no matter what their social life looks life set that up now
yta your elders probably feels resentment right now towards you and his younger brother chores are chores and they have to get done regardless and wouldn t it make sense for those chores to be done before hanging out with friends anyway just because the isn t as social doesn t give u an excuse to burden him with extra stuff to do it s not fair and idk why it s a question you re even asking if u favor one more than the other just say it
yta i agree with the year old in my house growing up friends couldn t come over and there were no outside activities until homework and chores were done you re letting the year old skip out on chores for leisure isn t fair to the year old i m sure you didn t wanna do your siblings chores growing up so why are you doing that to your son
i think the grounding is a bit much i used to do my chores while my friends were over and frankly i had a lot more daily chores my friends either helped or they would chat with me while i did my chores it also seems pretty reasonable that 14yo is cranky about having to do his brother s chores because that would just be really annoying what you ve described is mins worth of chores so it seems highly reasonable that 12yo could just do that quick like after his friend left
yta i can understand not having the kids doing chores while their friends are there but they aren t they are the more social kid can easily do his chores after his friends have gone home you re just setting yourself up for disaster here with the situation and these vague rules

nah i see your point and you re not an asshole for asking but you ve said your piece and your boyfriend is unwilling to shower twice a day or only at night now you need to decide whether this is something you can let go or whether this is a dealbreaker for you but you would be an asshole to continue to ask him to shower at night barring unusual circumstances
nah although ops boyfriend is right she doesn t have any more right to ask him to change his routine that he would to ask her to change hers he doesn t dig ditches for a living she appears to be extremely germophobic someone who works in a hospital might not be the best mate especially if her phobia is escalating
you two need separate bedrooms if this is really that much if an issue you sound like a germaphobe and his job is just going to eat at you showering twice a day is not good for your skin or hair let the man set his own schedule
pretty sure i saw reversed genders post a few days ago anyone has a link husband problem with his wife doctor who didn t shower before bed nah
yta i am like your bf showering in the morning is part of my routine as it helps wake me up so when i shower before bed it also wakes me up when i do shower before bed it usually keeps me awake an hour to two hours longer than if i hadn t showered
yta i mean it s a difference of preference but i don t think it s reasonable to ask your boyfriend to have a second shower of the day before bed there are many different solutions to this problem you should talk about some of them that could perhaps be a compromise for both of you
yta if he showers every day in the morning then demanding a second shower is out of hand
info what s gonna happen if he says no
if you share one bed i think it s perfectly reasonable for both parties to want to be comfortable in a clean bed if one partner is unwilling to make sure that happens and you still want to be in the relationship with that partner then the only alternative is two separate beds
so many troll posts about doctors not showering lately
nah but i lean towards feeling your bf has a reasonable perspective especially because he wears work dedicated clothing scrubs along with gloves
we just did this one like yesterday
nta shower twice a day you dirty smelly whiner
again we had the same story a few weeks ago with reversed genders
we just had the opposite version of this post where the husband wanted to know if he was the ah for sleeping on the couch because his wife wouldn t shower before bed she s a doctor in a hospital too he was overwhelmingly nta and most people were saying she ought to shower edit i m getting downvoted but here s the link https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12a5vhe/aita_for_sleeping_on_the_couch_when_my_wife_comes/ personally i find it disgusting to get into bed without showering doctor or not
hang on here what is he doing for the scope of work some departments aren t as high risk as others
if you work in health care of any kind you shower when you get home you re exposed to who knows what even if it s not liquid or crusted onto you him removing his clothes is no different than getting into bed w them when he s still carrying everything else on his skin clothing doesn t protect you fortunately he s only a boyfriend nta
nta also eww he works at a hospital and after he comes home he just goes into bed without showering that s gross he should know better than anyone how filthy hospitals actually are he should be the one showering the moment he gets home i have doctor friends i have nurse friends and the first thing all of them do when they get home from the hospital is shower
nah bordering on yta
sounds like you are relationship incompatible you clearly have a germ phobia so dating someone who works in a hospital may just not be in the cards for you nah
nta hospitals are filthy you have to re apply hand sanitizer after walking every six feet for a reason the rampant spread of communicable diseases is a major issue in that environment it s easy to sanitize your hands that s why you do it it doesn t mean by some magical principle your body is staying clean don t take my word for it this is what the cdc says about the prevalence you don t need a mansplaining md to know this is yucky stuff https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk441857/ in the cdc published a multistate point prevalence survey of healthcare associated infections involving patients from us hospitals according to this report about of hospitalized patients suffered from at least one of the hai in absolute numbers in an estimated hospitalized patients suffered from infections the dominant infections in descending order include pneumonia surgical site infections gastrointestinal infections urinary tract infections or utis and primary bloodstream infection and include catheter associated bloodstream infections among the pathogens causing hai c difficile is the leading pathogen and is closely followed by staphylococcus aureus klebsiella and escherichia coli
while i understand what you are saying i m saying yta if you are forcing him to shower i too work in a hospital but as an aide i sweat and get very oily while sleeping too always have i have showered at night but still feel gross in the morning and have to shower again when i wake up so i ve always been a morning shower person even before working in a hospital when i feel super gross after work have a c diff patient buggy person and or covid patient i will come home and do a quick shower and then shower again in the morning because i feel gross again most days working in a hospital are stressful and the mental load is huge coming home and showering is just too much for me most days and i want to do nothing my husband married years and kids all understand that some days are stressful and they know if i need a shower after work i do i will even call my husband ahead of time to clear the washer if needed and make sure no one is in our only bathroom something to try get different blankets for you both to cover with my husband and i have different blankets because he s a blanket thief this might also provide a barrier and make you feel a little better while sleeping
nta i think getting into your bed without showering is so gross but i realize people have different standards for stuff like that i also believe in removing your outside clothes and changing into inside clothes when you get home and not wearing shoes in the house so maybe i m not the best judge lol
gf is ta the bf has his routine worked out for him and thats what he feels in comfortable to him showering daily is already bad for the body cause it can dry out skin and strip the oil from your hair the gf has her routine and the bf has his routine both should be respected without forcing change to them
nah but given his job he should be washing before bed i get that it breaks his routine but a quick min shower at night wont kill him
he gets oily during the night how can he sleep with the daytime grime on his body since we are in the same situation i will vote nta it s hard for me to lay beside my boyfriend who has been out and about all day if he is not showered honestly it s disgusting and it s a dealbreaker for me i don t mind showering in the evening and showering again at night my bf is also a morning showerer but will shower before bed everytime i sleep over just to accommodate me no matter how tired he is you re married so your husband should compromise he honestly has nothing to lose showering twice

yta that s controlling behavior it s not like he s doing hard labor i don t know what his exact job is but if he gets bodily fluids or other icky stuff on himself he would wash it off at work not to mention showering that much is terrible for the skin
look if you are this much of a germaphobe you aren t a good match with a medical doctor gentle yta
if he works at a hospital he should shower
nta that s gross i don t want to cuddle my partner in bed unless he s washed have another shower in the morning ffs
nah you have your preferences and your boyfriend has his yours aren t more or less correct than his although i can tell you that your concerns aren t based on any rational criteria if he practices good hygiene at the hospital and doesn t climb into the bed in his scrubs i m not sure that a shower would do anything other than assuage your anxiety you have a variety of choices here counseling to address your anxiety separate bedrooms to avoid confronting it or letting this drive a wedge between you two
from a morning shower person yta
if seen way too many medical professionals in this sub call people disgusting for not showering after a shift because hospitals and people are surprisingly disgusting but back to the judgement nta whoever washes the sheets sets the rules
forget about the hospital aspect for a moment it seems to me like this would be very much of a romance dampener for many people nta
i m a little surprised a doctor doesn t wash up after and in the morning i can see the rationale for morning as i similarly get oily overnight but i d imagine in the profession he is in it s rather normal to do both seen as the likelyhood of germs and bodily fluids
lol i remember when this was posted with the genders reversed and everyone said yta but in this case it s nta solid social experiment
nah maybe try to find a compromise maybe taking two showers isnt going to work but he may be willing to do a washcloth scrub before bed or maybe y all have seperate beds during his workweek and spend the weekend where he doesnt need his wake up shower routine sleeping in the same bed and having that physical closeness as long as y all are willing to work together to find a solution to the problem and dont start treating the other persons preferences as the problem y all will be okay
i shower every night regardless of whether i sweat or not i piss and shit during the day i m not going to sleep with that residue on me
nta im a nurse and always shower before going to bed and usually as soon as i get home he may be using gloves and washing hands very often but still you never know what you are bringing home
nta i work in a hospital rampant and serious germ and virus he should have more respect for you and anyone else who lives with you it takes mins to rinse off for petes sake
yta doctors are one of the cleanest people out there and they re very aware of germs and bacteria he sounds like he s having a pretty good hygiene routine it s okay that you have a different preference but you guys need to work out a different compromise because forcing him to change his routine is not ok with him
nta as a doctor you think he would understand germs better but knowing many doctors those people are some of the dumbest people on the planet
nta a doctor should always wash up after work
nta i was always a shower in the morning person and then i went to work at a casino you bet your ass i showered before bed because i was gross
yta if you can t accept his showering and sleeping preferences sleep in separate beds it s out of line to expect him to change his personal preferences on something so individual as showering routines to accommodate you and your hang ups not everyone needs or even likes to shower before bed i for one fucking hate it my hair never feels dry enough i get cold immediately after showering not to mention i either apply lotion and feel like a slippery fish in my pj s or i go without lotion until the morning and feel like my skin is begging for re moisturizing itself for hours to avoid all that i d have to calculate my shower and my bedtime to a tee which is annoying and not the kind of control freak schedule i want to be following after a long day of being a mother and running a business my bed is clean i am clean and i have never had any single issue where my hygiene was questioned other people feel different and that s perfectly alright but i am not changing just because someone else thinks i m somehow dirty luckily my husband doesn t give a fig about it but if he did we would not share a bed he s a doctor he knows how to observe hygiene and asepsis measures at work and how to sanitize himself afterward if he didn t he would ve already had more than one issue with patients or his own health at this point this isn t about him not being clean just about you feeling like he isn t he is already willing to accommodate you sometimes demanding he does it every time makes you an asshole
yta yesterday i believe there was a post on here about a woman who works as an obgyn or at the hospital doing something and the husband wanted his wife to do the same thing you re telling your husband that man got reamed for it so i m basing my opinion on that as well as the fact that he works in a hospital so he should know how to stay clean and he clearly is if this is something that bothers you so bad then maybe this relationship isn t the one for you i m also wondering if this is a point of control for you because that s what it kind of sounds like would you ask the same of a businessman who works in the office all day if the answers no then you re trying to control your bf and for what what is going on in your life that makes you want this kind of control over someone
yta you re welcome to your feelings but what you re asking isn t reasonable
nta this is just my personal opinion of course but it s unhygienic that he would work in a hospital all day with sick people and then come home and not immediately shower why would he want to bring those germs home to you be intimate with you it can be his preference all day long but he needs to consider you as his partner and your preferences
nah bordering y t a depending on how much you push this i am a female and your bf sounds like me my hair gets oily overnight and showering in the morning is best for it and me and helps me wake up i ve tried showering at night and when i get up the next morning i feel dirty i don t want to take two showers a day and you shouldn t force your bf because you re a germaphobe
nta i agree with him about the showering in the morning as it wakes me up my wife is like you op and she showers at night before bed and expects the same of me being a respectful not whiny baby i shower again when i get home from work it s not really that difficult i can get good and clean in less than minutes
nta before you said hospital i thought you were ta but that makes a world of difference changing clothes doesn t matter those germs are on you sir a minute rinse isn t killing anyone but the germs if that s your main concern here i don t see how you could be ta especially after the covid pandemic changing everything
nta why can t he just take two showers i work as a nanny and come home with baby vom and shit all over me i take one full shower in the morning and a quick rinse off shower as soon as i get home why can t he just do that
nta he really should be showering after being in a hospital all day maybe he could have a quick shower after he gets back from work in the evening and a longer one in the morning when he wakes up i don t think it s unreasonable to ask him to do that based on your preference as you re sharing a bed together
nta the comments really confirm the stereotype about how unhygienic redditors are
nah it wouldn t shouldn t kill him to hit the shower before bed
seems like nah from a fellow night shower enjoyer i think if he complies quite often that is pretty good i could also see how some days a doctor would just want to get home and crash so he doesn t want to change his routine i also feel the worries about someone working in his field not cleaning up before bed
nta i could not sleep with someone who doesn t shower before bed that is a hard boundary line in the sand for me it seems absolutely disgusting to me to get into bed without showering
i would think hospital work would equal a shower after getting home but what do i know nah you both have equal points but also if i was a doctor i d shower after work just to feel clean but my skin also can take it
nah but i do think you have a better point he works at a hospital like that s actually such a dirty place full of harmful bacteria have you seen the signs they put up about how just touching things in certain areas could be potentially life threatening and that s just for visitors not doctors who show up in sick peoples rooms gloves or not it s not necessarily about being stinky but germy i asked the same of my partner and they were cool with it
your ah boyfriend should shower every night you would think he should know better he s a doctor
yta harming his skin for no good reason doesn t sound like a plan
yta people saying nta realize she keeps pushing and bugging him about this right he s clearly said no or that s too much and she s still asking and obviously trying to use reddit to win the argument what you have is clearly a bit of a mental health thing it s not normal and i m not saying that to be shitty or rude or even judgmental we all have mental health things it is what it is where you become the ah is making this someone else s problem instead of dealing with your shit the bed is dirty regardless skin falls off creatures live on us we sweat and drool and shed and fart all night unless you wash your sheets daily this whole argument starts from a place of ridiculousness your mental health shit should not be your boyfriends responsibility he should not have to comply with an unreasonable request he shouldn t even be confronted with one what you re asking is unreasonable and that makes you the asshole he has to make all the changes so that you get your way that s not a compromise that s just a shitty imposition you won t deal with your bullshit so instead he has to that s kind of bullshit get your ass to therapy study the science get some medication whatever but start dealing with your problem in a way that involves you making changes and not other people adapting their lives to service you that s a shitty expectation that s a shitty thing to ask and it s inexcusably entitled not to realize either of those facts apologize to your boyfriend and start figuring out what you can do to address what is a you and only you issue this is not and should not be your boyfriend s problem on any level
yta his habits are different from yours but that doesn t make him wrong that s something to keep in mind if you want to have a happy healthy relationship with him or anyone else
info do you want him to shower every single day or just on the days that he works i feel like it s a reasonable compromise for him to shower before bed on days that he works i m a big proponent of going to bed clean but my bf has a different schedule and often comes home from work absolutely wiped and goes straight to bed sometimes i ll put my foot down and make him shower depending on the state he comes home in but sometimes i just let it go because he s exhausted we do change our sheets far more often than i ever did when i lived alone just because i too am a little paranoid about keeping the bed clean
nah y all have different preferences it was fine of you to ask your bf to shower at night and it was fine of him to say no if you cannot sleep in a bed with him unless he s showered first you ll either have to have separate beds or split
nah re washing per se however bf dont wear your scrubs outside the facility this insane habit of american doctors is indeed inexplicable would you wear your white coat around in public you have locker rooms in the hospital right get changed in out of scrubs and shoes clogs are best but whatever you can get away with and saves your back leg feet and if you feel so inclined shower end of your day if the hospital doesn t wash your work attire insane double bag all your scrubs and wash separate in high temp with the appropriate detergent etc it s not about cooties or feeling dirty hygiene isn t cleanliness gf chill out on this aspect if bf has just consultations in the office it s ok in this particular case however the issue is that community microbiome belongs in the community and possibly multi resistent hospital bugs must stay in the hospital it s basic hai control do you guys even get taught microbiology healthcare hygiene id epidemiology these days plus there s a psychological benefit the day is over you re out of uniform you re a private free individual if you also shower you wash out the worries the anger the sadness and go home with space in your heart for family friends and fun
nta i agree shower before bed or sleep separately how does it work for sexy times is he just never clean beforehand
nta but you can t expect your bf to change his patterns any more than you have your routine how would you feel if he wanted you to shower in the morning pretty annoyed right that s how it feels when you try to change a person to confirm to your routine if this is a need for you to have a partner who showers at night then you ll want to find a partner who is willing to confirm to this request otherwise you ll have to accept him for who he is
yta as someone who lives with a germaphobe it s not cool to inconvenience your partner instead of getting help for your issues
nah you asked now respect his no if you keep pushing you will be
nah i shower two times daily my curly hair suffers for it but the rest of my body is alright i don t like the idea of making my bed dirty coming home from work however i m going to be honest every doctor that works in some form of surgery that i ve met or have heard talk online showers religiously when they get home like as soon as they are through the door to ensure they don t contaminate their living spaces i ve seen behaviors like this discussed in aita posts too info what kind of work does your husband do is he just a general practitioner does he do surgery of any kind if not then i wouldn t worry about his hygiene per se i d ve surprised if you told me he was a surgeon because i haven t heard from a surgeon who doesn t short when they get home i ve heard plenty who would rather sleep on the couch after extremely long shifts than risk contamination of their bed if they are too tired to even shower yet from your post you seem to suggest that your husband has a somewhat lax enviorment as much as it can be for a doctor at the very least
nta boyfriend is asshole you work in a hospital you gotta clean up after work hospitals are very infection prone obviously they work very hard to keep them clean and they are very stringent about sanitation protocols but the obvious when said corollary to that that people often don t realize is they do that because they have to because the buildings are definitionally full of diseased people and tissues because even slight errors in those sanitation protocols can leave dangerous diseases in or on the persons performing healthcare and those errors happen a lot to the tune of some hundred thousand dead a year
nta if it is caused by an actual disorder that you have diagnosed because in that case i think the bf should respect your diagnosis and help you be comfortable in any other case i d say it s a very soft yta
nta ask your boyfriend if he only washes his hands after he sees a patient obviously it s very important to wash your hands before seeing each patient he is doing the same thing to your bed he needs to wash his body before he gets into bed to get rid of the germs a warm bed with humans that sweat is the perfect medium to allow those germs to multiply overnight i get that people like to shower in the morning to wake themselves up but since your issue is with germs night showers are important
nta i teach primary kids and wouldn t think of not showering after a day in the plague grounds hospitals are even worse this is a comparability issue the two of you will have to figure out he could always have a good warm scrubbing shower in the evening and then do a quick cool rinse in the morning if for no other reason than he loves you and wants to give you peace of mind but if he isn t open to that and you can t compromise your hygiene standards i don t think you re going to be compatible long term
i m going with esh but i think it s funny op thinks her bed is cleaned after they slept in it over night and had likely sweat at some point while sleeping not to mention the dead skin cells so unless she is changing her sheets before she gets in bed every night they aren t as clean as she thinks they are
i shower morning and night
i kinda want to know what he was doing during covid my husband worked in hospitals sometimes during covid and everyone who worked in hospitals healthcare came home and stripped and showered right away
tell me you dont work in a hospital without telling me you dont work in a hospital
push two full size beds side by side separate rooms would work but so would separate beds sheets
idk if i d say not good plenty people get sweaty throughout the day and have to wash when they get home
yes and he was determined to not be the ah lol https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12a5vhe/aita\_for\_sleeping\_on\_the\_couch\_when\_my\_wife\_comes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12a5vhe/aita_for_sleeping_on_the_couch_when_my_wife_comes/) most people including those who also worked at hospitals were saying his wife should shower before bed
what is wrong with you nta for wanting a clean partner the responses on this thread from unwashed men are too much
we re still in the middle of a pandemic and the hospital is one of the most infested areas ever i won t be fine sleeping with all that bacteria just for preference
i recommended we get a second bed for when i really want just a clean space but he says we don t have space
not sure if true but i think people were pretty rough with op pretty chill here
he works as a hospitalist ie a general doctor in a hospital meaning he interacts daily with patients but spends most of the time sitting at a computer putting in orders writing notes
honestly it depends on what kind of doctor he is some have very little patient contact there s a big difference between a surgeon or er doctor and and a radiologist they are all doctors but their exposure to patients and fluids are very different
agree i would honestly prefer he shower as soon as he gets home and put scrubs in to wash asap shoes left in the garage as well i m not a germaphobe but his exposure level is high and he should respect her concerns
same
if that s really op s issue they should want the so to shower immediately when they get home because otherwise dude is chilling around the house sitting on furniture touching surfaces making food etc it s not the issue though op is simply one of those people who prefers to shower before bed because it makes them feel clean totally fine so doesn t though and one person doesn t get to dictate what the other does unless someone is tracking actual mud or something into the house with them
the top comments to that post are all nta though
https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12a5vhe/aita_for_sleeping_on_the_couch_when_my_wife_comes/ like this one where a man posts about his wife who is a doctor and they agree that she should shower the circumstance is a little different in that he is asking if he is an asshole for sleeping on the couch so he s not asking her to change her behavior but i have yet to see any strongly worded posts about how much he sucks on here
i wonder if it is just plain old sexism or if it has to do with what time it was posted
but if it s so unhygienic then she shouldn t want to be around him at all whatever nasties he s brought home will be on every surface that she touches too from the kitchen to the sofa so unless he is cocooning herself and not touching him while they are watching tv this is a moot point not ti mention the fact that her bathroom is just as full of the nasties given toilets will spray feces particles up to 15ft so they can both shower and even use a new towel each time but the secind either of them brush up against counter or just walk across the floor they ve both brought possible contamination into the bed
just out of curiosity are you by any chance still washing your groceries when you bring them into the house
lol a regular person is more likely to bring all sorts of germs and bacteria into their home just from going about their day than a doctor is after a shift they observe strict hygiene and asepsis measures unless op and you are freaks that still sanitize every surface before and after touching it wear gloves and masks outside at all times etc then you re not cleaner than a doctor
that s not health for your skin at all first thing i learned in nursing school is that you shouldn t shower daily according to some study i read a few years ago times a week would be optimal unless there is dirt sweat involved

i think yta because you didn t tell your classmate that your paper was going to be riffing off of their idea you didn t do anything to credit them for leading you in that direction and you were also kind of a dick about it when your classmate was understandably surprised and kind of upset when they found out there s nothing wrong with taking other peoples ideas observations and expanding on them incredible and original work is created that way but you should always make sure to give credit where credit is due and a heads up would have been respectful
footnote or add a note of appreciation at the front for his contribution
yta you expanded on his idea but you also absolutely stole his original observation
your comments have solidly made yta you sound super narcissistic this person isn t even your friend but you know that they wouldn t have come up with as good of an idea as you so it s your obligation to steal it as if you are bettering academia or accomplishing anything but taking the easy route on a single assignment
yta it was his idea not yet fully formed but still his initial thoughts he could have thought more on the topic and ended up writing his paper on the same thing if it wasn t for his idea and discussion with you would you have come up with it on your own you should have reached out to him and said hey i was thinking about that idea you had and came up with some interesting thoughts if you aren t going with the topic i m going to run with it
your friend should understand this is how almost everything on a scholarly level works there are little to no original ideas especially in philosophy
light yta because you should have credited him with finding the observation in your paper
im really torn i think id need to know more about philosophy tbh and how rare his finding really was im going to say yta for now but a cautious one
esh you suck for not coming up with your own idea your friend sucks for whining that someone else turned his idea into a paper you both sound annoying
nta however you probably should ve given him a heads up that you a developed a deeper analysis of his observation and was planning on writing your paper about it you re not an ah for piggybacking in his initial observation but in academic circles it s common courtesy to let a classmate or colleague know you are planning to expand upon a topic they are currently researching you re under no obligation to stop writing about it if your classmate didn t like the fact that you were thinking about this topic too but giving him a heads up is the professional thing to do
nta if he could have written your paper he would have
nta your classmate would fit in with the people who always say they stole my idea invention of just because they thought of something doesn t mean they wrote the paper just like when someone thinks of a useful invention that not around and says why doesn t this exist i should invent it it doesn t mean other people have never thought of it and then stole their invention especially if the never made the invention to begin with
yta should have told him asked first
nta honestly those observations are all over the net it isn t the apparatus but the force that drive the mind that the professor wanted to see people document observation all the times but it takes real effort to see the pattern op probably could give his classmate some credit next time put it in the paper as a classmate of mine pointed out the
deleted
nta you can t lay claim to an idea generally speaking and call simply having the idea plagiarism look at all the content out now on the concept of a battle royale where a bunch of people are stuck in one place killing each other from video games like fortnite and apex legends to books like hunger games to the original battle royale novel that later became a manga and movie success in japan all of these things take the same basic concept and make very different stories around it some even having very different and varied social commentaries relevant to the concerns of the time and often heavily influenced by the culture behind the people who created that content at the end of the day your peer can be whiny about it if he wants but he had just as much a chance to work it out as you did if not more if he wanted to really work with it he should have done so
yta it doesn t matter if it was an observation or an analysis though he did analyze the work resulting in the identification of some patterns that s prior work that you did not do and you presented it as if it was your own what you did would have been fine if you cited his work and citations are a hallmark of quality work not in any respect something that diminishes a finding or analysis
yta what you did was acceptable by the laws of academic integrity so you didn t break rules but it was still an ah move this wasn t a passing discussion that you picked up on you and your acquaintance were explicitly talking about the paper and he confided a topic he was clearly interested in that you ultimately took and were given a lot of attention for you didn t steal anything but you clearly used his thinking as a jumping off point and it s rude to claim that you did all of the thinking or that his thinking wasn t useful his thinking was clearly useful to you he gave you a massive push down a path you didn t even see you easily could have given him a shout out even if just by saying a discussion with a classmate made x clear in your paper or after your speech the least you could have done is quietly mentioned it in passing to him at some point hey thanks for the other day you got me thinking and i took a closer look and got inspired to write my paper about y academia thrives on collaboration you won t make many friends if you deny that you re taking inspiration from others
yta your comments have told me all i needed to know
yta
your professor an adult vindicated you the notion that you stole anything would mean that anytime anyone has a discussion about any random thing and an interlocutor hears something in that discussion and digs further and does something more with it it s theft that s ridiculous nta
nta he recognized a pattern you gave the pattern meaning the bulk of your paper was not based on his observations

nta you could have both written a paper on the same thing from two points of view and your acquaintance didn t choose to do so
nta no one owns an idea or an observation however i would have added something to my paper thanking my friend for drawing my attention to the pattern
i m curious what was the pattern
okay let me see if i got this right after a week you were unsure what to write your paper on since you state that your acquaintance couldn t do anything with their observation after a week an acquaintance then shared an observation you found interesting but they didn t know how to take it further you decided to withhold your insight even though they shared their findings not exactly an asshole move but come on the paper landed you praise but you still refused to give any credit to your acquaintance in my opinion you had two options share your insight during the exchange as it could have led to your acquaintance being able to write about the observation from their perspective or give them some credit as without their observation you wouldn t have the paper that landed you praise but as things stand i d have to go with yta
you didn t ask him because you knew he wouldn t be okay with it according to you in the comments this makes you an even bigger ah
yta you keep saying his observation was meaningless and useless compared to your work i would love to know how you would manage to conduct research and analysis of something you didn t even notice in the first place
nta to put it in legal terms you can t copyright an idea
just a note from a legal perspective nta copyright does not cover ideas so there was no plagiarism or theft here
nta but i think you should ve told him not asked about the paper just a hey i had a look into what you were talking about or just gave some credit for the original idea he s pissed he couldn t write a paper on it
that s fair how could i have credited him
fair
i don t disagree with that but i do think an observation on its own is useless so i don t see it as an ah move
yes i know he wouldn t have done anything with it so i took it because it s an interesting issue that should be discussed i m not sure what s wrong with that
the reason i didn t was that i m pretty sure he would have said no and then the idea would have gone to waste altogether
fair although we are just high school students so pretty far from academia
fair how could i have done that
it s not rare at all plato s dialogues are thousands of years old so i think almost every pattern you could find in them has already been analyzed to death
annoying how
thanks for the advice
exactly he wouldn t have been able to do anything more
yup i hardly think his observation about a dialogue that s thousands of years old is unique and either way since he wouldn t have been able to take it any further than an observation i don t think it s an issue
i didn t because he would have said no and let the observation go to waste which i think is an ah move
that s how i saw it as well observations alone are meaningless without the ability to analyze them which i had and he didn t
thank you
good example and you re right i d take it a step further since he didn t even have an idea just an observation
i didn t present it as if it was my own expecting original observations from a work that s thousands of years old is absurd
to clarify he is just a passing acquaintance
always glad to be informative
yup it was the starting off point which i used to draw in more evidence cross reference other works and provide an analysis for what it all meant
thank you
high school
you could have written it into your paper organically or you could have included it in a notes section at the end or you could have just said it super briefly to the class before reading your paper thanks to classmate for helping me identify the pattern that is the basis of my paper i m honored to expand on that conversation for you all ahem
so the immediate parallel that came to mind for me was watson crick who used franklin s radiograph to determine dna s structure we now recognize that although watson crick made a fantastic discovery is was unethical as fuck to use someone else s data to get there without explicit permission and to fail to adequately cite the original person who generated the data franklin gosling similarly in this case the original student had an observation essentially raw data but didn t have the interpretation the original student still generated something of use because the interpretation could not happen without that observation to work from
it probably would have been appropriate to tell him what you were doing your work was after all inspired by his observations it is your own work but he did contribute
you don t know that you assumed when you assume you make an ass out of u and me you are acting dumb and lying right now you have already admitted in your other comments that you decided that your peer would not like you stealing their idea so you purposefully did not tell them ask permission or mention the issue to your teacher you purposely did not credit your classmate you are choosing to be shady and manipulate people and things to get the result that you want you don t care about anyone else you are an asshole
honestly as much as you re getting ta d the comments it is a good thing you asked especially if you end up accepting some of the feedback and growing from the experience not everyone is strong enough to do that
so you knew it was wrong and and he wouldn t like it and still did it that s even morally worse yta
which is an asshole way to treat someone
uh no you re not from webster s the meaning of academia is the life community or world of teachers schools and education while you weren t technically wrong to use your friend s observations you could have avoided some ill will if you d thanked him before your papers were graded for giving you the observations that inspired your essay
also yta but not that light you could have mentioned it to your friend beforehand but purposely didn t you could have mentioned your friend in your paper but purposely didn t how to give them credit in your presentation your introduction could literally be that you were talking with your classmate _______ and they observed ________ this led to or this inspired the thesis of your paper
by asking how you re annoying you are not introspective enough to understand others
i think you re being kind of condescending though he totally might have figured it out himself after dedicating more time to it why are you so insistent that he couldn t have
also an interesting question to have your classmate answer did your teacher only have you read your essay to only praise the observation made or did they just like the whole paper if they only wanted to point out the observation then credit is due to classmate but i m guessing they liked the whole paper haha
it s an ah move to make you do all the work of coming up with a unique observation and analysis isn t that what all you other classmates had to do or it s an ah move to deprive the world of your genius analysis
this is a terrible take what would you have without his observation you didn t see it yta for trying to take all the credit
so because you have the ability to analyze that gives you ownership of the observation that s total bullshit without his observations you had fuck all you assume that he wouldn t have gotten there because you think you re smarter than him for seeing what he didn t but you re apparently not smart enough to realize that some people take longer to analyze longer to put the puzzle together but they do eventually get there given time he may have come up with all of it on his own but you ll never know now
yea that s fair honestly for all you or any of us know if he had kept at it and established something he could work with for a paper he could have come up with a different explanation for that pattern than you did i never did too well in philosophy myself the textbooks made my brain hurt but from my understanding of much of the content it s not necessarily a field where everyone in the room will come to the same conclusions even when presented with the same content
did you cite your friend as a contributor or did you reference a difference source if not then you presented the work as wholly your own thinking and analysis there s a reason you spend so much time in school learning about the construction of bibliographies it s not to have advanced formatting knowledge it s about reinforcing the importance of giving credit where it is due
that s true
i can see how that would apply here although i would say it was probably far less work on my acquaintances part than on franklin s
fair
fair as for academia i was thinking more on a level of college and academics who publish in academic journals but fair
you could have mentioned it to your friend beforehand but purposely didn t you could have mentioned your friend in your paper but purposely didn t yeah because i knew he d say no and this would mean the observation would go to waste
you re right the oc is a time traveler who knew i would make this comment after they made theirs and deemed me annoying on that basis
as i said in the op he told me this idea a week after the paper was assigned and said he had been thinking about the deeper meaning since the paper was assigned to me the deeper meaning was evident the moment he explained the pattern so if a week wasn t enough to figure it out it s heavily unlikely he would be able to at all
that s a good point i hadn t thought of looking at the feedback he liked the entire paper especially the analysis and delve into the deeper meaning of the observation which was my work
and your paper was significantly less work than watson and crick s so
i was on the fence on this one but this comment where you admit to knowing he d be against it and doing it anyway pushes it to yta for me
that makes you an asshole imo if he tells you no at that point then you bring it to the teacher if it is worth burning a friendship working relationship over every one else had to come up with their own observations and ideas that s part of the process if they had okayed it then that s one thing but to purposely hide it because he would be upset come on
you wrote this to show us how annoying you are right good job puppy
even if that is true the fact that it isn t a kind thing to say should also be evident to you and you got something valuable from his insights so you should give some kudos
with significant less stakes too they stole what i assume was months of years of work to make a discovery that would make them world famous i stole somebody s observation of a book to get a good grade on a paper that was the point i was making
agreed this pushed me off the fence as well yta
that s fair
i mean i called him an acquaintance for a reason i value the subject enough that i wouldn t want a good observation to go to waste
added benefit really
and doing that is still an unethical ah move even if on a smaller scale you should have asked the guy who made the initial observation if he was okay with you using his initial observation or at the very least given him credit
edited to call it a working relationship since splitting hairs is all that matters apparently
i didn t ask him because i knew he wouldn t be okay with it and then the observation would go to waste which i didn t want
wouldn t exactly call it a working relationship because we re just students in the same class i think it s important to get the nature of the relationship down right to illustrate the level of relationship in giving up
the observation would go to waste okay you mean i wouldn t have had anything to write a paper about because i wasn t intelligent enough to figure out the subject matter on my own
you didn t ask him because you knew he wouldn t be okay with it the classic asshole line
splitting hairs is all that matters apparently
you can call it that if you like but i think it s a difference between stealing an idea from a friend vs stealing it from a random guy in my class

nta he s upset not because he hurt your feelings but because he knows you recognize the imbalance in your relationship he s also upset because other people either now see how he treated you or now publicly acknowledge it i m not saying the following statement to be mean i m saying it so you can see how obvious it is to a reddit rando who has never met you or any of your family members your brother is self centered and absolutely puts his own interests above you even your mother acknowledges this when you told her he was not attending because he was picking up a puppy she said she was disappointed but not surprised i m sorry i can imagine being on the outs with your brother hurts a lot this is a big step in claiming the respect you deserve and i hope you realize that and stand your ground you have done nothing to feel guilty about i get that you still do feel guilty but this outside observer absolves you of any unwarranted guilt
nta you literally said how you felt that he was choosing a dog over you because his past actions have also proven you aren t a priority he just feels guilty and uncomfortable
if he didn t want you telling people he backed out of your graduation festivities to get a dog he shouldn t have backed out of your graduation festivities to get a dog nta obviously
nta for the comment because it s true but i do think your relationship with your brother is unhealthy based on what you describe it s pretty clear that you two want to be in each other s lives a different amount and there s no easy answer to handling that i do think you should talk to him about how one sided things have been for so long but i also think you should back off he s made it pretty clear with his apathy that he doesn t value your relationship as much as you do it s unfortunate but you re setting yourself up for disappointment by expecting otherwise
info have you gone to therapy at all regarding your relationship with your brother we can t possibly know all of the context of your relationship from your post but you ve described an extremely one sided need for his approval that seems to be some combination of him his friends bullying you and you trying desperately to force a relationship with somebody who is very clearly trying to ice you out and you definitely need to work through that sort of thing professionally the choosing a dog over you is a wakeup call that something here is deeply screwed up and needs re evaluation more than anything
nta after getting a lifetime pass from you you finally had your say wish you had said it to him directly but in either case he finally heard the truth
as i read your post i thought i could be reading about my life in my case my brother is younger i was two years old and in love with him from the moment my parents brought him home i was so excited to be a big sister but like you i was always the one chasing him to have a relationship it took me until i was around to really see what was happening and i stopped i don t know if he even noticed but my mom did and asked me about it i told her i realized he didn t care about me and i wasn t going to chase him anymore she argued with me about it for months and finally told me how much it hurt her so i started trying again for her and i did it for years i regret that so much now after she passed away i was proven right and he started a fight so he wouldn t have to pay me back the money he owed me that was years ago and i haven t seen him since and i don t expect to i grieved as if he had died and moved on please don t let other people guilt you into continuing to chase him it will bring you nothing but pain be civil when you see him at family gatherings but please stop chasing him for a relationship that will never happen i m not going to lie to you it s going to hurt but after the grief there can be peace
nta on this particular situation but your obsession about your brother and constantly calling him best friend when he has never even considered u a friend is very unhealthy you need therapy for that it s time to let go not all siblings are friends and being siblings doesn t mean that he loves u the same way u love him relationship any kind require efforts from both ends
nta there s no way that he planned to get the dog before knowing when graduation is especially since you graciously got him a free room he purposefully chose to be selfish and it doesn t seem like anyone s on his side he only cares that word got out not that he hurt you and he didn t even apologize while he was letting you down much less after
nta you just said how you felt i haven t spoken to my brother for over 10yrs long story short i hadnt seen him for 2yrs he and his wife planned a surprised trip to town so i wasn t able to book time off work which meant i was unable to see them when they were free i was working and when i was free they were busy etc after their trip i told my mum i was disappointed they didn t make more effort to see me or atleast give me a heads up they were coming brother got angry and told me not to ever talk to him again and i haven t it s sucks but what can you do
i mean no disrespect when i say this but is he your brother or a real life doll you shove love into
info i invited my whole family out to celebrate everyone got a plane ticket and hotel room i m paying for and it s been planned out for months what communication came from your brother did he accept your invitation before you bought flights and reserved rooms did he have input into his flight
info could you give some examples of how his friends would bully you also did you ever try to make your own friends or did you think of your brother as enough did you live in a more urban area with lots of people or a more rural area with not a lot of people
info did you actually ask your brother if he wanted to come before you made all the reservations
nta i thought my sibling was my best friend as well until one day it literally hit me on the head that i wasn t when she knowingly hurt my feelings and didn t care i had to take a step back she s not my best friend and it hurt a lot more to even realize i ve been spending a lot of time and energy on somebody who i consider to be the most important person in my life and i didn t register as important to them at all at this point in time she s just a step from being an acquaintance had been for the last years you can t force somebody to want something that you do that they don t wish you the best of luck
nta but you clearly have not been picking up on the signals your brother has been showing
how awkward must it have been for younger brother to have older follow him around anywhere and i say that as the older brother by years
nta for saying what he did but honestly it seem like you in your brother didn t have a relationship at all and you just tried to push yourself in his life because you didn t have many friends even though him and his friend s attempted to get you to leave them alone and now his trying to avoid you because he can now but couldn t before
nta he got called out for bad behavior hopefully you find someone that supports you and values your time and friendship
nah it sounds like you re hurt and he has never returned your intense attachment to him which is his right inviting yourself to stuff following his friends around unwanted and describing yourself as his best friend aren t marks of a healthy sibling dynamic
nta you need to end this depenancy on him he doesn t show it back
nta move on without him he is not your best friend
you don t have to answer this but are you on the spectrum i can relate to this a bit as a person with autism
nta but maybe he resents you for following him and his friends around in highschool it s cute when it s a little sibling who doesn t understand and glorifies her big brother but it s a little weird when it s an older sibling glorifying and following around a younger one even when him and his friends are making it clear they don t want her around he s an ah for not rescheduling for something more important but it sounds like you ve been pushing an unwanted relationship onto him and are mad that that didn t force him to have the same relationship towards you
info perhaps your behavioural need to follow your brother around at a younger time caused him some suffering in his social group have you ever detected any feelings of resentment from him has his peers ever made fun of him because of you though this was most likely whe you are not around perhaps you are the root cause of his behaviour towards you
nta the truth hurts sometimes you deserve to be treated with a little more care and consideration
letting his friends bully you never reciprocating when you gave him birthday and christmas presents never making an effort to stay in touch i m sorry op but your brother has never been your friend and he s only sad now because he s realizing that you re finally figuring that out and your mom has known all along good for you for finally calling him on his crap and you shouldn t feel guilty about having done so nta
honey i have to say a gentle esh here from what you wrote your brother has been telling you for years that he doesn t want to be friends with you and you refused to take the hint getting a puppy on that specific day is shitty but it also seems like he s trying to force you to understand without actually saying the words you deserve friends who truly want to be your friends but you need to let your brother just be your brother
nta you re stating what happened and he s upset because it s making him feel bad that this is how you see it unless he s getting the puppy from a kill shelter he can wait a couple of days for something that is important to you
nta and if i were you i d take the opportunity to expand on your thoughts in an email or text he knows you re upset about this one instance i d let him know it s not just the dog that how people act shows their priorities and you ve always gotten him presents for birthdays and christmas and you always initiate conversation but he never responds in kind tell him the fact that he blew off your graduation confirms what you d been feeling for a long time and that you will stop trying so hard to be involved in his life though it may be difficult for you this might give him the wake up call that it s more than just deciding to adopt a dog right when you are graduating he probably doesn t know how you are interpreting his actions and how much it bothers you once you do this he will either rise to the occasion or he won t this is giving him one last chance plenty of people don t appreciate what they have until they don t have it anymore
nta and that sound you heard from him was his being called out when my father died i tried to establish a relationship with my half brother i made all the attempts he didn t do anything the last conversation we had i had asked if he wanted to get together at christmas my dad died on thanksgiving he never replied to anything and never reached out it was then that i decided that if he didn t think enough about me to want to attempt a relationship then all i could do is walk away yeah it hurt but life is too damn short to put effort into a one sided relationship he has shown you time after time that he has no intention of cultivating a relationship believe him you can love him but you don t owe him the right to make you feel bad
nta even your mother wasn t surprised you called him out on the selfishness and now you can just leave it be and focus on your own life
i don t envy you or your brother it s not nice that he cancelled but your relationship also doesn t sound very healthy
as someone with an older brother who puts effort into maintaining a relationship with me i feel you op it hurts when we love them so much and they re too sucked up their own assholes to realise they re throwing away a sibling but we can t force them to maintain a relationship nta
i was the quiet awkward older sister in my house too and there weren t a lot of girls my age in our neighbourhood so my brother and i played together a lot growing up as we got older and outgrew the lego and playmobil we hung out together with other neighbourhood kids unlike your brother my brother got mad when his friends said anything negative about me he also got mad when one of them had a crush on me lol he was very protective because he cared about my feelings and i was there for him during his first heartbreak and when he got in trouble we bought made each other gifts i still have a little coiled clay bowl he made me in art class we live far apart now but when ever he can afford to he comes to visit and i go visit him we text share pics and while i ve never really called anyone my best friend he probably fit that description when we were young and still does to a certain extent your brother seems to make selfish choices so much so that his own mother notices maybe this incident will make him reflect on why people see him this way maybe it won t but he agreed to come celebrate with you and your family and then he backed out because of a postponable event your description of what he did is how it felt to you and anything he got dished out as a result was deserved i wouldn t cut him off just yet but i would definitely let him make the next move he owes you that much nta
when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time maya angelou he s a shit brother don t waste your time nta congrats on graduating
nta you can t skip out on major life events for a family members and not expect to receive any blow back he made his choice now he s gotta live with it and don t feel guilty op you ve done the reaching your whole life its time to see if he ll do the same and if he doesn t then you know where you stand on his priority list you shouldn t feel guilty for standing up for yourself if he didn t want to face the embarrassment of his actions he shouldn t have made that choice
nta stop being your brother s doormat it s a very uneven relationship that you ve got going on here and it s not doing you any good take a step back and let him think about it
nta you just called your brother s behavior what it is and now he s shifting his guilt onto you and trying to dodge accountability it s unfortunate he hasn t valued your relationship all these years and i get why you re pissed his behavior is inconsiderate and i don t blame you for distancing yourself from such a one sided relationship all relationships should be reciprocal and no single person should initiate all the contact btw congrats on graduating
nta for telling your parents about the dog however i think you had unhealthy relationship with your brother for a long time you forced yourself on him and his friends although it was made clear they want to be left alone it s strange for older sister to follow her younger brother around and push her way into all his social groups i don t know why your parents didn t intervene they should ve let him play with his friends on his own and stop this weird codependent relationship from your post i suspect your brother became resentful of you personally i feel like this is more of a nah case because it doesn t sound like there s much of a relationship between you two even your parents weren t surprised if your brother doesn t care about you i get why he would prioritize his dog over you
nta for how you feel those are your feelings but all i could think about while reading your post is your younger brother having his older sister always tag along with his friends no brother sister wants their sibling to always tag along and i think we ve read stories on reddit on how much they would hate to be forced to invite sibling and share friends to me it seems like you were the annoying sister and made this whole one sided relationship have you discuss any of this with him you may have your side of things but he also has his and you may need to hear his reasons as to why he s not close to you
nta you told the truth it is very telling that he cares that others know how poorly he treated you but not that his actions were very hurtful to you this is about him and his lacking and not you you deserve better
nah it has been clear for a long time that as far as he is concerned you re not particularly close and your pushing for more seems to be driving him farther away if you back off some and meet him where he is you might end up being closer as you get older but pressuring him to be your best friend when he clearly doesn t feel the same is counterproductive
not ta for informing your parents that your brother wasn t going due to getting a dog but you kinda are for jumping to the conclusion and framing it like he planned to get this dog on that specific date to somehow hurt you to your parents given the limited information you provided you seem to have had a possible parasocial attachment to your younger brother growing up directly or indirectly involving yourself in his personal time especially with his friends around is often straining on a sibling dynamic when ages are reversed in your situation it was his older sister following him around being near as a developing kid along with his friends clearly not enjoying someone they weren t friends with always being close by i m sure didn t help with his growing resentment to you as he got older wanting space and distance while i fully sympathize with you about feeling lonely getting bullied not having many friends and idolizing your younger brother to an extent when you were kids your investment into him while he has clearly shown time and time again that he s not as interested is concerning for you as an adult i wouldn t even necessarily blame you for this as a child your parents should have definitely intervened to help guide you through your struggles as a child but as an adult you should definitely be seeking assistance in dealing with these feelings with a professional whether that s a psychologist or at the least school hired counselor your own growing resentment towards him for not prioritizing you is a situation you need to learn is okay to walk away from at this point in your life you guys aren t kids anymore it s okay to grow apart back to your brother and his puppy to say that he s flat out choosing a dog over you may be a bit harsh he s an adult living his own life with his own responsibilities and plans while he definitely should have made his change in availability public to yourself and those of your family attending much more in advance indeed making him a possible ah stuff happens he should at the least be paying you back for both the plane ticket and hotel cost you spent on him for the situation at hand esh in their own ways congratulations on your graduation have a great time make memories your brother has made his choices you don t need him there in order to be happy on your day
big congratulations on your graduation you have great things coming in your future nta that s just so shitty i m so sorry your brother is a taker and an ah don t feel guilty for calling him out on his bad behavior to you he s just upset that others can see it now
this is weird you re practically trying to force a relationship with your brother who doesn t want one signs have been there since you were a child and you are fully aware of this yet you still haven t grown up i understand you re hurt but he s not obligated to attend just like with any invitation nobody is required to attend something they don t want to maybe he s trying to create more space because you won t take the hint
honestly i think esh you for being the clingy older sister that never took a hint growing up and it took until you were almost thirty your parents for not noticing this and intervening when you guys were kids your brother for being passive the whole time and not being direct with you to give him space seems like a lot of unspoken emotions
esh him for allowing his friends bully you and you for not getting the hint that he doesn t like you at the bare minimum he should at least get you gifts but i do think he just sees you as his annoying older sister the graduation thing tho is a sign that you need to move on and limit your contact at least till you feel better he s not the worst person but that s actually very hurtful i would advise you to seek therapy apologize to him for bothering him all these years and not getting his very obvious hints but tell him that it s very disappointing that he doesn t even do the bare minimum like getting gifts reciprocating affection etc and that you have gotten the message clearly that you wish him happiness but you re going to stop making any effort with him from now on bye he s your distant relative at this point
nta i think you re in deep deep denial over your brother he doesn t act like your friend or even your sibling so not sure why you latched on to him so hard even now knowing how excited you are about your graduation and knowing your plans he decided to get a dog he is telling you without words exactly where you stand in his life time to cut the cord maybe send him one last letter detailing one sided relationship and your hurt and confusion as to why he doesn t seem to want you in his life and conclude with message received will not contact you again
i m going with nah whether you realize it or not you ve driven your brother away by never giving him any space you ve latched onto him for years but in the end he did choose a dog over your graduation so i understand both views but can t blame either of you this is the unfortunate outcome of an unbalanced relationship and you need to take into consideration how he actually feels if you don t want to lose your brother
i say ehs you for not realizing that it s highly weird for an older sibling to hang out with their younger siblings friends especially ones that bully and belittle you your brother is also an ass because he should have said right to your face when you were younger that he doesn t want you around instead he just let his friends bully you and when they were gone turned all nice and shit you honestly need therapy and obviously your brother doesn t care to have a relationship with you any time soon
i m feeling really guilty because i ve always forgiven my brother and i ve never heard him sound the way he did on the phone yeah this is the problem your brother has never been held accountable because you always forgave him now he s done something shitty and he gets to feel like shit for it the fact that you feel guilty is just more evidence of you being a decent person and him just not giving two shits about you nta it sounds like he s chosen a lot more than just a dog over you
i ve never heard him sound the way he did on the phone because you ve never called him out on it before think about your mom s response she wasn t surprised at all by your brother s behavior he s done things like this before and you have always let him get away with them don t feel bad about this you re nta
i m curious to know why you thought he was your best friend i m wondering did you have any friends growing up besides him to compare
nta i don t think your brother is either it s pretty bad of him to cancel after all the reservations has been made but do you think you tried to push a relationship on him
nta but you are kind of slow your brother is not your best friend and if you think he is then you need new friends he shown you what he is and he s shown you over and over and he might even get an ego kick out of thinking he can just do whatever he wants and you ll go along stop playing that game be civil and get along but forget the gifts and the pretense of your relationship being a close friendship and for crying out loud let this teach you a lesson in valuing yourself no one is perfect but believe what people show you about them because you deserve better
nta he actually chose to pick up a dog over coming to your wedding it s exactly what you said my brother chose a dog over me if the truth hurts your brother that s on him he should honor his commitment and choose you over picking up a new dog if the truth bothers him too much
nta you told the truth and he got upset i would recommend low contact or no contact because it seems like your brother does not care about you and you ve always forgiven him and given him gifts but he has never reciprocated
nta he does not see this relationship the way you do i d call him again and tell him what you told us some people aren t as emotionally aware some people don t place as much importance in gifts as other people i d ask your brother what he wants in a relationship from you is is possible that while you see this graduation as a big milestone in your life and you want your family to be part of it he does not see what this has to do with him like this is your thing not his thing
nta but i don t think your brother is the ah either i totally understand why you d be frustrated and disappointed i would be too but adopting a pet is hard and if he puts the adoption appointment on hold there s a very strong chance that the dog would be adopted by someone else so he probably saw that opportunity as now or never that said if he had to miss your graduation trip to adopt this dog he should have at least made it up to you by planning a trip to visit you at a different time
unpopular but y t a i m getting strong missing missing reasons vibes from this post like has it never occurred to you that maybe your brother didn t want you always following him around and now he pretty much resents you phrasing it like he chose a dog over me comes off as very attention seeking and dramatic you could have just said he was busy or you could have been honest in a more neutral way but instead you can t accept the fact the person who you decided was your biggest priority doesn t view you the same so him finally being able to choose something else other than you is a huge affront edit esh canceling the day before when someone has already paid for your plane ticket is a dick move he should at the very least pay you back
nah i don t blame you for being hurt but i don t blame him for wanting his distance from you it really seems like you smothered him when you were children because you were weird and awkward and he had a lot of friends it s also possible that your parents made him let you follow him and his friends around and he resented you for it as a result i also can t help but think that there was more to his story than you let everyone else know
nta it s sad
yta i realise that this vote is going against the trend but your feelings for your brother seem to be a good deal more intense than his feelings for you this isn t a new thing he s made that clear for years by your own account justified or not it isn t healthy for you to continue to try to force a kind of relationship with him that doesn t exist outside of your hopes he doesn t want to have the kind of relationship with you that you want to have with him he never did i know that it s not what you want to hear but it s what you need to hear so that you can begin to move on and heal
here s the thing your bro doesn t owe you presents or being your best friend you said it was one sided you have to accept that however that doesn t mean that you don t get to be honest about it he really does care more about a dog than you if he s going to act like that he needs to own it because he certainly hasn t earned a good brother badge nta
esh but i m wondering if one or both of you are neurodivergent and aren t good at reading each others signals and are not communicating well it s a bit unusual for an older sister to be bffs with their younger brother sure some siblings are very compatible and close but a lot aren t and to be a part of their friend group particularly when it seems those friends weren t always on board with including you that puts little brother in an awkward position of choosing between peers and sibling and its understandable that he might have wanted to have his own peer group and not always include his older sibling but failed at setting boundaries and while he may have loved you he might not have liked hanging out with you so much i m wondering where your parents were in all of this when you were growing up were they pushing to have you two do everything together so he got resentful of always being told to include his sister did they ever try to help you both establish some healthy space i think your parents let this misunderstanding go way too far it seems like they noticed that things weren t balanced but decided to pretend everything was fine
after reading other people s points of view i m sticking to esh i didn t think about it but you as the friendless awkward older sister followed your little brother around despite them bullying you to keep you away they spit in your face pretty much and you deluded yourself into thinking he wanted you around and that you were best friends it s going to sound mean but i m not entirely sure you know what a friend is just off you calling him your best friend and not having any other friends to call your own you ve never really known friendship to say that he ever was one to you i imagine he was nice to you in private just because he didn t want to be mean to you around his friends but he had to if he didn t want friends bullying him about his lame older sister trailing behind him like a lost dog onto him i don t think he should have accepted those gifts but maybe he just thought you would get the message but he was horribly wrong i think after a while he really should have told you straight up you re not his best friend i get that maybe he really didn t think you would be able to mentally handle it but he really needed to do it so you could go to therapy sooner not sure how i feel at the dog comment on one hand you personally felt he chose a dog over you because you latched onto him in a way he never did for you and maybe for him it s not that serious idk tldr you re both in the wrong you need therapy like not even yesterday but like years ago he should ve told you explicitly how he felt about you but maybe he thought you were too fragile for that esh
i had a friend once we used to go out a lot and it was really cool we laughed we had fun etc but somehow i was always the person who would call up and ask if we should go out or if we could meet one day i thought i will test it and did not call her our friendship ended that day she never phoned or texted me never tried to make any contact there are weird people out there obviously your brother is not this extreme but it s kind of the same one sided relationship where he just takes what you give and does not bother to invest anything nta
yta i honestly don t understand the n t a votes op inserted herself into her brothers life since childhood and it affected him negatively she knew the relationship was one sided but didn t care it s cruddy behaviour of him but i m guessing the whole family would have been harassing him for months if he was honest from the get go this way at least he ll only have the blowback from now until maybe a month after the event and then no one will care anymore he made the best choice for him and you can t accept he has a life without you
ayta for calling it like it is nta he just used that as a weak excuse to not make the effort with you
yta this is sad i don t know how best to explain this giving gifts and putting in effort isn t virtuous when you re ignoring everything they say and do to show you that they re not interested it s like the emotional equivalent of talking over someone you re forcing a relationship on him that he doesn t want and given how quickly he heard about your little quip i d bet money it s your family that has been pressuring him to be your caretaker this whole time you should be a little less hurt about him not seeing you as a best friend and a little more hurt that you never noticed how overbearing you ve been a little respect for him might go a long way to getting some balance to your relationship
my sister has been gone for many years she was just like you but the difference was so was i we were each other s best friends you obviously always wanted that and i don t blame you because it s great but he definitely is not that kind of sibling i think that anything you thought that was great about him was really just you filling in the blanks there may come a day when he s older when he thinks back and realizes that the best peer in his life was always right there in front of him but you can t count on that for now you have to see that you didn t lose your best friend he never existed to begin with nta obviously and congratulations on graduating good luck moving forward
nah smells like you put your brother through some one sides emotional incest you were two years older forcing yourself into his social life and tried buying his friendship not surprising that there could be some resentment from his side
did you consider you have been suffocating him since he was a child his older sister just leeching onto him and his friends
yta you ve been practically forcing yourself onto your brother all these years
yta it should have taken you much less time than years he has never showed you anything to signify he thought the same of you this is the only thing that makes me say yta because you expected something from him that he has never given you before
nta your brother has treated you like crap forever he is taking you for granted do yourself a favor and let him initiate from now on maybe he will realize what he s missing maybe he won t but at least you can save your energy for those who will build you up and appreciate you
sweetheart it s time to wake up he showed you your whole life what importance you got in his life believe him nta but please start loving yourself first
definitely nta here i would echo some of what others are saying your brother never saw you based on what you re saying as his best friend if he chose to pick up the new puppy that day he chose not to go to your graduation because of the puppy this is a huge deal as it should be you need to talk to your therapist about this because you should not feel at all guilty you don t have to be mean if you speak to him but just plainly say this was a big deal to me it was important that you be there and you chose to pick up a puppy the day before so you couldn t come and that makes me feel as if i m not important to you
nta that s exactly what happened and someone besides you called him out on it don t apologize you didn t do anything wrong he literally chose a dog over your graduation call it as it is and don t continue to be his door mat
nta you spoke the truth and he s upset because he doesn t want to acknowledge that he s an ah he knew you reserved a room and plane ticket and still chose to schedule that date to get a puppy don t feel guilty just move on and surround yourself with friends who value you
nta for what you said but possibly for your persistence growing up especially being the big sister i can see it creating resentment in him to where he wouldn t want to see you and use a dog as a scape goat
nta but it s time to stop contacting your brother at all ever
nta sometimes reddit people say something along the lines of if you re upset people are being told about your behaviour the problem isn t the telling but the behaviour i am a dog lover and can definitely tell you i think your brother is a jerk move on and love those who love you
nta he got called out and is sore about it you are valid in your feelings and your relationship has been one sided leave him be your really not missing anything since he doesn t care to reach out or do anything ripe that band aid off and accept it for what it is
nah i can t really call either of you an asshole because it seems like you forced yourself on a relationship that wasn t happening he kind of made it clear he didn t want you around
nta for whatever reason and i suspect there are things you are leaving out your brother doesn t like you that much he s not obligated to like you either i would have selected n a h but your brother needs to admit that he chose a dog over you but you need to just accept that your brother doesn t like you or want to hang out with you and move on
esh it is sad he s missing your graduation and planning to do something on that day instead of going was mean of him and it s scummy he never reciprocated your gifts i m sorry you didn t get the relationship you wanted to have with him gonna be honest though it sounds like you have been stepping on his boundaries a bit through your whole lives you may have seen him as a best friend but he saw you as the annoying older sister who kept following him and his friends around instead of making her own when they made it clear they didn t want you there i m going to assume they were boys around his age and you were the lone older girl trying to hang out them picking on you was them trying to drive you away unfortunately he has never regarded you with the same closeness you do him in the most gentle way possible it took you a little too long to recognize that for your sake maintain distance from him
yta you said you consider him your best friend and that s kind of telling as to why he acted that way
yta jesus you sound exhausting let s be real he isn t choosing a dog over you he s choosing his own life over yours which he s been trying to do for years and you just won t stop you ve completely driven away any real relationship you could have had with him
nta your brother is never going to put effort into the relationship except when there is nothing better i m sorry that he s like this
bad news he was never your friend it doesn t even sound like he liked you your instinct of wanting to leave a one sided relationship is correct
nta your brother is he killed the relationship not you
nta
nta if he s upset that the truth paints him in a bad light then he shouldn t have acted in bad faith
nta sometimes our family members aren t who we want them to be he s obviously selfish and just not interested in a relationship with you i know that hurts but you have to meet people where they re at stop initiating enjoy your time with the family members that support and go build yourself a beautiful fulfilling life congratulations btw i have no relationship with my sister so i do have some experience with this our situation is much more toxic i don t think nc is the answer for you guys just let things play out for now and go from there
nta
nta but he honestly never had your back i understand why you were attached to him but it s really time to reassess the relationship if your celebration mattered to him he would not create a situation where he needed to pick up a puppy and couldn t go
nta you just told truth maybe your brother doesnt want to see you beacuse you make him feel that he must repay you for all of this so this payed hotel would be another bill or he just dont care about you but he have problem to be painted in bad light in front of yours family

wow your dad seems pushy and you absolutely can have not secret service but hospital security keep him out but think of this i have heard sooo many stories about relatives coming over in the first sleep deprived and tender healing weeks of the baby being home and instead of what can i do to help here i brought you something to eat let me hold the baby so you can get a nap or shower you get aren t there any snacks wow you look tired the house is a mess would it maybe be better to have your intrusive relatives come by the controlled environment of the hospital for a few minutes enforced by a stern nurse or backed up by security than have them show up at your home for who knows how long whatever you do good luck i have always thought the people that just didn t announce when they even went into labor had a good idea they have a little peace and quiet for a while anyway nta
nta and don t give other people s demands another thought tell the hospital staff what your preferences are and they will take care of it and then silence notifications from him until you are at home with your baby
nta and bahahaha it ain t your husband pops has to worry about let him try that shit on your l d nurse they might as well be secret service and won t take shit nor threats from nobody
nta you are the one giving birth so therefor you call the shots you have every right to say who does or doesn t participate in the birth at the end of the day it is about you and the baby it is a very emotional and intimate moment for a mother and you should do whatever will make you comfortable don t let your father or anyone bully you into doing something you don t want also congratulations
so nta it is your child not theirs it is your experience not theirs and if you tell the hospital you don t want anyone to know you are there it doesn t matter if the pope shows up they ll say they have no registered patient by that your name do it your way the grandparents can deal
nta you may have to get graphic with your dad be blunt about having to push the baby out of you or surgically removed in the event of an emergency after a number of hours when you get to that point your mom might actually speak up and back you up on those points also reiterate that you are the mom not your parents and you have greater rights to saying who can see hold do anything else with the baby tell him that after the trauma of the birth yes your body is actually going through a traumatic event that is causing some damage to the body if you say you want months to recover bond with your child and get into a routine before you have anyone come barging in and just being noisy wanting the sm likes being unhelpful then you damn well have that right make it clear that you are not aiming to keep him or any other extended family out of your child s life but they all need to respect that it is your child therefore your rules and your boundaries and if they can t be reasonable adults about this they are going to be losing out you might also want to ask him how would he feel if he were in roughly your place and his parents were basically demanding to be there waiting all up in your mom s business for the baby to pop out so as to be the first to hold the infant likely before even the nurses doctors my guess is that either he is going to realize how much of on idiot he is being or he is going to remember your birth or siblings if you have any and his parents did exactly what i ve described and it annoyed the heck out of him and your mom
nta you have the right to set boundaries and this was a very personal and private decision stand your ground best wishes and good luck
nta there s a very high probability you are over thinking this and will feel differently with hindsight and that s perspective your parents have which you don t but it doesn t matter that s not how you feel now and nobody is entitled to see the baby until you and your husband are ready

i m thinking you re nta at all depending on the manner of birth you might not even want to have to deal with other family for simply hurting besides you re going to be dealing with learning to breastfeed i m assuming this is your first and other items related to the new child you re right you ll feel inundated joyful and will be needing support your husband can do that your family should be able to understand you need some time to adjust and unwind and visiting when the baby is home is more than adequate congratulations
i didn t have my parents at the hospital my dad and his partner drive us all home two days after the birth though and the next day my mum met our son nta boundaries are good to have
nta but i would love to see a secret service guy get past a labor and delivery nurse lol just tell nursing staff that you do not want any visitors while you are at the hospital your dad doesn t know how locked down the labor and delivery area is nowadays
nta you have the right to do what you want here your dilemma doesn t make you an ah that said you have way too much invested in this decision there s no reason this had to be this dramatic you have absolutely no way to know how your delivery is going to go and it s way too early for you to be setting expectations on this plus you wouldn t have hurt anyone s feelings by telling them not to come after the delivery instead of before it s so much easier to accept i m just too tired if you don t mind waiting a bit at least that way you would actually know what you re feeling like personally it makes complete sense that the hospital visit would be easier than a house visit i d be able to avoid cleaning up the house and fussing about what i might have to serve i d have to get up for every phone call or doorbell at home baby could wake up from any sound at least in the hospital you don t have to lift a finger to greet visitors and my local hospitals are still requiring masks be worn in the l d wing
you make a great point about the benefit of them coming to the hospital especially the more restricted time frame i ll keep that in mind i really just want him to understand that i don t know how i ll be feeling and to respect my current plan
right i pointed that out nothing scary than a labor and delivery nurse protecting their patients
there is a way that you can ask for your name not be put out there that way if anyone asked for you at the hospital they would say no one is here by that name we made everyone aware when they came to meet my baby at home minutes visit that they cant stay longer than that

yta you have to get her back on a more normal schedule you should not have walked the dog at 3am if her schedule was later
yta he s right you created it you fix it
yta the dog needs to learn the new schedule and by either of you waking up to take him out at you re just delaying that learning process you created this habit
yta he acts like he is dead asleep at 3am you think that s acting
why were you walking your dog at 3am when you got home did the dog specifically need to go out to relieve herself or did you just take her out then to spend time with her edit op took the dog out to spend time with her sorry op in that case yta it would be one thing if your bf was not taking the dog out and she had to relieve herself at 3am but this is a whole other problem that you created unfortunately dogs are creatures of habit and thrive on routines you re gonna have to figure out how to condition this nighttime ritual out of her my thought would be to take her out for longer walks than usual before you go to bed say if you typically do min do min to tire her out it s a time commitment for sure but it s way better than being woken up at 3am constantly
yta asking someone to wake up in the middle of the night to walk a dog is total madness the only valid solution here is to get your dog like any other dog to sleep at night and to wait until the morning to get a walk stop valuing the wants of your dog before the needs of your bf
yta you created a bad habit for the dog now instead of fixing it you re reinforcing it that s on you
sorry but your bf is right yta you need to train your dog since your shift changed however he should help with that yall have to gradually get the dog to wait later and later until a reasonable time also that was a bad idea from the get go bf should have been taking him out before bed just because you were coming home at 3am doesn t mean you should have created that bad habit for him my fricking yorkie goes out at 10pm and can wait until 8am before going out again
yta you did create the issue and you should start breaking the dogs habit if you no longer work nights sleep through the night let him bark like a baby would cry eventually he will figure out the late night strolls are over
i get that you used to work night shifts and it was hard on you and all but you re the one who made your doggo get used to this schedule if i had to wake up at 3am to walk my dog i d be kinda annoyed too yta but at least it s an easy ish fix
yta you created the issue you deal with it easy as that
you were the one to set the prescedent for am walks if your schedule changes and it is no longer faesable for you to do those walks you need to re train the dog for a time that is reasonable for you yta
info are you not doing night shifts anymore is the dog being let out before your bf you go to sleep overall sounds like the dog isn t trained it s barking to go for a walk at 3am like this is normal you made this a normal habit and now you ll have to re train the dog that its not an acceptable or normal habit i don t see how your bf is an ah for not wanting to walk a dog at 3am
yta you did create the issue you can work to ween the dog off the am walks but otherwise i don t see why it s unfair for you to be the one to follow through on the am commitment that you made to your dog
yta how on earth is this on your boyfriend to ever do you made the dog expect middle of the night walks it s on you to teach her that isn t a thing any more or it s on you to take here this is crazy is this real you really think he is an ah for wanting to actually sleep through the night you literally said my boyfriend refuses to wake up at night and take your dog for a walk you don t want to do it so you realize why he wouldn t want to yet it s your fault the hav it exists why on earth would you start it in the first place especially when you knew it wasn t permanent the dog is at your door when you get home late great that makes sense they great people so greet her and then go to bed you started walking her inexplicably this is all you
edit yta there was no need to start that with the dog and now your bf has to wake up at 3am because of what you did
yta take your dog to dog training classes making somebody get out of bed at 3am for this isn t cool especially when you re the one that conditioned the dog to expect a walk at 3am to let it out in the garden now and again for the toilet yeah but there s no need for anybody to be walking dogs at 3am
yta you need to retrain the dog and both of you need to be on the same page about when is a good time to go for a walk
info is she not being let out before bedtime is it just she got used to the habit and not she needs to pee
yta you need to retrain your dog to make it through the night again getting up at 3am just to walk your dog is ridiculous
yta walk the dog at normal times and then when you do get home at make it more enticing to get into bed than to want to go for a walk maybe that s giving the dog treats to go lay down it s definitely ignoring her requests to go for a walk you can break this habit pretty quickly
yta this would be fixed in a week or two if you didn t indulge in your dog s behaviour for god s sake let you bf sleep no one should have to be out walking the dog at 3am
yta you re pretending like this is something that has to be done at a certain time it s definitely not your dog will get used to being walked any time day or night getting walked twice every other day or literally any other permutation that works for you have you ever noticed that when you take your dog out at 3am there aren t a pile of other dogs being walked that s because it s weird and nobody does that outside of extenuating circumstances it s hard to believe that this never occurred to you
yta you created this issue if my partner expected me to get up at 3am and walk the dog they d be told to hit the bricks
wtf obviously you need to re train your dog to get walks when it works for you both not to wake up in the middle of the night just because that s what you used to do that is insane yta all day long
yta you created this situation and now you re not only refusing to fix it you re angry at your boyfriend for not fixing it for you not only that but you stayed in the bathroom to coerce your boyfriend into waking up to do what you wanted yuck
yta it s your dog it s your bad habit and it s you reinforcing that bad habit it s not reasonable or safe to walk a dog that late it s your problem so you fix it
yta and yes you should fix it
yta and you sound like a very inconsiderate partner
yta if this is too much for you hire a trainer that can help you set your dog back to a normal schedule dogs are habit creatures and work best on routines
it does sound like the dog is training you rather than you training them
yes you are indeed an asshole
i work weird hours as well and my dog will hop up if she thinks i m up when i go pee i go back to bed she will settle quickly when she realizes it s not time for a walk don t reinforce the behaviour and it will adjust
yta you created this problem and now you don t want to deal with it
i created this issue and should deal with it to fix it yta he is right you created this you fix it you don t get to train your dog into a habit that disrupts your boyfriend and then get mad when your boyfriend is disrupted
he did end up doing it but was pretty pissed off about it and said i created this issue and should deal with it to fix it yta you did and you do lol
yta retrain the schedule now that you re no longer doing night shift i m all for splitting pet responsibilities but this one s on you
yta you re creating a false dichotomy there is an obvious 3rd option where you both ignore the dog when it asks for a walk at 3am so it will learn your schedule
kennel train the dog the dog goes to bed at it stays there till 7am if you get home middle of night give kisses and go to bed after a few nights problem is solved if it helps put a blanket towel over the kennel so they can t see you it has worked in my house for many many puppies dogs and kittens in this situation you are the asshole it is rude to do that to bf yta
yta stop treating your dog like it s a newborn baby that needs fed there was zero reason to go out at a ungodly hour to walk a dog the dog can wait for a walk
why is the dog asking for a walk at three in the morning a healthy adult dog taken pee before bed should not need a walk in the middle of the night if that s an ongoing issue consult your vet yta for expecting your partner to walk the dog in the middle of the night
yta first off 3am is a ridiculous time for dog walking however if you were working nights and this time worked best for you then i get it dogs need exercise so you walked them when you could however you re not working nights anymore you need to get the dog on a new schedule you are the one who got the dog on the routine of 3am walks not your boyfriend it s completely asinine to demand someone to wake up at in the damned morning to walk the dog if you want to keep the dog on a 3am walk schedule then you can get your ass out of bed to do so you created this mess either do it your damn self or start a new routine i m appalled i can t understand how you think you re in the right completely ridiculous
you re mad that you don t want to walk her but expect someone else to instead and it s your dog do the math op
you are the weakest link i m sitting here laughing because my mom used to be the weakest link she always gave in to the dog you didn t like the excitement when you came home at am so you took her out to curb that that was your first mistake you should have found another way to calm the dog waking your bf up at am to walk the dog when he gets up at am isn t just ridiculous it s dangerous tired drivers are as bad as drunk drivers and interrupted sleep can cause health issues your problem is you don t know how to fix the bad behavior you created you need to learn a good dog trainer will teach you and teach you to work with your dog i highly recommend calling your vet for a recommendation it s what i did a vet won t recommend someone that will hurt your dog their reputation is on the line now you can do training as a couples thing but the reality is you need it the most look you love your dog i get it i have you look at that cute face and those oh but mommyyyy eyes and you cave unfortunately that s not what s best for that dog you love so much get a good trainer to help you and your girl soft yta
need more info whose dog is it when does bf need to get up in the morning have you or your bf made any effort to get the dog on a more normal schedule
you trained her to get up at 3am there was no need to do that so you train her to stay in her bed at 3am not your bf or you get upto go for a walk with her not your bf yta
yta btw away to fix your issues is crate training after her night time potty time put her in the crate so she can t wake y all up by going to the bedroom door
hi i m a behaviourist in addition to all other suggestions get her a puzzle mat or something similar mental energy is just a good as physical giving her something to do at 3am will also help with the barking etc don t let it become a habit but a good way to also train your dog to go out laterite to start pushing walks by minutes each time until the desired result which you then reinforce with repetition
yta unless this is a case of i didn t want a dog and told him i wouldn t take care of her you should be helping out he shouldn t have to get up at am to walk the dog you have to get her out of that habit
yta
yta
your bf is right walking the dog at 3am because habit is unacceptable dog s are trainable and resilient come up with a plan and stick to it walk the dog last thing before bed and first thing in the morning in a couple weeks the dog will have adjusted and yes this is your responsibility to fix since your schedule created the habit yta esp for waiting in the bathroom to prompt your bf to get up you were already up ffs gtfo with your nonsense
i don t get how you don t see that it s your fault op yta
yta and you re not gonna like any of the feedback coming your way cause if you can t see yta already you re just flat out missing some brain cells
yta why the fuck do you think your dog needs a walk at 3am why can t it wait until daytime your bf now has to have his sleep interrupted and engage in an activity that will keep him awake for probably hours afterwards just tell the dog no take it out in the morning it s that simple
no one should be walking a dog at 3am i m really not understanding why your bf can t walk it when he gets home from work failing that why have a dog when clearly you re both too busy with work to give it the attention it needs
kind of an ah i go through this with my husband my damn dog can tell time he gets fed twice and my husband travels a lot if it s just me he wakes me up at if my husband is at home he gets pushed with the wet nose at 5am it ticks him off but i said if he just ignored him and told him no like i did a couple of nights he would wait your dog will too ignore her and tell her no until a new time is established my dog also changes when he asks for lunch if i m on the couch he bugs me at exactly if i m anywhere else at home it s it s bizarre they know this but they also know what time they can get their way based on our behaviors
i work alternating swing shifts never have i drastically changed my dog s schedule this is a you problem so now you have to come up with the solution it s not going to be fun there s a reason people sleep train babies and puppies and not full grown humans and dogs you want to be lazy guess you have work to do to fix your dog before you get to
yta you ve conditioned this habit into the dog walks at am if the dog needs to go to the bathroom you could ve just been letting them into the backyard or something or make them go outside before you both go to bed or something you ve started this routine it s your job to either change it or do it yourself until it s changed he shouldn t have to have his sleep interrupted because of this he can share walking responsibilities but not at in the morning
yta you made the habit you get up it is not unfair and you don t mention anything you ve done to try and break the habit why should he be punished for what you did
yta how about you take her for a walk at am or would you be sleeping
yta i ve read a lot of your comments and i think this all boils down to your dog is not properly trained you got your dog into a habit of 3am walks your dog barks gets overexcited and does not appear to listen to you and you don t appear to do much to stop any of this you give in to your dogs demands these things can be fixed but you need to start properly training your dog go back to basics learn some basic commands and train calm you said your dog doesn t like a crate and associates it with the vet you need to associate the crate with calm and safety this will help it s a learning curve for both you and your dog but you will both be happier in the end it s hard work but it s worth it
so your pissed off that your created this habit with your dog and you boyfriend refuses to deal with getting up getting dressed and taking the dog for a walk at 3am of course he is pissed off it s your problem you deal with it
yta where in this crazy world is it safe to walk a dog at 3am
yta you trained your dog that you would take it for night walks now you want your bf to wake up mid sleep and go for a walk simple situation just stop taking the dog for night walks and un train this behavior also be a grown up and fix your mistake stop trying to involve your bf
yta you got the dog into a pretty bad habit it also makes sense though because before 3am the last time he would ve been out was 8pm according to one of your comments which is too early to be his last walk of the day doesn t help that it sounds like your dog is a loud barker tough situation i d talk to a professional and see what you can do that s probably the only way to get things back to normal it s a totally fixable mistake though for reference i have a really good routine with my dog and have had zero issues i do a walk in the morning around or another one around and then a final one around 11pm gives him plenty of opportunity to get his outside time if you aren t already doing walks per day i highly recommend it if you already are then i d try to do something around those times that i do it morning walk dinner walk bedtime walk it covers all of your bases
yta sleeping time is your for your bf and the dog to sleep it needs an appropriate routine its a bit ridiculous that it can just come barking at your door in the middle of the night and you bow down to the dog if you no longer work nights or if he doesn t work nights can t someone do it early in the morning
yta i have to agree with everyone else and your bf you unintentionally created this problem you need to be the frontrunner to fix it however it will take your bf s cooperation and patience as far as how to fix it your dog doesn t sleep in a crate i take it maybe get a crate if you don t already have one ensure bf walks the dog right before he goes to bed then puts the dog in the crate then even on those nights when you do come in late don t get the dog out the dog will go back to understanding night time is quiet sleeping time not walking or play time it will take several maybe many nights of the dog crying and barking but do not give in a healthy adult dog can hold their bladder overnight so unless there is some unstated reason for why your dog cannot then there is no reason to continue this habit even if it is possible on the nights you come in late if the dog has never been in a crate you might have to start at square one with crate training i would say just let the dog cry without the crate but i think your dog has been conditioned to whiz at that time and it will likely go in the house
it kinda made sense when you were getting home from work at am to take the dog then but if that has changed but you need to retrain her now it s not reasonable what you re asking if you want to leave it at then it should be you who gets up yta
yta this reminds me of my idiot roommate who would complain that her cats woke her at 5am every day to get fed which she continued to do daily holy dumb
as a night shift nurse i m not getting up in the middle of my day sleep to do anything but you expect him to get up at am i highly doubt if the tables were turned you d be interrupting your sleep yta
yta change the routine so that neither of you have to wake up in the middle of the night to let her pee kind of obvious
i just wanna know where the hell you live that you feel comfortable going for a walk at in the morning yta
fuck that it s a dog
yta chiming in just because of your edit delete thread if you don t want responses to clarify i think yta due to your initial post i specifically commented because your edit was obnoxious
i sort of enjoy walking my dogs at 3am but i m an old man that wakes up in the middle of the night anyway walk your dog right before bed time so it s tired when you go to sleep yourselves
yta you made the mess why should he have to deal with it
the only time i have ever walked a dog in the middle of the night around the backyard is if they had the spray sh ts or they were vomiting you re going to need to stop walking the dog in the middle of the night it will take some time but your dog will get used to it
what you just resigned yourself to having a dog that needs to be walked at am now just start walking her at a new time every day she will learn yta
soft yta your dog has gotten into a routine yes but a few days of consistent changes and she ll break the habit you don t need to pander to it it won t hurt her to ignore her barking annoying for your sleep as it may be until she realises this is no longer the time she gets walked you and he should be walking her at a time that suits you both not when she decides assuming her needs are met of course a high energy dog that isn t being suitably exercised will obviously act up and be restless but assuming that s fine the dog will settle once you stop giving into rewarding her and reinforcing the routine
yes you re the ah especially as you re letting a dog dictate what he wants if i let my bulldog behave like that he d be eating scraps and shitting on the floor
your on your dogs schedule yikes
so you were awake and woke the dog and then hid in the bathroom so you wouldn t have to deal with it are you sure you re an adult yta
yta if i am understanding correctly you are no longer working these hours right which means there isn t a reason your dog needs to go on a walk at 3am quite reinforcing your dog s behavior teach a go settle type cue
info who is in charge of dog duties does he walk the dog at all or does he just wait for you to come home to do it
info how old is the dog
yta i understand how your dog got into the habit but now that you re no longer working those hours if you don t want to walk your dog at that time anymore then you need to retrain him you can t expect somebody else to walk him for you because you don t want to get up at that time anymore
yta you trained the dog bad and now you re putting your mistake as more important than bfs needs i d actually leave you no cap you ve woken this poor bastard up multiple times because of your own decision making and you re holding your dog over his head and forcing him to partake in your entirely awful decision making if your dog barks you tell it no it ain t that hard if it doesn t listen congratulations that s what you get for not training it keep telling it no it ll learn eventually entirely your fault and top tier psychotic behavior to legitimately sleep deprive your so by waking them up in the middle of the night because you refuse to learn how to plan around having a dog
don t have kids if this is how you fight about a dog lol
yta and he s being extremely kind
yeah sorry yta this isn t a normal chore this is a problem you created because of your unusual schedule he should not have to be responsible for your actions
it s unfair i always have to do it it s your dog or y all s and you chose to walk the dog so late at night yta
yta a walk at 3am isn t reasonable if that is something you want to do fine but it s not reasonable to ask your bf to pick up the slack for the problem you created
why does your boyfriend have to deal with the issue you caused yta you trained the dog to do this you deal with the behaviour and ensure the dog is walked you screwed up when you taught her that this is the schedule don t push your screw up into your bf to deal with
yta he is sleeping you trained the dog to want to walk at that time do you need to be the one who walks it
yta the solution to this problem is not to wake up or worse as your partner to wake up to take the dog out i recently switched from nights to days and had to change my dog s sleep schedule he was grumpy for a few weeks but he adjusted i would suggest slowly transitioning him to only daytime walks start with taking him for a walk before bedtime and then telling him goodnight and going to bed if he starts barking at the door at 3am don t reward him if your dog is crate trained i would full on crate him overnight in the meantime he will get the idea that his walk is now right before bed and not at 3am and then just start moving the walk back one hour at a time until it s at whatever time you d now prefer to walk him
yta how is this a question lol if you want the dog to be walked at all hours of the night whenever she wants then you need to do it otherwise the dog needs to be on a schedule that a normal person would be ok with
yta i have three dogs and you can untrain this behavior pretty damned quick you know just like feeding time after daylight savings time your dog should be trained on your boyfriends stable schedule not yours
ok so i ll give you your thousandth yta creating the habit and then putting the dog in front of your bf doesn t paint a pretty picture of life with you

i would also not like a random man sleeping in my house nta
nta it is your house and you don t have to let men sleep over if you aren t comfortable
umm whose house is it yours or hers your house your rules why are you even giving this discussion life respect your houserules
i m surprised with all these ytas i don t want to feel uncomfortable in my own house either for whatever reason so of course nta op the fact you let her female friend stay over and not her male gay friend is irrelevant in here
your house nta
nta she can have whoever she wants over when she gets her own place
i dunno what s up but the way you phrased this seems to have annoyed everyone you re nta for wanting to meet someone before they sleep at your house while you are also staying there there s no world where that is an unreasonable ask
nta your daughter is a grown adult living outside the house she can host sleepovers whenever she wants and invite the entire sf gay choir if she so chooses at your home where you are being kind enough to host easter for her an her friend you have a need to know the guy before he spends the night policy that doesn t mean you re homophonic or a misandrist it means you don t want to have a male guest stranger in your home while you sleep
eh i d say nta it s your house therefore it s your rules although i do understand why your daughter is frustrated because you let someone else you didn t know in the house and only now just not letting someone stay over just because they re a man your initial reasoning was a little confusing and hypocritical so hence why she s upset if you genuinely tried to explain why you d be uncomfortable with him staying over i don t see reasons for any big problems
honestly i don t think you re ta but i do think the way you went to explain it is a bit illogical and makes you seem unfair
you don t want him there because he makes you uncomfortable she wants him there because she wants to sleep late so it s not that he has nowhere else to go it s just that him staying elsewhere will somehow force her to get up earlier than she wants to i m confused
nta if you re uncomfortable with a strange man being in your home his sexuality is irrelevant
uhh him being male is tangential to his sexual orientation i don t blame you i wouldn t let a strange woman sleep in my house boundaries are useless if you throw them away every time someone tries to guilt they you they can find elsewhere to sleep it off they shouldn t have gotten that drunk anyways nta
ya know maybe i want to walk around with my bra off in my own home without a dude that i ve never met around look it s your home so ultimately you can do whatever you want but ostensibly you can do this other days of the year and you could still do it even if your daughter has a friend sleeping over this is a lame excuse whatever your actual issue is it ain t this
question why do you trust your daughter s judgment of her female friends but not her male friends
slight yta i get it your house your rules so you can say no i just think you re slightly ta to do so because your logic doesn t really make sense you can walk around with your bra off around her female friends him being gay doesn t matter but your daughter is she is grown and capable of having male friends whenever she does date if it s a man will you not allow him to sleep in your house when she brings him to meet you because you don t know him you literally don t know anybody until you meet them lol
yta specifically because you clearly have some hang up about him being male that you re not being honest about do you frequently walk around braless in front of her girl friends do you think that is totally appropriate for having guests over if the girl is a lesbian does that change things it your house so you can have who you want in there but be honest about why your daughter can t have her friend over cause the math ain t mathing
if he s gay i doubt he has the slightest interest in your bra or lack thereof yta
yta any friend of your kid should be welcome you ve raised her to make important decisions and doing due diligence on a person ensuring that he or she is ok to stay overnight with loved ones
yta your daughter wants to bring a friend home end of story you re rejecting him and making things difficult without even knowing him ultimately it s your house so of course you can make any rules you want but don t be surprised if your daughter doesn t come home from school either
well it s your house so you make up the rules but don t come here complaining why your daughter is no longer visiting it s a bit yta
yta unless your daughter is a terrible person who makes terrible decisions with regards to friends you are telling her she can t be trusted
your house your rules to technically nta but huge but the lesson you taught her is terrible you told her you don t trust her judgement men shouldn t be trusted women are safer than men which is not the truth because i m a woman and was sa as a kid by a woman you ve also taught her that you running around braless is more important than doing something nice for a kid who doesn t seem to have anywhere to go for what s probably a long weekend off school i have a son in college and i would ve been horrified if he called me and said he decided not to go visit a friends house because her mother was scared of having a guy in the house because it s dangerous
esh yes your house your rules but what s the argument with the bra obviously this man doesn t care about your bralessness and her girlfriend does the other part is is this about being able to overpower someone because the girlfriend could be just as dangerous right i guess i m not sure as to the fear of this stranger and not another stranger but still your house
you re uncomfortable solely because he s male yta
yta you never let her have friends sleep over do you have some reason you completely distrust your daughter s judgment about friends
yta if you re ok with her having girl friends over guy friends should be the same thing sexual orientation has nothing to do with it in this case the issue isn t that you dont know the person since you let strangers stay there when they were women it s that you don t like his gender i d suggest talking to a therapist to figure out why you re not ok with men around seems like there might be some sort of trigger that you may need to work through
nta it s your house but you should work on the misandry for some reason that doesn t rile up reddit like misogyny

your house your rules she can always leave
nta your house your rules and she should respect them has your daughter shown poor judgment in the past with whom she s brought over that would cause you to have concerns in this case you did say he was a new friend so maybe you wonder if she really knows him well enough to be bringing him home being gay does not make him a woman if you don t want your daughter bringing men to sleepover that is up to you and she needs to respect that i personally would probably let her bring him only because i d want my daughter to get to sleep in
nah but she s just going to stay at college and not visit you for easter if you re going to be weird about her friends is that really what you want or is it worth it to you to compromise a little in order to see your daughter for easter
do you have any suggestions i just feel uneasy around men i don t know meeting at dinner is one thing while i m asleep is another
correct he lives on campus my suggestion was for her to come home for easter sunday she wants to come saturday night so she can sleep in campus is a one hour drive
i m sure he s great but i ve met enough men from trusted ppl that did not turn out to be great sure there are bad females it s just different and maybe that makes me ta
the bra thing was kinda a joke but i just don t trust men i never met i addressed the lesbian thing wouldn t care
yes
she s already here actually luckily she s not petty and we do have an awesome relationship which is why i posted this i do feel bad about it and i m glad for some of the responses i def have room for improvement and maybe should over come some of my trauma but i also need to listen to my own instinct it s balance
did you explain that to your daughter you trust her sure but you need to explain to her that you re perfectly fine with her making friends if she were to say he s gay so why does it matter are you homophobic you have a great comeback so if he s gay do you think he s less of a man by saying he s gay why does it matter she herself is demeaning him in a way she s essentially saying i don t view him as a man because he s not someone who has sex with woman don t worry about it it s not about the sexual implications you just are uncomfortable sleeping in the house with a man not because of sexual reasons but because of his gender saying this as a very masculine gay leaning bi man who has h
ok so i get why you are uneasy but do you want your daughter home for easter like if that s the hill you ll both die on make sure it s worth it one thing to consider if the issue is truly a man in your space and you have some spare cash is to get them a cheap motel room to crash at doesn t have to be fancy just someplace you don t mind her staying otherwise she ll be driving home late tired and annoyed which isn t super safe or maybe won t come at all my mom regularly rented rooms for me and friends partners when we came to visit because she too didn t want people in her home keeping her up doing college kid shit and she hated me driving late it was a nice compromise
nta this you don t trust men you trust her and it is not about sex or sexuality you don t want a strange man in your house while you sleep
i would suggest unpacking that in therapy
do you have a lock for your bedroom would that help you feel less anxious
oh sorry i should have figured that out
no it makes you reasonable that is a perfectly reasonable risk assessment look at any violent crime statistics
unfortunately it kind of does internalised misandry i understand where you might be coming from i have trauma from men in my life but we can t live our lives in fear of all men most are lovely by treating one gender differently based on dangerous and inaccurate generalisations that makes yta
so how do you plan on meeting any boy she might bring home look i m not sure if there s some trauma in this distrust of men or what and that you re business but you should at least talk to your daughter honestly cause yeah i d be upset too if someone said they didn t trust my friend for no reason
fair enough but i do think this is exactly the kind of thing that s going to make her less likely to visit as she gets older it s not about being petty it s that if visiting means dealing with weird restrictions then it s less appealing
who has had to make many accommodations to make sure i don t make any woman uncomfortable meant to type that bit hit enter whoops
thank you for this response
i like that idea
which is sexist and makes op yta
or it could just be a result of y know millennia of women being told to be careful around men violent crime being committed almost solely by men etc etc
not really judging someone just based on their gender is not reasonable at all to form opinion whether a person is good or not it makes you sexist and if the roles were reversed i guarantee more people would have said that
i m definitely not scared of all men or even most but it does take me longer to trust a man vs a women maybe that s on me i probably shouldn t trust women right off the bat either
dinner bbq party not the whole night while i m sleeping for the first time
i get that she says this guy is her new bff once i meet him a time or then i should be cool and if i m still not cool then i ll have to have a talk with her about why not
i m not about reverse sexism or reverse racism maybe yta
i m definitely not scared of all men or even most but it does take me longer to trust a man vs a women this statement is self contradictory maybe that s on me i probably shouldn t trust women right off the bat either despite the downvotes the other person is getting it definitely sounds to me like you have a double standard based on gender here i understand that men are statistically more dangerous than women but i think that enforcing a different standard without knowing the guy at all based on statistics and anecdotal experience is indeed sexist
right so clearly you have some issues with men specifically talk to your daughter about that cause i get why she s pissed cause if i had a friend i cared enough about to bring home on a holiday and i was just told no i don t trust them i would take offense to that too it very much would feel like an attack on my character judgment obviously your house you can do what you like but it s always the parents who impose rules without an honest discussion with their child that are asking why their kids don t visit
gross
i honestly believe calling a women sexist is akin to calling a black person racist it doesn t matter exist
what
lol what plenty of black people are racist just like plenty of women are sexist you in fact are one of those people unfortunately a person can be racist sexist not a good person regardless of their skin sex etc
white ppl can not systematically hold black ppl down at least not for a few more hundred if not thousands of years the same way women can not men simple not liking a different skin color or sex is not what racism or sexism is about sure i can not trust men but they doesn t make me sexist as i nor my whole gender can keep men down or stop them from murdering and raping women in far greater proportions than women on men
ok i think what you meant to say is black people cannot systematically hold white people down which i agree with however what you re describing is systematic institutionalized racism that is not the definition of racism the definition of racism is thinking of someone as lesser because of their race racism can be institutional but it can also be interpersonal a person who makes racist remarks and treats people in a racist manner is still racist even if they don t represent a system or institution same goes for sexism just because you aren t systematically holding down men doesn t mean you aren t displaying sexist behavior you are and the fact that you re attempting to excuse your behavior by saying it isn t real sexism only makes me more confident in my original assessment that you indeed are engaging in misandry also why are you assuming that all racism is only between black people and white people racism can happen between white people and asian people asian people and black people etc it is not always a black white dichotomy
thank you for correcting my sentence this young man is probably awesome however you saying i m sexiest because i have far more caution towards men due to of murders being caused by men and of rapes being caused by me makes me less likely to be a victim imo women don t have the luxury to trust alll or any man also the above was an example and not meant to be all inclusive point is reverse racism and sexism does not exist

nta she s an adult her boyfriend and her can figure out rent between the two of them if they want to live in a trash heap they can
nta do you want to move out when your lease is up or move out before if you want to move out after your lease ends you re in the right to do that and you don t have to live with a shitty roommate just because she s your sister edit changed verdict to nta based on op s comment
nta she s capable of being an adult but hasn t had to be you move out and she ll have to do it and you ll be happier
ywnbta nta she has poor life habits and insight because she never had to learn yes move out you are not happy you ve been setting yourself on fire to keep her warm create a future you will enjoy
you are nta for not wanting to deal with your sister but probably a bit short sighted leaving her with a lease and an apartment that you are responsible for unfortunately you probably can t give her the lease and walk away since you are the one that signed it given her behavior as you describe you likely will end up paying for both the lease you left her with as well as your new one which certainly won t let you save anything and might wreck your credit if you can t afford both
i think you should kick them both out she needs to hit rock bottom before she changes coddling her by not wanting her to not have anywhere to go is only hindering her

some people don t figure it because they don t have to it s hard but she won t swim because she doesn t have to i would give her three months notice so she has time to look for full time work then leave she will either learn to swim or sink
nta it sounds like she will not fly until pushed out of the nest either way it is not your problem even if she is your sister
honestly i want to move out asap thinking about it i actually havent signed a new lease yet and it was up in febuary so i could technically just leave but i dont want to leave her without anywhere to go i just wont want to live with her
shes my sister im not going to make her homeless
what about giving her maybe like a month s warning that you re leaving and she can try to find a new roommate while you look for your new place she doesn t have to leave the apartment if you do of course if she can t find a new roommate to live with which might happen since you make it sound like she doesn t really know how to do anything lol then she might be in a difficult situation but you can t protect her from herself her whole life she s gotta learn at some point that she does indeed have to be an adult
she needs the trial by fire when it does go bad later for her do not ruin your credit to help her again she won t learn if she keeps getting a bail out
she can just go back to parent s place but kicking her out is no different to leaving her with a lease she is not responsible enough to handle the only difference is how long until she gets kicked out and now that i ve made you doubt that decision i hope you re ready to be her parent your whole life because you re stuck between conflicting ideals don t want to live with sister don t want to make her homeless don t want to be her parent and carer she needs the hard kick lesson my dude

nta your mom needs therapy and to move to a smaller home that will have less bills if she wants to do a career change you are not her emotional support pet you are a human who is permitted to live your own life
nta her expectations of you are ridiculous move out for your mental health you re not her mother and you need to take care of yourself your moving isn t condemning her to anything she needs to sort her own problems out not use you as a crutch
nta get out of there as fast as you can if you stay she ll only keep milking you for all that you have it s not your fault or responsibility if your mum doesn t end up with her dream career if she was serious about this she would be finding herself a stable job through the transition and building up her savings it looks more like a tactic to try and get you to not leave the nest and to support her forever especially considering she has separation anxiety don t let your mum condemn you to the unfulfilling career go enjoy your life and congratulations on the new job
nta run don t walk from that situation your mother is going to milk you for every dollar she can she has already told you she is going to take all your money except for the barest minimum to get back and forth to work her unfulfilling career isn t your sammich or if you prefer don t set yourself on fire to keep others warm
nta this isn t just guilt tripping it is turbo charged guilt tripping tell your mother that you are not her indentured servant and move out if you don t she ll sponge off of you for the rest of her life and make life hell for any future partner of yours
nta you re the kid move out she can figure out the career change this speaks of an abusive dynamic and you literally describe financial abuse and needing out for mental health just go she can wake up to you gone if that s easier what i did to move out was pretending to agree lied about my income and paid in cash for the i raised you and you owe me debt to avoid being harmed or raising suspicion secured my vital documents and left with nothing but a few trash bags she didn t know held my belongings and a work friend took me away survival lies are the acceptable kind aww they re not paying what they said i can t pay that much guess we both have to wait for this there s going to be difficulty either way especially with abusive parents have trained you to obey their manipulative demands you must resist because you will never escape also would bet that this gig is actually just an mlm because it sounds the right amount of shady i could be off base there but not my first rodeo
me moving could condemn her to continue an unfulfilling career she says she has separation anxiety she s expressed that she wants to try something that could make her happy i e the career change and my support would help with that i told her the same thing when i wanted to take a gap year and she had a horrible reaction that still haunts me i planned to work during the gap year so i could support myself which was good cus my mum said i shouldn t expect any money from her she s an adult you are her child why the flying fuck is she so damn entitled those sound a hell of a lot like her problems not your problems run get the fuck out do not send her any money that s called financial abuse
nta it was your mother s job to raise you it is not your job to raise your mother it s time for you to leave the nest and start building your own life your mother is emotionally blackmailing you and holding you her child responsible for her happiness please do not take this burden on a parent with a healthy relationship with their child does not expect their child to stay so they won t have to deal with the inevitable discomfort that comes with them leaving home instead you celebrate your child s triumphs even when it makes you sad to see they are no longer the little child they once were it s a bittersweet experience but as much as children have to leave parents have to let go congratulations on your upcoming graduation go spead your wings and fly
nta she doesn t have your best interests at heart only hers you need to set some boundaries i know it s hard especially when you re being guilt tripped even if she claims that s not her intention you moving isn t condemning her to anything and if she really does have separation anxiety the best cure for that is exposure therapy not having it fed into anyway what about your needs and wants why is it fair for her to expect you to put them on hold for her

nta she s not in an emergency situation where you helping out might be more important welcome to the real world where jobs just aren t typically fulfilling and all of that she needs to handle all of that herself and work at something to pay the bills while changing careers that s how adults handle it
nta at all it is a parent s job to support their children to adulthood not the other way around mom will figure it out go live your life
nta move out immediately
nta she is trying to force you to stay home she will financially abuse you run now
nta your mom is manipulating you into supporting her take that job get out asap you will never be free if you stay she will always come up with something else to keep her hooks in you your mom is an adult she can figure things out for herself
nta move out she needs to figure her life out for herself this is not your job
nope just nope this is not your responsibility to pay for your moms career change she needs to figure her own life out and not be dependent on you how long does she expect you to put your life on hold you are nta get out as soon as practicable and enjoy your life your mom can get loans and a new job all on her own
nta you re an adult now so make your own choices your mum is being unreasonable in an extreme way
some places offer grants scholarships for women who are looking for a career change perhaps you can steer her in the direction of researching some of those types of programs for her some of them are dependent on income or type of career she is seeking but it could be a viable option they are usually readily available especially if she needs to go back to school as far as you putting your life on hold for her please don t take the opportunity to go to the job you ve lined up and move forward yourself her reaction is not your responsibility your mother should work and save as much as she can so that she can fund her career change herself your mother has made her own choices in regards to her current career her personal projects etc i m afraid that if you stay you won t ever be able to go which could be her ultimate plan especially since she is unwilling to look for a job herself your mom actually could use some therapy to help her cope with her separation anxiety and her trying to manipulate you as a mom myself as hard as it is to think about letting my children go i know that it is a part of growing up when they eventually move out it will be difficult and i will miss them terribly but our relationship doesn t end once they become independent it is actually the job parents are supposed to do raise children to be independent from them so a natural reaction should be to miss you but let you go and wish you well tell her you love her but then you need to go and be self sufficient and not be financially dependent on her at all in case you are if your mom chooses to be jobless or not move forward with her life independently she has to deal with any consequences nta good luck
nta her ideas are ridiculous why make your kid provide so you can make a job change that s not stable if she s making the money to pay for her current lifestyle she needs to stay
thank you
i ve looked into the company she s training with and it seemed legit enough she has said she needs to read my contract to make sure i m not being screwed over she has a degree and masters in law there may be truth in that but i worry she also wants to see my income i ve had my uni careers service go through it with me and everything looks good i want to send the signed contract to my employer without her finding out so i can argue that there s no reason for her to see it since i d already be locked in she d probably still fight me but it d be easier to make it look like it wasn t a calculated move on my end
i could be off base there but not my first rodeo lmfao off base it s definitely some kind of mlm
thank you
i believe she thinks it s fair for me to put my life on hold because it s intended to be short term she said up to years but hopefully less compared to her putting her life on hold to raise me mum does not like the word boundaries she s threatened to hurt herself cus of that word
she s told me up to years but ideally less
thank you it s nice to hear from a mum s perspective i can mention looking for grants to her i hadn t thought of that i have begged her to seek therapy if not for her sake then for mine but she laughed at me and claims i called her crazy so i don t see her going that route funny that you mention parents having to let kids be independent cus it s already happened to my mum i actually moved out for the first three years of my year degree and my mum survived i m now confused about why she s bringing up separation anxiety
do not give her the contract my advice lie oh i signed it already i didn t want them to give the position to someone else when i get a copy i ll give you one then you never get the copy she ll get suspicious eventually but optimally you are gone before then do you have a secret bank account yet if not that s where the direct deposit goes and it needs to be at a bank she cannot access and has no accounts make sure if she asks you to sign stuff you read it because power of attorney came to mind i have a juris doctorate so this isn t legal advice just abuse survival advice and abusive parents are capable of a lot of things so if your gut says lie it is okay to lie also i did say i could be wrong but anything unstable isn t someone else s risk to take especially one s child
i like to leave a margin of error to temper my ego
sorry but you need to call her bluff spoiler alert she won t
she doesn t have access to my bank accounts i don t know if she knows the location of my credit card though i got a new one last year but she hasn t asked me where it is
no no no no no let that ego floooooooow
i don t believe she would but it illustrates how unwilling she is to respect me on my terms
well done that is not easy with this sort of thing when you are out you do need to run a credit check in case it s making sure the worst case scenario didn t occur not assuming it did there s a spectrum of possibilities and you can t control them but checking so you know which you actually need to cope with is reasonable as someone who had to escape you re doing great at this point you can do this i don t know how this lands tonally in text but i know the lead up to that is stressful and frightening in part because of all the things you have been told you cannot do without her abusers foster dependency because it s harder to leave so the intent is me wanting to offset that by acknowledging the hard work you are doing
nope i like to stay grounded i know the me with too much ego that s called my 20s
i appreciate your concern empathy and shared experience my credit is actually great because of my mum funnily enough she told me to get a credit card when i was cus apparently you can t build credit without having a credit card i let her use it and she sends the money to pay it off no issue i ve been learning more about credit recently and i m looking closer at my credit score if things get problematic i ll have to tell her she can t use it anymore a very scary thought
i know it is scary but remember that once you are out you don t have to go back and you can greyrock if unfamiliar you slowly give less information and stop responding to the demands silence not no it s a halfway to no contact without true no contact and you can filter what she knows more you do also need to lock down your socials but i don t think you would post this without that care already some of the fear is the abuser training that happens you re not so small now but your brain learned the threat she poses when you were actually helpless so it doesn t assess it from you now if this helps any also i am glad i caught this post so i could offer support
a lot of my anxiety is definitely based off my childhood experience with her
that s normal for abuse survivors it gets easier with time but i still feel like a year old when i am faced with a parent i have to literally avoid family for life and death but that s easier to cope with than the things like this because it s not hard to go murder bad the delicate wisps no one can see are the harder ones to get the hang of

nta that would be disgusting to serve
nta flies puke on food in order to eat it maybe you could burn off the bacteria but do you really want to eat food covered in cooked fly puke hell no
nta the food should have been covered before walking away but also depending on what it was and how long some time was that alone is food poisoning on a hot summer day flies also can take fractions of time to lay hundreds of eggs so it wouldn t have just been bacteria but fly eggs
info who set the food out this is only the fault of whoever set the food outside without covering it properly to prevent flies from swarming to it you definitely weren t wrong for throwing it out that food was contaminated at that point
nta those little fly legs have been in all kinds of crap including literal crap and then leave it behind and walk over the food they also do weird things in terms of eating the food and spitting up fly stuff honestly i would be reluctant to eat any food in the future prepared by aunt or other people because who knows what other kinds of basic food safety they aren t doing washing hands not contaminating food with dirty utensils not cooling food immediately for safety fwiw there are some forms of food poisoning which can not be destroyed by cooking many people get food poisoning each year but don t realize they have gotten food poisoning they think it s a hour stomach virus or indigestion of some kind
nta but also it s already been done why reprimand you for something you already did
nta i personally think you did a good thing you protected others from illness and eating something gross i would suggest that next time everyone works on making sure the food is covered so that it won t be necessary
uhhh you have bigger problems than aita how often have you and your family eaten food that s had the flies seared off nta technically it could be n a h because there s no malice involved but uggh dead fly fly vomit and eggs charred on your food is just too much it was prepared for your sister you made a hygiene call she didn t agree just apologise and move on but seriously tell your family that it might be technically hygienic but most people would gag to eat food that flies had gotten into
slight yta if you aren t going to eat it its the chef s food to do with what they want btw your aunt is technically correct about the surface germs but i doubt that she d keep it on the bbq long enough hot enough cutting off the outer is another way to un infest food from arial flies

you re nta flies spread disease when they land on food people consume that food and may get sick next time someone should take a few moments and cover their food if they re going to leave it outside
nta that s nasty dude also keep in mind some bacteria make you sick from the toxins they release when they die so reheating food may not solve that problem and have you ever had norovirus throw that food out
nta flies literally land on shit who wants to eat that aunt sister should ve made sure it was covered
flies literally walk on shit who wants to eat poo coated roast
my point exactly
they also lay their eggs in food as well
literally who leaves uncovered food unattended at a park this was the obvious result
i guess it was the fault of everyone who grabbed from the food trays and didn t cover it back up
tons of people take the you fucked up approach to problem solving
extra protein
and shit not something i would eat it is also something that if seen by the health department would get a restaurant shut down real fast if they won t allow it why should you
yeah that s something that unfortunately happens at outdoor gatherings with food live and learn food trays with lids are best and everyone grabbing food needs to reseal the food or else they spoil the pot for everyone else nta
they probably have their toilet in the same room as their bathroom sink towels toothbrush

i literally didn t know there are entire families of djs in this world
how cute two nepo babies fighting in their natural habitat
info did you comment on her social media post and say this all publicly
yta so because she s been fortunate to have one kind of privilege she hasn t been discriminated against in another way i m a white straight woman should i quit complaining about how i m discriminated against in my career and opportunities because i ve not experienced homophobia or racism or should i keep talking about those experiences that i or other women may come across to try and make it better for all women
yta you can be privileged in some ways and still discriminated against in others she didn t say she s had it harder than anyone in the world she said she s experience gender based discrimination which any woman in a male dominated industry almost certainly has stop being a jerk
yta she s not just talking about her experience there but about all women djs which she probably knows more of than you has spoken to more female djs than you and has a better understanding of what female djs go thru in the business yes she has privileges others don t but that doesn t negate what women in general will have to go thru you should listen and learn more you ve got privilege to check as well
info i really need to check your logic here you re saying because one man has fewer privileges opportunities than your sister that she can t possibly have experienced sexism
yta just because she s kind of a nepotism baby doesn t mean she still hasn t had to deal with shit because she s a young woman in a male dominated industry privilege doesn t always mean you don t have problems it just means you don t have as many as other people also she wasn t just talking about herself she was talking about the industry itself as a whole can you even name a well known female dj hell can you even name a female dj who isn t your sister whens the last time you saw a female dj headlining an event having their own regular night at a major bar album drop
i ll go with yta you don t have to be the privilege police
yta women in the music industry are paid less and given far less opportunity than men and that is a fact for you to diss your sister from your position of male privilege is just beyond the pale
yta of the things you mentioned about your sister exactly zero addressed that women in the industry are not treated well
yta two things can be true at once she s enjoyed substantial advantages from her family s contacts and a man with the exact same advantages might have been more successful than her because of gender discrimination comparing to a man who hasn t had similar family advantages doesn t prove a thing
yta you ever talk to a rich black person they have a much higher level of privilege than a poor black person but you bet your ass that they still experience racism your sister may have a lot of privilege breaking into this industry she has opportunities that someone else does not doesn t mean she hasn t experienced gender based discrimination in her industry every woman has no matter how rich or how many connections she has incidentally you re only ahead cause of your connections is absolutely another form of gender based discrimination you ever heard of a male artist being disparaged for getting his start through family in the industry nope you ve just invalidated her entire experience as a woman cause she got a leg up in her career
dude everyone knows women face constant sexism every day it s common knowladge my sister in law is an eye surgeon her parents are doctors she graduated top of her class from john hopkins she s got connections everywhere she still struggled to get hired while many of her male colleagues who got lesser grades from lesser schools with lesser contacts had no problem getting a job at the same places even actresses from the greatest directors actors producers etc get absolutely shafted on pay yeah your sister has a lot of opportunities because of privilege but no doubt she d be even more popular get more gigs her skills would be questioned less and would undoubtedly just have more of everything if she was a guy yta
she has wealth privilege she does not have male privilege
yta once i was this high powered executive in expensive clothing and yet people would see many men in the office and assume i was someone s secretary many times i had to convince others i was not the secretary and i worked directly with the ceo and not as a secretary or when men interrupted me frequently when i was the most senior at the table so yes all the privilege in the world doesn t protect you from misogyny look at celebs they get misogynistic attacks or comments all the time
yta it doesn t matter whether she s been victimized or not you re an ah just for being the victim police i keep reading through your post looking for anything that would give you authority to decide how people are allowed to feel or what they re allowed to post about online and the only thing i ve found is your massive ego
yta two reasons why did you feel the need to laugh and argue with her about it none of your arguments actually disprove what she said she said she is a victim of being a woman in a male dominated industry even privileged people are disadvantaged in their lives and not only did you try to diminish your sister s life you failed now you ve got an angry sister is that what you wanted was being right when you weren t that important
yta speaking as a female employed as a dj it is definitely more challenging when i went to audio engineering school there was like women in the entire school vs men her connections certainly helped but it doesn t erase the fact there is a bias especially depending on what type of dj gig she does
if she was a man with the same family connections privilege etc she feels she would ve been treated differently that s how gender based discrimination works yta apologize sincerely and ask her if she d be willing to help you learn more about discrimination in her field
yta and i encourage you to read up about the concept of intersectionality there are many different aspects of who someone is that can impact their life and the the kinds of privileges and discrimination they might experience someone s gender their religion their sexuality their race their nationality whether they are able bodied the socio economic class they belong to all these things and more can influence your lived experiences the opportunities you have available to you and the kind of discrimination you might face for example say you have two people both grew up in a middle class family both went to the same school both of them are male both of them are straight both of them are christian one of them is black and one of them is white they are going to have some lived experiences that are similar based on class gender sexuality religion and they re going to have some experiences that are different based on race ethnicity intersectionality looks at the ways the different parts of our identities intersect and influence our lives your sister might be privileged in terms of socio economic class and the opportunities she got from that but that doesn t mean that she can t won t doesn t face discrimination based on her gender especially if she s working in a more male dominated field
yta i am so sick of men being blind to systemic misogyny yes your sister has many privileges but that does not cancel out all the systemic and social disadvantages women experience systemic misogyny is not something that affects men and as a result you do not see it in most cases and even more infuriatingly when women point it out to you with lived experience to back it up you still don t believe us please please listen to women and work on identifying and deconstructing your biases or blind spots that resulted from male socialization that s the best way to be an ally to women in the industry and in general
listen dude yta you have no idea what women experience moment to moment in this life yes i know my username implies i m a guy but i m not i m an old lady who had her share of crap from men like you who refuse to see what s going on
yta specific examples of privileges don t cancel out industry wide bigotry and prejudice
yta two things can exist at once you know the effects of wealth and gender are different things
info so you agree with her and just believe she s not discriminated against or you don t believe her point at all
yta i don t know how your sister s post went exactly but it sounds like she talked of discrimination against women in general and not only her so her privilege is really not the subject i think her post would have been even more impactful if she checked her privilege again maybe she did you didn t really expand on that something in the line of even though i can count myself as privileged because my family gave me a lot of access i could not have without them i still had to face x which in my experience is mainly faced by women in the industry i can t even imagine how hard it is for women who don t have the same privilege i benefited from but she is under no obligation to do it i just think it would have made the message even stronger
yta none of those things have anything to do with the fact that she has undoubtedly faced sexism in her industry which you clearly don t know anything about the fact that she doesn t always talk about it doesn t mean it hasn t happened to her
yta she can have some privileges and still experience discrimination even if she has it easier that other women bc of your mother connections it does not mean she has it as easy as if she was a man idk your sister and her experience but you don t either and she s not even talking about her only but about female dj in general
yta the sexism that plagues the music industry is well known
there s such thing as intersectionality yta
yta i mean if your sister was the son a known person in the dj industry certainly could have way more opportunities than the ones she already has the fact that she is some sort of nepo baby doesn t mean that she hasn t experience some or a lot gender bias
nta just being a women is not should not be enough to play victim a fake victim standing up for the real deal is more damaging than good i wouldn t want such a victim representing me
yta yet very good at mansplaining
your first impulse is laugh at her negate her experience and anoint yourself arbiter of who is and who isn t a victim according to your vast personal experience as a female dj i m sure you know better than she does the downside of privileged womanhood is that you have a lot to lose if you come forward privilege doesn t make you immune to misogyny or being battered or raped or denied certain opportunities it might keep you silent until you re brave enough to call it out even when your own brother calls your vulnerable sharing moment a lecture and her response to your condescension pissy you don t speak well of her i hope you think about that and how much you bailed on her and how what you said probably changed the way she feels about you possibly forever you could have just said she was brave for sharing and that you never knew even privilege isn t protection from sexism and maybe you re sorry that rotten stuff happens but you support her all the way you did the opposite instead yta
yta wealth privilege doesn t completely negate male privilege not everyone in the dj business cares that your family has money some care that they don t have a female dj
yta any time a man decides to opine on women being treated differently in an industry it s usually biased bullshit
yta i don t remember where i heard this but privilege isn t free pass on barriers but a lack of them to begin with google intersectionality your sister can be both privileged and oppressed simultaneously and it s important for both of you to understand what her privileges are as well as what they are not
nta people that play victim to gain attention cast a shadow on real victims and they get left unnoticed while everyone coddles the one with the most media coverage e en when it s all fabricated
yta women do absolutely face discrimination in the music industry and they are underrepresented in electronic music djing etc her wealth and other opportunities are irrelevant she s talking about sexism
yta you re not a dj and you haven t lived her life you don t know the dynamics of her industry or how she s experienced it she s allowed to have her own thoughts and opinions about what she s experienced in her own life also even if she has experienced privilege it doesn t mean that she can t see how it generally plays out for women in her industry and be very aware that she only got opportunities as a result of contacts it s great to have got the job s but she could be unsettled about how easy it is to be looked over why not just ask her about her opinions and learn about her perspectives rather than telling her about how she doesn t know about her own life
yta while she might have had more help rising to where she is she can still see the failures of the industry and use her plattform to lift the struggles that those less fortunate have to endure and while she has had more help on the way up than the average person it doesnt mean that she hasnt also been barred from opportunities she would have been the best choise for but didnt get because she was a woman sexism in entertainemnt is too wildly known for you to be this braisen in your rejection of the idea of it
yta jesus christ have some self awareness
i was ready to say n t a but i went back and read your original post more carefully after reading some comments by your words your sister was talking about opportunities given more to men vs women in general your sister said she has been a victim of this experience she enjoys a wide range of contacts and given opportunities because of your family s connections did it ever dawn to you that your sister may have tried to make it on her own as dj but never succeeded as well as she could have so she had to depend on her family s connections yta
yta
yta just because she s had more opportunities than most people doesn t mean that other women in her field have since you re not in her industry you have no idea whether other members of her gender have more trouble breaking in or not you unilaterally decided that the conversation was only about her instead of how she actually worded the instagram post per your description you owe her an apology
yta did it make you feel good to belittle someone for no reason
yta someone having a privileged background doesn t mean they haven t experienced discrimination op discrimination against women can be seen in a variety of different industries especially ones dominated by men to put it into perspective i don t know any women in my field who haven t experienced it it comes up naturally in our conversations because of how bloody frequent it is we should call it out where we see it we shouldn t act like it s fine because of someone s background and opportunities don t you think it s really weird that you felt the need to challenge her over this but then describe her response as being really pissy how the hell do you expect someone to respond to such a ridiculous challenge
yta your opinion is not more valid than your sisters lived experience
yta women are constantly discriminated against pointing out a successful male dj to compare her to only proves that basically to succeed in the dj business you have to be male even having advantages and contacts in the industry as woman she is still discriminated against you ve proved nothing except you are an ass
yta
yta the fact that she comes from has enjoyed the benefits of class privilege doesn t mean she hasn t been the victim of misogyny especially in the music industry i ve been djing for years and it s a super sexist industry i can guarantee your sister has been on the receiving end of that throughout her career
nta everyone s gonna hate me and downvote but i don t care everyone needs to stop complaining and feeling special for being discriminated against lots of you just love playing victim you re shooting yourself in the foot by becoming a weak whiny and stupid person this sub is unbelievable crazy how many of you have eaten up the narrative and see offense and victimhood in everthing you could be privileged in one way and still discriminated against in others is the most ridiculous thing to say and shows how eager people are to find discrimination in everything wtf are we even talking about anymore before you accuse me of being a privileged white male and tell me to shut up and go pay reparations let me tell you in liberal terms you probably couldn t deal with all the intersectional pain you d ascribe to my roots and gender let s stop self victimisation let s have some critical thinking
nta at all it s not like she wanted to support actual victims who have been treated unfairly or else she would have worded her post very differently the fact that she enjoyed the privileges and opportunities way above what a normal person would get and whine about being a victim of unfair treatments is ridiculous if anything she s the beneficiary of unfair treatments not the victim
nta having a cry about your situation with all the privileges is sad
nta playing the victim card is tired and annoying
yta just because you have some privileges doesn t mean you aren t disadvantaged in other ways sexism is real she is luckier than most women by the sounds of things but a man in her position would still likely be better off
nta i m tired of people who have given to them already complain about the they don t have and have to fight for you were right to give her a reality check
yta your sister sounds like she s well aware of how privileged and fortunate she s been in her career just as she s aware of how different it might have been without those family connections she sees her less fortunate peers struggling and witnesses the inequalities first hand she sounds like a much nicer person than you with a good heart and empathy you don t have to have directly suffered yourself in order to feel the pain of others
nta it s clear she s privileged and she s not standing up for other women she s acting like she s on their level when she isn t i m sure she s had to deal with misogyny but you ve clearly stated how opportunities fall on her lap edit could she have been discriminated against for being a woman of course i don t doubt one bit but how is she a victim of the experience of not getting opportunities she just isn t
yta just because she had contacts and extra help does not mean that she has not experienced gender based issues in the dj industry just because she has been successful does not mean that she has not hit some setbacks because she s a woman that case happens to be true for a lot of industries women are given less opportunities or less money it happens that is the truth just because your sister has had extra opportunities doesn t mean that she can t speak out on issues that might actually be affecting her community i have a few dj friends and i definitely do see a difference between men getting more gigs and women getting more gigs just because your sister happens to be successful doesn t mean she hasn t experienced that before i guarantee you if she didn t have all those contacts if she didn t have all of those ins and extra help then she would have been experiencing a lot more of the things she s talking about she would have experienced a lot more hardship trying to start out then your dj friend who had no contacts we re not saying that she hasn t had extra privileges but we are saying that those extra privileges do not cancel out whether or not someone s going to be biased towards her based on her gender extra contacts do not help with gender bias that s not how that works
yta woke misogyny sucks especially coming from women
yta you don t actually believe that sexism doesn t effect women with money right
yta women face sexism pretty much everywhere whether you re raised wealthy or not
yta i grew up with fairly wealthy parents in a privileged place but i work in a male dominated industry and i ve experienced harassment mansplaining to just plain out discrimination this isn t a race to the bottom be more understanding
yta and you proved her point so maybe she personally isn t but women are discriminated against in the industry
yta if you haven t had to deal with a problem that someone else struggles with particularly if it s in an area where they lack your privilege of gender in this case it s usually best to just be supportive
yta haven t you ever heard of intersectionality of privilege
yta and you missed the point of what she said while her career has been successful it s through her privileged contacts that doesn t mean she and more importantly other women are not discriminated against she has advantages that soemwhat offset that but it doesn t mean it s not out there in an industry you don t work in
yta
yes yta you don t get to decide how other people feel
for someone who doesn t work in this field mr i was always more of a film guy op you have some firmly held beliefs about a field that s not yours as the person who does work in the field your sister s lived experience trumps your opinion every time your opinion is unsubstantiated by fact as your male friend s experience is not the same as your female sister s when discussing a male dominated industry kindly remove your nose from business where it does not belong yta
nta she s not a victim she just thinks she is maybe she can think about it a little bit and do better
yta
yeah ofc women are always victims the same story over and over in your case your sister have never exeperienced that from what you said and she s saying it because every women says it simple as that it became a must in every women instagram feed to express her victimzation in itself it s a sign of weakness more than anything else i know some women that really struggle and believe me they never say this kind of weak speech and never victimize themselves they are the real strong women
nta as someone who has worked with many dj s they do tend to be male but each of them have spent years upon years to get where they are your sister might be a fantastic dj but there s thousands of them out there and they might just be better than she is
nta this fuckin victim complex bullshit needs to die already
nta i agree with you completely i get pretty annoyed when rich people act like their wealth has no affect on their place in life lots of prejudiced people will change their tune for someone with enough money and the right contacts
nta maybe she doesn t get the same opportunities because she isn t as good as the person they choose over her why does everything have to be sexist lol at all yta comments the sisterhood is real
nta it s easy to jump on the bend wagon and me too it for attention just to qualify that this is not a reference to the me too movement it was just a figure of speech
nta lmao she s not a victim because no one wants to hire her she s not entitled to employment employers don t owe her jobs
her privilege doesn t mean she doesn t experience discrimination it may be mitigated by advantages that other women in the same industry do not have but she still can experience discrimination as a woman in the music industry yta
sexist as hell or just doesn t understand how discrimination works yta
ynta in the industry you won t get a gig if you don t have money or connections that s how life works nowadays and op is trying to say that money solves pretty much all problems nowadays nobody cares about gender that much if you have money than that s it most people are fooled by money you pay them good money and your guaranteed to get a great gig and then there s connections if you or your parents or even friends have connections than they can help you and like op said she enjoys a lot of my mother s contacts in the dj industry that have given her many and big quality gigs before abroad and locally so she is getting gigs from connections so op is nta
ntah there is a mentality out there particularly amongst the newer so called feminism movement that wears victim hood as a badge and sees discrimination everywhere as a much older woman who has experienced real discrimination and missed opportunities due to real gender bias it saddens me to see women today misusing claims of discrimination as a basis excuse for everything real feminism was about equal rights equal access equal opportunity equal education equal pay not about proclaiming victimhood like it s a badge of honor it s sad to see something that something very real for my generation and those before and after mine usurped and polluted distorted that it s become just another victim status claim
nta she is trying to play oppression olympics
yta not because you re wrong about what you wrote your sister could even be said to be privileged and had a much easier path then someone without connections however she was talking about being a victim of losing jobs due to being a woman in her field are you a dj have you tried to get a job as a female dj how do you know she s never lost a gig to a guy because she s a girl x200b i don t like the victim mentality of today s kids at all i think there is something fundamentally weak and setting yourself up for failure by thinking your a victim i don t think it s laudible or even praiseworthy to be a victim i don t think it s something you run to instagram to brag about either so i get why you might want to slap your sister down for her pov on this issue because by every definition she s very very privileged but despite all of this you re still ta for all you know she just lost out on a big gig to some dude who can t do it at all because the dangly bits between his legs and she was venting on ig about how much this sucks and instead of support from her bro she gets told she is privilege and has no right to talk about it x200b see why yta
nta that she would she herself as a victim after what you described is an absolute joke this is why no one takes feminism seriously any more
nta not remotely the right form to ask this question but nice try lamo
nta some people need to get a reality check and get brought back down to earth
yta maybe she meant women in general it s not a bad thing to use one s platform to advocate for those who aren t as fortunate
she spelled nepotism baby wrong nta
yta because you are not the object of the discriminatory behavior she is talking about in particular you cannot take a very specific episode your friend s case to argue against a broader reasoning
despite all the privilege she s still being discriminated for being a women that s a kicker
nta i m tired of people victimizing themselves keep on complaining while she has got so many opportunities sickens me
nta one cuz the majority said you were ta two cuz she is privileged and connected
nta
nta she s not wrong but nepo babies are going to nepo

nta she isn t in a committed relationship she s being scammed your parents got involved financially so they have a right to know what s going on
nta don t let your sister swindle yalls parents
nta she is abusing her relationship with her parents and if you keep this secret for her it makes you a liar too as you know exactly how wrong it is
nta the man s a leech
he will drain your whole family if given the chance your sis is blind to that
nta my brothers dad is like this had to watch my bro go into dept several times before realizing that people like this arnt worth it your sister might be mad now but you re saving her a lot of pain in the long run
nta they should have broken up by now if your sister can t open her eyes now it ll be too late why isn t financial stability one of the factors to consider in a relationship helping out your partner in need is okay but taking over the whole financial burden is not break up asap
nta if your sister wants to make bad financial choices for her boyfriend questionable as that title may be that is on her when she involves your parents by using their retirement money she lost all rights to you keeping her secret this is something your parents need to know neither you or your parents should be supporting the boyfriend and your sister shouldn t either but she will have to figure that out for herself

nta but i think the adoptive parents might be elizabeth has a right to her own history even if it isn t pretty i m also adopted at 4months old and i can t imagine that being kept from me
nta as someone who spent almost years trying to find her brother who was also in a closed adoption it is important to know your roots and where you came from my mother was young and on her own she was mentally unwell and incapable of taking care of two kids my sister was put in foster care and my brother was adopted i grew up having my sister close by but we only met our brother a few years ago our mom passed of cancer last year don t let time pass don t deprive your sister of this valuable information that could change her life for the worse or for the better it will ultimately be up to her my sister and i stayed in contact with our mom our whole lives unfortunately my brother didn t have much of a chance and i think he regrets it it sounds like the adoptive parents have a jealousy involved it bothers them that they aren t the bio parents but it doesn t give them a right to withhold this information
nta either your adoptive parents did no research on the potential harm of not telling a child they are adopted making them idiotic and negligent or they did research it and decided not to tell her anyway making them selfish and cruel here is an article summing it up https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/adoption-disclosure-study/594496/ wait until the child is old enough hasn t been the advice for decades far before you and your sister were adopted it should never be a surprise to someone to find out they are adopted they should be from before they are old enough to remember the conversation every year your parents waited made it worse they put their selfish desire to live a fantasy over your sisters wellbeing sorry for the rant but adoptive parents who do this make me furious and so does anyone who thinks yta because adopted children owe their parents for raising them and so you or your sister going against them is disloyal or ungrateful you weren t wrong for telling your sister and she wouldn t be in the wrong for never trusting them again if anything i d question if its the right choice to gatekeep your mother s info from her i d say you should have told her sooner but that s not really fair when you were under their care etc
nta your parents should have told her what s the reason for a such a lie it s ridiculous that they stop speaking to you sorry for your troubles
nta if any i think your adoptive parents are the ah for doing the things they do they made a mistake by choosing to tell child but not the other i found it very odd that your adoptive parents choose not to tell your sister that does not sit right with me edit i see your adoptive mom choose not to tell your sister due to the pain of not being her biologically daughter even though i understand its a very selfish reason to make such a choice you are quite lucky your sister is on your side if she weren t your adoptive stepmom would have kept you away from your sister i think you did well by choosing to tell your sister also well done on protecting her and keeping her private information private also for not breaking the bond and trust of your little sister she probably really needs you in these hard times take it easy
nta i ve never heard of an adopted kid being angry about the truth when they learned it only that they d been lied to i m sure others will let me know if i m wrong but i ve had an unusually high number of adoptees in my friend groups over the years and this is what i always heard also your parents were in the wrong to force you to hide your background and lie to your sister you were a child yourself going through a very difficult and scary time that never should have happened i m sorry you ve always been the other kid and that your relationship with both your sisters is suffering as for your parents if they could go nc with you simply for telling the truth you deserve better than them anyway good luck op
huge nta how dare these people tell you a seven yearold at the time to lie like this this is disgusting like i could maybe get them saying we want to explain it to her when she s old enough to understand if you weren t in the picture asking you to do this and then making the decision to never tell her is so so wrong
i know someone who found out she was adopted as an adult she was born in the s adopted as a baby after her parents died she found out that not only was she adopted but her siblings and their entire extended family knew extended family claimed they thought she already knew the siblings had no excuse she didn t speak to the one she was closest to for years she felt so deeply betrayed by everyone but especially him because they were so close growing up you first obligation is to your sister not your adoptive parents maybe you should have talked with the older sister first to try to preserve that relationship but it doesn t make sense to keep this from e besides not wanting to lie to her there are so many ways for her to find out her birth certificate might have the info on it or indicate that it s amended she could find the court documents she could do a me test for fun you needed to tell her nta
nta if they went nc over this it corroborates your story you re not her parent you re her sister you re as much family as they are they don t get to dictate who is in your sisters family and say that you are not
nta and it s absolutely fucked up that they told you to pretend as a child
nta if you had waited years to tell elizabeth that you contacted your biological mom she would ve felt betrayed by both her adoptive parents and you even if she has to wait at least you told her the truth if your biological mom was dead then it would be a different story besides all it could ve taken was a school project or a dna test for her to find out she is adopted
info why tell your sis at if you weren t planning to give her contact info for more years
nta truth is almost always better than lies plus you telling her will give her a new perspective on the relationship between you and your adoptive parents if there was prior tension between you and them it ll help her understand why that tension exists when she may have believed it was because of her there s a reason the truth will set you free is such a common saying
i am an adopted child and what your parents did was cruel my adoption was treated like a dirty little secret and i was thunderstruck when i found out the truth nta
nta it is absolutely wrong for a child to be adopted and not be made aware of that fact your parents fertility does not give them the excuse to lie to your sister for her entire life she has a right to know where she came from when she eventually found out she d have felt betrayed by you as well as everyone else you told them you were going to tell and offered them the ability to do it themselves they chose not to
nta as a child welfare worker your adoptive parents are abusive for doing this and this is why we get nervous about adopting out babies
thank you for telling her i was told at and had a lot of stuff to process and i m still dealing with the betrayal through anxiety and other mental issues years later i hope your sister gets the help she needs and eventually has successful relationships with whomever she considers her family nta
nta as a former adoption worker i am appalled by your adoptive parents behavior they never should have told you to lie or pretend to be anything other than who you are also i dealt with a lot of people who wanted babies but knew they would never find one who wasn t part of a package deal and so they adopt a sibling group this is unfortunately quite common and there isn t much you can do to prevent it from happening but the fact that they told you this is infuriating i am so sorry that you and your sisters had to deal with this i am sure they provided you all with a loving and stable home but that does not excuse how they approached adoption and parenting i feel for your youngest sister because now she has to process this information without much context or support from her adoptive parents and that is so sad
nta as someone who was also adopted your adoptive parents secrecy just makes my blood boil you re an amazing loving brother to elizabeth and she will always appreciate your honesty
nta one bit i can t stand adoptive parents like this and for them to go nc shows they never should have been allowed to adopt in the first place i m sorry they put you in that position
telling some one the truth about their family of orgin medical history adoption has been considered in the best interest of the child for atleast thirty years now so your dishonest and manipulative adoptive parents are clearly the assholes here it is cruel stupid and pointless to lie to an adoptive child in the age of at home dna test
despite what reddit decides to say here this was completely unfair of your adoptive parents to ask of you at age they put you in a position of holding an important life long secret that you didn t feel was appropriate to keep a secret i can t in good faith judge this aita because i just don t know i think i d lean to nta but honestly i don t know if you should have waited two years so that you didn t have to keep any more secrets i do know that they left you with no good options
nta you have a right to know who you are my family was so dysfunctional that i legit thought i was adopted clear into my twenties and assumed they were just lying about it
adoption can be a predatory undertaking lying to your favorite child so you can pretend to be the bio mom is a sign that adoption is a little like theft her identity and yours was stolen the lies were never to benefit you or her nta lying is stealing no matter the saviour complex of the adopted parents
nta the whole package deal thing what a way to tell your kid you never wanted them you deserve better
nta you were a child but the adoptive parents were wrong and total ahs for letting your sister live a lie i hope that your sister wants to meet your bio mom
nta x200b the only ahs here are your adoptive parents
nta your sister deserves to know
nta i will say that your adoptive parents are huge huge major assholes i m an adoptee i can t even imagine your feelings i m so sorry for how your adoptive parents have treated you adoption is not something that they should ve hidden
nta your sister is struggling because everyone lied to her for her entire life that s on your parents
op have you looked into groups for adoptees they may be able to give you better guidance here i think you are nta but honestly i don t even know you found yourself in a shitty situation and i think you might get a better idea of how to navigate this if you can talk to some other folks who went through similar experiences to yours
nta she s nearly a legal adult and had the right to know
nta it s info that never should have been a secret so you had every right to tell her as soon as you wanted to
nta what your adoptive parents did to all of you was morally reprehensible and you never should have been put in the position of helping maintain their delusion and lying to your sister for them people who don t want to acknowledge the fact that they adopted their children shouldn t adopt children
nta every successful adoption i ve known where the kid keeps in contact with the adoptive parents after finding their bio has been because the parents were open about it your parents did a disservice to your sister
nta there s more tactful ways of doing this but eventually you d have to say something because elizabeth would ve started asking questions about who you re talking to if she ever caught you on the phone with them however dropping a bomb on a teenager like that isn t tactful elizabeth is at an age where she s finding herself as a person and to remove her identity as your adopted parents child would put anyone that age into a tailspin
nta your adoptive parents made the agreement not to tell your younger sister with a seven year old trying to hold op to that is really manipulative
nta i didn t know i had an older sister until i was she was adopted she reached out to me after years of searching she has medical issues and needed family history she s doing better now and our children gave a great relationship with each other there are times where i wish i met her sooner because we re so close and i feel like we lost so much time together
nta and it was unfair of them to ask you to keep that secret when you were a child
nta they had no right to keep her biological information from her knowing her biological background would not make her love them any less lying to her for years and guilting you into keeping it a secret was not okay
nta i am adopted myself and have known several people who were adopted overall the following i have seen seem to spell disaster for adoptees bad adopted parents family who values blood ties too much and roll over blind eye parents because family adoptee finding out as an older child or adult adoptee not being given a choice to find out about bio parents not everyone needs to know or want to find out but the option should be available while not your place to tell her because no one else was i can see why and that is why you are nta
this was wrong from the beginning and your adoptive parents are ta
as someone who had my birth parent hidden from me and was forced to keep it a secret after finding out absolutely nta i wish someone had been kind enough to tell me i found out by finding a document with my wrong last name on it elizabeth will thank you for telling her the truth one day if she hasn t already and your parents may or may not get over it but it sounds like your relationship with them was strained already i went nc with my parents and found a lot of peace in no longer feeling like i was a second place citizen in my own family
nta my father was adopted found out as an adult and he was pretty upset but when he found his biological mum she refused to tell him who his father was he didn t find out until we all grown up and he was in his 50s now when i was i was diagnosed with scoliosis we caught it just in time if it had been a few years it would have progressed past the point of being able to be treated because it was diagnosed so late i had to have operations with rods attached to my spine my sister had to wear a brace for years my fathers family has a history of scoliosis if we had known we could have checked earlier so absolutely people should have a right to know their biological history
nta elizabeth is not a toy or a puppet for your parents to create pretend worlds around she s a human being and she deserves to know her personal history and medical history your parents manipulating you as a child to deny your own history and create a fabricated delusion is sick in the literature was very fucking clear not to lie to kids about their adoption your parents were foster parents they should ve known but decided their wants were more important than elizabeth s life not ok
nta elizabeth has every right to know if nothing else her genetic health history is tied to her bio mom

honestly i think the person you need to ask is elizabeth how does she feel about knowing does she wish you didn t tell her does she wish she knew sooner if she s happy with you having told her and agrees she should have grown up knowing then how are you the asshole
i m stuck on the comment still i know my place feels like your have resentment still as an adopted child myself i have always known my adopted parents are my real parents i hate when people say they aren t real knowing where i come from is not an issue for every adopted child some of us don t give a shit and are happy with our lives as they are and honestly that can change over time the way i felt at is drastically different from how i feel now at your feelings and hers may evolve as well your parents absolutely should have told her the fact that your parents and older sister cut you off speaks volumes about how they feel about you and i m sorry nta but i wonder if part of you made the decision to tell her bc she deserves to know but also out of spite for your family
did you want your sister to know or did danielle want her to know this seems manipulative no matter who wanted her to know
i m gonna say nta a lot of peoppenhere have made great points to throw in my own cents for medical reasons your sister needed to know she was adopted you both need to be aware of your biological parents history in case there is anything genetic
nta
nta i d have wanted to know
nta your adoptive parents are though i m glad that you finally told her the truth she deserves to know that s a pretty big secret to make a kid keep that and it doesn t matter what age you had told her the truth she still would ve been hurt by it her adoptive parents refused to tell her about her birth parents almost like they were trying to erase them from your lives
when my grandson turned his mother told him that he was a sperm donor baby i always thought he knew why she waited i have no idea why he was mad she waited so long the dad he thought was not his real dad he was so lost for awhile until he had time to adjust to it a
adoptive parent of a sibling group here my kids were twins and at placement my twins have no memory of any parents but us however they all know and understand that they were all wanted all loved and that it is perfectly normal to have feelings and curiosity toward bio parents never do you tell your kids to keep secrets of that magnitude you are most certainly not the asshole your adoptive parents are kudos to biological mom for staying in her lane adoptive parents biological sister will never understand and her bio sister will have a lot of unpacking to do
i was in this position as well my biological mother met my adopted father when my brother and i were young i was and my brother was still a baby i was told told not to tell my brother we had a different biological father from a young age i felt like i carried a huge weight on my shoulders and wanted to ask questions but i didn t want my mum to be angry i felt like an outsider and fantasized about what my father was like did he miss me was he in the army and couldn t see me was he rich we were poor would he turn up one day and love and spoil me unfortunately my brother died age so i never had to make the decision to tell him if i had the chance i would of told him when he was older nta no child should have to keep a secret like that i really feel for you
nta but i would have waited until she was simply because of the reaction what would have happened had elizabeth ever done a and me or the like test had medical issues needed a kidney how long was this delusion supposed to go on your parents wanted the delusion that your mother gave birth and were willing to do whatever to get it did they make up stories about her birth infancy before she came to them lies after lies
nta given some added info i am changing it to nta basically op says in comments that the reason was because the adoptive parents didn t want to be reminded of the pain of them not being able to have another child so it was all about them if the child had been the product of oh hitler i would say hell no do not tell the kid but they don t want her to know because of their pain screw that pain is life
nta
nta but there is a reality you didn t take into account you threw a hand grenade into your sister s life kept the pin but closed the door she can t get away cannot get space and in reality most likely feels betrayed by everyone you pushed her out of the plane with no parachute going forward you have to support her if every choice she makes if she decides that danielle will never be her mom or that she doesn t want to know her which is her right you have to support that if she wants to keep calling her adoptive parents her parents you have to support that if she wants you to never mention her name to danielle you have to support that you gave her the knowledge and now she is in control this situation because at least then she ll know that her best interest is taken into account
nta maybe you could ve told her in a better way but she needed to know and it s incredibly fucked up of your parents for not saying anything you were a child forced to lie to your sister they should have known it would come out eventually and anyone giving you grief doesn t understand that you also had your life blown up but immediately afterwards you were forced to lie and never talk about your trauma with your family
nta it s a difficult situation because it depends on the people involved personally i m all about honesty and asking a child to lie to their sister about the existence of biological parents is not a lie i would perpetuate indefinitely i think it is generally more harmful than good to lie in these situations because now your sister not only has to deal with the existence of unknown family but also needs to come to terms with the fact that her parents siblings lied to her face every day for years that s a really tough pill to swallow good luck and hopefully your adopted parents realize that there are no good bad guys in this situation and you were doing what was right for you and what you thought was right for your sister
this is a tough one is old enough to make medical decisions and need to know the truth from at least a biological perspective you both need to know what diseases run in your family if you re going to tell your sister then she needs all the information not just part of it and trust me with ancestry dna and all of the others available the truth was bound to come out nta
nta it is not the job of a child to lie on behalf of an adult they pressured to to lie to your sister while both of you were in a traumatic foster to adopt situation after being taken from your parents it s incredibly inappropriate for an adult to even ask this of a child much less one coming to them from trauma it is not your job to maintain their lie nta nta nta
nta for telling her i wish i had known about my dad before i was your adoptive parents are assholes for not telling her it does so much harm that folks who don t experience can t fathom the psychological trauma i can t trust no one now i question everything from the past to the present if it s real or not it is unfair that they expected you to hold that lie
not quite the same thing but i learned my father was not my father when i was secrets like that are never good making you lie was abuse nta
i don t think it s fair to ask a small child to carry a lie like that on their shoulders especially forever it was bound to become too heavy for you sometime and is old enough to learn the truth especially since it never should ve been a secret in the first place if one child knows both need to know and frankly your mom was a giant asshole for telling you that they only wanted elizabeth what the actual fuck so nta
nta they sound weird af wth tells their kid they only adopted her because she came along with her sister please protect her at all costs tell her anything she wants to know people need to stop normalising not telling kids where they come from they have a right to know their background and history and if you don t do that for them and be open it s like your asking for them to go low contact
nta my younger bro and i have the same mom and dad she left him and moved to another state mom remarried when we were very little and so we only knew one dad my cousin spilled the beans when we were sal isn t your real dad your real dad and my dad are brothers i was so pissed i jumped off the swing and was ready to kick her butt i didn t when i got home i told my mom what she said she same down and confirmed it my younger brother didnt find out til he was about when he was shipped off to stay with bio for bad behavior i didnt think this was a good idea but who am i anyway he s had anger issues since
op your adopted parents suck first it was totally unfair of them to expect you to keep a secret that you agreed to when you were seven they may have wanted to keep the adoption secret but they should have accepted that wasn t going to be a possibility because you knew and their eldest daughter knew they only wanted a baby but elizabeth and i were advertised as a packaged deal my mother went into foster care and her foster parents eventually became what i have always considered my grandparents but apparently my grandmother once told her that they preferred boys i only took her because they had already taken her twin brother ironically my mother s brother had no contact with them once he left the home but we were constantly in contact with each other but there s some things that just wound your soul and even though logically you can put it aside it s still really hurts just realized that this is more about her than about you it s not you that is broken it is them shame on them they have failed as human beings my parents have cut all contact with me i m sorry i know it probably hurts even if they seem like really crappy parents and really horrible human beings but sometimes when we cut out the toxic people in our lives it makes room for healthier relationships i had to cut my mother out of my life for various reasons and i have created new bonds with people that i m not biologically related to but i consider family find your real family not the biological ones and not the adopted ones but the ones that you choose to be connected to nta
nta your adoptive parents made many unacceptable missteps here they adopted a child they didn t want just so they could have the baby sibling they did not hide from said unwanted child that they were unwanted they lied to their daughter about her origins they asked her siblings to lie to her which also meant forcing you to lie about your own origins despite knowing better your adoptive parents are mad that their choices had consequences they chose to keep her in the dark thinking they could manipulate her into not thinking it s important where she came from honestly they would have been more likely to succeed at that had they told her i ve known several adoptive children who grew up knowing they were adopted but never choosing to meet their bio parents because their adoptive family was all they needed but when you hide something from a kid it s much more likely that they ll wonder why
nta i have yet to come across a truth that should not be told
nta it s just a messy situation the reality of it is your foster parents chose to start things off with a lie while their intentions may be good in some ways it was still a lie that could some day unravel now it s unraveling
nta as someone who also went through a difficult struggle with being the product of a closed adoption and i was told about it as soon as possible i fortunately had a family friend that was older and also went through a closed adoption so i was able to speak to him about my conflicting emotions about how much i hated the thought my bio parents got rid of me out of pure convenience but how much i simply wanted to meet them face to face one time your parents should have taken the time to tell ur sister the truth from childhood it s not their right to withhold that kind of information i told my parents since i was that i wanted a promise from them that they would have no part in the relationship between my biological family until i approved it since they had no idea about what kind of people they were and it was my right to decide if i wanted to reconnect with them after the initial meeting when i turned and had my records unsealed imagine she needed a transplant or important medical information and gave out incorrect details only to find out in an emergency that she wasn t blood related to your parents i wanted to at the very least ask my bio family if i needed to watch out for any hereditary diseases and ask my mother face to face why she abandoned me also it helps to be able to take time to process how you feel about the situation itself so the shock would only be more severe the later she found out so i commend you for feeling compelled to tell her asap once it became clear that your bio mom was reaching out and in a better place to connect in a meaningful and important way and could no longer be a secret if it was me i d be so angry if you kept that info from me and dropped it on me at with no time to process it and suddenly coming face to face with a decision to accept or reject this opportunity to meet her biological mother and see her origin for herself this way she has at least two years to decide although i m pretty sure a closed adoption only legally binds the adoption agency from handing out biological families information you never signed an nda or at least i didn t and i ve heard of many teens that had closed adoptions use private investigators to find there biological families information before but that s actually probably a good idea to let her digest the information for a year or two you should provide info about the kinda of person ur bio family is as a scout for her and let her decide for herself if she really wants needs that connection when she comes to terms with how she feels sorry i wrote a lot it kinda hit some trauma in me i guess i feel like you re acting like a good big sister and i hope you help her process this all and take the patience to answer any questions she has honestly and let her make her own informed decision on how to proceed
nta people who do this shouldn t be allowed to adopt
nta i am an adopted person your parents did your sister no favours by withholding this information especially in the age of easy dna testing you did the right thing even though it was unpopular there is no shame in being adopted there is no shame in being unable to have your own off spring i thnk it s reprehensible to pretend a child is your own biological child when they are not you might want to find some post adoption resources or support groups for you and your sister the truth of who you are who you are related to and where you come from is your truth to share whether your parents agree or not it is not their truth they don t own you they have no say in who you tell you are adopted including your sister they are flat out wrong and have handled all of this poorly i m sorry
nta your parents make me so so so so angry best guidance for the past several decades has been to make adoption a normal part of your child s life story over the past years with commercial dna testing it s outright stupid for parents to even believe they could keep this kind of secret your parents knew they were injuring both of you they knew they couldn t keep this secret and they tried anyway apparently because they have some kind of adoptive child bigotry going on i m so sorry you didn t feel safe to tell her sooner
adoptive parents are horrible people basically didn t want you but took you because you came with the baby they wanted second your sister is either able to be emancipated or is tell her everything adoptive parents are assholes for trying to force you guys to forget where you came from
if i were adopted i would want to know nta
nta as a fellow adoptee it is enraging that it s legal for adoptive parents to withhold biological family information you were right to tell your sister the truth the united nations lists the rights of a child and among those rights is the right to know our genealogical information withholding the truth of an adoptee s true identity is a disgusting violation of human rights that too many adoptive parents get away with
nta where i live adopted children must be informed tgat they are indeed adopted since thr very beginning if they are babies when adopted as soon as they grow to the brain capability to understand any information they are informed in a soft and kind way so even at 2yo because it s more traumatic to find out later in life
as per the child rights convention children have the right to know their identity i assume you come from the us which is one of the countries in the world who did not signed the child rights convention and therefore it is not required by law that adoptive parents tell their children about their origin this goes against their rights and is why on other countries it is mandatory for adoptive parents to tell this information to their children once they reach an appropriate age to understand what you did was give your sister what should be hers by right and ultimately it is up to her how to proceed not your parents nta and also your parents are a h for going no contact when all you did was look over your sister s best interest why would they know best what it is best for and adoptee than you an actual adoptee
only ahs are your adoption parents and georgia they can t keep secret forever what will they do if you or your sister need an organ
nta your adoptive parents are massive ahs though wtf did they think would happen that your sister would never do a dna test that she d never look into her birth your adoptive parents attitudes are just one of the reasons the us adoption system is vile and needs to be scrapped in favor of a system that prioritizes the children instead of prioritizing finding babies for needy adults oh and they are beyond lucky that you never told her before now i would have weaponized that information form day one oh you think you re going to ground me i m pretty sure my sister is about to find out she s adopted
esh adoptive parents should have told elizabeth when she was old enough since they did not you would have been better to wait until she was an yo adult
i m conflicted i want to say you re nta but as an adopted kid sometimes i wish i could ve not known but that s fantasy my parents were honest i still don t think you re the asshole i m leaving the adopted parents feelings out of this it should ve been told to the kid me knowing i was adopted didn t make me feel any less loved in fact that person loved me enough to chose to be my parent and sorry i missed the last part they were wrong to cut contact from you that s so painful i hope you have support
probably not the best timing on your end but the only ah s here are your parents for making children lie to their sister their whole lives that was incredibly selfish of them you gave them the opportunity they said no and that would have been more years of lying if you didn t
you should have waited she may be anxious to know about her biological mother and may demand to have her contact how would you handle that your adoptive parents gave you a good home love education a sense of belonging you should have continued to talk to them until you got the green light to tell her you were too quick to make and take decisions
yta you did this for you not her if your biological mother was not sober and you did not reconnect with her you wouldn t have done it you chose to disrupt your sister entire system because of something you believed in
yta you are still keeping a secret for two more years i think that is in its own way twisted and mean either tell it all or wait now you have someone with an identity crisis and you have the info she needs it is wrong your bio mom is sober if she is so great why hide it you are now as bad as your adopted parents you basically destroyed her last couple years of high school out of spite if you want to be honest do so but this makes you just as bad as them that is just my two cents
yta you didn t think about your sister you only selfishly thought of yourself
nta
nta the adoptive parents are making them about them and about what they want it s not
nta and that was unfair of them to put that secret on you when you were how is your sister handling it
nta my oldest daughter was adopted by my ex husband at the request of her bio father we were upfront with her from the beginning we had a happy adoption day celebration when the judge approved our request she was her bio father had been out of her life for years and months so there was no memory of him we wouldn t have had to but we did it any way because we felt it was the right thing to do and eventually adopted kids have to be told because of medical histories i agree she should have been told long before i am surprised that your adopted sister didn t spill the beans when it became apparent your little sister was the favorite you re not wrong
nta your adoptive parents had no right on never telling her she s adopted i mean i understand waiting till she s older so she would be able to understand and be able to have a conversation but that s debatable because they would feel like they would be living in a lie i m just confused on how that would medically work for her wouldn t she see the papers if you biological mom has a high blood pressure and you adoptive parents don t keeping that secrete would just screw her up just with medical because she wouldn t actually be telling her doctor her family history
nta your adopted parents never should have asked you to lie your sister needed to know she was adopted what happens when she goes to doctors and gives comply made up family medical history
nta however i would of waited till she was so she won t have to wait she may just starting digging and researching herself

i see this as two separate things you pay for his schooling and whatever agreement you have for that you don t like your dad and his fiancee now you want to dictate what your brother does by leveraging your financial support that s a major ah move in my mind that you don t like your dad or that he moved on that s your thing your brother might be more able to forgive or knows something you don t or likes the fiancee or whatever reason it might be it would be understandable if you didn t want your dad at your house or if you didn t want to go visit him but dictating who your brother can visit and be happy for shouldn t be something you do
yta sure you re upset that your father moved on quickly and you have the right to feel that way but imagine how your brother feels having lost his mom and now having to choose between being happy for his father and financial security
giving your brother money does not give you the right to dictate his relationship with his father i m convinced something happened between them prior to my mom s passing that may be enough for you but it s not reasonable to demand that be enough for him you re making demands of his life based on your view of events that he may very well just disagree with could in fact be wrong or maybe he s not willing to end his relationship with his dad over it this is between you and your dad taking away your brothers college tuition was a power move who was it really intended to hurt oh right your dad your brother s a person dude not a pawn yta
i feel yta your feelings are your feelings just as your brother s are his you don t get to dictate nor punish him when his feelings don t align with yours
yta it s your money and your free to do what you want with it but it s pretty fucked up you d just throw away his future for going to a wedding so every time he does something you don t like your going to hold financial blackmail over his head that s pretty shitty
yta just because you feel one way doesn t mean he has to feel the same and this is his education his future it is extremely generous of you to be paying for it in the first place but also extremely unfair to hold it against him and put him in the middle
yta you re controlling what your brother does by withholding money for his education you don t have to support your dad s relationship but you can t tell your brother he has to agree with you or else
yta you re using tuition education and his future career as some sort of power move to get him to do what you want
yta for one huge reason you do not use your money to control other people lives and that is exactly what you are doing and that is not right your brother is not doing anything illegal immoral or wrong if he wants to attend the wedding then he has every right to do that i don t know if your dad cheated on your mom and apparently neither do you not for a fact anyways even if he did that is your father s short coming not your brother s if you are mad at your father then you take it out on him not the rest of your family
yta
yta you have no proof of an affair even though the timeline is suspect
yta what is the goal of punishing your brother for your father s behavior
not only are you unfairly judging your father for a relationship he entered after your mother was dead you re also holding your sibling hostage this is so unfair you don t know what it s like to be older and lose a spouse you don t have some generosity have some perspective and keep your commitment to your sibling to pay their tuition or don t and lose them too yta
yta you re punishing your brother for having his own opinion about the situation you can t control him with your money that s flat wrong and it s been years now it s unfortunate that you re holding on to this grudge still you re nta for that no one can tell you how to feel but it seems mean to me after this much time
yta you have your feelings about the situation and he has his both are perfectly valid however you using your financial position over your brother to get him to not attend the wedding is extremely shitty and controlling behavior don t be surprised if he goes no contact with you should you go through with this
they aparently rekindled contact after my mother passed and everything went fast after that but i m convinced something happened between them prior to my mom s passing god you re presumptuous what proof do you have that happened do you even have circumstantial evidence that this is the case i know months is quick but ffs get over yourself unless you can tell us exactly why you think this is the case and it doesn t include months is too fast cutting off your entire family because you assume people who moved on maybe a little too fast must have been cheating is asinine yta
yta for trying to control and manipulate your brother with money
yta some people grieve differently some people can t stand to be alone my step mom stayed with my dad through the end of his cancer and rekindled an old relationship a month or two later i know for a fact there was no contact before his passing it happens you can t blackmail people to get them to match your feelings
yta all you re doing is causing more pain for everyone yourself included note i m sorry about your mom that must have been agonizing
yta you re abusive holding finances over his head to bend him to your will you re a terrible sibling
yta you are being petty manipulative and cruel it s time to find some healing and move on
yta you re punishing your brother for something your father may or may not have done years ago after losing his wife men often find a new partner soon after losing one and although you are still grieving your mother would want your father to go on with life and be happy

you re a huge ah your poor brother so what if he wants to attend his own dads wedding you re just manipulating and being abusive you don t even have proof your dad cheated on your mum
yta first things first let me give you my deepest condolences over your mom s passing i lost my dad a year ago and it was the worst time of my life i can sorta imagine what you re going through i know months is a short time to get over someone but may i ask if your mom was terminally ill it could be that your dad had been mourning her death for years i also don t think it s fair that you can t let your dad move on and find love again i ve seen people who lost a loved one and it completely broke them but i agree with the others you re being controlling and manipulative over your brother and it s not fair that you would risk his future and career over the wedding
yta you agreed to pay for his schooling and now you are being petty and making him choose between your father and you and do you have proof you dad cheated on your mom yeah it was fast but some people done like to be alone and it s not like he married her right away it s two years later grow up and stop putting your brother in the middle you making him choose between his education and your father don t you see how wrong that is
i agree i will reconsider thank you
before my mil passed away she made my fil promise to not dwell on her passing and to find happiness with someone he started dating again months or so after she passed away and married a fantastic woman years later i swear that wherever my mil is she made sure they found each other my new mil is very similar in vivacity kindness and wit to my hubby s mom she s loves both of our daughters as though they were her own flesh blood and my fil is happy just as my hubby s mom wished him to be so op don t begrudge your dad s happiness or be mad at your brother for being happy for your dad it may be that your mom also wants wanted this for him and if they knew each other in high school then they already knew all the nitty gritty details and could move faster than strangers please pick empathy
you didn t have to pay for your brothers school it s nice that you do but you shouldn t be putting a condition to paying for it to me esh

i m pretty sure it s illegal to padlock the accessible stall what if someone with a visible disability needs it
nta this needs to be addressed if you are in the us what she s doing is possibly even an ada violation failing to install accessible restroom facilities is an ada violation so i can t see padlocking existing ones as legal if you are given an grief here is how to file a complaint https://www.ada.gov/file-a-complaint/) some things are worth risking losing a job over being forced to wear depends because someone has locked a bathroom would be one of them for me
nta as a person in a wheel chair if the boss didn t hand over the key my next stop would be a lawyer
nta the ah here is the boss locking up a stall to house her bidet many disabilities are unseen
this is not an aita issue contact a lawyer immediately preferably someone well versed in ada compliance
nta at all this sounds like a reasonable request to me not sure about yourself but i m from the uk and in our employment law employers are required to make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities and health conditions such as what you described this wouldn t require them going to any extreme lengths or expense to make one of their employees much more comfortable
nta and i m pretty sure it s illegal to lock a handicap stall is there a way to report this issue without putting your job in jeopardy
nta but considering how the boss is your bf may be right about losing your jobs i believe this may be against ada if someone is in a wheelchair does he expect them go into the bathroom just to see that it s locked just to go back out to ask for it to be unlocked and then go baaack into the bathroom to use it that s so unnecessary
nta your place of employment is required by us law if you re in the us to make accommodations for your disability
no nta unless you are working in an extremely toxic place i would just politely ask whether you could a key to the handicap stall because of your kidney disease legally the answer they give you has to be yes
nta this is actually illegal and against the americans with disabilities act she absolutely cannot padlock the handicap stall please ask her to remove the lock and explain that she s violating the ada rules if she doesn t you can report her does this company have an hr department you can also go directly to them about this issue
nta go above her head to whomever she answers to and talk to hr its illegal for her to padlock the handicapping accessible stall for only her use take pictures of the padlocked stall a conversation regarding her admitting to only having access to the stall for her personal bidet would help too this is a human rights violation as they are required to have an accessible bathroom for special needs this is a state mandated law my sons in a wheelchair and this makes me furious you need to say something she should be fired i can t believe the gall in thinking its okay to block a handicapped bathroom to hog up your own personal bidet if she retaliated and fired your well that would be another law broken your bf is wrong don t sit down and say nothing say something for yourself and people like my son say something for the line of women out the door as well i understand your real fear of retaliation it wouldn t hurt to reach out to a employment attorney they should be able to do a free conciliation and advise you the correct order to do this
nta go to the higher ups
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** i was recently diagnosed with lupus and kidney disease which makes it very painful if i can t go when i need to go and i have to hold it it was hard for me to get a job during covid due to lack of experience and recently my boyfriend got me a job working with him i really love the job and i m getting paid more than ive ever made but at work there is a fully accessible handicap stall and one other smaller stall the issue is the handicap stall is locked with a padlock so no one else can use it except for the boss because she has a bidet toilet that only she uses but she only works twice a week when there are breaks there is a line of women waiting for that one stall and i am seriously about to buy diapers for work i expressed this all to my bf and he said not to say anything or make it a big deal because we would probably lose our jobs over it am i the asshole for wanting to talk to the higher ups about this or should i just keep my head down and invest in depends i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta i m not sure but you also might be able to contact the department of labor i believe they have to offer accommodations for any sort of disability kidney problems might be considered disability
nta there should not be a padlock on the only fully accessible bathroom stall if you don t want to fight that particular battle and don t want to tell your boss the particulars of your health problems can a doctor provide you with a note to say you require access to an accessible bathroom stall
anonymous tip to hr though do be careful if you ve been vocal about this to anyone else if so it won t take long for her to find out
this is the way to go ada is taken very seriously and osha might have some issues for safety also
ada doesn t mess around for good reason no one should have to consider adult diapers for lack of workplace facilities this is about dignity nta
she and then she s never even there for it be unlocked at all completely against code
anonymous tip to hr i foolishly assumed that the lock was probably approved by hr because the boss needed that toilet for a disability related reason and needed the bidet because of an inability to use a typical toilet without one i think maybe i was being gullible about this but op should talk to hr either way
this is the way
handicapped toilets must be made available to everyone
yep to be compliant with ada regulations the padlock has to go nta

info is gianna allowed to her dance because tbh it doesn t really sound like any of her punishments have been punishments
yta why is his behavior worse than your daughter s bigotry that is exactly the message you re sending
yta you re educating gianna for repeated shitty behavior but not punishing her you re punishing ryker without educating him about appropriate anger expression get it together
yta why is that with gianna every punishment even as a repeat offender was actually an opportunity to learn but the moment ryker slips up he gets an actual punishment even if you didn t intend it this looks exactly like favoritism
please explain in a paragraph essay why your daughter has no consequences for her racism while your son gets consequences for his anger yta you re about to fail as parents
so the racist doesn t actually get consequences clearly we know where she may have learned her bigotry do better and punish your daughter yta
yta if you had punished your daughter properly this wouldn t have happened you clearly have a favorite destroying a dress out of anger from racism is a one time teachable moment your daughter showing a pattern of racism is something that should have been addressed more seriously
slight yta his punishment does seem more severe than hers given that she is a repeat offender and he is reacting to racism in his own home why is she still allowed to go to her dance given her behavior you re educating her without any serious consequences but you re punishing him without any real education
i don t know if you re ah but you definitelly need to recalibrate the consequences you dish out to your kids your son trashed valued property of another person he definitelly deserves punishment and forbidding him from going to the dance may be it but by her racist behavior your daughter trashed dignity of another human being that s magnitudes worse than destroying even the most valuable thing and for that she got a writing assignment and a cultural exchange dinner which she obviously didn t give a crap about and learned nothing from and during which she clearly disrespected your guests and seemingly got no punishment for that if your son can t go to the dance then she needs even more severe punishment than that edit thanks for my first award kind person
info what kind of a weird crowd has your daughter fallen in with most kids i meet these days are super open minded and non judgmental you may want to do a quick search of her browsing history on social media
yta he punished his sister because you parents haven t done anything yet it s wrong he destroyed the dress but look at where he s coming from let him go to the dance make him do a few chores to make up for what he did but y all gotta do more than just take her phone racism is wrong she needs to learn that
yta an appropriate punishment would be making him pay back the cost of the dress a new one but i honestly wouldnt punish him i d explain how he did it was wrong but youre proud of him for sticking up for his friends against his raciat sister and yta for even allowing your daughter to still go to the dance obviously whatever you re doing with your racist daughter isn t changing her mind maybe take a look at yourself and how you contributed to raising a racist
yta while you mention some ways in which you re trying to address gianna s unacceptable behaviour they re not exactly punishing gianna had to say sorry and write a letter please she still gets a nice dress and gets to go to some banquet meanwhile your son is getting a more severe punishment for trashing the dress of his racist sister than she is getting for being racist
yta i don t understand how destroying a dress is coming with a bigger punishment than getting in trouble for racism twice what he did was wrong but the fact that your daughter is still getting to go to her dance and out with friends also seems like the wrong response i can understand why he is angry
yta your clearly not teaching her to not be racist if she got in trouble again writing an essay isn t going to teach her anything she did it to avoid further punishment but why is your daughter still attending a dance when her actions are vile your son was absolutely in the wrong to ruin the dress but i absolutely understand why he is angry
yta your son is just a kid and clearly frustrated with your daughter behavior although he shouldn t have ruin the dress why was your daughter going to the dance thing anyway it s like you keep awarding her for her actions while your son is upset and ended up acting up on his feelings
info why was your daughter allowed to attend the dance
look you have to punish gianna not just educate her yes it s good that you are trying to teach her a lesson but you see she keeps repeating it so start punishing her as for rykard what to say since you took the education path then start it on rykard too what he did to the dress is wrong
why was she allowed to go to the mall with her bf and friends
esh why does your son get big consequences for his bad behavior and your daughter have none your punishment of your daughter an apology and a two page essay obviously didn t work as she engaged in the same behavior immediately thereafter you didn t say how long she lost her phone for but if it was merely to investigate it doesn t sound like very long she s making racist jokes to the extent that she s getting in trouble for it at school and she still gets to go to her dance i m not surprised your son is angry and lashed out he sees his sister repeatedly insulting his friends and nobody does anything about it
yta for putting the onus on the poc to educate your racist child yta for not having consequences for the racist yta for punishing your son for not being a racist
yta for lack of a real punishment with real consequences for your daughter kids need to feel the consequences of their actions showing racism is a huge deal and shouldn t be taken lightly it sounds like her phone wasn t taken away for very long and then she was able to go to the mall to go dress shopping with her friends both kids need to be disciplined for their behaviors while what your son did was not okay he felt that he was giving her consequences for her behavior your daughter was acting racist more than once and hasn t learned anything
you say you are investigating where your daughter s racism comes from have you looked in the mirror bias usually starts at home whether it s overtly stated or not
yta so your son stands up against racism in his own home and is punished harshly but your daughter makes the racist jokes as a repeat offender and still gets to go to the dance beyond that she has an opportunity to learn about another culture through some amazing homemade cuisine and lighthearted conversation and she can t even be bothered to try and be a gracious hostess op i can t help but note that you keep referring to ryker s actions as his anger as if you think he doesn t have the right to be upset about his older sister and role model being so outrightly nasty about other races he is angry and rightfully so i d venture to say he may even feel somewhat betrayed that someone he loves and respects i e his older sister is being so rude and disgraceful yeah you should punish your son for wrecking the dress but there s a way bigger issue here
yta its deeply fucked up that his punishment for being angry about racism the wrong way is worse than her punishment for being racist
your actions indicate you are more upset by the destruction of property than a moral bankruptcy actual malice in character yta actions speak louder than words and you are punishing the act against stuff far more severely than the double act against petiole from someone who is older and who has already been through your re education attempt you might want to consider why and what your have going on underneath the hood too
your daughter a proven racist no consequences your son trashes your daughter s dress consequences what kind of parenting is happening here what message are you trying to send to your children yta
esh they both shouldn t be allowed to their respective dances but you need to explain why to them she s repeatedly engaged in racist behaviour while he lashed out in anger to get his way however justified he was allowing either of them to go sets a poor precedent imo
ahh more white people being less upset about racism and more upset about vandalism checks out yta
esh ryker for destroying property he should pay you parents the replacement cost imo gianna for being a racist and you and your spouse for not punishing gianna i understand you are trying to educate her but for this type of ongoing issue she needs education and consequences she doesn t need to go to that dance until she can show changed behavior you can t punish one child harshly for a single act and not impose consequences for a pattern of antisocial behavior
info gianna is being kept from her banquet for her racist behavior right
hang on a minute so she s racist on more than one occasion and your way to handle that is to educate but he retaliates to her racist ass and your way to handle that is to punish him in quite a severe way removing something that meant a lot to him you go ahead with this assuming the dance hasn t already happened and i can guarantee you ve just created a core memory for this kid that won t be forgotten nor forgiven it s your daughter you need to be focusing on tbh
sooo patient with the racist daughter but nuclear with the angry son yta a good punishment would be making him pay for the dress or something after u try and educate him like u did ur daughter who is a repeat affender all ur teaching him is either u don t mind what the daughter is doing that much or he is ur least favourite kid either way rethink
so you did not take away the dance or fun privileges from the one making the racist jokes but are punishing someone for standing up for their friend who is a victim of said racism guess we found out where her behaviour is coming from glad at least one of you is not racist yta
yta your daughter is a little racist monster i feel sorry for your son that you clearly favour your daughter and apparently support her racism just because you live in a white town is no damn excuse punish her properly and apologise to your son
esh your daughter is behaving very badly and doesn t seem to have been punished in any way your son and his friends vandalized her property and when he told you to shut up for his punishment he spent the rest of the evening in his room with friends and texting people kids need consequences your kids don t seem to face any yes you told him no dance good but why is your daughter allowed to attend why is she still allowed to hang out with these racist friends why is your son allowed to be so rude to you without losing his phone his social time with friends or much of anything at all
esh he and his friends were wrong to destroz the dress you were wrong in not punishing your daughter more harshly for the racism you daughter obviously was wrong by being racist so overall no one should go to any dances and you should really start educating your daughter some more on the topic and maybe figuring out where she gets the racism from friends other family members internet etc and try to act against those factors that corrupt her
so you don t punish the daughter who repeatedly gets called out for racist behavior but you do punish the son who admittedly in a half assed way attempts to defend his friend yta
so let s get this straight ur daughter the racist only gets a talking to but ur son who was pissed at her got banned from going to the school dance i wonder where she got it from
yta what he did was wrong and there should be consequence for him ruining the dress but why is she still able to go to this formal dance when she s had multiple racist incidents if he can t go to his dance i would expect her to not be able to go and to also be grounded or something else additionally given that her actions are pretty severe in comparison and need to be corrected as much as possible asap
so your daughter is outed multiple times for being racist and her only punishment is having her phone privileges taken away yta for that alone if he doesn t go to the dance neither should she stop coddling your racist spawn
info what were the jokes you have punished her and have tried educating her to an extent taking away her phone making her write an apology and an essay and forcing her to engage with the culture when she doesn t want to i however don t know if you ve done enough or too little after all racist joke can mean a lot of things in 6th grade i was in choir when singing a christmas song i sang the lyric gay like how chang said it in community i had a stern talking to by the teacher i feel like that was enough if i d instead goose stepped and held up two fingers like a hitler stache when singing a hanukkah song a larger punishment would be needed if i d been calling people racial slurs an even larger punishment would be warranted if your punishment for her fit then nta if it didn t then eta except possibly the ryker depending on just how terrible what she said was
esh your daughter needs to be educated and have consequences for her racist behavior your son needs to learn that he is not the one to set those consequences why didn t you send those boys home as soon as you realized what they did to the dress instead you allowed him to tell you to shut up and spend the rest of the night in his room with the rest of the vandals perhaps you should all be in counseling before your whole household ends up a bunch of racists and or bullies
esh daughter for her racism son for his destruction of the dress two wrongs don t make a right you for taking away his dance but not your obviously racist daughter s they are both acting horribly i d say her punishment should be more severe in fact if they act like this where have you been until now this behavior doesn t happen overnight
yta so your daughter makes racist remarks twice that you know of and she still gets to o to the dance but your son doesn t for doing something way less worse look both your kids are behaving badly but in my mind racist remarks are way worse than destroyed property and at least your son was coming from a good place even if his actions were very misguided
yta at this rate we re going to see a viral video of your daughter being racist and then kicked out of college did your son do something bad yes and i get why he did it did your daughter do something worse yes twice and all you ve done is make her write a paper say sorry and taken her phone hell no she shouldn t get to go to the dance at all and your son should only have to say sorry for ruining the dress since that s the first punishment you give out
so the racist doesn t get punished and you re wondering why your child is racist
something about the consequences for these kids isnt going right the daughter has not changed her behaviour whatsoever the son apparently thinks its oke to destroy other peoples property and why on earth are both kids hanging out with their friends i would have at least called the parents of the sons friends to come pick them up or drive then home not hang out all night makes me wonder if you even talked to the parents of what these kids did
info why is your son immediately punished for one offence and your daughter barely punished at all for more than one offence
i feel like this is an esh ryker was wrong for destroying the dress because it wasn t his to ruin point blank he didn t pick it out pay for it nor would he be the one wearing it to the event his punishment is valid to me however destroying the dress is a micro problem compared to your daughter s continuous racism just talking about it clearly isn t working and actual punishments are deserved for her i don t think she should be going to her dance going out with friends or spending time with her boyfriend if she s going to continue being a racist tbh if you don t deal with this now someone else probably will later and i guarantee it won t be pretty but it will probably be deserved
yta your son gets punished for taking a stand against racism a fairly deserved prank your racist daughter gets to do whatever bro you are fucking up your daughter needs all privileges at the very least restricted until she can act like a fucking human being your son deserves a trip to the ice cream parlor if you do not make this right you may lose your son forever doom your daughter to a life as an entitled trumper do better
esh everyone sucks here your daughter for her bullshit racism your son for his vandalism and honestly you it is not your son s friend s responsibility to be a cultural prop so your daughter isn t an asshole
nta for the punishment but yta for still letting the daughter go to hers or hang out with friends she should be grounded for sure and not allowed to hang out with these people after
what is worse racism or vandalism so your daughter is allowed to go to a dance with people there even though her behavior is hurtful to actual people but your son isn t allowed to go to a dance because he destroyed a thing parenting is hard but it doesn t sound like the punishments fit the crimes yta i find it deeply concerning that both of your kids seem vulnerable to their peer group s influence and go along with the group mentality
yta you went through the motions of racism is bad mmmkay i mean even your racism response was kind of racist let s talk about diverse athletes really but you never gave your daughter any concrete lasting consequence to her repeated offenses in fact you don t even blame her for her own actions you took her phone to investigate where these ideas were coming from they are coming from her own mind clearly and her parents are not interested in punishing beyond performative essays for teachers your son whose close friend is directly harmed by her racism reacted to his sister s racism by destroying something that truly mattered to her the dance dress he was severely punished for his first offense you already taught your son that standing up to racists is wrong will you teach your daughter that her racism has no place in your family or will you buy her a new dress and make her write an essay about brown people
info what exactly was your daughter caught doing
so according to your profile you were trying to post an update we all wanna know if the daughter actually got a punishment for her awful behavior please post in comments about what you guys are doing moving forward hopefully it s my son can go to his dance and my daughters dress will not be replaced she has to stay home and pay for her actions
the update shows you ve definitely learned a lesson honestly when i was reading the original post i was horrified that she was out dress shopping with her racist friends the same day she was busted for using racist slurs for the second time i hope your daughter learns something but unless her friends are getting a similar lesson i doubt it ps her school chromebook use needs to be supervised nta because of the update
yta and the fact you even asked is very telling it seems like you believe that ruining clothing is worse than being a racist i also love how you used that you live in a white town to defend the fact that you haven t taught her anything there s this thing called the internet and history you may want to look into both as there s numerous events that are directly connected to racism even today s climate in america is race related what your son did was bad but the fact that your daughter gets literally no punishment whatsoever shows why she think racism is acceptable not sure where you live but there s also museums with tours that will help you get knowledge on specific horrific events in the name of racism
so punishing your son but not the daughter who started all of it what kind of parenting is that
the child who deserves punishment is your daughter tolerating racism from her in any form is absolutely inexcusable and you ve given her multiple opportunities to resolve her behavior you need to get your daughter some help and let your son go to his dance
neither should go to their dances both need to be home and away from friends both should be grounded from everything both fell into peer pressure esh
yta racism is worse than ruining a dress keep your racist daughter home from her dance let your justifiably pissed off son go to his and use the money you would have spent on a new dress to buy a gift basket for your son s friend s family for putting up with you and your awful daughter
info why is your daughter allowed to go to her dance i get that destroying the dress was wrong but why did you even get her one
wait the rascist girl gets to go to the dance and get a new dress but the kid who stood uo for his friends albeit in the wrong way gets punished i feel like thats not quite right
yta just to be clear your daughter who is old enough to understand why her actions are wrong made racist comments made it obvious she didn t feel any remorse by how little she cared about her education made more racist comments still gets to go out with friends and gets to go to her dance still your son who is also old enough to understand why his actions are wrong took offense to racism retaliated against his racist sister which imo makes it worse because if your own family does racist things and you don t stand up i m a firm believer that you are a closet racist was not given any education about his actions and was only handed a punishment even though he watched his sister do something arguably worse and she basically got a slap on the wrist is now not allowed to go to his dance for sticking it to a racist are you upset your daughter said something racist or are you upset your daughter got caught being a racist because based on how you handled these two situations you your husband and at least that one daughter are racists and your little education stunt you pulled was your way of making yourselves feel better about the fact that you re not openly racist but you all sound like some closet racists except your son freeryker
yta good on you for making her learn about other cultures but you didn t follow through in any meaningful way what punishment did she get for being racist at dinner why is a 3rd infraction met with we looked at her phone and not we made her stay home and not be around the friends encouraging racism trashing her dress sucks but why is she allowed to go to the dance and banquet after getting in trouble times when her brother is banned from it for lashing out in frustration at your lack of action many super white areas have anti racist groups maybe at least have her talk to some people in them and stop letting her hang out with the people who are likely encouraging the racism you said she got in trouble with her peers
yta gianna should not go to the dance while ryker has a good reason to be upset one that should be validated that s not an excuse to ruin something of gianna s i believe not allowing him to go to the dance for ruining a dress isn t fair to him especially when gianna is the one who has been making racist comments as for gianna she should not be allowed to go to the dance at all she seems to be unbothered by the repercussions of her racist comments
racism is taught your daughter too she has been a bad human and daughter the excuse trying to teach in a white town is an excuse you aren t being a good parent you say in other comments you don t like favoritism yet you won t ban your daughter from the dance you are like ever parent when i was in school you let your little racist say things till something happens then oh no my baby then everyone else is the bad guy or guys in this case you aren t a good human either just stop and think about the life you have lived then let you son go to the dance
yta your daughter has been making racist remarks repeatedly and yet you never even thought about not letting her go to the dance you son has been behaving thousand times better than her trying to come up with ideas for her to see her ah ways i m not saying what he did was right but he was probably feeling frustrated and angry and how his sister kept acting i say he still deserves to go to the dance what he did is nothing compared to what your daughter is doing
you mentioned you have kids but only talk about the how do your other children feel about her behavior do they think it s funny do they think it s rude and uncalled for regarding her racism do they feel what your son did was justified do they participate in the racism she learned this from more then just friends and her boyfriend and this so called all white town you live in you seem to think your daughters actions are harmless i wonder how the other kids take that
weighing in late after the edits and i have one simple question why are you focusing on anger management with your son at all at this point he expressed his anger multiple times in more productive ways and you clearly failed to provide the support and outlet that was required because you failed to take his very justified anger seriously your son is not a problem and frankly it s another symptom of your over identification with white values and white culture that you re framing this as an anger management issue you need to expand beyond white niceness and quickly if you want to prevent raising more kids like your daughter the problem is solidly your daughter which extends back to you as white parents you utterly failed at some point to give this issue the weight it deserved all along and now you re reaping the consequences of that neglect these types of posts all across reddit are maddening it s always the same story white parents did nothing and now their child is a raging racist misogynist some other flavor of bigot and wringing hands poor me as the parent how could this happen to me i m such a nice good white person ally you need to have a serious sit down and talk amongst yourselves as parents figure out what the hell you missed and do better moving forward reading books on racism and writing up book reports is eye rollingly naive and won t change a thing it s such a white liberal approach to social justice get a grip and you had better do it soon because approaching this from your own whiteness is not going to change a damn thing
yta you are encouraging your daughter s racism i would even go as far as to say you are racist because why are you punishing the victim of racism yet you are praising the racist
yta and all of your kids are too the fact that your son thought it was okay to trash his sister s dress is bad very very bad he stuck up for his friend which is great but that s not the way to do it he at least owes you the cost of the dress the fact that your daughters are racist brat is well i could say a lot but i ll just say that this is one of the worst traits anybody could ever have all of this still makes you the ah no one should be going to any dance that should have been taken away from her the minute you found out she was being racist again also the fact that she s done this twice shows me that whatever you did the first time obviously wasn t a real punishment you need to take this very seriously with both children
yta your response to the first instance of racist behaviour wasn t too bad the second time however it doesn t sound like there were any meaningful consequences this is a very serious problem that needs to be dealt with and you aren t doing anything as for your son it s not a terribly mature way to handle conflict but given his age it s not surprising should there be some consequences for him possibly but i d argue not sure he destroyed property but he didn t do anything unethical it s similar to how acts of civil disobedience can be illegal yet completely ethical he saw that there was a serious problem that wasn t being addressed and took action it might lead to problems down the line so at a minimum a conversation is necessary that said he has a good moral compass injustices persist when good people stand by and do nothing i m appalled that you seem to think destruction of property is worse than racism he did it in service of a much larger goal she s being malicious and needs to be prevented from causing more harm before the patterns of behaviour become more ingrained of everyone involved in this situation he s by far the most moral
yta for naming your kid ryker oh and raising the next mtg
sounds like your son is getting a more severe punishment for the dress than your daughter has gotten for becoming a racist yta make him do chores to pay for the dress but don t let the racist out in public while you keep the kid insisting on tolerance at home
racists raising racists and punishing the non racist sounds about what i d expect yta and frankly i feel terrible for your son s friend for having to spend time with racists
yta gianna most definitely should not be going to a dance you should have returned her dress the second you saw her continually being racist ryker didnt handle things well but neither are you
i would say esh imo first off it s your daughter being a racist repeatedly secondly your son for ruining her dress i understand where he s coming from but ruining a dress wouldn t do a thing imo and lastly it s you and your husband if your son is getting punished for destroying a dress then your daughter should be getting punished for being a racist they both did something wrong and if one couldn t go to the school dance then it s only fair for the other racist one to not go either you and your husband as their parents need to teach them to do better
so let me get this straight you re punishing your son for standing up for his friend and not punishing the racist daughter seriously an apology to the teacher and an essay is nowhere near enough who has repeatedly mocked the friend in questions culture yeah yta this is why your daughter keeps doing it because you re backing her up
well not exactly hard to see who your favorite child is yta was what ryker did acceptable no of course not he s also a year old kid who watched his older sister make racist jokes about the culture of a close friend of his why did you just take away your daughter s phone after she and her friends repeatedly made racist jokes but when your son acts out you say he can t go to the dance either punish them both or punish neither
you re such a pathetic mom you say you don t want your daughter to be racist yet there s been no effective punishment and you re also like i m gonna punish my son for his atrocious behavior towards his racist sister it does not seem like you re taking your daughters racism seriously with the fact you won t haven t punish ed her and then you punish your son who s stood up to discrimination made by his own blood i think that s pretty telling of where your daughter got her racist attitude from _  _
yta how about neither of them goes to the dance
yta you punish him more severely that the daughter who has gotten in trouble for being racist multiple times shame on you
yta for not clamping down on the blatant racism the first time oh sweetie we know what you did was wrong but it wasn t as wrong as your brother and his friends getting upset at your punishment points to slytherin
yta
i m white but my fianc and son aren t it s disgusting that another parent wouldn t see a huge issue with their daughter being a racist she shouldn t get to hang out with other racists also racists turn into domestic terrorists it s something that needs to be dealt with swiftly your son shouldn t have destroyed his sisters dress but maybe he did it because you refused to punish her yourself you likely could have prevented a lot of this by properly punishing your daughter yta
yta so you re punishing the kid actively fighting racism but not the racist and we wonder what s going wrong with the world today
note to everyone op posted an update which shows that they ve taken some pretty decisive steps to try to help ryker and educate gianna i don t know how effective it ll be with gianna but op absolutely deserves credit for taking in everything that s been shared in almost comments and trying to ameliorate the situation big props for moving in the right direction hello i first want to thank everyone for the advice yesterday was insane processing just how many comments i got and also talking to family including my siblings parents and in laws about where to go from here i get it my husband and i were in the wrong we first talked to ryker he told us how mad he was at gianna he told us about how some girls in his middle school have been racist towards his friend so he wanted to protect him he told us him and his friends made the plot together bc they felt like she could hurt someone if she didn t face backlash we asked him if he regretted his decision purely to see his mood he immediately said no we did go over anger management though we then talked to gianna and things went much worse than we expected she defended herself and used much worse language than what she got in trouble at school for she used slurs and called ryker a crybaby my family and my husband s family all live close to us we decided to have dinner with my siblings parents and in laws we asked for advice discussed everything and had them question gianna and ryker some more again gianna expressed much worse sentiments than we could have ever imagined ryker was more put together and went into depth about his feelings after our families had left my husband and i went in our bedroom to discuss what punishments would be we first spoke to ryker we told him he could go to the dance and then discussed the money with him we decided to not make him pay for financial damages to us but we asked him how he felt if he bought something with his hard earned money from gold caddying he eventually said he understood our initial anger after that thought experiment off the recommendations of my brother we also suggested looking into how he could channel his desire for social justice into sports the most important thing in ryker s life besides his friends we then talked to gianna we told her she would not be attending the junior banquet and told her she would have to read and write a report on books from a list of books on racism some commentators have made recommendations and we will look into them she has also lost all of her devices except her school chromebook until further notice we also apologized to ryker for holding him to higher standards simply because he s the high achiever of the family he also mentioned the fact we don t give him enough attention because of that we are looking into different therapies such as family therapy or individual therapy for gianna possibly ryker and even our other kids
yta your daughter continued to make racist comments after being both educated and disciplined that s now a clear active choice and should be handled as such there s no more leniency or benefit of doubt she s already been educated an investigation into her phone shouldn t take a week you re not law enforcement waiting for a report from your forensics team you should have searched it immediately and figured out who she s following and what she s saying to friends in her texts if this is difficult because she s hidden her activity then that should also be dealt with at sixteen after multiple times breaking trust she doesn t have privacy over her phone she shouldn t just lose her phone she shouldn t be at the mall with friends a week after choosing to spread racism she shouldn t be with her friends period let alone having fun at the mall she needs to earn that privilege back and you need to a tighter rein on who she is allowed to hang out with your son s comments about his coach were a blatant attempt at telling you that you weren t doing enough he was telling you how his coach someone he trusts to handle situations would deal with this instead of picking up that your son was telling you your parenting was bad you asked him about his favorite athletes as if you were indulging him this comes across as very patronizing and a superficial way to talk about racism it also doesn t address your son s actual concern that you needed to do more to discipline your daughter your son is angry because not only is racism wrong in general but it s affecting someone he cares about by allowing your daughter to get away with a slap on the wrist you were conveying to your son that who he cares about aren t worth protecting his friend and his friend s family were willing to visit you at your home and do the heavy lifting to help your daughter your son has likely seen how carrying that emotional burden affected his friend to then see that his sister not only spat in the face of that gesture but that you were going to allow her to do so must have been devastating to him your son shouldn t have destroyed the dress however i understand his feeling that if no one else was going to do something that he had to take on that role himself this situation is what happens when children feel the need to solve adult problems you need to apologize to your son you need to teach your daughter the full consequences of her decisions and make clear what the consequences will be in the future if she continues to make bad choices you need to put in the effort to weed out the negative influences in your daughter s life including within her in person friend group if you don t have enough information about her friends to do that you need to get it fast only after that should you talk to your son about the consequences to his behavior show him you heard the message he was trying to send and are actively doing something about it after that is made clear you can work with him on how to process his frustration and anger better as well as give him consequences for his own choice to destroy the dress
esh i wouldnt let any pf them to go to the ball
yta for not yanking the dance away from your racist daughter and not imposing consequences for her behavior ryker destroying property isn t okay either and deserves consequences but you ve been letting your faucet off scott free and i see why he d be pissed at that
yta for not punishing your daughter with not allowing her to go to the dance you re okay with being racist twice what your son did is misguided but well intended at least yes he should be punished for destroying property but it tells a lot about you and your priorities that you punish him heavier than his sister when she committed a greater offense
yta for still allowing gianna to go to the dance after repeated issues and punishing ryker after one instance what did you just teach your kids it s okay to be repeatedly racist but it s not okay to ruin things how about both those things are wrong
yta you re raising a loud and proud racist aren t you so pleased with yourself her consequences for a teacher teaching out and telling you your child s a racist oh she ll just write and apology letter she s then caught being racist again so you take her phone but not as punishment but to see where all this hate is coming from because it couldn t be your precious angels fault her dress should have been returned long before this and she should have been grounded from the dance that would actually be you parenting instead you re punishing the actual good kid and making excuses for her racism growing up in a white town doesn t excuse her or your racism if you re this cool with your daughters blatant racism and excuse it bc your white in a white town chances her racism comes from you
yta girl gets in trouble for racist remarks twice and is then at the mall wtf where are the consequences for her actions so your son retaliates because you re not doing anything yta yta yta parent your kids
yta i m totally against destroying something it s a waste of money and it s unkind but gianna was racist twice that you know of and she is allowed to go but he isn t she s a racist this isn t a one of dumb kid thing she s racist and has been caught twice this is a bigger issue than a torn dress
i can smell the favoritism yta

ytaish every time i ve been asked to be a bride s maid i have excepted with the understanding that i ll be wearing a dress that i most likely will never wear again it s like the ugly christmas sweater
info what do you mean she spent your entire childhood telling you you looked bad in pastels did she bring it up every morning over breakfast unprompted or did she give an opinion when asked for it and since blue is your favorite color do you actually never wear pastel blue currently esh this is all just so incredibly childish
this is difficult to read but typically brides pick out the color for the bridesmaid dresses so yta also moh typically has a lot of responsibility so having to pick between you or her best friend and deciding on both is not insulting you wrote that you are really busy and the moh are supposed to plan the bridal shower and bachelorette party there are certainly other things you could say no to like event planning or being in the bridal party at all but if you are in the bridal party the reality is that the bride gets to dress you and even the best bridesmaid s outfits are a bit atrocious
ok so your sister should have gotten organized about who was going to be moh and has handled some things badly from the sounds of it but you re part of the bridal party which means you dress the way she says you dress or you leave the bridal party its not your wedding its hers and if she wants her bridal party in pastels you can certainly voice your opinion but she has the final say ywbta to stay part of the party without conforming to the color scheme she decides on it would make you stand out from the group at a time when you should not be the focus of attention and it would take away from your sister s experience of her wedding if she s dead set on pastels and you re dead set on not wearing them then you need to withdraw from the bridal party
yta don t be petty over something like this you can tolerate wearing colors you don t like for one day
yta you agree to be a bridesmaid you wear whatever the bride picks that s just a general understood rule if you don t want to wear the color she picked the drop out otherwise suck it up
esh she sounds exhausting you re in the wedding party though and that is the group of people the bride actually gets to tell what to wear go with it or don t be a bridesmaid or co moh and let her plan her own wedding
esh brides pick out the dress and colors that s just how it is you can step down from moh if you feel that strongly about it she does sound like a pita to work with though for sure
ywbta if you don t oblige the color scheme i would personally ignore the pastel request and find some different blues that compliment the bridesmaids and bride and post them in the group chat for everyone s opinion that way you can get some people in your corner and it s not solely her input although she will have veto power some agreement in the group may cause her to ignore her instinct to bully shoot your ideas down i would just keep trying different options you could also wait until late evening to send the options catch them when they are tired and wear them down with options lol
yta if you are a member of her wedding party then this is actually the one time she is entitled to tell you what to wear either refuse to be in the wedding party or wear what she picks
nta and i m sorry to say she does sound like a bridezilla bully i don t know where this notion comes to brides that the world will bend over and accommodate in their own expense their every whim you already provided two possible dresses within the color palette she agreed on and she shot you down she also refused to buy the dress i think she made you a co moh so she can use you as the wedding planner and assign tasks to you i d stand my ground on the blue shade i want if she refuses to accommodate or to pay it s her less plus she knows you don t like pastels based on her earlier opinion which by the way could be biased
nta i would step down from the wedding planning and party completely
listen up let me lay it down this is a story that s going around a sister s wedding a color scheme but one bridesmaid says it s not her dream she s an event coordinator working hard but her sister s demands hit her like a shard first it s the moh then the dress and now she s feeling quite distressed her sister s been pushing crossing the line trying to control every single design and when she says no to a pastel hue her sister says wear it or i ll have to sue but let s be real that s an exaggeration a sisterly bond is worth preservation but boundaries are important too and sometimes you gotta say i m through so aita what do you think should she wear the pastel or take a step back from the brink it s up to her to decide her fate but in the end family should appreciate
nta your sis sounds like a controlling b h fight for your boundaries fight fight fight
automod thanks for posting this comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed this comment is not accusing you of copying anything read this https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before contacting the mod team https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2famitheasshole)*** throwaway account my 20f sister s 22f wedding is in august naturally she wants everything her way for her wedding and of course i m understanding of this however she has pushed the boundaries of many of our family members regarding her wedding firstly she told my grandparents that the wedding would be taking place at their property without formally asking no big deal my grandparents obliged but when it comes to planning she has thrown nearly all the responsibility to me i m an event coordinator for work currently i should note she has graduated from undergrad while i am still working on my degrees and i am also working full time i have set boundaries on what i am willing to work on with her but it is not my responsibility to plan her entire wedding she kept pushing the envelope and i ve held firm with my word on what i m willing to work on but i may have come to the realization that i may not want to be her maid of honor for context after getting engaged she spent the whole time telling me that i would no longer be her moh but her best friend would be instead i told her that was fine but i didn t understand why she kept having to tell me that i wouldn t be her moh several weeks later she sent out the invites for the bridesmaids i received a letter from her asking to be her moh i facetimed her and accepted but let me know that her best friend would also be a moh odd but whatever later she created a groupchat of all the bridesmaids there are of us showing us the color palette for the dresses and her vision i was under the impression that i would be wearing an orange pink color but then she later told me i was permitted to wear blue my favorite color to stand out from the rest of the bridesmaids she then asked me to send dress ideas to the groupchat i sent two photos of two different dresses of the same color a dusty yet summery blue she shot them down she then told me i was not allowed to wear that color because it was too winter y and told me i need to wear a pastel blue i should note this wouldn t have bothered me if it weren t for the fact she spent our entire childhood telling me how awful i look in the colors that suit her especially pastels i told her i would not be wearing any pastel color and if she really wants me to then she can pay for the dress she then refused and said too bad she s going to wear whatever i want her to when another member of the chat tried to diffuse the situation she has a knack for trying to bully me into doing what she wants and has done so for our entire lives so i don t know if i m reading too much into the situation or should i just comply to keep her from blowing a fuse so aita tldr sister with a habit of not respecting boundaries wants me to wear a pastel dress at her wedding after spending our childhood telling me how awful i look in them i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r amitheasshole if you have any questions or concerns
nta i would be done irs her wedding she needs to plan and arrange it or pay you for your expertise for the bridal party bridesmaids wtf is she so indecisive she wants everyone in her wedding or is it so large think indian multi day wedding we have all read about that she needs that many attendants
i d usually say you are indeed t a because weddings and wedding parties kind of include this stuff but in this case it s different the bride has overstepped from day you are not the only one here being disrespected who on earth can possibly think that it s alright to inform someone that you re using their place as a venue that someone who works in the event industry will work for free in this case that she is entitled to everything she desires because she s related to those people as long as you step down from the wedding party and send an invoice for your work you re nta i kind of suspect the real issue is not the dress here the dress is just the straw that broke the camel s back after years of little not so little things yeah the whole dress issue is very immature but that s not the point the point is she s disrespecting everyone with the we re family and it s my special day excuses tm and that you are tired of her microagressions
i agree that it s childish and i ve thought that quarrels like this were of the past but for context my sister and i being close in age were constantly compared and pitted against each other with the majority of people regarding me as the prettier sister i absolutely do not agree with this as i see the detriments it causes to both parties of the retort my sister made it a habit to put me down and make remarks about my physical appearance from what i wore to my actual body in order to make me feel less than her to answer a potential question yes she knows what she s doing and yes she does it deliberately
weddings are one of those times when a person is allowed to be a bit of a tyrant the idea is that you re only going to do this once hopefully and it s a huge and inevitably expensive life milestone the people getting married have a right to have the experience they want
i should probably clarify that it s not necessarily about the dress it s about respect she s known for pushing the envelope regarding people s boundaries and blatantly disrespecting them she has heaved this responsibility upon me and claims i m being a bad sister by reinforcing my boundaries regarding the workload the dress situation was the tipping point i think i would have complied if she approached the situation differently but by bragging to the other bridesmaids that i ll fold under the weight of her thumb is what caused me to snap i understand that it s her wedding and it s her day but she s trampling over everyone to get where she wants to be
as a lover of poetry i m impressed
you didn t answer the question
you don t have to be in the wedding party for someone you obviously don t even like but if you say yes to being in the wedding then you have to wear the colors
then you need to withdraw from the bridal party being part of it comes with the responsibility to help the bride realize her vision for the wedding even if you disagree with it
stand by your boundaries withdraw from helping it sounds like you have a lot on your plate and your relationship with your sister is straining expect to be hounded for stepping down but stand your ground you are not an object to be used i don t think that you are the asshole it sounds like you are overwhelmed and instead of your sisters wedding being a celebration it s an obligation

nta i understand she s your sister but she hasn t been worried about hurting yours or your fianc s feelings so why are you concerned about hurting hers you ve made your feelings on her comments and attitude known and she s brushed you off so she clearly doesn t care about how her actions are impacting you and your fianc if you are really torn on what to do i would have one final conversation with her about this and let her know that you are thinking of not inviting her to your wedding because of her actions if she still brushes you off then you have your answer
ywnbta i think your fiance has a right to enjoy his wedding day without the rude woman who insults him every time she sees him this is a celebration and both of you deserve people there who will join in your happiness not deliberately ruin it if you need to explain the lack of an invitation just say on abc occasion you treated my fiance this way and on def occasion you did such and such we weren t going to risk another scene by inviting you she s an adult and can handle the consequences of being left out
op stand your ground she s made the decision to not accept your fiance so why would you want any drama at your wedding and there s no need to waste your energy any further the family may try to force the issue and they can have the choice to either come drama free or not and remind them of it it s your special day and keep it that way because you ll only have one shot at it
nta she doesn t have to like your fiance if she doesn t want to you don t have to invite her if you don t want to though not inviting her will definitely put an end to a good relationship with your sister you are definitely not an ah for standing up for your fiance and telling your sister you only want people there who like him
nta she s messing up your relationship with her by being cruel to your fiance
nta it s your wedding and if she can t be nice to her fbil then why invite her you think she s gonna cause drama at your wedding tbh you need to sit her down with your parents and get to the bottom of why she dislikes your fiance so much and tells her that if she can t be nice she won t be invited a part of me wants to say she is jealous is she older than you is she single if yes to both or being single then she may be jealous that you are getting married especially if she s older
ywnbta you re worried about hurting her feelings but she clearly doesn t care about yours a wedding is to celebrate a marriage why would she want to be there if she doesn t like the person you re marrying talk to her and tell her exactly why she s not invited my guess is she ll cry and cause drama not because she wants to be there but because of what people will think if she s not
ywnbta if she has made it clear from the beginning that she doesn t like him and has been openly rude why would she want to be there anyway if i were in your position i wouldn t want her there either
nta if her behavior rubbed  the wrong way don t invite her
nta she s right that she doesn t have to like him she s wrong that she can treat him however she wants if she can t understand why you wouldn t want that at your wedding that s on her
nta it sounds like she doesn t support your relationship at all but it also sounds like you actually do want her there if she will behave if you have a good relationship with her and think you can trust her maybe talk to her openly about it and say you want her in the wedding but tell her your concerns and make it a caveat
ywnbta she does not have to like him but she needs to behave decently and respectful towards him which she does not do by insulting him you should tell her before the wedding that you are not inviting her and explain why but not let yourself be pulled into a discussion about this you could maybe let her come if she apologizes and realizes her behaviour is wrong but most importantly only if that is enough for both of you to feel comfortable to invite her
nta but talk to her before sending out the invitations tell her exactly why you re worried and considering not to invite her then you can base your decision on her reaction and she doesn t get blindsided if you just don t invite her without communicating about it you ll just create even more drama in advance and possibly have other family members feel like they need to pick sides
nta
she doesn t have to like him is she doesn t want to and you don t have to invite her if you don t want to i wouldn t want to be around anyone who can t treat my partner with respect family or not nta if she cares about you she would not treat him like that why would you want her there she doesn t like the person you are marrying
ywnbta your husband to be deserves to not have to put up with someone who is consistently rude to him at his wedding
your sister is absolutely right she doesn t have to like him if she doesn t want to likewise you don t have to invite her to your wedding if you don t want to actions consequences it doesn t matter who she is if someone is being rude and spiteful to your partner they have no right to expect an invite to the celebration of your marriage to that partner nta at all
nta why would you invite someone to your wedding who isn t happy for you why should your husband have so eone at his wedding that hates him
nta but why are you willing to risk irreparable damage to your marriage by continuing to be around cater to someone who openly hates him
info what aren t you telling yourself i say yourself because put plainly people don t just exhibit this level of hatred for no reason either she s racist and you chose not to see it something happened and you choose to perceive it differently or you view your fiance through a rose lens and chose to ignore anything that runs contrary to that point is your sister has a reason that s probably justifiable to her that you may be wilfully having blinders on to
you would nbta but be ready to end your relationship with your sister if you don t invite her
info can you be a bit more specific on the things your sister does
info how old is this sister behavoir sounds like she is a pre teen teen how long have you and fiance been together that sister hasn t come around
in my medical opinion you need to invite her then the onus is on her to attend if she does attend and acts up she will look bad if she doesn t show up she will look bad by inviting her you will vindicate your relationship best case scenario she shows up and everything goes smooth but either way you need to invite her or it will be one more piece of resentment in her boogyman bag

nta she s ruining her relationship with you by being rude to your fianc stand your grond and let your fianc have a wedding day without snide comments from your sister it won t be a happy day for you if you have to deal with someone destroying your happiness
the fact that you and your family allow her to disrespect your fiance is worst that the no invitation would she insult your children too or him in front of his children unless there s a real motive behind this animosity your sister is the ah and you can keep the relationship as it is now
you will not irreparably damage your relationship by not inviting her you will not invite her because your relationship has been irreparably damaged by her actions nta
but she just brushes me off and says that she doesn t have to like him if she doesn t want to this is a celebration of your union she has no place in celebrating someone se doesn t like or respect joining your family she doesn t have to attend if you don t want her to her feelings are detrimental to your celebration if she kicks up a fuss tell her you aren t going to invite someone to celebrate your wedding who doesn t want to like your husband nta at all
nta why be afraid to hurt her feelings when she is hurting your fiancs feelings every time she insults him having her there will be bad and she will try and ruin your big day so tell all your family she is not invited and that if they side with her then your sorry they wont be there either
so youre worried about your relationship with your sister and not your relationsihp with your husband that shes offended since you guys got together lol
ywnbta she would have only herself to blame
nta she s right she doesn t have to like him if she doesn t want to but that doesn t mean there aren t going to be consequences for that such as not being invited to your wedding or not having a close relationship with you and your new family going forward
nta and i was actually in a very similar situation if you replace fianc with ex because we re not together anymore we loved each other madly but my sister hated him and absolutely refused to meet him halfway both he and i would ask that she hear him out and she wouldn t even dignify us with an answer about meeting with him and she refused to even explain why she hated him to me i love my sister to pieces but this is one thing i ve never truly moved past even if i m not with said ex anymore i m really sorry to hear you re going through this my one bit of advice is that you tell your sister beforehand exactly why she isn t invited there s no point in leaving her to draw conclusions about why she didn t get an invite or worse she assumes she didn t get one because she didn t need one and shows up expecting to be let in it may also be a wake up call for her and give her some incentive to start mending things with your fianc best of luck
nta she can t control herself she does not belong at your wedding to insult you future husband she doesn t get a pass because she is your sister if she can t say anything nice then don t say anything at all
your marriage may be irreparably damaged if you do invite her now is the time for you to stand up for your husband or don t have her around him you mentioned she s family so will be your husband this does not sound like a good start for your marriage i hope you can work through it
nta but who cares if you hurt her feelings when she consistently hurts you and your fiance your fiance is family now too and he deserves to be treated decently by your family
invite her keep an eye on her and then kick her out for mean comments best of both worlds
ywnbta do your sister and fiance have a background that is causing her to dislike and disrespect him is this how she always acts towards your romantic partners is she in a relationship herself and unhappy in it i m trying to understand why she is being rude and why you re ok with it if she can t be nice or quiet then she needs not be invited to the wedding if that causes her to go lc with you so be it her attitude as described in your post doesn t warrant the company of civilized people
nta its your wedding if she belittles your husband then she doesnt get to come it doesnt matter that she is your sister who wants that type if toxicity at their wedding
nta but now that we re getting married i feel like i can t just ignore her behavior anymore this was your mistake it doesn t matter wether you re getting married or not stop letting her get away with this shit you should have nipped this in the bud the first time make it clear that if her behavior doesn t change it s not just the wedding she won t get invited to
nta she ll ruin your day by being ugly to you both can t you see that she doesn t care about your feelings don t let guilt manipulate you into inviting her don t discuss it with anyone just don t invite her and when you start getting calls from her flying monkeys just tell them you don t know what you re talking about and change the subject don t allow anyone or anything to ruin your day
nta why would she be upset about not going to your wedding if she hates your fianc i don t care if she was a sister or not anyone treating my fianc that way would not have been invited to my wedding celebration at all with her actions would you invite her if she weren t your sister if the answer is no why does being your sister change anything she is still being disrespectful of your fianc and by association you
ywnbta i would also argue that if you let come then ywbta this woman has been rude and insulting to your fianc for years for no reason why should that same woman be part of what should be the happiest day of his life op your sister is rude and toxic and idk why you keep her in your life tbh
and i don t want to hurt her feelings by not inviting her i also worry that our relationship will be irreparably damaged if i don t include her in my wedding op how healthy is your relationship if she spends the rest of your lives disparaging your husband and undermining your marriage nta dump her
too late for that
i think it s time for op to sit down with the sister and say i know you ve said you don t have to like him if you don t want to and that s true but while you don t have to like him i need you to at least be polite and courteous to him if you can t agree to that i can t commit to having you at my wedding
i genuinely un ironically think that it s super sweet that you believe this but in my experience you re dead wrong people hate others for no reason i e hate that is unprovoked or not obviously caused by any form of blanket prejudice all the damn time it s just part of human nature see elementary school bullying some adults are just grade school bullies that never grew up plenty of rationalizations will come later if they re confronted but they re just that rationalizations some people simply need someone to hate someone to put down someone to act as their social emotional punching bag and they ll choose whoever they think is the safest option to fill that role now it s entirely possible that this isn t the case with op s sister but i wouldn t rule it out altogether
i strongly disagree she ll make their happy day a bad day you really think the sister will care about ruining it she already ruined their relationship with her comments no need to let the behavior continue if op doesn t invite her the sister will know that such comments aren t tolerated and she might stop the comments
if she does attend and acts up she will look bad that s fine if the occasion is just a family dinner or something but it s not worth playing this sort of game with one s wedding
doing all of this in front of your or her potential children nta

if she is happy to take the train and doesn t see an issue with it why don t you drive the car there instead and she can take the train days beforehand problem solved
what if you compromise and take the train days later but instead of the bus she drives down to get you near her parents house and then you guys drive back she ll still get the extra time with her family that she s looking forward to and then it will still only be hours for you if maybe someone else in the family comes with her she ll have someone to talk to fit the hours down as well and then they can switch off driving too so they only have to drive hours each instead of her having to drive or you driving after being on a train for hours edit to say nah she s missing her family and doesn t want to miss out on more time with them and you re feeling hurt by the situation but i don t think it s anything to do with a lack of love for you or thinking less of you she may just not have realized how far it would make it when she originally suggested it and she very well might be willing to do that for you were the roles reversed so she may not see a problem with it at all
soft yta she wants to spend time with her family it s not her fault your work conditions prevent you from getting the times she needed let her spend as much time as she can and just join her later
nta if she just wanted to leave days earlier that would be totally fine but she wants to take the car making your journey more than twice as long yea fuck that she is being extremely selfish she can either take the train herself or if she is insisting on taking the car then just don t go on the vacation and go on a separate trip that s more convenient for you
it s her vacation with her family you re just the new boyfriend along for the ride that sucks you re gonna be traveling hour on trains and such but this is time she is looking forward to spending with her family yta no don t call it off just figure out why you re being selfish
nta she can take a train if she wants to go earlier that badly very selfish of her dude
nta have her take the hour train ride and you take the hour car ride you will already be days late she is guaranteeing you will miss a 3rd day
nta she s being selfish and is gaslighting let her take the train and bus on 5th and you drive the car on 7th

the car is her mother s and she didn t offer me to take it if she goes the days in advance she would ride with her family with her stepfathers van that s another point i guess she doesn t trust me with her mother s car that s why she didn t even offer it and suggested the train
yup there you go since she thinks she s feel the same in your shoes let her prove it by leaving you the keys and riding the train herself
i m going to suggest that to her and post her response i have a feeling of what she will say but let s see
i mean it s a huge pain in the ass for him if it s about seeing her family then maybe op just goes on separate holiday that s more convenient with his friends instead
it s her mother s car
we ve been together for and a half years and we were planning for our first vacation together when we decided that it would be nice to lay our plans together with her families
she isn t going days early but op is going days later they planned for the 5th she wants to go the 5th why is that selfish of her
so he commits to a vacation he doesn t know he can actually take because he didn t bother to get employer approval until after he already committed to the plan and it was booked but now she deserves to either take an hour train or lose days of family time he fucked up and she tried to be compromising but she ultimately isn t okay with the fact that his mistake is going to make her vacation worse and i just can t fault her for that
she is definitely the ah but you don t know what the word gaslighting means if you think it applies here
gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self doubt and confusion in their victim s mind typically gaslighters are seeking to gain power and control over the other person by distorting reality and forcing them to question their own judgment and intuition gf is not gaslighting shut up
the car isn t theirs its her mothers its not up to her to lend it to anybody and she doesn t need to go by train as she can ride with her stepfather on the date that was planned months ago
that makes it so much worse
it s not her vehicle to offer
i hope it s good news for your sake
yes it is hours is a long time i wouldn t enjoy it either but his work commitments shouldn t get in the way of her spending time with her family she s not selfish for doing that he s not a massive a h for not wanting to travel 18hours on a train by himself either but he shouldn t pressure or guilt her into spending less time with them
i think this just seems like a bad idea from the start i can t imagine many destinations i d want to travel that far to be with someone else s family hours or if this was your first vacation together wouldn t you want to spend it alone i don t know if we have enough info about the relationship to judge
well that s new info you should ve included that before soft yta then she was looking forward spending time with her family yes she co opted your vacation to spend it with them she has to share some blame then again you re a new relationship that s the family she s known her whole life and she doesn t owe you loyalty just because you ve been dating exclusively for a year and a half you just have job obligations that prevent you from traveling with her you can not blame her for that or for her wanting to spend time with her family she even said if the roles were reversed she wouldn t see it as a hardship at all you re just being selfish because you said you still wanted to have her with you for those hours days traveling then makes you sound needy
it s also days so op is asking her to skip of the vacation
the thing is that the exact date of the vacation was in the air until late february i handed in the request as soon as i got the info from their family and right after that i told them about the situation and we agreed that my gf and me would follow up together by car just today she suddenly complains that the whole plan is shitty and that she doesn t want to lose the time

info have you had issues regarding food and cooking in the past either with layla or someone else where you felt insulted and unheard
i say nta it was your party your house your kitchen whether l is a chef or not she never should have interrupted you or asked your guests what they would have preferred she is ta
nta it s your place you decide who cooks guys do you prefer op to prepare the food or me to prepare it layla is a major ah for this sentence alone
you re nta your friend was pretty rude she should have accepted your answer and stepped back rather than doubling down and involving the rest of the party based on your answers to others she always cooks and never lets anyone else do that i m inferring that she is one of those rather insufferable foodie types who thinks she is the only one in the room who can cook
info is there a reason they didn t want you to cook did they know and not like what you planned
info i m wondering what is missing here if you planned a sleepover for that included dinner did you plan and prep for the meal or did you only decide to provide a meal at the last minute i ask because you say there were plenty of snacks but at 11pm your guests wanted dinner if you had planned on providing it why did you as the host not set a reasonable time to eat and have the food ready by then if your friend the cook offered her services because she and the gang thought you hadn t planned or prepped the meal then it would make more sense that everyone wanted the profesional to jump in and get food ready in a jiffy because they were past hungry and knew a pro could ready the food faster bonus that it would be tasty again it really feels like a big chunk of the story is missing
i m gonna say nta because there was no reason for her to step on your toes like that
nta it s your house and your food you wanted to cook for your friends with the food you bought in your kitchen tbh you could ve been nicer maybe saying i want to cook the food i bought in my own kitchen
nta your friend may be a chef but she s an entitled one you don t waltz up into someone s house dinner party and demand to cook when the host already prepared something you could have offered for her to help but were by no means obligated and if you wanted to cook for your friends then you should have been allowed to without pushback
nta your friends were incredibly rude and horrible guests
i would say nta it was kinda rude for her to come into your house and demand that you let her cook instead i also think that it s a little sad that not one friend stuck up for you
nta uh your friends are kind of weird i know i d be really uncomfortable with someone else using my kitchen and preparing food for someone i tend to meal plan carefully and live with multiple people so i d worry that that person would use ingredients that they shouldn t because i planned to use them for whatever specific meal or because those ingredients were bought by someone else for their food and not necessarily up for grabs i m not sure if you have roommates to consider but if you did then whether she used food that belonged to them would be a concern too if layla wanted to cook that badly she could have talked to you beforehand at the very least rather than blindsiding you she could also plan her own little get together and use her own kitchen at her own place i think it s pretty short sighted to think that just because you went to school for something like cooking that you are better at it if i m being honest
nta your friend layla is though for trying to take over the cooking when you said you wanted to do and turning it to your friends she would never be in my house during a meal time again and your bf accusing you of being rude nope he sounds like a guy who goes with the crowd and doesn t like to make waves which is not the kind of guy i would want to date
nta
both parties involved in this pissing contest is ta
nta your friend is being weird i know a few people who are experts in things they do and want to show off if i was in your position i would have just conceded though because it s a bit of childish argument
yta your friends wanted the professional chef to cook but you were a brat about it and said if they wanted her to cook they all had to leave you are a horrible hostess to your guests and a selfish person who has to be the center of attention yuck no wonder things were awkward after your childish display i probably would have left right then you owe everyone an apology
yta why not let her cook and save you the work or do it together do you not like her cooking this seems like a strange thing for you to be determined to do without any other context
editing my answer because it was pointed out that op did not ask for the vote it was her friend which changed the siutation quite a bit for me nta your friend should have asked you first before offering to cook like that and calling for a consensus but at the same time overriding the goup decision was a bad call that put a damper on the evening but this was out of your control by the time you got here
esh it s weird of her to presume to take over someone s kitchen you did ask and didn t abide by the decision even if she were the best chef in the world i wouldn t pick her in someone else s house

you re both the ah if she s a professional chef it would have been a cool thing to have at a sleep over she also could have been a lot nicer in asking
esh layla for putting it to a vote to your friends at your own party huge ah behaviour from her you for letting it get to 11pm and waiting for your friends to say they wanted dinner before making moves to make something i was planning to cook food if you were planning to cook the whole time why hadn t you already done it
nta hindsight is but honestly i don t think i would have insisted because yeah that was guaranteed to make things weird even though you were in the right bear with me here a moment i would have either let it go let the rest of the evening play out and considered how close i really wanted to continue to stay to this group of people or went ahead and kicked everybody out maybe faked sick even though it would have been obvious and probably ended up ending things right there by default or if you want to continue trying to make it work next time specify ahead of time we ll order out i ll be cooking since it s my house i would love for layla to cook i propose we all pitch in x for ingredients so layla can bring the ingredients for whatever she wants to cook so that the expectation is set early i don t know the dynamics of your group exactly but i m wondering if some geek social fallacies https://plausiblydeniable.com/five-geek-social-fallacies/) aren t at play here here s what i would guess played into how the night went layla is obviously pretty controlling demanding the gall of someone to demand to cook at someone else s house is pretty big and calling for a vote to try and shame the house owner out of cooking is let s call it socially inept to be nice everyone seems to enjoy getting free food from a professional chef if anybody calls out layla for overstepping or goes against her they are afraid they will lose access to free cheaper food from layla and potentially start other drama if layla does tend to be a leader of the group so everyone goes along with layla even when she s being unreasonable layla is usually the biggest voice in the group her being challenged thus feels like drama because everybody is pretty non confrontational and happy to get stepped on rather than have to speak up when one person s voice tends to a lead a group of people who are people pleasers or just fairly non confrontational they will tend to turn on anyone who challenges the leader because it signifies a change in status quo and they have accepted and gotten used to the current status quo the point that they should have a voice too never really factors into their considerations they re far too worried about appeasing everyone and seeming peaceful and approachable if that s all spot on i would really consider spending less time with this group and branching out to meet some new people and foster other relationships if i m on with any of this the group is likely to start freezing you out anyway as they ll deem the fact that you have an opinion as a threat to the group they likely won t directly outcast you but will start to become colder and less friendly effectively forcing you out anyway and regarding your boyfriend saying you were out of line to not want someone knocking around your kitchen during your hosting is oof i d be having some serious talks and introspection on the future of the relationship at this point is there anything your boyfriend would advocate for you over
nta your home your kitchen layla should have asked if she could cook or assist you not just say that she was going to cook
really bizarre that layla a guest thinks she has any authority in your household nta
nta eat your host s food or don t eat at all she wasn t necessarily rude to offer but she should have never made the comment about preferences and the other guests should have said of course they would eat your food everyone owes you an apology
i have never had any problems neither with food or layla i just wanted to show my friends my cooking abilities for once because layla is the one that always cooks
thanks for your answer that s exactly what i think but my bf doesn t think like that
deleted
they didn t know what i was planning to cook and i don t think there is a reason they don t want me to cook because i have never cooked for them before
i was planning to do spaghetti and i bought everything some days before the sleepover prepared the spaghetti sauce hours before the sleepover it would only take me like minutes to prepare everything
yes i agree i should have been nicer but the tone layla used was bothering me
i am considering to apologize with them
i do like her cooking but she always cooks and never lets anyone else do that so i wanted do show my friends my cooking once
i wanted to cook because she always cooks
op didn t ask the friend did personally i would feel incredibly weird going to someone s house and commandeering their kitchen if anything esh
tbf op didn t ask
actually layla is a very sweet person i don t know why she was acting like that the other day my friends wanted her to cook because she is a professional and i have known some of them since i was little and came to my house very often when they came my mom used to cook and mom is a very bad cooker so they probably thought that i am a very bad cooker too the rest of them are more used to layla s cooking so they probably want to eat something they already know they like idk the group leader is my boyfriend not layla
you had to stretch a bit for all that mr fantastic
in that case it sounds like it was a bit of an overreaction and i would say esh she s the one who tends to cook it sounds like because that s what she does for a living and enjoys it and i understand you wanting to show off your skills but to go from a small back and forth over who should cook to essentially threatening to kick everyone out if you didn t get the chance to cook seems like a lot at the same time i do understand being upset over her essentially taking over what should have been your sleepover it was your house and you were the one who was trying to entertain everyone and be a proper host you were excited to show off your cooking skills for once and while her offering makes sense i do feel like she crossed a line by insisting the way she did and then also turning it to the group like she did i would be insulted as well and the fact it got to a point where they were not only accepting this and voting but voting for her i get being hurt especially if she is a good friend and you want to keep her in your life i think the two of you should sit down and both apologize to each other for your actions as well as explain where you were each coming from she may not have meant to overstep but she did you may not have meant to lose your cool but you did these things happen though and hopefully you can talk it out and move forward with a better understanding of each other maybe suggest cooking together in the future especially for sleepovers
apparently neither do the other commenters i don t get it
i would have let her cook instead of insisting yeah but i would have felt really crummy over my friend doing that to me
if you had the sauce simmering on the stove when your friend offered to cook why didn t you say no need it s all done or if you want to boil the pasta water great everything else is ready i m sorry if i m being dense but it still feels like there must be more to the story why would your cook friend the whole gang want to to wait even longer for her to ready an entirely new meal rather than eat what was already prepared they all sound like a bunch of ah if no info is missing why would she have offered to cook in the first place why would the friends agree why was your bf upset with you rather than at the friend group for insulting you in your own house at the party you were hosting it just really doesn t make any sense if your post is the whole story i d dump all of them
okay this is totally different you already did the cooking and you just needed to put it together that s not the same as needing to start cooking a meal and i don t understand why it was even possible to have this argument why didn t you just say that you d made everything for a spaghetti meal and just needed to boil the pasta to begin with
yes layla asked i m sorry i explained myself wrong my native language isn t english
that does change things quite a bit i edited my answer
yes layla asked not me
cool reason comprehension i said i wonder if and if several times
i m considering sending a message to my friends apologizing for getting a bit too angry thanks for taking your time to comment
i actually don t know why i didn t mention that i was a bit tired and angry so i didn t thought well and just said what i said but now i know i should have mentioned that the sauce was ready
i answered that already telling them everything was ready just didn t come to my mind
there s absolutely nothing wrong with your english i was just reading through it too fast
why didn t your boyfriend say that you d already prepared food it just seems like neither of you saying the totally obvious thing the spaghetti i made will be ready in minutes when she offered to cook would have prevented all of this not saying anything about what was ready and then getting angry when the suggestions from the group didn t make sense based on what you d prepared is the problem especially if it s standard for her to cook generally
aaah alright thank you

esh it s not okay for him to use you as a meat shield for his ex gfs it s also not okay for you to invite uninvited guests to someone else s party much less let them in both of you need to grow up
esh eric for using you as an excuse you for getting petty revenge under the guise of feeling bad for amber
esh he s used me as his fake excuse to break up with previous girlfriends too you suck for inviting someone to a party you re not hosting thus causing drama it s eric s party also you suck for allowing him to use you as a fake excuse to break up with multiple other women eric broke up with his ex amber and claimed it was because he had been madly in love with me since childhood and couldn t take it anymore eric sucks for using you as excuses to get out of relationships that is very scummy if he wants to break up with someone he needs to be honest and not lie saying this
esh there s no need for you to stir up unnecessary drama and eric shouldn t be blaming his breakups on you
yta you wanted drama i m surprised you didn t bring popcorn
yta sounds like you just wanted to start some drama
yta you knew your friend didn t want to speak with her and you took it upon yourself to force him into contact with her
esh eric is using you he s not just using you as a prop he s using you as a prop to lie to people scummy thing to do with no integrity to it you not only put up with this you supported him doing it in the past you then allow her access to a place she isn t welcome these are secondary issues to eric s suckiness but you should have done better tell him to stop being a lying sh t if amber comes to you tell her the truth from your perspective that s all you owe what you know to be true and then butt out
yta my friend explicitly told me not to do something so i did it
yta this was his party and you let her in knowing he didn t want her there also isn t it his house so he gets to choose who can come in not you
yta it s hard to tell why eric is so crazy about you
yta you let her into his home she could have easily stolen or damaged property you risked his safety because you wanted to be petty
yta not your place to invite anyone you are a horrible friend
yta
yta it wasn t your party or your place to invite her

i was my female friends bf everytime we went out to protect her but if the reverse happens then its wrong i take this as he said those things because you were his friend seems like you werent what if she had lit a fire in there
exactly it wasn t ok for him to do that to you especially since it doesn t sound like he considered the potential danger he could be putting you in and it wasn t cool of you to let amber crash his party to try and make him stop apologize for crashing his party but put your foot down and tell him to quit using you as an excuse for his commitment issues
i ve never allowed him to use me as an excuse he does it without my permission while knowing i don t like it
why didn t you say something to him it seemed like you just let this happen multiple times you re aware he does it but do nothing to stop it that s allowing or maybe you did try to stop him but he wouldn t listen if that s the case why stay friends with him
youballowed him by continuing to behis friend after such shitty behavior forgiving once i understand vit only if he honestly sincerely apologizes fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me people act like jerks because we allow them passes over and over again he is a jerk but you had the ability to walk away ling before this incident

nah you re right to want to live openly and authentically your mum however is also allowed to be very nervous about the fallout from this particularly from her other children i think it s worth giving this issue a little more time to breathe and have another conversation with your mum emphasising your support of her if and when this news becomes public
nta but if you do decide to share be prepared for some repercussions eventually this is going to come to a head when you host a family event your half siblings decide to join afterall it isn t fair to exclude them from events you host because it will make your mom uncomfortable talked about your mom needs to take this bull by the horns confront this all before you accidentally say you re visiting your siblings slips do happen so she better handle her discomfort sooner rather than later
nta its your news to share just be prepared for the repercussions
ohhhhh op i can relate long story so i ll be brief my dad and his older sister were out of wedlock in the 40s 50s probably same dad scandalous i did my dna to confirm my paternal grandfather but dads sister doesn t want to know so while i ve been discreet where i can and i m not looking to hurt anyone my dad wants his bio dad listed in his obit so that cat will be officially out of the bag if i was you talk to mom and ask her how she wants people to find out from her from you from facebook because they will find out that genie is out of the bottle you can t keep this quiet no matter what you do so give your mom as much control as possible to minimize her upset nta best of luck with the new relatives and congrats
nta it s not your secret to keep tell everyone and your mom can deal with the fallout how your mom feels your life history blow it sky high and be free
nta this exact same situation happened to me just because your mother chose to lie and be ashamed about her choices doesn t mean you are obligated to lie and hide your family you also have had a massive upheaval in your life and you deserve to get support from your friends meeting my new half siblings and developing a relationship has been one of the greatest gifts of my life and i refuse to hide that or be ashamed
nta it s normal to want to share his news and it s normal of your mother to want to hide her shame she may need more time to get used to having it exposed keep discussing it with those around you and she ll grow inured
nta it s understandable that you want to share your news with those close to you however your mom is also in shock about your paternity so it s natural for her to consider repercussions you should be as well how will your step dad s family feel when they realize that you re not related to them by blood if when you do go public with the info be prepared for people to start making comments assumptions when the truth doesn t match their perception
she didn t have any doubts well she either cheated on one with the other or she was sleeping with both at the same time but that s her look out only she knows the problem with this kind of well problem is that you have already opened pandora s box by doing the test and meeting your siblings i would imagine you are still fairly young and with the prevalence of social media posts re posts sharing liking friending etc it will not be long before the truth will out somehow if you have a family party birthday christmas new year and they are invited your friends and family are gong to wonder who this group of young people are who look suspiciously like you and your mum and if they don t meet them in person they may well se pics on social media sites the alternative of course is to cut all contact with your newfound family but i imagine that is the last thing you want you re nta for wanting to share and whether your mum likes it or not the cat is already out of the bag she can run but she can t hide
nta this is a huge thing that is happening in your life and it definitely affects you more than it does your mother seeing as it is you who has spent your whole life thinking that terrible man was your father just to find out that isn t true it should be completely your choice who you share it with and who you talk to about it chances are these people probably won t have as strong of a reaction as she is thinking they will
nta
nta your mom may be an amazing woman now but she failed in the most fundamental way by depriving you of a relationship with your birth father hear me on this you never got to know your dad before he died because of your mom every action she s taken with regards to this was meant to keep her from looking bad and you were a casualty of that you can respect your mom you can keep your relationship with her but what you should not do is continue to sacrifice yourself on the altar of her decades old lie it s time to get to know your family and not keep them as some dirty little secret
nta question dose the a reason ex dad bad because he dislikes your mom for cheating
op nta your mother is only thinking about herself share your news it is your truth
nta you have a right to live in your truth unfortunately that truth comes with your mom s truth as well whatever the case may be the man she thought to be your father isn t through all of this you gained six siblings that is exciting and new and must feel so great you re allowed to be ecstatic and open with that
you should share the good news with everyone congratulations on finding your bio family you are right your moms only worrying about her indiscretions it may be that s what she doesn t want out i m glad the bio family and you are bonding good for you
nta and no she was not just as shocked as you it s not like she was impregnated while in a coma

nah you aren t wrong for being excited and she s not wrong for her feelings either this really won t function as keeping it a secret and getting to know your paternal family it s unlikely to function as a secret now anyway because your paternal half siblings know and who knows how many others on your paternal side it only functioned as a secret this long because no one knew heck your mom didn t even know absolutely no one had the info to spill perhaps discuss with your mother that there s others that know and you and your mother cannot control what they do with that info additionally there s now a means for the relatives you had previously believed to be your father s family will be able to piece together the truth also you won t be matching to them if his family also does this test can figure this secret out the fact that no one was told for so long can be forgiven because no one including your mom knew but now it s known now they are deliberately having these facts withheld i don t want to say your mom made a mistake because you re here but your mom did have a history that she didn t need to make public or share she had the right to not disclose when it didn t impact others it s now impacting others and now others can feel like they ve had something that involves them being withheld
nta but maybe come up with a backstory about how your parents were on a break or almost divorced at one time
nta for wanting to share but maybe ywbta for sharing as a society we are still working out ethical obligations and etiquette rules related to what dna testing can reveal your mother is the main person your news will affect but she may not even be the only one give her some time to get used to it go ahead with getting to know your new siblings and relatives keep your mother informed but dont push her on revealing the secret for a few months at least eventually secrets come out and eventually everyone will know but not all facts need to be revealed as soon as you learn them i promise you that understanding that and restraining yourself until consequences for all concerned are a little clearer will benefit you in the long run it s a useful life skill
removed
info a lot of judgements are saying give your mum time how long has it been though since you found out
nta but i don t know how valid her worry is in some communities she could be looking at anything from eviction to job loss to actual harassment or even violence yes it s an extreme example but it s worth considering your younger sibling is also going to be majorly impacted by this news as well as your relationship with their dad s extended family it s worthwhile to sit down explain to your mom that you need to share your joy and truth but you re willing to work with her and help mitigate her fears and dear god tell your sibling in private before you tell anyone outside the family
nta
nta your news to share or to not share if mom is worried about the embarrassment then she should have thought about it when you were conceived
info have you talked to your mom about your bio dad and why she didn t think he was your father also what s her family like will they disown her treat her badly if word gets out this seems like important context to have before you decide how to move forward
i won t cast judgment because it s not a fair situation you re in i can very easily predict the bad fallout if sharing it goes poorly i can see the accusations your mother would face i can see the jealousy and resentment your siblings might develop the suspicions about their own parentage and i can see the isolation you will be left with when everyone blames you for everything i can see everything backfiring so spectacularly that you create a rift you can never close again it could literally break your family apart i understand your excitement but you need to ask yourself if everything you stand to lose and all the pain you risk invoking is worth the risk my honest suggestion wait until you understand what it all means you re in a fragile position where you can either gain everything or lose everything in the meantime hide your me profile if it comes out because one of your siblings does it too you ll be accused of hiding it
this depending on your community her support network this could end up destroying her life for a good while you aren t wrong for not wanting to keep secrets but give it a while to really think of how to handle things and keep your mother looped in
your mum however is also allowed to be very nervous about the fallout from this oh no if it isn t the consequences of her own actions
she supported me doing the me and even wanted to do it herself not a decades old lie if mother herself was surprised by the results
he doesn t even know she cheated although i m sure he suspected it at times it s ok that he wasn t there for me but why wasn t he there for his actual child my mom made it easy for him and she never asked for child support or money thankfully on my part but not for my sibling

why should he lie for them

months
yes we had a discussion it just seems like she was in denial and convinced herself he was not my father she was married at the time of my conception and i think she did not want to embarrass herself but couldn t go through with the alternative either way i truly forgive her i think my mom had to learn a lot of hard lessons in life and considering the lack of support she had she overcame a lot i think my mom is a total badass flaws and all no one is perfect it just bothers me that i am able to handle this well and not have anger or resentment i haven t been irrational or impulsive in my response or actions i ve actually been trying to find a way to transition my new family into my life without hurting my mom my mom doesn t have a big family or anyone that would disown her she does however have a lot of friends and people that respect her she is also remarried and my stepdad supports her when he found out he was completely calm about it and said these things happen the person who believed he was my dad still doesn t know that he is not my actual dad
not all consequences are reasonable
you re getting downvoted but you re right
people always say that that they re shocked as if they didn t know there were possibilities or more around the time they got pregnant she wasn t shocked it was just easier to believe the most convenient option
she wasn t shocked she knew there was a chance it wasn t an immaculate conception
how could she possibly be surprised that op could have another father moms was there for the deed and was an active participant well ignoring possibility of sa
he s already lying to himself about her not knowing so what s one more lie clearly the mother wouldn t have been apologizing profusely if she truly didn t know she s apologizing because she at least suspected but never followed up because she wanted to perpetuate the fantasy that all her kids had the same father
if she thought there were good odds he had another dad she would ve tried to prevent the test
it turns out i have siblings total from my birth father she may not have even remembered the encounter if they were wasted i don t think the guy kept himself to himself very well
okay i ll explain in more elaborate detail if she encouraged her daughter to take the me test she was sure or at least extremely confident that her daughter was her husband s child if she wasn t sure or she had doubts she d have tried to discourage taking the test talking about privacy exposures and the danger of having this personal information out there and available to be abused therefore it was a shock and an unpleasant surprise when the test came back obviously she had to know about the possibility but also obviously she thought that chance had been safely eliminated until the test came back she didn t know or believe that her daughter s genealogy was a lie
if i give you one possible scenario will that make you happy it was a one time thing she was on the pill he used protection nothing could possibly go wrong
right she had a fling with a guy and then settled down i think this is a lot more common than people think especially in the past before dna testing exploded
never heard of bluffing
sure have so i give a detailed explanation and get a non sequitur reply

nta solid clap back
definitely nta he needed to hear the truth
nta that was the nicest thing you could have said to him
nta at all you tolerated him for a long time you even tried to figure out the reason he was picking on you it s not like you went from he deserved it the reality check he needed good luck with everything in life don t waste your time thinking about losers like dom screw him
esh his parents did fail him yeah he s a fucking bully he sucks his behavior sucks but he s coming from a place of pain and rage and you clearly know that see that based on what you said if you can be that insightful i m going to say you can also be insightful enough to take the higher road in all likelihood you will fare far better in life than him there is solace to be found in that and no i m not saying bullying is ok by any means
nice enough to leave him pouting for the past several months
i understand that i didn t know when i said it and just assume through the benefit of the doubt that everyone that doesn t practice a basic level of kindness was failed in some way and were not born like that if i d known the details i would have chosen my words more carefully but i did not and that is where the aita question is coming from

nta you adopted carter when you were with your ex as a family you split up and are not a family any longer you are under no obligation to adopt a child who is no longer part of your family why would you take on legal responsibility for someone else s kid when you are no longer in a relationship with their parent i would say no the offer of adoption ended when your relationship did and alex chose which potential parent she wanted to live with she is and old enough to learn that decisions have consequences i m sure that if you were all still a family adoption would still be on the table but you aren t and it s not
something tells me that alex at is seeing that your financial resources will make her launch into adulthood much more comfortable she s likely looking at colleges and if dad has money troubles has realized that he will be of no help it s very suspicious that she goes straight to legally adopt me and not i miss you and have realized how much you mean to me can i come spend time with you
nta you re not married any more why would you adopt alex
nta step child adoptions are a thing but are former step child adoptions even entertained in court and why would you consider adopting someone who has a long history of abusing your children do you think she will continue to treat them well after she gets what she wants
nta if carter is suspicious of alex s motives you should be too
nta she s mistreated you and the younger kids for a long time you were still married to her dad when you made that promise you aren t anymore there s no point in being nice to someone who has proven they don t give a shit about you once you have adopted her you can t go back and she probably knows that i m pretty sure her good behaviour would change really fast and the only thing that would happen is she d demand money all the time she s she can learn a lesson about actions and consequences please protect your younger kids from her i grew up with an abusive older sister who treated me very much like alex treated emily and it f cks you up in so many ways
info how much child support would you be on the hook to pay after doing this when she refuses for you to have any custody enough to make life with dad better
after carter s adoption was finalized things went downhill correlation or causation it sounds like there s a lot more to unpack here than carter s adoption and having another child and that alex needs to be in therapy and needed to be in therapy ages ago my ex interjected and talked about how back when i adopted carter i had promised to adopt alex if she changed her mind that promise was made before you had to literally move out and get custody of the other two children to keep them safe from alex
nta anyone can be nice for a short time she is 16yo so that means she was a teen and going terrible things to her siblings also she is your ex s kid there is no reason for you to adopt her i hope her dad got her therapy when she was acting out because she sure needs it sorry ex s ship sailed when he did not do much to stop her bad behavior his money issues are his to deal with
nta y all are divorced now and she made y all s life hell you offered to adopt her and get therapy and both were refused protect yourself and your kids i would just say you don t feel comfortable considering everything that has happened
nta she can just as easily start treating them badly again after she gets what she wants if you consider it at all it should be after group counseling probably without the ex
info does your ex hate his kids like how did you end up with primary custody of his biological son and now he also wants you to take custody of his daughter too
nta i would absolutely not make myself legally responsible for someone i did not trust
nta if and i mean big if you decide to go through with this before starting down the legal path therapy counseling is a non negotiable must that has to happen if alex and your ex don t agree to this then no go
nta adoption has to work for everyone involved not just the adoptee i feel bad for alex i m sure there was a lot going on in her head and she didn t know how to deal with it in a healthy way but you can t put your mental health and the well being of your other kids in jeopardy if you re not sure about this if you re still open to the idea in theory there s nothing wrong with slowly testing the waters talking about it having her over more without her father etc to see if it might work out if you re not open to it at this point that s perfectly fair just don t lead her on in that case
nta no absolutely not you divorced the man you loved to get yourself and your children out of a volatile situation that she created you taking her back essentially makes your entire divorce and everything you went through to keep the other two safe pointless that she s acting nice now doesn t change that that even carter is suspicious means you need to be very cautious and i don t mean in the immediate i mean for a long time whatever her motivations for being nice now won t matter once she s adopted she s acting nice now because she knows she has to if she wants to get anything from you once she s adopted it won t matter she can go back to her old tricks at any time for any reason without consequences you wouldn t be able to legally cut her out of your life if she reverts you also currently have no financial obligation to her if she s not legally your child say you adopt her and she gets nasty and send her to live with your ex full time again you re now on the hook for child support until she s you have everything to lose and nothing to gain by adopting her op tell your ex your fine with her coming to stay over and having scheduled time with you but you will not legally adopt her that the only way you ll consider it is as an adult adoption if she proves she really wants to be part of the family i say adult adoption because you wouldn t have any legal repercussions at that point if she shows her colors after you signed the papers do not adopt her while she is still a minor i also want to point out that if you re so scared she ll act out if you say no that s that much more reason not to if being told no is enough to make her nasty to her siblings and you then its guaranteed her behavior would continue to be volatile post adoption only it ll be when you refuse to buy her the car she wants or you try to ground her for breaking the rules etc from the sounds of it it seems like she resented the family you all created and felt her brother betrayed her by loving you and wanting you to be his mom and hated your younger child because she was a result of your love with her dad those feelings don t just go away my bet is that you re right she saw that her quality of life was forced to change as a result of her actions and realizing that the person she screwed over was the person providing the life she liked she sees you as an atm eta it s possible she wants to be adopted because she wants to be close to her brother again but she doesn t need to be adopted to have a relationship with him the only thing an adoption is required for is access to your funds i would tell your ex that the offer you made was null and void the moment she became abusive to her siblings and the moment the divorce was finalized as i said earlier if she wants a relationship with her siblings tell them she s welcome in your home so long as she treats them well set up a schedule for visits if you re comfortable with that if not just tell him no to all of it you don t have to explain your reasons either but whatever you do do not adopt her as a child they ll try to call you names and manipulate you none of it is true the hope is that if they can convince you it s true you ll do anything to prove them wrong including giving into their demands
she is she is old enough to understand that her previous behavior is making you wary if you are considering this there are several conditions you should require this discussion should be had between just the two of you she needs to acknowledge the harm she has previously done she needs to be able to provide a sincere apology she needs to go to counselling both individually and then eventually with her siblings she needs to hear the hurt and damage she has caused to her siblings from their perspective the two of you need to have some counselling sessions to discuss how she hurt you and your children and how she needs to show she can behave kindly and follow your rules as her parent before she becomes your child you and your ex need to also have some mediated sessions to ensure that he is not going to undermine your parenting going forward this is a lot of work for this year old you are nta if you do not adopt her you need to ask yourself if you would want to if she did the work if you would want to then lay out the work she will need to do to earn her siblings agreement and your trust and don t forget the requirement to have your ex admit he f ed up there was something wrong and he enabled it if he keeps undermining it will never work
nta don t adopt her
nta but i ll give you something to think about i taught middle high school kids for years i watched quite a few girls behave in really horrific ways for years until their sophomore year of high school don t even get me started on how mean girls can be ages boys are a different discussion anyway it s as if a magic switch was flipped in the middle of their sophomore year and they started to turn into decent human beings some of my favorite former students were hellions in middle school and then turned it around in high school if i hadn t been willing to give them a second chance when they got older i d have missed out on some pretty amazing kids you ve expressed concerns about alex s motivation for suddenly wanting to be adopted and you have every right to be suspicious here s how you find out whether or not she s really changed tell her you are not going to adopt her since you re no longer married to her dad fully explain the logistics of that and don t bring up her previous behavior unless she does try to make it about the technicalities see how she responds if she gets angry don t worry that s to be expected i m sure she ll argue calmly refute her arguments then end the discussion she may be abusive to you expect it and don t respond in kind and try not to hold it against her as she s still young and her first response may not be her final response she has a history of not managing her emotions effectively and you should assume this is still the case at least with her initial response that s not the real test what you are watching for is what happens next once her anger cools down in other words the final response how does she treat her siblings how does she treat you once the initial disappointment passes give her a couple of months to adjust to the news and then check in with your kids to see what s happening behind the scenes that s what will inform your next move if she is abusive your gut was right if she treats everyone with respect and reestablishes a positive relationship with you managing her disappointment in mature ways once she s had a chance to process you could consider adopting her later as a purely symbolic gesture seeing as she is your kids sibling or not that s entirely up to you seeing as she did a pretty good job burning bridges it could be a nice 18th birthday present after she s had ample time to prove with her actions that she deserves the gesture only time will tell if alex is going to be a decent human being imo she may be worth the wait as i said i ve seen some pretty amazing transformations of course i ve also seen some girls remain the spawn of satan i think every kid deserves a second chance when some of the reasons for the behavior may very well be related to their immaturity and inability to manage their emotions once they ve had a chance to mature less grace is warranted
nta don t do this what kind of nerve does she and your ex have to think this would make sense at this point you re not together anymore and you don t have a real relationship with alex anymore this makes no sense i m sorry for alex but she needs therapy not a weird adoption on paper only situation
nta she wants you to adopt her for the wrong reasons not out of love but for money
nta and do not adopt her it is more than a title being her parent there s school financial responsibility medical care problems with the police if she gets in trouble and so much more don t let her bully you or her siblings i can t just hear her now you have to pay for my school trip to europe bc you re my mom etc
nta for not wanting to adopt her when you re not in a relationship with her father anymore but i feel like a lot of the answers people are giving aren t considering that alex might ve been acting out because she lost her mother everyone including her biological brother was moving on and now she had a new person coming in wanting to in her eyes replace her mom years old is old is enough to see the consequences of her actions and she does but she wasn t when these actions started she says she misses you and she sees that her life is not as good without you she s trying to be better by being nice to her siblings because she probably believes that it s her fault they got divorced broke up i honestly feel like it s the ex s fault for letting a child lose her mom and go through so many changes and be so angry while adamantly refusing therapy for her she was and still is a child her dad is an adult sometimes children need help and he failed to provide that you did what you needed to protect your children but she didn t have anyone protecting her that s not your fault by any means but i just think that should be considered i m not saying you should adopt her but just to recognize which i think you do since you had previously suggested therapy to the dad that she struggled growing up
nta but maybe instead of saying no right now insist that all of you go to family therapy to make sure that it is the right decision for everyone whether you are comfortable or not alex is and will be carter s and emily s sibling right now it looks like alex is more open to a relationship for whatever reason and it may be the best chance to create a healthy relationship amongst the children
ywnbta but i d honestly suggest family therapy to see if everyone can come to an agreement it could be any reason as to why she s choosing now regret loneliness force deception etc i know the damage she caused is done but it s not too late to foster a relationship with her without adopting her she s extending an olive branch you have every right to be cautious or refuse it with her past behavior
i m of two minds on this one you are divorced so adopting her now does feel a little strange and her actions are a little suspicious but breaking promises especially to kids is asshole behavior also i don t think you re reading this situation fully her actions picking on her brother after he got adopted ignoring the shared child these actions scream jealousy there s a disconnect here to me this whole thing reads wrong did their mother die or abandon them why was there a thing about you legally adopting them at all the way this reads feels like really important stuff is left out like maybe this girl lost her mother and felt like letting you adopt her was some sort of massive betrayal so she said no to it but then her brother had a full mom in you the shared sister had a full mom in you and only she didn t so she started acting out unable to deal with or even understand how she was feeling and now she s gotten a little older and sees what they have she s more capable of coping with the feelings and wants you to be her mom too because she always loved you and felt left out and wants to fix it it s really hard to say anything here because it just feels like there s something really important absent in this i can wholly understand you being suspicious and wanting to safely test the waters but i think you need to genuinely understand her motives before you reject her
nta alex just got her first real life lesson about actions having consequences or in reddit parley she fafo d
ywnbta the motivations behind your adoption offer have been erased entirely over the years this situation is very different and based on the information you presented i agree her motives are not impure you also shouldn t adopt a child because you feel emotionally blackmailed into it either
nta don t do it whatever her ulterior motives are it s not to benefit anyone but herself why would you adopt her now when you re no longer family the only connection she has to you is her siblings but you re no longer her stepmother why would you be responsible for her also the fact that you got primary custody of a child who isn t biologically yours says a lot about his father he ignored her behavior for years and continues to do so
i m just glad carter has you protecting him
nta it just sounds strange i would wonder if your ex and alex figure that if you adopt her you can all let bygones be bygones and be one big happy family again and then his money problems go away or you adopt her and she stays with him allowing him to ask for child support yeah no it makes no sense to adopt her now
why would you adopt the child of an ex that s insane maybe if you had a great relationship and the ex died it would make sense but it doesn t make any sense now it s weird enough as it stands nta
nta think about it once you adopt her she comes to live with you then she re starts her bullying bc she has gotten what she has wanted you will be removing your children s safe space if you fall for this trap of course your ex wants the adoption to go ahead he will come out of it financially better than he is now her behaviour will revert back once you say no which proves she was faking it and once you say yes this is a lose lose situation don t do it
what a strange question you are wondering if you should adopt a teenager whose father you divorced a teenager who hated you for years yes hated who tormented her younger sibling and step sibling because of their association with you and who only appears to have changed her tune about you because of in what world would adopting her be a good decision you would be an imbecile to adopt her and bring that chaos into your life and the lives of your children i m seriously wondering about your common sense ywnbta if you did not adopt her
nta you were never obligated to adopt anyone and you re definitely not now since you and your ex divorced if carter is suspicious of alex and says she s been acting weird then yeah definitely don t adopt
ywnbta she s acting nice to get adopted and live in a better home and have more privileges than she would ve had living either her dad it s bad to say but once you ve adopted her i m sure she d go back to her old ways of mistreating her siblings and then you d have no way of getting rid of the girl or making her change
nta she wants the adoption because her life isn t better now that she got her wish
nta alex spent years trying to get rid of you and now that she s actually experiencing the outcome she doesn t like the result of her efforts too bad so sad maybe she ll learn to be nicer to the next one
nope teen angst or not she acted truly vile and she s continuing to act truly vile by only mentioning the nice things you have never that she misses and loves you ywnbta
esa at least the adults in the situation controversial opinion apparently but i recognize that you said alex s behaviour changed when you adopted carter i can t help but think that there was a lot of hurt wrapped up in that whole process for her something tore her open just then and it sounds like the adults didn t investigate what that was she was a kid who i suspect was acting out pain i m guessing as illogical as it may be she was feeling rejected by the family for becoming yours and lashed out at her sibs because of it the only people she could have any power over and who most represented her pain i m betting she has regretted not taking you up on your offer for a very long time maybe right from day she reacted like a kid does when they are deeply wounded
she seems far too manipulative and there would be no motivation for her to act kindly to them once adoption was no longer an issue meaning the same results would likely to occur if you adopt her or not could you possibly just work it out where you take her a few days a week so she can be with her siblings but not officially adopt her tell her you are worried that based on prior behavior she will change back that you will treat her just as you do the others but if her behavior goes back to where she is hurting her siblings she is no longer welcome to stay this way she remains motivated to be kind to them and it could be a win for everyone
nta and carter and emily should get a veto if you ex and alex talk it over later and want to do it
nta she is using your other children as pawns to get what she wants the second you owe child support on your legal child she will go right back to her old ways
i don t see why she would bring that up now you re divorced from her father so in terms of that nta
nta why would you adopt her now especially when you are no longer together with their parent and they were a big part of the reason you got divorced
info one thing i do not understand with regards to your ex husband not believing that alex was treating the other children badly why couldn t believe his children why wouldn t you have them tell their father what was going on and how alex was making them feel
i m naive but this is a legit question how did you get primary custody of carter and his biological father didn t
not your kid not your problem nta stay the hell away from them
alex is the reason your family broke up why would you want to adopt her and now that you aren t even with her dad it makes zero sense don t do it trust your gut nta
seems to me that the x wants no responsibility for his kids he would rather you raise them so he can be free to do what he wants
nta she broke up the family if you adopt her the second its signed she will go back to her horrible ways yes she is using you for money if you don t adopt her she will go back to her horrible ways she is going to go back to her horrible ways regardless don t adopt her to protect the other children i wouldn t tell her outright no you will only consider it if therapy is involved individual and you both that s leaving the ball in her court on terms she won t agree to so its never going to happen and you won t be the bad person
nta wow a wicked stepdaughter that s a twist on the classic old tale
there s a pretty easy way to resolve this give her the opportunity to show she wants to be a part of your family before you will agree to adopt her refusing outright would make you an asshole she s a kid who was going through a lot of changes it s fairly common for the older sibling who remembers their other parent better to be more resistant to blending families she deserves a chance to repair her relationships with her siblings allowing her to take advantage of you or harm your children would also make you the asshole so just let her come over and spend time with y all and see where it leads nah
nta trust your instincts also your ex clearly never had your back so if you do adopt alex you can also expect no support of she acts out again in the future plus she bullied your kids in the past so do you really want to bring that back into the family best advice would be get you and your kids into family therapy to discuss it before making a decision one way or the other
nta i would also look into reactive attachment disorder and educated yourself and hopefully your ex kids can have rad for a number of reasons and it sounds like she possibly could have it based on whatever the situation surrounding the birth mom or lack there of is
nta she literally ruined your marriage her own brother sees through her do not trust this she just wants the privileges of you having more money she will drop the act and go back to abusing your kids
nta but with a big caveat if alex started acting out immediately after carter s adoption it seems pretty likely she was alienated by being left out of the adoption process seems like both you and the ex were trying to be considerate of her feelings but there are some years of resentment and left out feelings to work through even if she couldn t admit that she might have wanted to be adopted too i agree with all of the posters saying that alex needs therapy but it sounds like she might need a bit of empathy too
your first thoughts are correct this child is unstable and angry and capable of anything protect your kids and do not get involved with her if you re worried about what she might do when your ex has them withhold them from him and go to court to have his custody rescinded because of the danger to your kids
nta she s a manipulative bully
nta but perhaps play the wierd waiting game i d like you to wait a year to make sure this isn t a snap decision then your too close to and me adopting you will mess up your financial aid for college finally your an adult now and i don t really support adult adoption in all honesty the first one is really good because it forces alex to really want or not want an adoption the next two are just great delay tactics from your description i also think she just wants your money and i wouldn t be ok with that either
nta maybe a private chat with your ex to find out what is really happening maybe something is happening he s quite sick and alex needs a parent maybe he is guilting alex bc she destroyed his relationships with you and the other kids if something is going on do insist on family counseling before making any more changes
nta anyone can play at being nice for a short period of time you are right to be cautious alex could easily be playing the game to have access to your resources you shouldn t begin to consider adopting alex until she s truly apologized has gone through personal therapy and the family has had months of group therapy to fully heal that process should take years if alex has shown true personal growth you might consider an adult adoption at a later point in your life although alex isn t legally your child if she continues to behave well you might consider budgeting some money to help her for instance i can tell you ve been working to be better to your siblings so i ll pay for your driving lessons if your dad will help you practice driving in his car
those kids know she is a bully there is no way to save that don t adopt her she doesn t deserve it nor is she really your child carter is loved you like a parent she just wants to use you
nta yeah if she hasnt changed gotten close to you or anything its very suss that all of a sudden she wants you tonadopt her
nta doing this could seriously affect your life not in a good way she probably only wants to live in a big house and if she starts acting rude again then this is proof she didn t want to live with you because of you or your kids i say don t do it but it s your choice
nta would you even be able to her parent is alive and well able to care for her what s changed why does she want adopted now i bet she won t have a good answer it s not like she said she missed you or regrets her past behavior
nta not sure the courts would accept you adopting a child that is your ex s when there is no medical necessity to i e he is very sick and won t be able to care for her soon you adopted your child a long time ago and since carter doesn t want you to it seems i would go based off their feelings alex is a bully and trying to play you they didn t want to see you until they saw how nice your home was by chance
her mom and dad can t afford to pay her university tuition in a couple of years so she needs to find someone who can afford it and kiss their ass she also probably wants a car don t fall for it stand strong and nta
nta you and her dad are no longer together she s a huge part of that
nta especially because i would bet she will star being mean again to them once you adopt her she clearly manipulative and needs counseling
i would be like do you not realize you re the reason me and your dad are divorced lmao why on earth would i adopt you i would have zero relationship with someone else s kid who ruined my marriage
nta there s multiple options here first would be to reference the bad behavior and flat out say no second reference the bad behavior and say you can start with some weekends together slowly add more time as the ex agreed and just see where things go and how they play out making sure it takes over a year before any decisions to give it time to see if it s an act kids can t keep up a charade as long as adults and third tell her maybe after she turns and until then spend time together and if she still wants you to adopt her then you guys could talk more about after she turns i am sure there s other ways as well but these are the ones i thought of
nta because alex is obviously manipulative and a bully you wanted to be a family and she refused only wanting it to serve her interests she lashed out without any help from her dad to help navigate the difficult family dynamic and chose to be a terror to the other children imo that kind of behavior does not get rewarded and it is obvious she doesn t care for you or the other children as a family
nta whatevet her motive it s not loving you as a parental figure and wanting to make it official she made it clear she didn t want it and her request is inconsistent with her behavior stay out of her game and focus on protecting your younger kids from her bullying
do you still think of her your daughter do you still love her as your daughter it s very possible to still adopt her as long as ex agrees you re nta if you don t want to i m just seeing posts saying you can t since you re divorced but you can it s not blood or legal ties that make a family it s what s in the hearts
nta alex controlled your marriage don t let her control your divorce too the offer for adoption was for when you were still married to your ex if she s not nice to your kids then as the primary custodial parent you have a say in your ex s visitation that s the leverage you have over him to parent his eldest alex doesn t need to be super nice and bend over for her siblings but if she s outright hostile then your ex only gets supervised visits alex is she can be left alone at your ex s house for half a day or so it s sad that carter is suspicious and alex acting nice weirds him out it speaks volumes about the abuse he s suffered at her hands over the years emily might be sad if alex ignores her again but if that relationship is based on how much money you re shelling out how long will you keep the gravy train running so emily is happy if alex is in it solely for the money the day you stop paying is the day she breaks emily s heart better to rip that bandaid off asap so emily can heal and move on
nta good god why would you even consider this don t do it that kid caused your divorce she wants money and stuff she s not your responsibility and be damn glad of it
nta don t do it she will be treating you like a bank tell them you can t adopt someone who was abusive to your kids and that her desire to be adopted now makes no sense and stop her from coming to your house
nta you divorced your husband and split your family because she was so adamantly against being adopted and you being a mother figure in anyone s life now that she feels let out she wants to be adopted she doesn t want a family she wants your stuff from what you described her behavior hasn t changed other than acknowledging your son and daughter she hasn t apologized she hasn t sat done with you to discuss why things have changed with her she hasn t even made real efforts to get along with your kids other than not bullying them she immediately went to ok you can adopt me like you re doing her a favor this sounds like a ploy for your husband to get back with you and for her to benefit from your money i m sure once she moves in she ll treat your children poorly when you aren t around your ex had a chance to make things work and he chose to ignore your concerns not believe you and refuse therapy tell her to get therapy or counseling first and you two will revisit it again
still i don t want to be legally responsible for a kid that i m pretty is only pretending to like me and being nice because she wants things from me the problem here is that you are right she only sees you as an atm she is only being nice because she sees that the other kids are living and getting better than she is however those are the consequences of her actions she choose to be mean and to act out and destroy your things to the point that you had to leave for the mental and emotional well being of yourself and your children she choose to refuse to be adopted when she was given the opportunity to part of the family she choose to turn her back on the love and friendship instead to bully and ignore her siblings now she is seeing the grass is greener but the gate is locked and the fence is high and wrapped with barbed wire she missed her chance you are no longer a family and she is no longer your responsibility nta
yata i m conflicted on this you are not an ah but you did say if she changed her mind kids remember these things and she was obviously going through things as a child regardless of her motivations you made a promise to a child that is something sacred and must not be ignored for those saying she is no longer family yes she is she will always be her step daughter and brother and sister to the other children kids don t always get it adopt her if you can she probably needs a good role model like yourself in her life i can t possibly imagine what she has gone through in her life where she keeps having to choose sides and be all alone bc people can t get along adopt her and love her like your own your life and hers will be better for it she doesn t deserve to be rejected she is still a child yes yo is a child god bless
nta but my heart breaks for that kid something is terribly wrong
i m honestly torn because i am seeing a teenager who was asked if she wanted you to be her mum and she tested you then her family just imploded and she is reaching out to see if you actually meant what you said and you didn t you divorced your husband not your step kids but now you have the opportunity to keep her at arms length and are doing just that so would you be ta for not becoming her parent when you can t love her unconditionally no but were you ta to make a promise that you would be her parent when she was ready when you couldn t love her unconditionally that s where i am torn because i am sure you meant it at the time but it s not a promise you can make if you can t guarantee to follow through on it maybe esh alex for being a nightmare teen you for making a promise you wouldn t keep your ex for not approaching you about the promise in private although i can kind of understand he doesn t want alex to think he didn t spring to her defense so that s a bit of a split decision for me
nta the circumstances are different now you re not even with the dad anymore alex successfully caused you two to break up and now all of a sudden she wants you to be her mom i think you re right that she sees what her siblings have get and realizes she screwed up and now wants to play happy family
nta let me give you reasons to stand your ground you have more money then her dad she sees it now she s a bully your kids have to deal with her when they see their dad people are saying give her a 2nd chance no she doesn t deserve why would you give someone a 2nd chance after bullying your kids
don t do it nta
the part that makes me feel conflicted is that i have learned that alex has been nicer to carter and emily since she has been over pfft that s after you were broken up assuming she s happy than before totally bs alex s consequences are hers alone nta pray that your ex is still alive for alex s sake maybe you need to tell your ex to get alex a job in case still no to adoption
nta money aside you have no obligation to adopt her since you are no longer her step mother i personally think she sees the situation as wow they get all these cool things that i want and is not actually interested in being nice to the others carter was happy when you asked him if you could adopt him she chose to be rude and spiteful to you him and the youngest for that you need to trust your gut on this
nta part of your marriage ending was her bad behavior do not reward it
nta why would you do that she is literally the reason the family got broken up
nta the context for adopting her was in an attempt to unite the family now that the has ended the offer went with it honestly it feels highly manipulative for her and your ex to try to hold you to this commitment that was clearly tied to being in a family
nta seems a but weird your ex is also pushing towards you adopting her as well sorry but after the abuse she put you and the little ones through i d be worried she would revert back to it once she s got her foot in the door or if you ever say no to her over anything if you don t let her stay up late is she gona bully you or the kids again will she flip if you won t buy her something you say you re worried she will revert back to being mean if you refuse to adopt her but you said already she doesn t act up in front of her dad should you find out she has bullied them on visits then stop contact and seek legal advice explaining her abuse if she abuses kids at your house send her home and tell ex she is banned from coming over again given her history you do right in protecting the other kids she d only be using you for gain rather than love and that is just so sad
nta this child broke a trust you had in her when she treated her siblings so atrociously making you feel that they were unsafe in her presence the fact that her brother your son says her acting nice is suspicious is another red flag your first instincts was no leave at that for now offer to go to counseling with her and your other two children if she turns it down your instincts that her motives weren t pure are right take your time don t rush to adopt because she your ex are attempting emotional blackmail on a promise made prior to alex s actions contributing to break down of the marriage be open honest about how her actions hurt that therapy is needed to get past that hurt don t rush it say years from now after therapy you have no hesitations adopt her but do not adopt her when you feel the way you feel right now
nah except your ex she s young and confused and we all acted shitty at age esp when trying to be in a blended family however ur not with her dad anymore so why would you adopt her what s up with your ex though it s a little odd that he didn t keep custody of carter when you divorced is he unstable i wouldn t adopt her either but if she can be polite and respectful i d still allow her in my home to spend time with her siblings
nta
nta at all
nta
nta it would ve been appropriate to adopt her while you and the ex were together but doing it now is kinda odd
nta you adopted carter when you wa with your ex alex had her choice and made it she now clearly trying to destroy your family you broke up with your exonce because of her you think if you allow alex back in your life she won t go back to her own ways

nta your sister s husband is homophobic your sister knows he s homophobic and is happy to use you as a babysitter but not stand up for you
nta i always question when people try to hide reality from their children g is clearly homophobic and is projecting that onto his family your sister also the ah is sacrificing you to protect the stability in what she is accepting as a solid relationship her friend can stay out of it you ve clearly identified that this is a family concern so i don t blame you for bringing in your parents i think understanding your sister s mindset is critical in ensuring this does not escalate further what irritates me most is that g s relationship with your sister is accepted and fine but yours is confusing and cause for psychologist visits he ll probably pick one that supports his pov which will simply make matters worse i worry that if g doesn t accept the reality that is gays existence your going to lose any relationship you have with your sister that she accepted this and married him is appalling i m sure there were more than enough warning signs
nta they expect you to babysit but to hide your relationship they don t get to eat their cake and hide it in the closet
nta you didn t do anything wrong here and g sounds like a real ass your sister s anger is misplaced it sounds to me like she s conflicted about having married g because he s homophobic and it all came to a head when she somehow thought it wouldn t it sounds like she loves you but is not strong enough or willing to go against what g says also and this is just a side note they re very aware that you re gay they seriously didn t think that would ever come up with the kid
nta god forbid you start teaching the kids to be tolerant and accepting of different people at a young age
nta your dad is cool edit updated in light of op reply below
nta your sister chose to marry someone who doesn t respect you she knew this before she married him and continued to make that choice i m so sorry but your sister has made her choice she made a choice g is exactly who he has always been further your sister and her husband are completely aware of who you are so it was completely unreasonable for them to presume that you wouldn t answer extremely basic age appropriate questions from this child they asked you to babysit for the weekend the delusion and arrogance are astounding your sister made an unfortunate choice and only she can fix this it s not you it s her
my sister asked me if i would take care of d for this weekend so she and her husband g could take a weekend off to celebrate years together did g know you were watching d i don t understand why they d ask you to watch her when g s so homophobic nta what did they expect did they think you wouldn t be around your bf that weekend for some reason i thought he lived with you but re reading it doesn t look like he does i think it s silly they re taking her to a psychiatrist and want you to pay for it why did they send her to your house in the first place if they re so worried about her learning about gay people people mess me up sorry you re going through this
so let me get this right a man who knows you re in a committed gay relationship was totally fine with you taking care of his daughter for an entire weekend so he could have some alone time with his wife but he was completely surprised when his year old asked questions about said gay relationship and got angry when those questions were answered with in a very age appropriate way what an a and you op are nta
nta i know this is painful for you but i gotta say g is a total psycho i hope you don t internalize that hateful sob s reaction his issues are legion
nta you didn t really explain anything wrong to a kid it s not like you went into the nitty gritty that guy is just super homophobic
kids shouldn t have any idea what sexual orientation is that s why she has absolutely no idea that she has a mother and a father kids also shouldn t know what blond people are and is far too young to know about brown eyes s nta your homophobic sister and her husband are they have no legitimate argument to support their barbaric perspective i m glad your parents are standing up for you
nta he s going to sue you for what existing g needs to get over himself also your sister s marriage isn t circling the drain because you re gay it s because she married an intolerant ah who is always looking to find something to get angry and self righteous about i hope that someday soon your sister realizes that it s not her job to manage his feelings for him and leaves
nta how else are we going to end generations of hate if we don t normalize that love is love no matter the gender
nta in todays day and age it s common for families to come in all shapes and sizes the kid probably has classmates with same sex parents and is going to learn about it sooner than later
nta i will never understand why telling a child that gay people exist is such a crime it s literally just a fact of reality gay people exist it s not like you told this year old about sex or anything explicit when i was about i lived with my father brother dad s gf and her two kids her daughter years younger than me was hurling insults at me very common for people in the home to do that and called me a lesbian i asked her if she even knew what that word meant she said no and i said it s a girl that likes other girls and so what if i am one she told her mom who ripped me a new one and insisted my dad make me move in with a relative because she couldn t have her daughter sharing a bedroom with a lesbian i didn t have to move out though i wish i had been granted such a mercy but i did get an earful from my dad about how it s inappropriate to tell children about gay lesbian people
nta your sister married a homophobe you gave a small child a very innocent answer it s not like you went into all the details and scarred her for life bil needs to talk to that psychologist about his own issues
bigotry aside if you don t want your kids exposed to gayness perhaps it is best to find a non gay babysitter idiots and then there is the whole bigotry thing you did nothing wrong your sister and her husband are the as as for bringing your dad into it they threatened to sue you so ofcourse you were going to respond
clearly you are nta wtf does your bil think he can sue you for the only thing d needs therapy for is homophobic deprogramming
absolutely nta the more it s normalised to children the quicker people like g will die out i doubt very much that the kid has been traumatised by your shocking revelation g is pushing his own insecurities and homophobia onto her your sister will need to make the decision of being ok with living with a homophobe and losing her family my sister divorced her husband because of how he treated our gay brother hopefully your sister will see the light your parents sound fantastic by the way
if you worded it like you wrote you are totally nta saying that a man can love another man same for women does not i repeat does not harm anyone in any way or fashion my year old son knows this for over a year now and he is a totally normal boy in all ways the girl is only confused because her parents made a big deal out of it
nta dude threatens lawsuit you get legal advice your sister is the biggest asshole here with the on being supportive stand your ground and go no contact with them
nta your bil is clearly a homophobe your sister may have once been supportive but by marrying someone who treats homosexuality like a character flaw she s showing what she really believes in many ways she s worse since she s known you all her life yet still chooses someone who thinks your sexuality is a mistake i m so sorry you re going through this rely on the friends and family who support you and rest assured you are definitely not an asshole here
nta my god what planet does your sister s husband live on i m sorry you re going through this
g is trash like your sister
nta please hug your dad for me
so your sister married a homophobic bigot and wants to pretend it it ok she is not on your side nta
sister and husband are right you shouldn t have explained what gay people are to her they should have nta
so i can run conservative ish on some issues but not this one i genuinely don t understand what g thinks you did wrong here this is simple age appropriate explanation for the fact that relationships come in lots of different forms which she brought up on her own heck i m pretty sure i had almost the exact same conversation with my oldest around this age when he asked the same question definitely nta for your explanation nor bringing your dad into it when g threatened you g is definitely an ah a major one
being gay is not a mature or age dependent topic for example if a year old can understand that you can have a mum and a dad they can understand that you can have a dad and a dad or a mum and a mum you did absolutely nothing objectively wrong or inappropriate i m very sorry that people are acting this way but it sounds like you have a good dad and you know what in today s society that wee boy is going to question whether his dad s beliefs are true or not and if he went quiet after you explained or spoke about it later it stuck in his memory enough that he will remember this when older if that kid is gay himself you ve been a highly important and positive part of his life as he may never be allowed to be around another openly gay person for years nta
nta g is homophopic so this is on him and somewhat on your sister too as she must have known his views while marrying him and having you as her brother as the wedding shows it could have blown out on any moment but eventually it did
nta the way you explained it is exactly how it should be explained to a child that man is clearly homophobic and your sister doesn t care
absolutely utterly nta g is a complete homophobe like we didn t already guess and it sounds like he s turning your sister into one i really feel sorry for d once again i repeat you are nta
nta your sisters homophobic husband brought up the lawsuit so it is totally understandable you reached out to a trusted lawyer you know and totally ok to answer that little girls question about the kiss nothing wrong here your sister seems like an asshole too good that your parents stood up for you
nta as soon as your brother in law started with his stupid behaviour you were absolutely right to involve a lawyer you can trust the fact that the lawyer is your father is neither here nor there g is an awful person and your sister is proving herself to be an awful person if she supports g s bigoted agenda
nta g better cancel disney plus and pretty much every child tv show going because shocker in most shows include all types of family set ups and relationships because it s normal life my year wouldn t have even blinked at the kiss because he would have just seen it as grown ups kissing although he has zero time for princess films so he is exposed less to the classic man saves woman stories do you know what move he does love and i have seen multiple times this week disney strange world can t say i have seen any signs of physical damage kids are not born with the thoughts like girls and boys kiss boys and boys don t that s taught behaviour no need to guess who taught her that
nta if anything it sounds like g is the one that s confused here
nta what exactly were you supposed to do gaslight a child into thinking the liss didn t happen adjust your completely normal behaviour with your boyfriend to avoid any questions while doing a favor for her homophobic ah of a dad your sister is also an ah she can t be blind to her husbands views and is ok with them while having a gay brother who is directly impacted by not only her husbands but societies backward and hateful viewsm she should be an advocate i d be severely disappointed in a sibling marrying a homophobe i d probably reduce contact to a minimum
nta all kids should be taught boys can like girls and boys girls can like girls and boys what matters most is that who they choose someone who loves them and is kind to them our kids all under are well aware of the above our oldest even learned about homophobia transphobia and is encouraged to call it out if she sees it being lgbtq is not a lifestyle it is part of who you are the only thing forcing homophobia and religious views on kids will do is destroy their mental health make them incredibly unhappy and lead to suicide you did absolutely nothing wrong i m glad your dad stepped up and is so supportive
nta esh you left your five year old niece at a mall playground for two hours by herself that seems dangerous i m really curious if that s actually what your sister agreed to your sister and husband are awful that really doesn t even deserve explanation i m sorry you have had to cope with their obscene behavior eta not exactly a playground
nta g is a homophobe and by not standing up for you your sister has turned into one by proxy
nta as others said your bil is homophobic and most likely d s confusion means she now thinks gay people are okay and bil is looking for a church approved therapist to bring her back into his homophobic fold
nta
nta and frankly i can not believe this is even a question your bil is a raging homophobe your parents are awesome your sister needs to get her head out of her ass and you have done nothing wrong
nta children should learn about identity and sexuality of such identities how else will they learn
nta i m sorry your sister is blaming her husbands homophobia and idiocy on you she s only trying to push it onto someone else so she doesn t have to feel guilty for marrying an a h
nta i m so sorry for your niece
jesus christ on a bike nta that guys a psycho it always makes me laugh that these people think children are too delicate and young to know about the gays but it s all fine and dandy that mommy and daddy kiss eachother seems a child s sexuality is fine as long as it s straight
nta your sisters husband is a homophobic ah i feel sorry for his daughter if she s anything other than what he expects her to be she ll never feel safe sharing her life with him she ll always be afraid of him being angry or disappointed and dragging her to therapy because she doesn t fit into whatever bs stereotypes he wants her to as for your sister you aren t ruining her marriage her ah husband is she s been choosing him over you for years and he s shown his true colours aggressively and shes still choosing him
nta
nta your sister is really confusing her child you really didn t even try to be seen out of respect she was going to the extreme and harassed you for money because she thought you messed up her child she is causing serious damage to that poor child ignore her and the best friend best friend just a ride along you sister was childish and you responded like an adult
nta
nta in the month of june gay pride is everywhere tv billboards advertisements etc unless you live under a rock it ll come up and you ll need to discuss it with your kid sometimes the opportunity doesn t present itself until it suddenly does this is actually a great way to present it organically like see no big deal
nta if you don t want your kids exposed to queer folks don t ask them to babysit your kids your sister sucks and she s just being consistent in her decision to pretend homophobia isn t a problem when it would personally inconvenience her to have a moral backbone
your sister willingly married a raging homophobe who was always going to look down upon you and your family nta children are not confused by lgbt people existing and you didn t tell her anything inappropriate
nta the husband is an intolerant bastard and your sis over there is completely fine with that including cutting you off from your normal interactions in favor of bigoted thinking
nta is the capitol city jacksonville seriously when kids are curious it s ok to explain stuff to them as long as it s not like where do babies come from your answer was age appropriate and the only lasting harm being done to that child is by her own father so sorry you have to go through this
nta just wow
nta what were the kids parents planning to keep them away from normal society i m surprised that the kid had made it to without having at least this basic level of explanation hope the family drama clears up
nta you only involved your family because g threatened to sue you you naturally told the lawyer you know to ask for advice and also to get support from parents because this would obviously be a big challenge your sister is ta for marrying a homophobe and for not telling you he s a homophobe so you could protect yourself
shouldn t have let the demons babysit his kid then ftr i m queer and don t think gay people are demons they re both homophobic and have yet to pose a logical argument to u and will find no psychological damage and no grounds for a lawsuit the two of them don t respect u and still expect u to do things for them u did nothing wrong u explained homosexuality in an extremely mild and age appropriate way her parents handling of this will be more traumatising
nta you did nothing wrong mate aside from letting these bigots hurt you and your boyfriend
nta i have seen a few people say he should have told the child to ask the parents to me it would still have gone bad because she would have said i saw op and his friend kissing either way i feel g was just waiting for any reason to go off on op taking d to a therapist is to me dumb the therapist will look at the dad like really then probably explain the same way op did then the lawsuit thing made me laugh the judge will look at g and tell him to go away op live your life happy and surround yourself with people who love you even if your your sister would come around i don t know if you could have the same love and trust as you did before
you are absolutely nta and quite possibly the reason your step niece may turn out not to be a bigot despite her shit head father and your pathetic disloyal sister
nta what did she expect when having a gay couple babysit her kid g is a homophobic asshole and your sister is at best a spineless enabler
nta
nta god forbid that d learns that gay people exist and an overreaction to a psychologist and making you pay you might have to cut contact to your sister since she s okay with supporting her homophobic husband
i hope one day people will understand that being gay or bi or anything else isn t about sex only like being straight isn t about that either so there is no problem explaining gay to a child two people are in love and want to spend their lives together that s it or does somebody explain his year old what mummy and daddy do in their bedroom when he she is asleep to op nta but prepare yourself to loose touch with your sister her homophobe so isn t the core her decision to marry somebody like him will destroy your bond
nta try to stay in that young girl s life so her dad doesn t make her homophobic like he is
nta
nta if anyone is confusing the child it s her own father i don t want to imagine what he says about homosexuality and is making her uncle whom i suppose she has a good relationship with when she spent the weekend with him such a bad disgusting person that will confuse her children generally are not judgmental about love also the question was answered totally age appropriate and the father behaves like op showed his niece gay porn as for the sister i personally could never be in a relationship with a person with such a mindset as g s it would put me off him really fast and forever it s so sad that she doesn t stand by her brother my aunt is homosexual and my grandmother is very catholic my aunt really struggled for years to come out to her and my grandmother struggled to accept her sexuality but guess what she loves her daughter and overcame her phobia my aunt and her family are included in everything just like us heterosexuals with their family as it should be and no one should have to be grateful for being accepted for who they are it should be the norm especially when it comes to family
you definitely did nothing wrong your niece asked you a question as any child would at that age you answered in age appropriate way i don t see how your niece seeing different relationships would negatively affect her also this won t be her only experience or knowledge as she see this in other ways through school general socialising they are completely off their rockers you helped her to understand people love and live in different ways and it s about being happy and being true to yourself her father and your sister are the ones at fault their homophobia views are the issues people or kids don t become gay bisexual etc because they know about the possibility of it they are treating you badly when you helped them out by babysitting the fact how strong the homophobia is means they will not see anything clearly and are plain crazy the fact he thought he could sue you or expect you pay for therapy that is not needed because you explained people love in different ways just more crazy your parents have just been honest and made clear that don t want him near you as a family because the utter disregard to you and them because he cannot respect others or treat them compassionately her sister is equally at fault as she aware of everything and chose to take her husband side and not her families whatever she chooses to do is on her and her alone whatever happens she has to live with consequences
nta you did presented information in an age appropriate way sucks you have to deal with it
nta he s a bigot who wants to raise his daughter to be a bigot and your sister is perfectly okay with that sorry you have a shitty sibling man
nta your bil is homophobic and your sister s integrity isn t worth more to her than him also he started the legal route first it just so happens the lawyer you consulted was your father
he was even talking about a lawsuit against me lol i am not a lawyer but is there really a ground for which op can be sued my sister is very angry at me and even her best friend texted me saying i was stupid and childish to bring my father to the matter your sister doesn t care about you or your mental or physical safety i don t see why you should feel bad for her in this case she knew you are gay and she knew her husband is a huge homophobic and yet she chose to marry him as for your best friend what were you supposed to do the guy was threatening to sue you your father is a lawyer you ask him for advice in the matter it s purely logical once again you re the victim here your sister knew the situation about her husband would not have been sustainable over time and yet she still decided to marry him
nta you have a lawyer on your side and your parents supports you so you won and you did nothing wrong explaining about the stuff to the daughter why are you gae s
nta she asked a question you answered it in an age appropriate way my general line is anyone can get married so long as they re not already related because my kid is always saying she will marry me
your sister is a homophobe i casually explained the same to my own kids that boys and girls can like whoever they want easy for kids to understand it also makes it easier for family since my kids have married gay uncles the last thing that i would want as a parent is for my kids to think that there s something wrong with their uncles who love them and have been nothing but respectful to them
nta
i got an email from g saying that he was taking d to a psychologist to see what damage i caused to his daughter and that i was supposed to pay for the session he was even talking about a lawsuit against me the kid asked and it sounds like you answered in an age appropriate way nta the husband is batshit insane if he thinks he can hide the existence of gay couples forever especially while using one for babysitting does sound that kid will need a therapy fund after growing up with a dad like that though
nta good on your father for standing up for decency and family your sister married a bigot and of course that is going to have consequences if he is unable to keep his prejudice private
nta
nta she should have thought seriously before bringing this man into a normal family accepting lgbtq family members is normal and her husband is now the abnormal person she must have been very desperate for some kind any kind of relationship to marry him knowing how he felt it was going to be an issue she tried to cover it up with ohh its his mother but its him your family accept your relationships and eventually her husband was going to experience his moment as soon as her husband started talking about suing family members of course you did the rational thing and spoke to your father who realized his daughter had made a mistake marrying this bigot
nta and you didn t confuse her i promise why on earth did your sister marry a homophobe
nta your sister knew your lifestyle and when your niece asks it sounds like you gave her a pretty simple answer it also sounds like your bil and fam are grade a nimrods you re not destroying your sister s marriage the realization of what sort of people she married is doing that all on it s own
nta your sister has no right to demand that you go back in the closet for her homophobic husband pardon me but fuck that
nta obviously homosexuality came up organically and you answered a curious kids questions truthfully what quack psychologist would even take a kid in to talk about that with a kid your dad is an a level champ tell him that your sister will come around after the divorce
nta sister s husband is just plain old homophobic when i was my parents were reading me the book and tango makes three a book about gay penguins in the central park zoo who adopted an egg it didn t confuse me because it was normal it is normal
nta and wow he is a piece of work a great specimen of raging homophobia the most astounishing thing to me is your sister supports him
wow what an overreaction you re nta she asked you answered honestly and in an age appropriate manner that s all there is to it and you shouldn t be made to hide or feel ashamed about who you love
nta your sister became a bigot for her bigoted husband i m very sorry but you did nothing wrong
nta why did your sister marry a raging homophobe if she supports you
nta but i wonder if your sister is in an abusive marriage does she seem skittish since she got married constant excuses for her husbands behaviour has she ever explained bruises if accidents as i walked into a door or i fell
nta explaining relationships in g rated terms is not inappropriate at all it s fine to explain that a woman and man holding hands are dating it s fine for adults to kiss or show affection in front of kids as long as they keep it g rated people trying to say it s somehow inappropriate if the couple is gay are homophobic it s not okay for them to make up special social rules that only apply to people like them your sister is homophobic and her husband is worse don t feel guilty for existing also tell your friend they are being a bit of a judgmental ah it s not childish to reach out to your support system or ask for an outside opinion when someone is treating you poorly
nta that topic was going to come up eventually and you handled it as well as could be expected your niece seemed to take it in stride so if she has any trauma from this it s from the way your brother in law reacted if anyone needs counseling it s g that fella has some undealt with stuff going on
i am so sorry you are having to deal with this backward nonsense nta
nta i think your explanation was perfect if d had any more questions she probably would have asked you then and there year olds do that ask questions well typically seems like she just accepted your explanation and went on with life you were right to call your father for advice your sister can die mad about it she is married to a homophobe and who knows what other horrible thoughts he harbors and is ok with that based on her reactions detailed here i m glad your friends and family are standing by your side and your father is right in not allowing g to be welcomed anymore no homophobes in his house
a kid who is old enough to ask the question is old enough for an age appropriate answer which is what you gave her there s no realistic expectation that a gay man who is babysitting your child should have to utterly conceal his sexuality to the point where he can t give his boyfriend a quick goodbye kiss either you re nta g s level of disgust with gay people meant this sort of awful behavior on his part was always going to happen at some point you just happen to be the unlucky trigger

nta i m a sahm and homeschool my year old with a toddler in the house it is a privilege to have the option of staying home it is also harder than any job i have ever had both things are true
nta because she isn t picking her children up from school due to napping is everyone forgetting now that the kids have school she has a lot of freedom and cleaning honestly shouldn t take that long if you pick one thing to do a day
itt people misconstruing op s words and not understanding the difference between privilege and opportunity
nta being a stay at home parent is a privilege that allows her to do things that people who work hours a week still have to come home and do she can barely handle the bare minimum in making sure they have transportation for school i d be making arrangements for day care and making her get a job outside the house for awhile
nta she is priviliged i would have loved to have one parent stay at home as a kid but tgey both had to work she gets to spend time with your kids if she doesnt agree with you she can go work and you both hire a nanny
as a working mother i d say she is very privileged i was at home for awhile with babies and that shit is hard and actually these kids are in school full days so she has plenty of time to herself to get things done or nap kids are messy but if you have time to clean every day your house shouldn t look like a bomb went off now i m not saying dad shouldn t help because he works but we don t know if he does or not
nta kind of first of all you re absolutely right the subjective well being and leisure opportunities and general stress levels are far far better for stay at home parents than for someone employed full time especially for salaried positions that end up with unpredictable longer hours her life is charmed and she is spoiled by any metric of human well being used at any point in history she is incredibly privileged but what on earth made you think that would be a helpful thing to say tell her how important it is to give the kids consistency tell her to set alarms tell her to forego naps until she sleeps soundly at night or if she s not sleeping enough suggest going to bed sooner treat this as a problem to solve so you re right i guess but saying that was never going to make anything better and it s predictably made things much worse
i could never be a sahm i cannot imagine how women do it the mind numbing boredom for one plus the constant ness of our give me paid work any day
info does your wife want to be a sahm maybe she hates her current situation and wants a change but doesn t know how to talk about it with you
nta being able to be a stay at home parent is in fact a privilege there are many parents who would love to be a sahp but financially can t do it that said it is still a hard job which op repeatedly acknowledges the fact is though based on the post she s not actually doing her job as a sahp she s left her kids at school more than once and didn t pick up the schools calls because she was napping that s not on call as she puts it expecting her to pick up and drop off the kids on time isn t unreasonable and pointing out being a sahp is a privilege which she s abusing doesn t make op an ah op maybe it s time wife went back to work and you hire a nanny if she s working y all will be able to afford it and that way she doesn t feel as if she s expected to be on call
info did she choose to be a stay at home wife and mother do you help her with your kids if she s napping and missing picking up the kids it may be she s overwhelmed and exhausted saying she s privileged to be a stay at home wife was not a great comment to make
nta op is not making a generalization about who does more work between them but that they op should have emphasized the plural they are both privileged are privileged enough a parent can stay home with them full time op could have worded it better but the sentiment is the same they are lucky enough to be a one parent income household op wife needs to set an alarm or go to the doctor if she can t wake up from afternoon nap
nta being able to take care of and spend time with your kids is orders of magnitude more fulfilling than making a corporation richer and having the burden of paying all of the bills furthermore i very much doubt you are doing no child care house work and house maintenance even after having worked plus hours a week once the kids are on a schedule she will have free time you won t possibly have and it s for you too not just her
nah technically that is a huge privilege that a lot of families can t afford but it s not just a privilege for her the entire family benefits you included but i can also understand how you saying that in the context you did seemed dismissive and even patronizing towards the work she does poor choice of words but i wouldn t say it makes you an ah
esh why in the name of the heavens and the earth is she missing picking the kids up from school she has the day to do homemaking on her schedule and get a nap in throwing it in her face that she s privileged isn t the right way to fix it either if it bothers you that she s a sahm then say that directly passive aggressive comments ain t it sir i ve seen in mentioned before but it s kind of important is something else going on with her medication depression up all night prepping
nta for the concept and i don t think you meant harm by what you said but i think you insulted your wife and belittled what she does contribute to your family some info is missing the kids are all in school so what are her current roles responsibilities does she have to do everything to get kids ready lunches packed and out the door to school on time while you leisurely get yourself ready for your workday does she do all of the household cleaning organizing laundry shopping cooking chauffeuring etc for the family what do you do when you get home from work what do you do on the weekends unless your wife is depressed or lazy which we don t have enough info for she might be napping because she s incredibly exhausted how often is she napping and missing picking up the kids are there other signs of exhaustion or depression also does she want to be a stay at home parent now that the kids are back in school maybe she might want to hire a cleaner and get back to the workforce i think you need to have a discussion with her about all the things and let her explain to you her feelings don t just tell her she s privileged because it likely does not feel like that to her
is this new behavior or has she always been like this
all three of your kids go to school m f for what i m assuming is a regular school day hours five times a week leaves her hours each week to do what she wants she doesn t have to work she doesn t have to worry about bills and she only has to do a full day with the kids on the weekends so days per month i have been single handedly responsible for toddlers for weeks and weeks and weeks with no help and no break i would ve given anything for even a once weekly instance of hours to myself the fact that your wife is repeatedly sleeping through school pick ups is unacceptable i would kill to have a working husband while i stayed home with the kids
you are nta for telling your wife that she is privileged to be a stay at home mom many families need both parents to work full time and take care of kids if she had to work full time on top of her current home responsibilities it would be harder that s common sense so many irrelevant comments
if she is not picking up the kids from school because she is napping i would be concerned no idea what is going on but this is very irresponsible i would suggest you tell her that she has to go to work and you will get a nanny as she is obviously bored or can t cope as a stay at home mom if this doesn t wake her up you should check what she is really doing during the day good luck
nta part time sahm here work days week the other during work week i m the kids uber chef maid and atm if we could wrangle it financially one of us would be full time stay at home it s totally a privilege not available to everyone wife should try working full time and managing home and kids to learn gratitude
info are there any medical reasons or causes for these naps is she depressed is she lacking motivation and purpose is occasionally like or three times a school year i would have more of a hey what s going on conversation instead of a you re ungrateful and you re lucky you are even able to have this choice conversation
if you wife is sleeping a lot this could be a sign of an illness she needs to see a doctor being a stay home mom is not easy hour on call every job is cleaning up after everyone do you come home and pitch in helping in the house work and with the kid her day does not stop she doesn t talk to adults all day do you talk to her during the evening listen to her problems does she have a weekly cleaner come in the help does she get nights off to relax does she get date nights does she get weekends off does her have a hobby that she can do the questions are privileged not staying home so doing the work so you do not need to
nta in today s economy it absolutely is a privilege to be a stay at home parent however when you are getting calls plural that she is dropping the kids off late and is late picking them up there s an issue my mom was a stay at home mom from the time i entered middle school when she had my siblings to years after i graduated high school when all my siblings were in school all day vs half a day i rode the bus until i started driving unless my mom picked me up for an appointment however there was one incident that i remember it had been raining for almost weeks i didn t take the bus because my mom was supposed to pick me she didn t i didn t think anything at first because she d always wait until the pickup line at my high school went down to pick me up but then i realized that there were no other cars or students around the doors were locked and i couldn t get inside to call anyone i had to walk a little over miles with my violin and a bookbag that weighed pounds on a road with no sidewalk in about inches of mud and rain to my aunt s house by the time i made it to my aunt s it was close to i got out of school at so obviously i waited longer than i should ve but still my mom never showed no one got a hold of my mom until after because she was napping honestly no one even knew she didn t pick me up until i got to my aunt s anything could ve happened to me sitting outside the school alone for as long as i did or while i was walking to my aunts i understand that your kids school noticed they hadn t been picked up but still anything could happen you re lucky they didn t call cps or the police after not getting picked up like normal
nra op is saying that the family is privileged because he makes enough to cover the bills and obviously have some for saving they are not struggling i was sahm i never got my kids to school late heck that is the best part of the day because now you have time for yourself i was able to keep my house clean cook dinner play account and take a nap i would set my alarm to wake me up a hour before pickup never was late i was in the pickup line early the best part is if the children are in school that means they are old enough to help around the house they can pick up their toys put their dirt clothes in the hamper and take it to the washroom to be washed they can bathe themselves they can help mom cook and cleanup afterwards i tried to do everything at first until my mom told me have the kids help you time management and delegate
info how often is occasionally like once a week or once a year
nta as a working mom i get what you mean but she probably took it the wrong way because of how society thinks sahm s don t do anything at home which is wrong to be a sahm is a challenging and dedicated work i also understand why for her it would be an insensitive thing to say it is bothersome though that the school has to call you guys to because she forgot to pick up the kids i wish i had the liberty to stay at home and care for my kids but then our family income won t be enough you re right it is a privilege i sadly wish i had even just until my kids are in their teens
i d take going to work over being sahm any day the paid work is usually more interesting less tedious and the hours are a lot better plus you get to talk to other adults
op if your wife was able to earn the income you did would you be a sahd if you would be a sahd then i think you have some basis to see your wife is privileged if however there is no way you d be a sahd then you cannot argue your wife is privileged as she s doing a job you wouldn t want to do my wife and i both high earners in tech and both of us get a lot of fulfillment from our careers and although we could afford it neither of us would want to be stay at home parents so i wouldn t consider it a privilege
nta only because she still occasionally gets them to school late and i have gotten calls from the school that she didn t pick them up and they can t get ahold of her because she s napping but i think you forget that yes for some families like yours having a sahm is a privilege but many other women are forced into that role because m f childcare costs more money that they are capable at making at the jobs they are qualified for and so for many families it is actually a privilege to have two adults able to chase a career
nta i don t think it s wrong to call it a privilege being a stay at home mom can be very hard and very rewarding but you have to put in a lot of work and there is a lot of temptation and opportunity to slack off you have to be very motivated and dedicated it can be hard to maintain that you have to think of it as a job and keep yourself on task you have to be a worker and the boss setting wakeup times and breaks and such it can be a very hard job it also can be a very easy one depending how strict of a manager you are to yourself it can be very hard to maintain the economics to afford your wife staying at home that shouldn t be overlooked either i think she is so upset because she knows she is falling short and wishes she could do better and it hurts that others notice that to but you can t fix something until you acknowledge it
nta so many women would kill to be able to stay at home with their kids it s a hard job but a lot of women have to work and do most of the home chores kid stuff
nta somehow stay at home moms have convinced themselves they have the hardest job in the world and that everyone else is on a vacation a sahm to a school aged child is such an insane privilege and you re right especially since she sucks at it i d tell her to get a job asap if she can t hack it as a sahm
nta you posted this too early wait until the bread winners get home from work for a more reasonable ser of responses
i agree it s a privilege but i think the argument is probably about the second part of what you said we are fortunate that i make enough money for her not to have to work she still works slipping in little diggs like this here whether or not it s what you intended to communicate if it s what you wrote here i can only assume you ve slipped it into an argument here and there especially when emotions are high and it would definitely eat at me too saying she works and you understand sometimes is completely negated when you say the above at other times i also have a nest full of kids and i am completely exhausted at the end of the day there s days after tucking then in i just collapse on my bed without even pulling back the covers or changing into pjs so i can understand falling asleep without meaning to or seeing an alarm if it happens more than rare occasions though something is very wrong
i m a sahm and i am privileged to be able to have that role it isn t always easy no but it certainly doesn t give her a pass napping instead of picking up your children nah time for her to get a job and put the kids in after school care unless you want cps involved
nta
nta i stg nobody reacts maturely to hearing that they re privileged when it actually is very much a privilege to make enough on a single income to keep one parent home but the bigger issue is that your wife is not doing her job if she is continuously sleeping through phone calls from the school
she s not priveleged you re nta but there s some serious problems afoot and i don t know if it s napping
anyone else think it s a hidden addiction issue no good mom sleeps thru calls unless they re medicated
esh it s also a massive privilege for you to have a stay at home wife you could not pursue your career and have the family without her the privilege goes both ways you re doing her a favour and she s doing you a favour
nta based on context but is she well i love my naps but i ve only ever slept through them when physically sick depressed or utterly sleep deprived are you a dude who thinks oh i work to pay the bills therefor i don t have to raise my children or clean up after myself if so you re a crap father and life partner if you actually pull your weight when you re home please talk to your wife about setting up a well visit at the doctor s office for a full physical including bloodwork and checking for thyroid issues and maybe a therapist
info is there a reason she might be overtired does she clean late at night is doing of the chores and errands and parenting are you only responsible for your paid work while being a stay at home mom is easier than being a working single mom are you another kid to feed and clean up after are you making her the only parent is she up all night with bad sleepers you are right that being able to stay at home is a financial choice that not everyone can make and two parents working together makes things easier other than living with an abuser there is nothing harder than being a single parent single parenting means taking the sick and vomiting kid with you to the all night pharmacy at am because there is no one to stay with them while you run out that s honestly a good thing for both parties to remember and a reminder to respect each others sometimes imperfect contributions
nta
nta it absolutely is a privilege you think people like going to work they d rather stay home with the kiddo s as would i
info did you ask your wife what is happening is she feeling ok it s not normal to sleep so much during the day is there underlying medical problem depression comes to mind thyroid problems it s classical sign of sleeping way outside normal pattern that s how we found out my mother has hypothyroidism
nta she is in fact privileged to be in a position to be a stay at home wife especially given that the kids are all in school she s on call hours a day for the kids yes and so are you and isn t it wonderful that she gets to sit around home all day while the kids are at school instead of working while the kids are at school that s quite the privilege that she didn t pick them up and they can t get ahold of her because she s napping she makes a huge deal about being on call yet is napping when she has scheduled tasks this would get her fired from a job my dude she s not privileged she s entitled oh wait she s a woman i forgot yta she clearly is suffering depression you obviously come home drink beer and play video games and are an absent father the only reason she s napping so much is that she s exhausted from all the mental load you put on her and you re probably liking pictures of bikini women on instagram maritime flags all around eta lest you think that last paragraph is hyperbole https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/12co3ya/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_is_privileged_to_be/jf2dpuq/ was the third or so highest upvoted parent comment at the time i referenced it
i don t find that privileged it would be my personal hell to be a full time unpaid caregiver to three children and full time maid with no time off no fucking thank you id rather work and pay someone else to do that not to mention if something were to happen to the relationship and she wanted to work she would not have a strong work history and would be kind of fucked sounds like a miserable thankless job tbh
i m a sahm and i know it s a privilege we can survive on one income but the way you re using it to throw it in her face doesn t sit right with me i think you need to get to the root of what s going on with her is she exhausted because of a health issue is she depressed and overwhelmed or is she on drugs i m just throwing out ideas you can be concerned but you re approaching this from the wrong angle i can t make a judgement yet
nta
i am sure to get heat for this but here goes nta my husband is the stay at home parent i want to be crystal clear staying home is work he has to keep the house clean take care of the dogs drive the kid do the laundry etc however he is the ceo master of the domain meaning if he is not feeling well and puts the laundry off or forgets something at the store there is no pressure or severe consequences if i don t do my job or flake off i lose my job and we lose our health care and ability to pay bills again i want to stress this being a stay at home parent is a job and my husband and i are partners he would never forget to pick up our kid because he took a nap
info other than work what are your responsibilities within the household
i was a sahm i would never do it again and i wouldn t encourage anyone to do it it s thankless your isolated and a slave to other people kids spouse it ll put you years behind everyone else regarding work history and income or retirement potential i love my children deeply and am grateful for the extra time i got to spend with them but it is not a privilege it is a sacrifice it is a privilege for the kids and the spouse working who doesn t have to balance the responsibilities of having kids and their work life
info how often is this happening like is she falling asleep after being awake all night with a puking kid is she late in the mornings because someone is throwing tantrums about not wanting to get ready and go to school is the house messy and never gets cleaned up are you around in the mornings to see what s going on gonna need some context either way saying she is privileged to stay home wasn t the right thing to say at that moment yes you were right in that it is a privilege especially these days and i say that as someone who was a sah mom for years but do you truly want to solve this issue or do you want to be right
nta see bill burr s bit about stay at home moms it applies to your situation
so she s a stay in bed mom nta
nta being a stahp is a job if you perform poorly at any other job you lose that one and have to find another
nta at all my mom would ve to be a stay at home wife but we literally couldn t afford it she sobbed the day she dropped me off for preschool and said it never really got any easier but it was the only way we could afford life was to have two working parents
nta i m a mom kids i do work btw but from home and i don t want to sound arrogant but seriously what are full time sahm doing all day when the kids are in school there is no way they spend hours deep cleaning and cooking sorry but no and that s ok because you are on call so she should defenetly relax a little but there is no excuse to be to late at school nap earlier go to bed earlier whatever but it s literally the sahm job to pick up the kids on time
absolutely nta i would have loved to have been privileged enough to have stayed home with my kids being a working parent meant i missed a lot of my kids firsts you didn t say her being home meant it was easy and not a job
nta i have been both a sahm and full time employee and even though there can be challenges being a stay at home parent it is in my opinion easier of the two i drove them to and from school sports extracurricular activities music lessons and all the normal activities children are involved in i also had a weekly routine of cleaning and laundry that i would stick to monday thru friday but it still was not as demanding as working out of the home full time
nta if you both agreed to that arrangement and she wasn t forced into it of course she should be doing her job maybe try asking why is she angry at you for saying this and why is she napping i mean i am sure she is exhausted from looking after the kids but also know depression is super common among sahms it can be a very tedious and thankless job she likely has no real social outlet and lacks stimulation very likely she is not only depressed hence the napping but also resentful that you get to have a life and she doesn t she doesn t even have colleagues she can chat to it might also be worth while for her to get a casual job or volunteer somewhere a couple days a week and put the kids in daycare those days just so she can have something else in her life
nta but for your marriage sake i d figure out why she s dropping the ball at home she may need a break or some therapy self care but she needs to ask for it you are not a mind reader and she is privileged to she able to stay at home
nta i would love to be able to stay home with my baby but not only do i have to work full time but i have to watch the baby while i do it
nta picking up and dropping her kids off on time is essentially part of her job as a stay at home mom i can t see napping being a real reason unless she has narcolepsy
nta it is a privilege and also hard work maybe it is time to look at some options for help if she isn t making drop off and pick up on time routinely
as much as i m a feminist and support women s right yes she s lucky to be a sahm i have a full time job a side hustle and am on call 24h for the kids along with my husband and couldn t do any different as money is tight yes i would love to have to think to kids only nta
nta being a stay at home mum is hard being a parent is hard but most people can t afford to do this for their family even though they may want too she deserves sympathy for her efforts and recognition but she needs to actually be doing it
nta i absolutely agree with you i am the main earner in our family so i can t be a sahm i d love to the months maternity leave i had was the best the house was much cleaner than it is now i spent the best time with my kids and my husband and i had more quality time together i work long hours some families it s a necessity due to child care costs some families it s a privilege because it s a choice
nta i m a sahm and i could never forget my child at school that s irresponsible and crazy to me that she could do that not once but multiple times
see the thing is she is privileged i do the same on call thing while doing hours of work for a boss while they at school i forgot my kid once because i can t tell time from an analog clock while i m sleep deprived but guess who gave me the lecture it was not my husband i can tell you that nta but in a fight you probably sounds like a decent interesting cherishing husband or just the capital letters u gnartoo deetoo you choose
nta being a sah parent is a full time job true and not every family can afford that true but she seems to be slacking at it and is being salty when the truth is being pointed out
nta but it feels like there is an underlying issue here is your wife fighting depression anxiety was it her decision to to be a sahm have you noticed any change in her eating sleeping drinking hygiene etc habits of course your children s wellbeing comes first but in order for mom to do this her needs need to be met as well it seems like a long talk and maybe doctor and or therapist may be needed to see what the buried issue is
we have three kids and we both need to work full time to make ends meet your family is fortunate nta
nta as parents you will both be on call for the foreseeable future she could also have the stress of a job outside the home and the conflicts it causes with her home life on top of the parenting duties she is lucky to be able to stay home even though it is a very difficult job parenting is hard and it s easy to get burned out it helps to be grateful where you can
yta sounds like she s probably depressed i m guessing due to the lack of a husband you re privileged you have a wife i doubt you put your fair share in if she thinks she s on call hours a day but i m guessing you don t recognise something being wrong with her so it looks like it s just laziness check in with your partner and remember why you re a partnership
nta even if the kids were home all the time she s still privileged to be a sahm not everyone has the luxury of that and if she s too dang lazy to set an alarm so she won t be late then she needs to find a job and you can use the money to pay for someone to pick the kids up and watch them til you get home if she falls asleep at that time each day then she can drive to the school park her car nap in the car and have the kids wake her when they get to the car when i was in college i had a semester where i didn t have morning classes but if you didn t get there at a certain time then you didn t get a parking space without having to wait and circle the parking lot times and play dodge ball and parking roulette with everyone else i would get there about minutes before the second morning class set my phone alarm and nap or study til class it was pretty common for people to do
nta i was a single mum and i worked full time which included about an hour of travel either side son used before and after school care when we got home it would be about 30pm dinner dishes homework washing bedtime routine sleep repeat it s definitely a privilege to be a sahm
nta
yta you basically said that your wife is lucky to do a hard and demanding job then justified it by nitpicking mistakes she s made what are you doing that s sharing the burden of raising children why are you pointing out that she s lucky when you re both lucky
yta being a stay at home mother is just unpaid work and it s only a privilege if it s the life she chose for herself her neglecting to be at your kids school on time due to napping could be a sign of extreme exhaustion or depression
yta you are privileged to not have to childcare costs for 3kids and burn through your pto to help with sick days etc something is wrong with your wife though probably having kids and an insensitive husband just a guess
you are absolutely ta in this situation she s not privileged to be a sahm you are privileged that she agreed decided to be a sahm to raise your children what contribution do you make to getting them ready for school picking them up prepping meals cleaning drs appointments games recitals playdates do you cook and clean help with homework wash clothes surely you re the only one who handles bath time yes she s supposed to be grateful i suppose that she gets to do all of this so that you don t have to worry about it in other words you get a pass to ignore it by virtue of her existence and the role she plays i m also fairly certain that you put a load of tasks in her shoulders to do for you throughout her day as well am i right picking up dry cleaning grabbing that package from the post office running that paperwork you forgot ironing your clothes how fucking dare you tell her she s privileged as if you ve done her some fucking favor no sir she s doing you a fucking favor i defy you to find a parent who hasn t been late on occasion to pick up their child i ve got two of my own when the oldest was in elementary and i was privileged enough to be a sahm receiving zero help from an entitled spoiled ass so called husband who d rather come home and play video games or troll social media than be a fucking father and contribute to his children s lives i was often late to pick her up because i was doing everything by myself sounds like your wife is too you don t mention any contribution you make to child rearing or frankly the relationship in general you are a massive ah for this comment and the people in the comments saying you aren t either don t have kids have no idea what the physical mental and emotional toll being a sahp can take or are so wrapped up in their own bullshit relationships they can t see the borderline psychological abuse of telling your partner who carries the brunt of parenthood that they should be grateful you re allowing them to carry that burden foh everything about how you wrote this post leads me to believe you re a shit husband you and your like minded cronies in the comments are really trying to make her seem like a bad parent when she seems to be the only parent you are privileged that she gets all the blowback for bad parenting while you get to look like father of the fucking year for doing fuck all furthermore that woman is a human fucking being did you at any point try to help her or did you default to complaining about her on social media if she napping she probably tired fool that s not negligent honey that s human that s momming
yta you are also privileged to be able to afford having a stay at home wife to keep life running smoothly i know it wasn t your intent to act like you re allowing the little lady to stay home but that s how it came off stay at home moms already have to overcome the disapproval of others about their perceived life of eating bonbons on the couch and you just added to it it s demeaning
yta being a sahm is interesting because it is something that some very wealthy women are privileged to do and some poor working class middle class women are forced into because they cannot out earn the cost of daycare or because child care isn t present for them that would allow them to work yta because something is going on with your wife and you are refusing to hear it from her or notice she s stressed and overwhelmed and she s struggling to get the kids to school on time or pick them up this is not a sign that she s privileged this is a sign that she s overwhelmed over worked and possibly clinically depressed you don t mention if anyone has investigated this at all she s telling you that she feels exhausted from being on call but you don t tell us what that means is she up with the kids at night what does that look like lots of folks in this thread are assuming that she s really only on deck for mornings hours afternoons hours and weekends so that would be 5x 2x15 hours that s hours a week assuming the kids are sleeping through the night reliably and zero vacations i mean your family might go on a trip but i m guessing she s still on deck the whole time to manage all the domestic labor and planning if i had a job that paid required hours a week on a typical week with additional overtime had zero sick days and zero vacation days i would quit wouldn t you and if someone told me that my unpaid hour a day week job with zero sick days and zero vacation days was a privilege i would assume that this person didn t see me as anything but a servant
fyi it s only a privilege if she wants to have to do it if she s doing it because your family does not make enough money to afford child care while both parents work out of the home then it s not a privilege it s a business decision i ve had colleagues have to give up jobs they loved after hgving babies because infant care was more than one parent s salary meaning they d be paying to work you are nta for being annoyed that she missed picking up the kids but it is not fair to call her privileged if she stays home due to childcare costs
yta her earning potential and her retirement have been sacrificed for you and the kids your career is never compromised because she is always there so you can work have you apologized and set up a spousal ira yet
did you really say you don t have to work that would be an ah move apart from that it seems you are aware that being a sahm is work you may just not realize how much work it is most people do about hours at their paid job and then get to do something else for a change a sahm has no breaks or vacation is on hour duty and does not get any colleagues for support when things go wrong
info what did she say that you were making this comment back at her this just sounds like a weird comment to make
it s only a privilege if she wants to be doing it does she
esh your wife needs to do a better job of getting the kids to school on time and being available for calls for the schools that being said telling your wife that she s privileged to be a sahm is kind of a dick thing to say even if it is true based on your financial situation
if someone says its a privilege they can stay at home by themselves working isnt a privelige its called slavery to pinkwash it is to romantizise something that you never get to relax from saying you are grateful doesnt help and that things doesnt work all the time can be a sign that the burden is too much for her talk with her
giving your wife the benefit of the doubt here maybe she is feeling overwhelmed overexerted any history or possibility of mental health struggles any of these could distort her perception of your statement she may have taken it as a personal attack against her that she is privileged and therefore here comes the attack has no room to complain acknowledging her hard work and her sacrifices will go a long way if you don t already maybe give her one morning or night a week where you handle the morning or nighttime routine with the children and tell her to sleep in or kickback and relax you got this y were ta to your wife and that s really all who matters i am sure she is ta sometimes too note she is right that as a sahp she is always on call she doesn t get to clock out usually but you can change that see advice above
esh the key language is that she says she is on call for hours a day that means you are slacking if that is true which you have not objected to here i wouldn t allow that to go unrebutted to my wife or in my own post if that s not true help her out more and she will likely not be so exhausted that she misses those times she needs to pick up the kids and get them to school on time regardless
esh your wife isn t upholding her end of the bargain and the children are slipping through the cracks this is bad your children have to come first and you guys need to be working as a team to make sure they re getting the best my sahm was late picking me up a lot as a kid and even though i understand now at the time i was super embarrassed and sad this problem definitely needs to be addressed however it seems like instead of tackling this issue as a team and finding the best solution you made her feel bad about how she s so privileged to be a sahm she probably took this as implying that she shouldn t ever struggle or complain i m hoping you didn t actually mean it that way because you acknowledge how hard she works but unfortunately we cannot control how other people feel about our actions when someone is drowning you don t tell them what a privilege it is to own a swimming pool if your wife is struggling with being a sahm maybe there s a deeper issue here that the two of you should talk about
yta it s true but you dont have to say it i m sure your wife is burnt out enough without you adding that she should feel so privileged this us a case of think it dont say it unless you just like arguing with her
yta perhaps a better way of phrasing this is it s our privilege that you can be a sahm because your kids get to be raised by your wife instead of a rando nanny baby sitter btw your title says stay at home wife all any of us want is to be valued seen recognized companies have started incorporating this into their culture eg my manager ends our 1x1 calls with a i appreciate everything you are doing thank you for your hard work it makes me feel seen and makes me want to try harder you are the only adult who knows the ins and outs of your wife s life take the opportunity to build her up instead of making comments that tear her down you love her and she loves you you ve got the rest of your life together be kind and be nice to her
nta it s not no work it s plenty of work but it s work lots of people with paid jobs outside the home do on top of their day jobs of course it s a huge privilege to not need both parents working outside the home or work that s not directly for the family
nta that s the bare minimum of taking care of school aged children i take a hour nap every day because sometimes i can t sleep and not once have i missed getting my kid i would suggest if she is that tired she get a checkup get some bloodwork but if her not getting the kids from school interferes with the breadwinner s job why is she staying home i wanted to add this right now my thing is my kids is getting older time flew by so fast and i don t know what to do it s silly but it s been making me feel real depressed i m exhausted by just being awake
