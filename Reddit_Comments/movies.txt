with major black films like da bloods and atlantics debuting on netflix how do you think streamers have or have not changed the game for black film
i am interested in watching more blaxploitation films i saw coffy and i loved it i was wondering if you had any suggestions
what are some black films in recent years that you think are on par with the spirit of
do either len or vince have a letterboxd
if you were to pick a second year that had a similar impact to which year would it be
have you had a chance to check out the regeneration exhibit at the academy museum of motion pictures what are your thoughts
thoughts on the la rebellion favorite films maybe thoughts on some of the gems that haven t gotten their due how do you think their accomplishments in the more niche arthouse scene affected the broader industry
i m late but following the podcast now
hey there thanks for taking the time to do this just recently discovered recently been binging to get caught up as autors yourself in a way what are your thoughts on the literary decision to capitalize the common noun black but not white
we ve recently seen important black films like buck and the preacher eve s bayou medicine for melancholy and killer of sheep receive canonical recognition restorations re releases criterion editions scholarly monographs etc what s a film that you think deserves reappraisal that hasn t yet received any
that s it for this ama thanks so much for taking part find our new podcast the class of right here https://link.chtbl.com/-vgevibh?sid=redditama), and huge thanks to the r movies mods for their support and assistance if you d like to hear more from us follow us on twitter here https://twitter.com/micheauxmission) or visit micheauxmission com https://micheauxmission.com). until next time len and vincent
if you re looking for intellectual discussion you re in the wrong sub here anything more than years old might as well not exist but i ll bite what is your take on someone like stepin fetchit who played numerous stereotypical roles but also made himself one of the wealthiest black people in the country in the process
i thought moonlight was a spectacular film and was astounded it actually won the best picture it deserved how do you think the black community responded to this film why i haven t i heard more about barry jenkins what s he up to
what do you think about the influential early independent film nothing but a man
this question is disrespectful just so disrespectful c mon man ain t nobody messin with mister jules winnfield stop it
len there are more opportunities to see our work and develop an audience a following and we re able to play with the whole box of storytelling crayons instead of just crime history and music
vince i think more avenues to get work out are always a good thing i m pro streamers
this is vince coffy is the best grier film but foxy brown is good stuff too also tamara dobson s cleopatra jones is a must see
this is len i m surprised vincent didn t extol the virtues of the full dolemite filmography because i won t don t do it unless you re doing a podcast where you have to watch every black film ever made
vince i would argue ava duvernay s selma has shaped how black historical films are made barry jenkins work is the foundation of an almost art house level movement and of course jordan peele laid out a path for black horror specifically and black genre generally
there s been a few i m always going to cape for pariah from dee rees it s already years old but never disappoints and it s a nuanced but frank conversation on identity and black mothers daughters black women in general dads and their queer daughters introduced me len to adepero oduye an actor who thrills every time i see her work judas and the black messiah the woman king sorry to bother you are some more recent examples of black creatives exercising the freedom that created
vince not yet
vince this is hard because after it was just an explosion but had deep breath class act deep cover juice mo money white men can t jump and malcolm x so that was a pretty busy year
vince i haven t we re east coast guys but it looks amazing i do admire the breadth depth of the work examined really sorry i missed the belafonte double bill of odds against tomorrow and the devil the flesh the world did you get to check any of it out
len looking to get out west in june and hope to have a chance to check it out i love that one of the films highlighted in the program is odds against tomorrow with henry belafonte that film made me reevaluate my opinion of belafonte s work
this is len there is a small film from jules dassin in called uptight that is set directly in the aftermath of the assassination of martin luther king stars raymond st jacque and ruby dee a really interesting political thriller about the movement at that turbulent and fractured time worthy of criterion consideration also a cool heist flick starring jim brown the split one of the better heist films of them all but slept on
don t knock i remember having some interesting thoughts about the difference between the marx bros and the stooges at that age
he directed and partially wrote the mini series underground railroad last year that got a lot of positive praise
i heard foxy brown was good but cleopatra jones is new to me thanks for the suggestions
i saw dolomite is my name it was pretty great
len nope
thanks i ve seen most of those but i ll add class act and deep cover to my watchlist
i work there and it s a pleasure to work in the space daily thank you for your response and hope to see you both soon
thanks jules dassin is one of those people whose work i know is important but who i m not familiar with and i see the split is based off a book by donald westlake richard stark i have to check that one out
it s easy to call stepin s career an embarrassment from the 21st century at a time when there wasn t much of a black community in hollywood the man took his vaudeville act and found a lane in films if he was white that same characterization would be praised for comedic brilliance like jerry lewis the man had skills and game i respect that
vince don t listen to len dolomite is iconic
vince now i wouldn t say class act is uh good but it is a bizarre example of the kid play pop culture moment deep cover is amazing though
class act is not a class act
matches the tone of the book perfectly
for those wondering it will come out tomorrow
cool i have been wanting to watch it without having to go to watch it
if i didn t go see it in theaters i ain t gonna pay for a hour rental i ll just continue being patient and catch it when it comes on hbo
not surprising i mean even for the recent mario bro s movie if you pre order it on itunes it says that that its coming out may 9th just a little over a month these release windows are just getting shorter and shorter
next aquaman releasing exclusively on hbo max
i m not defending the quality of the movie but this is just for digital rental purchase not on demand streaming like hbo max it s also extremely common nowadays so this article feels like it s just riding the hate train creed released in theaters march 6th and despite being well received was already available for rental purchase last week at the same price points that shazam will be
i love that movies are going from theaters to streaming so quickly these days i had no interest in seeing this or the new ant man in theaters due to bad reviews but will check out both at home
is that what happens to terrible films now
this is unfortunate i thought it was a really good movie for what it is i felt like it did more than it s job as a sequel i was entertained
i honestly don t want to go to the theatres anymore maybe it s cause i m old or the pandemic broke me but i just don t give enough of a shit to pay ridiculous prices to deal with ridiculous people and just not be as comfortable as i am at home it s just lost the magic
ooooof but not surprised this was a honest to goodness definition of a flop
yeah he same thing s going to happen with aquaman because these are both dceu films and the dceu effectively cancelled before either made it to theatres the flash will be ok despite ezra miller s best efforts because it s got batfleck keaton and will be launching the new dc film universe for all the superhero burnout people also don t want to go watch a film developed as part of a cinematic universe when that cinematic universe isn t continuing on
too bad it wasn t as bad as people said it was not as good as the first but still fun hopefully they keep shazam around as part of the dcu he s just obscure enough that his movies shouldn t be bogged down by too much reliance on existing canon
this is going to be more and more common companies need to retain subscribers on streaming services and big movies at least with some hype retain subscribers blockbusters that barely pay the price of their own cost in the cinema will be released faster and faster for home viewing and only those films that present an audience and potential for major financial milestones 500mm 750mm 1b should remain in theaters for longer the phenomenon of full movie theaters after the pandemic was more a post isolation hangover effect than a sustainable reality another important phenomenon to consider is the global economic situation there are countries where the cinema is very expensive here in brazil for example if i go with my girlfriend to the cinema in a ordinary room without the comforts of a vip room we will spend only with tickets the equivalent of months of netflix hbo disney stars combined to watch just one movie no matter how good the experience financially it ends up not compensating if the movie is average bad
theatres are dying right in front of our eyes creed was a successful movie and it got the same treatment
yikes
too bad it bombed it was a fun movie it feels like a classic comic book really i think the release date didnt help much shoulda been a may release imo
the new straight to video
lmao holy shit
it came out already and i m saying this as a person with little kids and who really liked the first one good marketing folks
theaters have really screwed themselves with the obscene concession prices sony bravia for no need for theaters
question on the article it says that it will be coming to apple tv and the like where you can pay to own it shouldn t it also come to hbo max since it s dc or will that be at a later date
i wish this movie didn t keep the whole family with shazam powers it worked with the theme of the first movie but it dragged it down in the sequel
cool i ll watch it a second time
i didn t even knew this movie had released i ve seen marketing anywhere i feel like companies are still stuck in the cable days where they only advertise through network show commercials
i liked the first one but dc still doesn t do anything for me and marvel has lost me too i think i m finally over comic book movies they over saturated the fuck out of the market
they would have made decent money if they had made a superman movie with henry cavill instead they thought this pile of crap will be a success clowns
cool can t wait to see it
they literally did like zero promotion for this
i thought it looked dumb af
this is fine by me i am having a hard time finding movies that make me feel like i need to see them in a theater i look forward to the streaming rental date
people with popcorn and drink at the movies easily watching a 2160p blu ray rip at home on tv and pop corn this is why i spent the money on a big tv
easy for a franchise to sink when you have a giant rock weighing you down
shame this is getting such negative reviews it was a great movie
this is all the rock s fault
oops should have gone with batgirl
they really screwed the first movie and especially this one with the release dates there s a whole bunch of stuff coming out around now and then there s the goddam mario movie
i don t think the movie was that bad i think that the current box office revenues are a really strong indicator of the economy right now the entire top does not even clear 1b combined gross the top includes d d which people have been raving about 1st weekend though creed john wick quantumania and scream vi in addition to shazam last weekend didn t even clear 100m for the weekend the economy collapsed good news i get to watch shazam tomorrow
to be honest i actually enjoyed this movie better than the first one i m also convinced that megan good is a vampire hasn t aged a day since uncle skeeter
first one was a fun movie unexpectedly never felt the need for another one
i liked it better than black adam i fell asleep during black adam
i just saw it it was pretty good the dialogue can be bad even though they re teenagers references were forced and some jokes were awful but the plot and cgi were great better than the original give it a shot
if it flopped why we going to pay to rent when we can wait it out for it to drop on hbo
well i just saw it in theaters this week
meh this movie wasn t great but it wasn t that bad
for those who are waiting it will be released tomorrow
i didn t think it was that bad tbh obviously not no citizen kane or some shit but i mean it was a good junk food flick if that makes sense i had a fun time
was anyone seriously expecting shazam to be an incredibly well selling property
nope shazam is either something a genie says or a music finding app based upon the idea of what a genie says this film was doomed from the start regardless of whether or not it was shown in theaters within one month
i didn t even know they made a second dc once again taking the l shocking i tell you
good for pirate gang
i honestly enjoyed this movie idc what anyone says
good i d much rather wait and watch films in the comfort of my own home than go to the cinema these days
this movie didn t deserve this there are far more worse movies out there it wasn t as good as the first but it wasn t deserving of any of this
i feel bad for the film i watched it and find it good enough or maybe even better than the first one
there was a second shazam movie
haven t seen it but it s shit right it looks shit
anyone seen it is it that bad i really liked the first one but the reviews say this lacks what made that one good truth
i enjoyed it sucks that people are so moved by asshole media people its a good enough movie better than several marvel movies imo
this movie was an absolute blast in theater and all the shit critic reviews are way off if you were a fan of the first movie i really think you should check it out on the big screen as it was as good if not better i could go into more detail but my lunch break at work is over and i just saw this with little time to spare it was so much fun and kicked ass in so many ways
i haven t seen it yet and same for the trailers but man no movie deserves such a huge bomb even freaking morbius grossed more even power rangers even fant4stic this must be heartbreaking maybe it s bad idk but what the hell happened the first one was nice people liked it and it did pretty good m worldwide
i m hoping zachary levi goes on another melt down on instagram
i saw this on theaters and loved it i would say this is pretty close to being as good as the original and i have no idea why this isn t doing better at the box office
rental nah
shazam fury of the gods will be available on digital beginning tomorrow april less than a month after its theatrical release warner bros announced the streaming date today alongside the news that shazam is coming to 4k uhd and blu ray on may the digital version will cost to own or for a hour rental period never once mentions streaming it will be available to rent for bucks or buy i feel like streaming means it will be on a service you pay a monthly price for that is not the case with this movie
no one watched that shit lmao
oh look it s the reason i don t go to theaters for super hero movies between disney and hbo max you see them as soon as they leave theaters
i saw it on release night good movie better than the first
no one asked for this movie
zachary levi is a hateful religious weirdo
thanks for saving me the click
i didnt even know it came out in theaters yet lol
as per article it s available to own for or to rent for 48hrs for lol wtf
neat now i feel like watching it
i know it doesn t have the best reviews but i still want to see it so i m excited
i assume on hbo max but the fact it doesn t even say that in the article is quite frustrating imo
will zachary levi release another whiny rant tomorrow too
you the mvp that was fast and i know what i m doing tomorrow
wow that feels so quick lol
i m assuming on hbo max
zero interest first movie was generic af
o o f
ok that s what s up
look at you not all heroes wear capes
holy shit
you haven t been missing much i went to go see it and it wasn t that good
i liked it thought it was fun and didn t take itself seriously does it have flaws yes is it enjoyable still yes
this for that matter i m not paying for renting any movie at home if i don t catch something in theaters i d rather just wait for whenever a movie is available on hbo max or another streaming service plus in the case of shazam it s still playing in my local theater lol
seriously i can each it in a theater for why tf would i pay to watch it at home
yar har fiddle dee dee
yeah but with it coming to streaming it ll have good copies on certain sites
why not just sail the high seas for free
universal is days with few exceptions of a month f9 nope minions no time to die and day and date peacock releases like the halloween sequels are ones that come to mind universal s deal with theaters when covid arrived loosened up was days until it hit pvod if the movie made less than million in the us opening weekend if it makes million days nope made million opening weekend but had a month before pvod f9 and minions were days making million and million respectively no time to die was also days making million opening weekend
how the fuck are these movies making money
good i hated the months wait
it s to disney
the perspective of this shot looks like depp is putting his arm around her and his hand is black haha
i had never heard of maiwenn so i googled her yesterday when she was twelve she met luc besson who was they started dating when she was and she gave birth to their child at their relationship was the basis for leon the professional barf
anyone see sophia copollas marie antoinette asia argento played such a good du barry even though i hate her
i hope they show her death this is an odd thing to say but du barry s death is always such an interesting part of the french revolution to me you see so many people who went to their deaths went with dignity poise grace or as much as they could muster under the circumstances i think in some ways this determination to hold onto their dignity for as long as they could contributed to the reign of terror it gave the people watching the executions a false sense of comfort jeanne du barry s death was unique because she did not go quietly she reportedly begged for help and cried in fear as she was being taken to the guillotine it apparently got so bad that they had to speed the execution up because she was so pitiful that people were starting to be swayed to let her go
sounds like the making of this movie was a shitshow https://jezebel.com/johnny-depp-female-director-of-jeanne-du-barry-were-s-1850307588
judging by the small amount of upvotes here i guess depp isn t being astroturfed on reddit anymore
i will say that a movie about louis xv is interesting in that he is the sort of ignored french king in between two significantly more famous kings like everybody knows about the sun king and louis xvi but louis xv is rarely talked about
does his buddy manson make a cameo
looking like christopher walken i guess the debate is settled
tbh johnny depp has done so many cartoonish roles that i can t really imagine him pulling off a good serious role these days i could be proven wrong but i personally doubt it
as a huge fan of movies i could not give less of a shit about this
he looks like he just woke up and doesn t know where he is is it truly good to be the king
can t wait to see louis xv doing a johnny depp impression
i mean at least it s not another marvel disney retread yay
why did i think that was his hand on her shoulder at first and think this must be a comedy
did depp punch a pa on this film too look up the city of lies lawsuit he settled on because the evidence was against him
not entirely on topic but did hollywood suddenly get an obsession with 18th century france or something
the french revolution was the greatest thing achieved by man

i fell asleep just reading the description
looks like christopher walken
the black hand really threw me off
i thought that was christopher walken instead of johnny depp
johnny depp has reached that level of notoriety ubiquity that prevents me from seeing him as anyone but johnny depp see also tom cruise george clooney jason statham no matter how much makeup and costume you pile on him i just see the cringey tragically hip keith richards wannabe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9agva_veye). that video is the pinnacle of self parody it s tragic because i grew up loving him and watching him grow as an actor what s eating gilbert grape edward scissorhands benny and joon cry baby fear and loathing donnie brasco etc etc but now that s all been eclipsed by the zany intoxicated harlequin fool character he plays in every movie now and the scarves fuck off with the scarves already
do we like johnny depp now or not i can t keep up
thank god we re over pretending this piece of shit is god s gift to the world
for depp this is actually perfect casting
when i see him i think about poop in the bed the drunken fights and the arrogance of that trial god he got gross
i thought he was christopher walken
yes
i m sure this will be a huge hit just like minamata which made million
pass
go johnny
depp s fucked up fans excited about this visual sleeping pill
this image came out in january https://people.com/movies/johnny-depp-as-king-louis-xv-french-film-jeanne-du-barry/) the trailer just came out today i keep posting it on this sub but it keeps getting taken down posted it again https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12e0xov/jeanne_du_barry_first_trailer_with_english/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)
well i m gonna cross my fingers and hope its good gotta love depp
nothing like rising through the ranks to be the chief prostitute
is this gonna turn out like phantom thread
plot twist her dog steps on a bee
i like the idea of an official mistress
i d be interested just in support of johnny depp this sounds like it should be pretty good anyway
one of the greatest things about depp beyond taking on some interesting parts and movies in his long career was that he was exceedingly photogenic the camera loved him in that mysterious way that is tough to describe but either given his over the top lifestyle or just the normal aging process he has lost a lot of that special quality and his eyes the mirror to the soul they say look empty of light he reminds me in a way of errol flynn who aged quickly and terribly where a coroner examining him after he expired said he resembled a year old man when he was only it s always hard to watch that sort of decline
that glass looks a bit small for a mega pint
this definitely doesn t sound boring
glad johnny depp is getting work again
love me some jd can t wait to see the movie he s a good character actor
this has got to drive that crazy ex of his crazy she s probably on a wild bed pooping spree as we speak
johnny depp fucking sucks
yes
wouldn t kick her out the bed for poopin
let s see how he screws this one up
playing an old dude who s into young girls a fraction of his age really stretching his acting chops on this one almost as much as playing an alcoholic pirate who is barely stringing things along
goddamn johnny has aged
if you believe and work hard enough you too can become a fuck doll for a king dream big ladies
just primos me you won t drop a deuce on my royal bed
does she shit in king louis bed
johnny depp is so hot right now
johnny depp is so hot right now
this looks sick
here ye here ye a spot of purple for everyone
costarring megapint
balenciaga
she likes the satiny black dude too
is that johnny depp or johnny knoxville
i hope this guy can stop acting like hunter s sparrow for five seconds that got old after a few years
she s sexier when she s blue with head tentacles
he reminds me of johnny knoxville in this shot
this
what a great honor to become the king s official mistress tm
picture of man sitting with neutral expression he s clearly a drunken wreck with no idea where he is
oh a film i m not going to watch i was a big depp fan back in the day i thought he was awesome and he loved how weird he was but he hasn t played a good role in years he can t play any other characters besides jack sparrow and to the shock of no one he was a nightmare on set people want to blame amber for his career being dead but he s always been like this to be honest i feel bad for the other people who worked on this movie their work is going to be affected by depp no matter what they do
removed
i thought he was canceled what a rip off
anyone know the director
it s interesting seeing him actually start to look kind of like brando
my relative was king charles viii last wife katherine parr
some serious jack lord vibes
jeanne du barry was the mistress that louis xv ordered a necklace for that became a pivotal scandal during the french revolution after his death see the diamond necklace affair side note the french really took any excuse to hate on marie antoinette
they had official mistresses was that better than being an unofficial mistress what is the wife then
aprs moi le dluge
wonder what depp will look like in costume
interesting king louis xv the beloved is very overlooked being the insignificant king between louis xiv the sun king and louis xvi the headless king
i thought that was christoph walken at first
i loved how du barry was played in antoinette she was hilariously trashy
so funny story my great grandmother like times removed or something like that was part of the fille de roi or king s daughters sent over to help populate canada in the s by king louis xiv
can t remember the last time i saw a depp movie where he wasn t in costume
no thanks
where s what s her name now
tim burton is getting serious huh
i remember when that guy was playing a high school kid
lucille ball starred in dubarry was a lady she loved the red hair they gave her for it and kept it as her signature color
i m sure this was a joy to film and he was great at all times as we all know johnny depp isn t a violent piece of shit with rage issues and that was all made up to destroy him through the cunning plan of simply divorcing him and then writing an op ed years later
that s robert downey jr s hand
i m glad i m not the only one who did a double take
you ve never heard of king louis xv s black hand it was his strongest hand they called him king louis armstrong
beware the black hand
he shouldn t have put the ring on
his right hand is black
r confusingperspective
were there black people in the court of louis xv
heard him talk a bit about this in the past regarding how del toro advised him to recut it some guest stars and being shelved for a long time wonder if the jamie foxx one will ever see the light of day
as for day s character he had to mask one of his most recognizable trademarks his voice he plays the unsuspecting man who gets swept up into the wild west of hollywood almost completely without using words i always wanted the opportunity to play a silent character says day whose well known voice can be heard as the voice of luigi in the new super mario bros i wanted the acting challenge it was a big swing wow this will be interesting
nobody just makes a movie for no reason who is he doing it at who versus
finally i ve been looking forward to any kind of news on this one hoping for a trailer soon
there is a spider
it will be in theaters on may 12th if you re looking for more information on fool s paradise here s the article https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/04/charlie-day-directorial-debut-fools-paradise-first-look).

finally i ve been waiting so long for this one
that sure is charlie day
he s an excellent driver
from my understanding jamie foxx s got shelved due to potential controversy surrounding one of the characters the rumor is that rdj was cast as a mexican and or hispanic character that hit on a lot of stereotypes idk the tone they are going for and how it relates to rdj s tropic thunder character but i believe that s the reason behind it being shelved
woah benecio del toro being your friend is a great resource to have when you re making a movie edit guillermo
deleted
all star weekend was supposed to come out before covid right i remember seeing a clip of jamie fox talking about it on joe rogan s podcast
i also listen to the iasip pod
can t think of any project outside of sunny and the first pacific rim that charlie day is in that is good
being there vibes
no kidding silent protagonists are pretty rare nowadays and mostly relegated to stoic badasses not regular roles

spider spider
thanks
that s a great article even more pictures i m so excited to finally get more info on this
but in a hat jokes aside i m super excited for this
i m assuming it s on pause due to them going on tour internationally
they are working on the thing that made you interested in the podcast to begin with
thought they were filming the new sunny season if you watch the episode with devito they said they were starting filming round now
yes it was driving me nuts when all the articles about cocaine bear kept calling it his final film performance
master of karate and friendship for everyone
cowgirl all the hits all the big ones
i hear he hangs dong
charlie day is not an underrated actor everyone loves him
he s a five star man
ghouls
dude did you see the sixth sense it turns out that dude in the hairpiece the whole time that s bruce willis the whole movie
this is the first i ve heard of it is there more out there about it that leads you to believe it s going to be terrible
what makes you say that i really did not like the draft of the script i read but that was quite a few years old and charlie has since made major revisions
at least it has a few cast members from always sunny lol
why would you say that charlie is a talented and smart guy and jon brion is scoring the movie
what are you basing that on
he s a famous bird lawyer
he s also well educated in bird law and catching rats also have you heard about his signature dish the milk steak
and that s not the only role he played a man in green
i mean he s also one of the stars of the longest running live action sitcom ever made and is a massively famous actor but sure we ll go with luigi
pacino
you look shite
what about it looks shite
a horse walked into a bar
if i remember correctly i think foxx was going to have multiple roles in it one of them apparently being a racist white guy i think foxx should sell it to tubi just dump it on tubi it sounds like it had an interesting plot
recently rewatched all of the indiana jones movies raiders is such a solid movie and set such a great tone for the rest of the series the article says that the opening scene with the boulder was all his design which is one of the best character introductions in film that scene with those details plopped you right into the mix without question i ve always been amazed at that kind of stuff when it came to film
absolute legend we re never going to appreciate enough i hope he knew how much he contributed to history
production designers are the most underappreciated by the public people in the movie business directors appreciate them though that s for sure if you re a good production designer you ll have legendary directors fighting over you a good pd can make the difference between an ok movie and a great movie if you don t believe me imagine if star wars was exactly the same except it looked like flash gordon rip to a great one
rip mr reynolds thank you for the joy you brought to us your films are iconic
he was an amazing man he s part of my partners family and he was nothing but generous friendly loving and a warm part of her upbringing
the fact that he worked on a indiana jones movie without indiana jones in the title and a star wars movie without episode proves he was truly from a bygone era thanks for your good work sir
rip
whenever i see raiders mentioned i think of this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2vk42y/what_movie_will_forever_go_down_in_history_as_a/coixif5) flawless hardly at the beginning while indy and his two native guides are slogging through the peruvian rain forest one of the birdcalls in the background is that of an australian kookaburra so in this supposedly flawless movie we find that the bird calls aren t even remotely correct not even close not even the same continent and this you call flawless philistine and now i know who was responsible rip
this is a sad one he also designed the sets for return to oz a visually gorgeous movie and the man designed cloud city in empire iconic
he worked on movies that if i had to guess will be watched and beloved by millions for literally the rest of human history sad to see anyone with such talent go but damn what a legacy even though a ton of people watching those movies won t know his name they re still appreciating his work his art has made him effectively immortal
the giant boulder catches up with everyone
my condolences
what a legend
thats a great run
an incredible legacy of incredible films there s many reasons movies don t look and feel the way they used to and he was a large part of that
thank you for contributing to some awesome memories i ve had growing up norman rest easy
legend rip
i wish i could thank this man for everything he gave me without even trying
may his soul rest in peace
rip you created such fanciful worlds for my childhood
good man thank you for your art rip
very impressive that he designed both the empire strikes back and mission impossible those two owe much of how iconic they are to their sets
you worded it nicer than the bbc
do they even have production designers these days or is it just the head of cgi
loved his design work in alien3
thought this was spacey
some video game indy games would be incredible all we have is the atari game and the nes games
why is it i read almost every week without fail about some old chap passing away on this sub
i wonder if they framed any of those cut off jeans shorts
it s accomplished people like this that makes me wonder what they think of the more later installments of some of these franchises his take on crystal skull or even the new mission impossible movies
another legend dead rip and thank you so much
rip raiders is one of the all time greats and the look of this film is one of the reasons
rip
big reason why these movies hold up today huge part of their success production design is why i prefer the early harry potters to the later ones everything was real when they went cgi it lost all its cool factor same with indiana same with star wars
rip
the atari raiders of the lost ark well that was the worst unending game ever so
rip to a fucking legend
i just love how well they captured that indy is not a super hero he fucks up all the time spends a lot of time running away and being generally pretty bothered by being near death so many movies with an action hero usually start with some magnificent feat of daring and indy is running away from the boulder going oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit the sets for these films were always so good because you never knew if you were about to see heroics in action or something hilariously funny jones and his dad on the trap door fireplace comes to mind it s so corny and funny
raiders is a masterpiece not just a solid movie i also loved the classroom and lecture hall in that movie much less the bar cairo and more
i think it was spielberg who said he wanted the beginning of every ij movie to look like the exciting action packed finale of another epic movie mission accomplished r i p norman reynolds
the beginning sequence is perfection the rest is also perfect temple of doom is iconic af too i honestly like cause tod is fun to watch even though last crusade is a better movie
it really makes you realize how many things have to come together to make a great film what if this scene was carried out with a bad actor bad set design bad directing bad score but at the same time replace this guy with some other person that didn t have same vision even with all the talent involved in the effort could have killed the whole endeavor
i ll say that star wars at least often comes up when people do talk about the behind the scenes teams like pretty much every big movie has a ton of background people involved but no one is ever like this guy was the storyboard artist from gone in seconds to name a film i haven t even seen because it seemed mediocre but star wars we get articles about the concept artists the production designers the special effects crew the visual effects crew the story behind how that one computer animation was done back in the conversations between the director and soundtrack composer the editor etc etc it s amazing how much attention the behind the scenes people actually got for star wars i mean it s understandable why but even if we take something like avatar where we know most of the appeal comes from bts work and we are amazed by some making of footage people still pretty much namedrop james cameron and maybe weta and leave it at that star wars seems special for how much people acknowledge the whole crew
very true production design sets the tone of a movie as much as direction cinematography or anything else
what exactly do they do
is he the one responsible for the rollerblading monkeys because that terrified me as a kid
bruh
https://store.steampowered.com/app/560430/indiana\_jones\_and\_the\_emperors\_tomb/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/560430/indiana_jones_and_the_emperors_tomb/) this was on og xbox too
i sort of disagree the problem is that george lucas is didn t know how to use it effectively
harrison ford is my favorite action star if all time because of how uncool he s often willing to look tom cruise has a lot of great qualities but i can t think of any time one of his action heroes gets made the butt of the joke as frequently as indy and han solo do and yet they still end up being some of the most charismatic characters in film history
that s my favorite aspect of the series his look of anxiety is always funny and then when he sighs and smirks in relief when something goes his way only for the henchmen to come back and punch him
henry jones those people are trying to kill us indiana jones i know dad henry jones it s a new experience for me indiana jones adjusts hat happens to me all the time
and the truck caravan what an awesome set piece without holding your hand you can keep track of the progress indy is making as he works his way up to the truck holding the ark
seriously such a perfect movie from start to finish
one of the best movies ever
one reason i liked stargate so much was it felt like a sci fi version of indiana jones with that lecture sequence to introduce dr jackson
let s not forget the score
i think tod is the weakest of the original but damn if that shot of indy on the bridge surrounded by swordsmen isn t the most goddamn indiana jones thing i ve ever seen
lucasfilm always included a lot of behind the scenes extras even back in the vhs days so his crews got a lot of extra exposure but even then norman reynolds is not a person who comes up a lot i ve heard way more about the ilm guys ralph mcquarrie and ben burtt than reynolds
they orchestrate the overall look of all of the sets in the movie that means they guide the art director and set decorator oversee construction and paint and make sure that the set designers adhere to an overall look while also allowing for any technical requirements like wild walls that need to be pulled to accommodate camera the production designer takes input from the director and director of photography to make an overall look including colors and how sparse or exquisite the sets must be to help properly tell the story it s a very all encompassing job in an elaborate collaborative process
the wheelers i m not sure if his production design credit extended to that but the man was crazy talented he also designed the well of souls in raiders and all of the death star sets amazing stuff
why not update and give us all the indy games of the past and why doesn t anyone recreate the original on todays consoles
cruise has quite a few moments in the mission impossible series where things do not go as planned especially in mi ghost protocol but he doesn t pull off that exasperated look as well as ford does
i hate snakes
yeah such good pacing almost no room to let up except the scene were they re on the boat and shows how tired he is
the opening credits are amazing the best parts of the score are heard
temple gets so much hate some deserved for inddeeyyyy every seconds and the poorly aged cultural decisions but dammit if it doesn t have incredible setpiece after setpiece the nightclub opening sequence into the car chase the iconic indiana jones plane overlay into an admittedly campy skydive the dinner scene the bedroom back forth leading to the attack the bugs the creepy af cult with the high priest in the temple the slave labor camp the mine car chase and finally the bridge scene and it just works as a pallet cleanser from the similar feel of as it takes place years before raiders
i ve always loved the documentary empire of dreams https://youtu.be/vb1da5jzdiq) that was included with the dvd special editions
thats a lot of fucking work lol
i swear they cut the boat stuff for tv i saw raiders in theaters last summer and i had no memory of that scene and i watched the movie all the time as a kid when all tnt played was that and the mummy every weekend
also the nerdiness being on equal stature with the jock soldier stuff was enjoyable
yeah we should digitally replace willy with tig notaro and it d be the best of the bunch
even kate hated that character but otherwise it is a good indiana jones movie it s just that were so much better that it seems to be bad
raiders takes place after temple of doom i never knew that
they frequently do cut sections like that for tv
good because it was boring as hell
well earned i ve seen a couple michelle yeoh movies and she is in motion in at least half of them
women in motion what kind of name is that
michelle yeoh is a fucking legend
the racist institutions that excluded people are now leeching off those people to profit off the trend this isn t like missing a few movies and not knowing about a person it s deliberately missing years of movies that weren t from us or uk
she s probably one of my favorite actors completely graceful and elegant no matter the role
yeoh is awesome but honestly everything everywhere was unbearably bad
ive always loved michelle i wish she got more romantic leads
i m so sick of hearing about this lady
who won thee men in motion award
she can t win that award she s not trans
removed
that s a still photo though
she is making herstory
damn who cares lmao
still unacceptable now that she s won the oscar she needs to be in motion in at least of her movies
in her last movie she won an oscar for playing a literal rock
women in motion pictures probably felt too long and women in movies felt a bit casual
they were tired of static women hogging all the accolades
there is a separate award for women sitting still
she s the only reason i paid attention to star trek discovery
cannes has given the palme d or to multiple japanese films with hong kong thailand and south korean films also winning nagisa oshima wong kar wai edward yang im kwon taek hou hsiao hsien and park chan wook have all won the best director equivalent not saying cannes is perfect but it has always been interested in spotlighting international cinema so i m not really sure what you re getting at here
the dinner is part of the pioneering women in motion program launched in during the festival to highlight the creativity and contribution made by women in the world of culture and the arts she s a woman she has had a hugely successful year this is one of the biggest events in films i feel like reducing this down to her only receiving the award because she is asian is the true racist thinking occurring here gong ali won the award in btw it also includes viola davis and salma hayek in less than years of giving it out if you wanted to call a hollywood organization award racist you picked a shit hill to die on https://www.kering.com/en/group/kering-for-women/women-in-motion/key-dates/
it s true i m asian and so fucking proud of michelle and happy for her but i m not blind to the cultural reality we live in and the showponying of michelle to counter sentiments these institutions favour white actors and producers that michelle yeoh won best actress means the academy doesn t have to give big awards to poc for at least another decade they should be happy to be nominated in supporting actor categories right
you re close but you ve missed the mark greedy bitches is the term the people that use any means to make a profit
i fell in love with her in star trek discovery then it just snowballed from there
sounds like someone needs a better mushroom dealer lol
and yet here you are commenting on a post about her
i m not she s awesome glad she s having a huge year
well her fans were sick of her talents going unrecognized for thirty years
has a trans person ever won it
women in film
women in motion pictures probably felt too long also wimp not great women in film is too generic women in motion works better for branding
that s just so weird at first i thought it was some kinda progressive award for women achieving milestones that break the mould like her academy award but reading the article it does seem like it s just about women in films in general
and anson mount being so handsome it hurts to look at
well her and patrick kwok choon
thank you
you guys know the individual members vote right there s not a boardroom where twelve exrcutives try to pick the winners that would make the show the best members of the academy are eligible voters an asian woman directed a best picture winner in nomadland not long ago and an asian man directed a best picture winner in parasite recently as well what exactly is your proposed alternative to not give an award to yeoh this year because it s somehow racist to award her this is the exact kind of crap racist people make up in the kind of posts you see on r asablackman
the best actor categories are voted on by individuals it s not a committee
touche
women
rhys he is a very good looking man i also have a thing for saru though i think it s the walk
not long ago it s as though asian actors just recently existed right that wasn t the point but you pointing out someone who lived through that experience as racist is kind of telling
take the man out of woman and you still have wo
wilhelm
woah man
very good looking is an understatement and yea saru s glide is mesmerizing
i can t parse what your first sentence means if this person s fear is valid that yeoh is only getting awards because she s asian and not for her skill which makes the award shows think they don t have to give major awards to asian people for years then yeoh herself wouldn t have gotten the award as their asses would already be covered from recent years she won because she did a really good job period
and the makings of an excellent adventure
woah
i love how more than years later we have never had a bad evil dead movie i m so excited for this
this poster is speaking to my mommy issues
this poster is looking pretty awesome i am stoked for this movie the evil dead was a bloody good romp
the trailer is really good
this poster is also apt for the barbarian movie
i really hope at the end of these new movies we can have ash show up in one of them completely oblivious and still cracking jokes imagine spending two hours watching an actually scary movie to just have it end with chainsaw killing bad guy and a cheesy one liner
you d be a good mom someday auntie beth you know how to lie to kids
why does it look like an ad for prostate examinations
is it a sequel to the reboot or a bruce campbell film edit seems its both campbell is producing it but not starring in it
ahem ash what are your thoughts on this groovy
still love the version the theater was packed
i ve never seen any horror movie in my life i hate jumpscares and dread the feeling of something lurking in the shadows but i m weirdly attracted to this movie i don t know why i saw the trailers and liked it should i go and watch it
i ve heard this movie is supposed to be over the top scary and gory
i watched the trailer but my brother didn t i have a slight idea on what we re gonna get but he doesn t we both are gonna watch it on premier day can t wait to see him squirm in his seat when he finally realises what he has gotten into
this is gonna be a banger looks so cool
is this a sequel to the remake
where is this on the timeline
i saw the trailer for this before john wick and it looked intense as hell
this new one looks fucking scary something i ve never experienced with an evil dead movie
i saw the trailer for this and it looks creepy i m kind of excited to go see this
words cheese grater
guy yells movie sucks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqtyek2yseo)
evil dead really is one of if not the most consistently good horror franchise
excite
i really hope this doesn t suck
in actually a little scared to watch this and i m a grown ass man lmfao excited
i ve never seen an evil dead movie can i start with this one
not going to the cinema to see it due to the fact i hate cinemas will buy it when it comes out in 4k bluray though
can t wait for my beau is afraid and evil dead rise double feature
do i have to have seen an evil dead rise movie before seeing this one i ve heard really good things about it and i want to go see it
yay i need me some more evil dead
groovy
i m going to see this with a friend when it comes out super excited
i can t fucking wait
groovy
let them come
is this gonna be like goofy like ash vs evil dead or like a sequel to the gritty one that was made a few years back
i would love if they go back to the medieval era to fight skeleton
groovy
i m so fucking excited
mommy s with the maggots now
just saw a trailer for this during john wick it looks terrifying and scary as hell
even though the movie isn t out yet i m already going to go out on a limb and predict that alyssa sutherland will be the best deadite actor ever she s creepy as shit in the trailers hell she can look creepy in real life too https://preview.redd.it/gn589u2homm81.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fede9af2edded797b5c3d62ff75dca5d6ded9e96) she s a model so in some photos she looks gorgeous but in other she looks bat shit insane she s got the eyes and the smile of a deadite
i cant fucking wait
all i can think about when seeing the trailers to this movie constantly btw with youtube ads is how much gene siskel hated the horror movie trope of children in danger if gene was still with us today he would have hated this movie lol
will i need to watch the other movies to understand this one
saw the red band trailer with cocaine bear and was amazed i m really glad they decided to push for a theatrical release because i remember seeing the title during an hbo max streaming commercial and seeing it tagged as exclusive
this movie looks so good and spooky i enjoyed the one with them in that cabin i m kind of hoping that they have some or at least one of the same characters i like seeing them make returns like for scream for instance i liked how the majority came back
mommy issues intensifying
literally the only horror movie i m too scared to watch in cinema but i need to
screw that i want another season of ash vs evil
frank cotton would like to know more
and that s how you find the g spot
is this a sequel
is this an actual sequel so part or is this a reboot but made by the og producers
sooo i got to see this was part of horrorhound weekend cincinnati as a pre con event it s awesome bloody and gory and pure fun we are seeing it again when it s out in theatres and i cannot wait
i learned a valuable lesson with the previous reboot don t eat before you watch it i knew it was going to be gory and gross but i almost lost my dave s double combo in the middle of the cinemark you ve been warned
looks pretty good tbh
she seems nice
oddly attractive
so good
i need ash vs evil back
i ve seen this already and it instantly became one of my favorite horror films so good
i found the first remake to be a big let down not an ounce of the humour that elevated the first three
midnight release nice
come to mommy seriously
this one better be a comedy
i loved the all of evil dead franchise this one really worries me the whole mom vs her kids makes it entirely predictable you know she is never going to actually do any harm to the kids and the adults are going to run around trying to protect the children and a few of them will end up dead but ultimately mommy will either break from the deadite possession because she her love for her kids is stronger or she sacrifices herself to keep from harming them the whole save the children horror trope is way over used
saw a trailer yesterday noooo fucking thank you movie looks crazy scary lol
if she use fingers im down
who s the director
nope
just saw the trailer for this before john wick it looks great but they show so much just in the trailer i hope it wasn t just the best scenes
my girlfriend when she is on periods and wants to have sex
is this poster actually sexual or am i just too far gone
if you squint really hard the hand arm kinda looks like a chainsaw maybe an easter egg edit attempted depiction https://imgur.com/a/nwfpk84)
if you want to know how to pleasure a woman that s how
and this is how you examine a prostate
can t wait evil dead ass the zoomer version where ash has a floppy haircut and is like i m finna blast you with this shotgun fr fam
ok the trailer for this played before a movie i saw and why the fuck was the trailer so scary lol i don t know if i can watch this it looks horrifying but also like it looks really well done too
i am so tired of seeing this trailer ad on youtube over and over and over again i will never watch this movie simply because of that shoving something in your face repeatedly is not a good marketing strategy it s annoying
ugh fucking sickening quite honestly why can t executives just let beloved classics remain that way literally every time they try to do this to recapture the magic from an old and well liked movie they fall flat directly onto their faces and ruin not only their new creation but they also taint the original with their corporate greasiness literally the first thing that popped into my mind when i read the headline was that scene from the office where michael just screams no god please no nooooooo bunch of bloodsuckers
the fact that we just keep seeing this one image worries me
is bruce campbell in it if not then a hard pass
idk i m not feeling this new one the trailer looks okay but wasn t what i was hoping to see after the evil dead i want more lore gore and dark eerie creepy set and settings evil dead overall tone was the intro in the woods perfect
when she s going down on you but you feel something inching towards your butthole
yea finger me mommy
inject

be a good boy and cum for mommy
it s being released in the wrong time of year though it will be on streaming to rent or for free by halloween so i look forward to that
hollywood out of new ideas coming to many theatres near you for many many years to come
this looks bad as in not good another perfect example of the were out of ideas people are sheep let s keep doing remakes trope
why do we need remakes when we already have perfection
movie poster looking more scared know more about evil dead rise know more about evil dead rise https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11y6m16/evil_dead_rise_2023_release_datecast_and_full/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
eagerly waiting for this movie missed the evil dead since last decades
i used to have nightmares as a kid about my parents going crazy and chasing me down to kill me after seeing the trailer for this movie i will not be watching the film
thought this was the new little mermaid for a sec
i can t wait to watch the movie and cover my eyes during most of it i love fun gore scenes but some of those from the trailer looked nasty
wow expect
wow he hit triple digits dude s a legend
pretty astounding career hickey boggs grease rocky stripes a lot more he also worked on deceiver which is a favorite of mine it s a criminally unseen neo noir from the pate brothers with a great cast tim roth chris penn michael rooker renee zellweger ellen burstyn rosanna arquette michael parks unfortunately it s not streaming anywhere but it s worth tracking down rip
for having to figure out how to film from a creature s pov in water due to a constantly malfunctioning shark prop butler did a swell job and got some amazing shots along the way one of my favorites is when quint is looking down at brody and says hooper drives the boat chief and all you see is quint s silhouette in the sunlight damn i remember doing a project on this little sequence of shots in a little film class i took
one of spielberg s production designers just died too weird coincidence
responsible for maybe the best dolly zoom shot in history
don t forget he also filmed one flew over the cuckoo s nest absolute legend and a huge loss
rip gone too soon
how d he die
for a second i thought this was about that guy who s family built this country
rip mrbutler
he lived a long accomplished life you can t get much better than that rip
rip and both movies are in the national film registry his works are now immortalized
safe journey mr butler
i didn t even know he was sick
bill paxton s frailty and the conversation and demon seed is underrated films that he shot he was an ac for the original star trek and was 2nd unit for deliverance and the godfather he helped with the second worst movie of all time xanadu of course he filmed the absolute worst movie of all time can t stop the music https://youtu.be/gcw6gn7kfv0
what a life
taken far too soon
not sure if he was healthy all the way to the end but more years than anyone could hope for
weird to think he would ve been in his s when doing grease and jaws
jaws is my favorite movie and this scene you reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjmo-dydeuk) illustrates all the elements that i believe makes this a perfect film as well writing directing editing acting effects score as well as bill butler s cinematography are all at a level also keep in mind butler had to film many of the boat scenes on the actual tiny boat and in open water before we had steadicams and digital equipment
that whole generation of filmmakers is getting to that point really sad to see they were among the best to ever do it
wrecked his harley at bike week
he saw the trailer for the new grease
i mean this guy died at got to that point awhile ago
i can t find any other documented cause of death so this is the current leading explanation mind if i cite you on bill s wikipedia page
he actually seems better now than he did a decade ago judging by how clear his speech is that makes me happy
i got to see this at the sundance film festival it s really good it s an interesting look about michael j fox s journey through his career and his diagnosis with great conversations that are honestly quite touching
this looks fucking great i was so prepared for this to have some somber tone of his diagnosis and how its effected his life career while i m still sure some of that may be included int he doc this looks to be far more upbeat and how he s overcome a lot of difficulties in his life super stoked to watch this
i sometimes forget how much of my childhood this man was a part of what a legend
just a heads up if any of you want to see some behind the scenes stuff on back to the future check out the movies that made us on netflix lots and lots of interesting shit happened during that production my favorite bit was when they went into detail on how crazy crispin glover is he argued with the director because he felt his character wouldn t use doors and would enter his home through a window they also had to build a wooden frame around his legs to prevent him from walking off his mark michael j fox s part of that production was also pretty crazy he would shoot that tv show in the morning afternoon and then bttf at night only really slept on the road between both of the sets
apple tv is fucking killing it
man fox is just so charismatic entertaining to watch in pretty much any role a true movie star obviously not the most important thing but it is sad that we lost the rest of his career and kind of sad that he spent the last few years of activity tied up on a sitcom that as entertaining as it was doesn t really have any lasting cultural relevance would have been interesting to see how he aged as an actor
wow that s great trailer
my dad has parkinsons and its been really rough on us all i look forward to showing him something positive with a man he recognizes
this looks excellent also if spider man was made in the s he would have been perfect as peter parker
this will definitely be on the watch list
god i m not ready to cry like this
my dad died because of this disease wouldn t wish it on my worst enemy it s going to be hard to watch this
i m gonna cry like a bitch
the man the legend the michael j fox
lots of wonderful films in this trailer obviously the bttfs but greedy mars attacks teen wolf secret of my success are all great movies loved watching them all countless times growing up
this looks great all of mjf s books lucky man no time like the future etc are fantastic very honest and enlightening and really funny at times too he s pretty forthcoming about not only his diagnosis but also his alcohol issues insecurity as his career waned etc i d say get the audiobooks which he reads if you re into that and his foundation has raised over a billion dollars for parkinson s research in years which will probably be as much of a legacy for him as all of his film and tv work his short lived post parkinson s sitcom the michael j fox show is up free to watch it was on tubi but i think it s on crackle now and while it s not necessarily a great show it is neat to see them really steer into things betsy brandt from breaking bad plays his wife on it too
that was a really well done trailer
when i was a kid i thought michael j fox was one of the coolest people ever i still do but i did back then too
sigh another show i d love to see on another service i don t subscribe to
i m not crying you re crying shut up
been suffering from tinnitus lately and he has been an inspiration to look at someone stuck with a lifelong condition impacting his daily life and still doing it with a smile i hope to get there
movie titled still that s actually pretty funny
i really miss him his movies made growing up in the 80s 90s so much better just recently rewatched doc hollywood
gonna admit that he looks great underrated actor for sure
dude is a legend instead of letting parkinson s dominate him he dominates it from what i have heard he has dedicated his life to fighting it for others really good dude wish we got to see him more
i love this dude made me very happy watching his films
god imagine how big this guy would have been if he didn t get such shit luck i feel so sorry for him no one deserves that
good to see mj fox is doing ok i don t know if this could be a revival but i hope he can do a few more films tv shows
im not crying you re crying
this sounds like an excellent documentary and since it s on apple tv i will definitely pirate it
what an amazing human being
gonna watch this for sure
i love double entendres in titles always lets me give my parents mini lessons about the english language
the title has to be a joke
get ready to cry
an inspirational man
wow i haven t seen him in a while and expected him to be doing a lot worse by now but he seems to be doing even better
he was such a massive part of my childhood can t wait to see this
there aren t many with a star personality like his as memorable as some of his roles are his spots in curb take the cake for me
hahaa still i get it
took a while to get this made for a while things between michael j fox and apple were a little shaky
i m glad he s doing so well he s gotta be on the really good experimental shit
he looks like he could have one last comeback tarantino should write him a role

he s the essence of teen s to me even now like i wanna watch teen wolf now
no shaky can effect
removed
the title is unnecessarily mocking considering he s anything but still other than that i hope this will be respectful and well made
i ll be back in two shakes
he is and always will be a hero
hell yeah year of the comebacks
i love this man so fucking much
still
fuck that s a brutal title that probably goes too far if anybody but m j fox came up with it
i m gonna watch the shit outta that
i love mjf he s a god to me
hah almost forgot about teen wolf gotta watch that again
looks good poor dude but he s got more heart than most of us
still lol cmon it s kinda funny love you mjf
dammit i love this guy
i think i read that he takes medication so the symptoms are not as bad but he doesn t take them at cons or events to raise awareness for the disease
he once handed me a soda and it exploded all over my favorite sweater i thought he did it on purpose but he blamed the parkinson s
same
i was surprised with how in control i guess is the phrase he is
is it overall upbeat or downbeat
if you read his books michael j fox actually hates people speaking with any kind of somber tone about him or his diagnosis he despises pity and openly states that it s the worst emotion people can show to him he considers himself lucky that parkinson s actually gave him meaning in life and there are countless people that are far worse off than he is
80s and 90s had some real banger movies
i was a kid watching spin city because i was a a mjf fan as a small canadian kid he s a great role model
i remember watching spin city a lot but when he left and charlie sheen replaced him i m pretty sure nobody watched it great supporting cast too
i was watching the bttf movies w my kid the other day for the first time i hadn t seen all of them in years or more what struct me as an adult watching is just how funny mjf is really great comedian and also clearly just a really smart guy listening to his insightful funny commentary on the blu ray interviews sad to think what the second half of his career could have been like
i remember seeing footage of michael being physically carried by crew members to the car to escort him from one set to another due to him being too exhausted to walk
michael j fox s part of that production was also pretty crazy he would shoot that tv show in the morning afternoon and then bttf at night only really slept on the road between both of the sets that s been widely known for a while people site it as a reason his illness progressed the way it did before he was diagnosed
just binged shrinking and was not expecting to love it like i did one of the best shows i ve seen in a while
just binged shrinking and was not expecting to love it like i did one of the best shows i ve seen in a while
ted lasso is the fucking goat pinnacle of television in my mind but you also have shrinking severance and i m sure others i m completely blanking on atm
indeed severance was a masterpiece and i really liked what they did with foundation they re really putting out some quality content
shrinking ted lasso schmigadoon severence banger after banger i just wish their turnaround time was faster on new seasons
he was amazing as milo in atlantis the lost empire there s just something so genuine in his delivery it s been ages since i ve seen the movie but i can still hear his lines it s only a grease trap it s just like a sink it s only a grease trap it s just like a siiink
spin city also doesn t hold up very well in terms of the material it uses for jokes
reminder to is all how important representation is
one day at a time for me it s life i know it is hardest on my wife and kids
i must have watched secret of my success about a thousand times such a great movie
didn t see the frighteners there thats my favourite from fox by a mile
for love or money was one of my favourites
mjf s biographical content always has great titles one of his books is titled always looking up the adventures of an incurable optimist
if memory serves he titled one of his autobiographies still me edit nope that was christopher reeve
seems like he pretty in on the joke of the title
i read your username as throwawaycunt and thought it was pretty appropriate
i remember when he spoke at congress once in favour of stem cell research and he was quite shaky some conservative politician accused him of not taking his meds so he garnered more pity but fox responded that he had actually taken too much and it was a side effect of that not saying this is always the reason of course just reminded me of it edit seems i misremembered probably rush limbaugh i was thinking of in response to fox s commercial political commentator not politician thanks to those who refreshed my memory
i believe i ve read the same thing iirc the reason was people essentially saying nothing is wrong with him it must not be that bad when he was medicated being relatively wealthy he is able to afford a level of care that the vast majority of parkinson s patients can t for anyone who hasn t seen parkinson s close up it s horrific my girlfriend s father has it though his seems to be decently controlled via medication and can essentially live out the rest of his life normally her uncle is currently in the late stages of it and isn t expected to live much longer
i saw him in portland last month and he was pretty rough this explains a lot guy is a class act though along with tom wilson christopher lloyd and lea thompson
the downvotes tell me some people don t watch curb your enthusiasm that s one of the best episodes
of course he did you were being an ass
without saying too much it s a mix of emotions it can make you smile cry or such
i loved his cameo on curb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi4lfjwofqc
thats awesome
he s definitely doing a lot better than a lot of other people with the condition i don t know how he s managed it for years
i listened to his latest book in audiobook form with him narrating loved it can t wait to watch this
i think most of us will always remember him for bttf but i loved his other fun movies just as much like the secret of my success frighteners and the hard way
bella why are you here dominic wtf did i do
fiona shaw is on such a roll and she deserves it great actress
mcnulty
i just finished the wire now everywhere i look i see an actor from it
sounds great ruth negga is great
this film will be reeking of listerine and jameson
love ruth negga
jimaaaaaaayyyyy
i m always up for more tulip the fact she s irish blew my mind when i d only known her for preacher
i d love to see bella dafne keen and maisie williams in a movie together somehow they re all so kickass but either way really happy to see bella getting some more role well deserved
we ll be watching bella was incredible in tlou and got
love fiona
bella ramsey so hot right now meme
what s a hanway
pedro pascal is also a last of us and game of thrones star
liked her in got but not sold on tlou mcnulty is always a solid addition to anything
that s kind of mean title
i m interested because of fiona shaw she did such a great role in andor
mcnulty
distinctive role does that have a double meaning i don t get seems like an odd choice of words
sorry but this is the worst witch erasure and i won t stand for it don t know exactly what i ll do about it but not stand that s for sure
ellie mcnulty raina maarva andor noice
i am happy for bella she deserves it better her than millie bobby brown tbh
ruth negga is amazing
she has been great in all three things i have watched her in i hope she continues to have a great career
things bother me about this article one is confirmation that tlou2 won t film for awhile and two is that the article explicitly mentions that bella goes by different pronouns than how they refer to them the entire article
i m so happy she s getting steady work
she s not interesting enough for me to care what she s in next but i m happy for those that are and for her
pedro pascal and brad pitt together in a buddy cop movie make it happen i really wanna see brad pitt in a stupid but smart comedy movie like will ferrell kinda stuff
her acting in the last couple episodes finally got me to like her character just wasn t digging it much or the show really for that matter even though it was the last campaign mode i actually played i just found most of this season as ok nothing we haven t all seen before dozens of times over the last years imo
i would not want to have to announce ruth neggas name at an award ceremony
bella has a lot of work to do to have a long term acting career and get a lot of parts good luck to them
removed
barbie is not out yet and i already want a reboot with bella ramsey to keep up with the times roll over body positivity it s time for the next big thing in our culture face positivity if you can t distract me from your face with your sheer acting caliber then i don t want to hear the script
monstrous yes beauty not so much
omg i just realized she s the girl who was the queen from one of the houses
hey its mcnulty
won t she be the lead in last of us season
ruth negga still the girl in the flower dress
i m most excited by the director romola garai she directed a really dope horror movie called amulet not for the faint of heart
dominic west is awesome
ruth negga she s awesome
ruth negga please
after andor i am so there for anything fiona shaw does i ve enjoyed her performances for years but she really knocked it out of the park on andor
it s uh it s gonna be awhile for season huh like the wait for tlou2 all over again
bella fuck fuck fuck dominic fuck fuck fuck
why are you here bushy top
i m on a wire rewatch and something to this effect is exactly what i hoped to find entering the comments
dominic in my office rip lance reddick
hahaha
watching season for the first time and he literally just said that as i saw your comment
fuck the empire
i once saw her do beckett s happy days in london it s an absurdist play where she s the only one who talks and gets progressively more buried in rubble as the play goes on i went in hating the play came out loving it i don t know how she accomplished what she did on that stage but it was incredible i think doing that play must be like the acting equivalent of performing heart surgery and she crushed it
i ve found her terrifying since super mario brothers
my time has come the universe is mine
jimm aayyy
mcnutty
fuck
old bushytop
you can never go back they re everywhere blew my mind to learn wallace was michael b jordan
i m living the exact same experience rip lance reddick
in season of the office michael scott references the show the wire then in later seasons he meets characters played by actors from the wire idris elba amy ryan so i wonder if in the office universe were those roles played by other people or does michael just not realize that charles and holly look identical to actors from a show he watched
bubbles was in the spectacular now burrell was in an episode or two of grey s anatomy bunk was in twilight breaking dawn part marlo was in halo reach clay davis was just in cocaine bear that s not even mentioning the big names like idris elba wood harris and michael b jordan
loved her character in preacher
saw her on broadway last year as lady macbeth phenomenal performance
loved her since agents of shield she s great
that last name tho
i love her so so much beautiful and talented
deleted
can i say her name
how exactly do we pronounce her last name
the fuck did i do
passing was seriously overlooked
bella dafne keen they were both in the same series
dafne and bella were in his dark materials together
dafne keen huh like maybe in a marvel disney series like maybe what happened after logan
well two already have had marvel roles specifically in x men related movies she could probably be a solid kitty pryde and she does have some resemblance to elliot page s portrayal not that you d need continuity but still maybe pixie or tempus for a blank slate
she has a very bright future ahead of her really looking forward to watching her grow up and do more she was so good and young in got it made me just want to root for her and see her succeed
don t forget catherine called birdy she was hilarious
when i saw her as lyanna mormont i told my wife that we d see big things from her she s a fantastic actor
pedro and bella basically my favorite side characters in got getting some amazing roles and succeeding big time we re going to be seeing both of them for a long time to come and they both seem very chill and humble
and star wars and dc he s assembling the pedro infinity gauntlet
re tlou i think ashley johnson the original voice and motion capture actress for ellie set a standard that would have been impossible for any year old actor to match i d go as far to say that her performances in both games particularly part ii are amongst the best or even the best of their respective medium there s a reason why tlou is the most awarded story driven video game series of all time when production began for the first game ashley was she had double the life experience of her character which made for a performance that was bound to be more interesting than any other ellie aged actor could give line delivery was more interesting jokes were funnier dramatic moments hit harder because she knew how to deliver everything with more nuance again all that comes with experience and to her credit she did it all believably the player never questions the performance because it s that good same goes for troy baker as joel compared to bella who is far closer in age to ellie she obviously does not possess that same level of experience as ashley and bella s not a bad actor at all but i agree with what you said i think it just comes down to how the original performance was impossible to match
did you open the article to see what it s about literally the main character is born with a rare condition that causes them to grow hair everywhere on their body and they wind up at the court of king charles ii where they are on display mingling with the aristocracy while also being an actual human person with feelings
how is it mean
i m always glad to see her pop up in something she s one of those truly great character actors who elevates everything she s in
i agree it s weird wording for the headline but based on the beginning of the article i think they mean it as a synonym for memorable or unique
she s distinctive alright
she really is her southern accent in preacher was so spot on i truly thought that she had to be from the south i was quite shocked the first time i heard her speak in an interview
yeah she really has no talent at all the charisma of a potato
the lady mormont
that s protestant whiskey
i d watch it again if hbo max becomes available in uk it s not going to be until i think due to sky
she was really great in andor
that s actually apparently what the originally had in the script and may have filmed but it got changed to fight the empire but the intent is still there
sounds like she got crushed by rubble because of the rocks
she was she played that role excellently
my dumb ass was thinking the animated one that just came out for a sec
i unironically love that movie a work of entirely accidental genius
you know what the plural of pussy is _pussi _ jimmy taught me that
i work odd hours and days but one luxury is that i can go to a tuesday matinee with all the retirees no kids
the social contract of mutual respect in public seems to have been completely thrown away in the past years or so and only getting worse
i went and saw the new scream a few weeks ago and minutes in to the movie a family came in with their phone flashlight to use to find a seat they had a child with them maybe years old to a scream movie they proceeded to eat some chicken wings loud af and had the kid playing games on their phone the child talked non stop me and my wife got up and moved closer and as far away as we could they ended up leaving minutes into the movie this is why i pretty much have given up on going to the movies it used to be me favorite thing in the world to do now i hate going because of how shitty people are
that is the new standard these days acting like an ass in public is the new vogue imo
not only in cinemas but theatres too try going to watch a play or musical without a disruptive audience you ll be incredibly lucky if you manage it i spent a lot of money on a premium seat to see the woman in black in london in november and it was pretty much ruined by the audience i m not sure if it s the same elsewhere in the world but in the uk it s very common for the west end to be swarmed by school groups especially for plays studied as part of the curriculum romeo and juliet an inspector calls the woman in black etc they just have absolutely no respect for the audience or performers constantly talking audibly so laughing with their mates playing on their phones i felt bad for the poor ushers who were running back and forth down the aisle trying to quieten them i don t blame the teachers either there s only so much adults can do to wrangle disrespectful teens i get it they re teenagers and they re excited to be out with their mates rather than at school but that doesn t in any way excuse disrespect and disruptions it s put a massive dampener on going to the theatre which is already a rare treat as it is since the pandemic audience etiquette has just dissolved there were idiots in the past naturally but it s exacerbated to awful levels now don t even get me started about people who loudly sing along with musicals you are not the main character shut up and enjoy the show don t ruin it for everyone else
i ve been noticing it more since theatres reopened over covid it s one thing to cheer for a movie but to have full conversations and be on your phone most of the movie kills my socially anxious self everytime to say something it s always teenagers too
i adore theatres and am a voracious movie fan but covid broke people s brains or something because the theatre experience has been unbearable since they reopened i have not had one viewing where i haven t had to tell three separate people to put away their phones and stop having full conversations i m done with theatres i think it s not streaming that s killing them it s inconsiderate people
i m fine with people being intrigued with what they are seeing and reacting to it but there is such thing as too far and people just acting like asses throwing food and drinks around screaming random things and acting like idiots is just unacceptable
on one hand there s no more social rules in public because of how little peer pressure there is or too little community self accountability everywhere s free for all restaurants gyms theaters etc the pandemic made it worse as people no longer seem to know how to behave in public and those folks are having kids and not raising them to behave in public etc etc on the other hand i feel movie theaters did that to themselves by not enforcing their rules in favor of selling tickets now the average person who can behave in public refuses to go to the theater as to not have to deal with sociopaths so there s only sociopaths left theaters like alamo are the last bastion but even there very few people will snitch to get someone kicked out so folks are increasingly annoying there too still its happening everywhere because there s no more accountability now if a business does try to warn customers or kick people out they ll immediately get recorded on someone s phone posted on youtube harassed karens will make a scene etc its tough
i actually quit my job as a manager at amc in because of how unsafe i felt i had to write at least incident report a week and i was having to call the cops on a regular basis whether it was normal customers or homeless people i was constantly dealing with all sorts of problems every day but one night a man straight up chased me around the theater cursing and threatening me he repeatedly said he d come back to get me and it was terrifying the next couple of days he was showing up and looking in the windows my coworkers and the security guard didn t tell me for those days because they didn t want to freak me out well as soon as i found out i quit on the spot and walked out not dying for a job
the pandemic drove people crazy antisocial and mad
so cinemas are becoming the new airplanes
i had a dude in a movie theater yesterday a row in front of me casually on his phone brightness all the way up
got a projector and pretty much only watch shit at home now unless it s something big things come to vod pretty quick these days so i don t ever feel like i m missing much i had a lot of fucking awful experiences pre pandemic and was reaching a breaking point then after a few years of no theaters i don t really want to go back people suck and basic etiquette has gone out the window when some guy yelled yo do you think shes had her period yet id fuck her about hawkeyes daughter at the beginning of endgame i think i hit my limit
they actually banned people under from my theater after 30pm because of this
unless you re at alamo draft house the whole respect of theaters is gone peoples phones out to record the screen and post on their social media accounts scrolling thru social media during the movie having open conversations this used to happen just not as much and it seems like people are just accepting the behavior i guess it s a side effect of people getting used to watching movies at home where they don t have to pay attention and the behavior just leaks over
it s not just in the cinema it s in shopping malls school college fast food places etc social media like tiktok have made a generation of stupid little sociopaths that will do anything including causing stress pain and anxiety in others for likes all laws need an overhaul to take this crap into account like if you commit a low level crime like harassing someone but are doing it for social media then it gets bumped up to a higher charge including hours in jail confiscation of equipment involved a fine all devices owned that have access to internet being also confiscated and then something like hours community service including supervised work helping with vulnerable people such as in old peoples homes and with disabled people all of that should come with a warning to never do it again and after months when they get their devices back if they ever do it again then it is a longer term jail sentence like months seems harsh but will nip all this crap in the bud
our current reality seems to be an overlap of idiocracy robocop and a clockwork orange god have mercy on us all but especially me
i love that the only specific example in the article is some dude getting a wedgie at a screening of john wick
thanks for reminding me why i haven t gone to the theatre in so long nothing is sacred anymore
anecdotal but i feel like after the pandemic quarantine people forgot how to behave in public
i see a lot of people complain about disruptive behavior while feeling either unable or maybe afraid of doing anything if wishing to avoid confrontation no need to talk to the person if you don t want but any theater worth its salt ed popcorn will have a manager who is happy to politely do something
went to a 9pm showing of the latest thor on opening weekend there was a group of people in the front row that had their toddlers with them and let them run rampant back and forth across the front of the room screaming and crying and then were playing videos think baby shark and cocomelon loudly for them on personal devices in addition to talking loudly amongst themselves this lasted for the first minutes of the film no one said anything thankfully they abruptly got up and left with their kids in tow before pm must ve been bed time
love going to the movie theater here everyone is church mouse quiet and almost everyone stays seated until the credits are finished rolling and the theaters are sparkling clean and well appointed tickets are more but popcorn and drinks are cheaper
i don t think there is some new wave of inconsiderate animals in theaters i think every years we remember how terrible people are in the s i couldn t go to a theater without a laser pointer showing up on the screen gangs of teenagers were roaming theaters yelling at screens getting in fights cell phones in theaters have been a problem since razer phones were the norm none of it is new
they need to bring back ushers
my wife and i went to see m3gan as a date night last month we left halfway through because a group of guys were acting shady af they kept taking turns leaving the theater and one was visibly angry and slammed the theater door open as he left we both got a bad feeling and decided to leave my bil is an avid movie goer and says it s gotten way worse especially on discount nights people have just gotten so trash these days
it s cool that movie theater workers in the uk have a union in the us movie theater workers aren t even required to be paid overtime
this has been a problem where i live for a long time hollywood hot shots always talk about preserving the theatrical experience but never ever talk about how to actually improve it and make it good again maybe christopher nolan and steven spielberg need to make that a priority for theaters there is a reason why i d rather watch a movie on streaming in my own living room rather than go to a theater because every theater is filled with people who are either talking playing on their phone bringing loud kids to the theater and just causing all kinds of distractions in general at home i don t have to worry about being around any weirdos other than my family
i haven t gone to an amc or cinemark in years because you always run the risk of some asshole ruining your movie we have a local place next to the house that basically has lazyboy recliners but up charges on seats they also have assigned seats so i never have to worry about getting their earlier etc if i want to watch a movie though i pay the difference to ensure a better experience
i gave up on going to the movies in vip or otherwise people taking calls and people using their phones to check movie info with a bright display letting their kids play games on the phone it s a trashy setting the last time i went to cineplex dunds vip in toronto for black adam moviegoers recorded the movie on their phones one of them kept taking photos with a flash and there was no one from the staff in the vip lobby never again will i go watch a movie
as a current employee of a theater i can agree with everything in this article even if it s the other side of the atlantic the fact the d d popcorn vessels sold out caused so many people to rage in our faces it s getting hostile out there in cinemaland
a film and tv lawyer who recently went to watch a showing of john wick chapter told the mary sue that she saw some very sus behavior she explained there was some commotion on the steps in the middle of the film and it turned out this man was being given a gigantic wedgie film and tv lawyer using the word sus is rather suspicious
personally i like seeing movies in a theatre but dread going because some dipshit s who were never taught how to behave often wreck the experience
i have been a regular movie goer for over years now seen movies per week up until covid and about one per week since fortunate to only have had a few bad experiences in those cases someone else notified the manager hope it stays that way i love movies at the theater
imagine mcu stans acting like football hooligans in a theater
i ve never seen this at a theater
guess i m just lucky i go to movies all the time haven t had a single issue there were two times in the last months someone had a crying child but they got up and left immediately in both cases haven t had any loud people disruptive people no one on their phones nothing i ve seen films in the theater in the last months and that s not counting ones i ve went to multiple times
it started with the dipshits clapping during movies when their favorite super hero shows up cheering so loudly that you miss the rest of the lines in the scene its evolved beyond that and that s why i ll wait and watch movies at home on my inch tv thank you very much
i have never had big issues at a theater the root is the rise of entitlement and people just being assholes
it s reassuring to have my misanthropy justified
i went to see two films today the first the super mario brothers movie had a ton of kids in the theater i told myself before the film started that some of the kids would be talking and i was right it was only two kids but they were excited about the film so i let it pass the second film air had me sitting next to a couple who would shut up even after i asked them too thankfully the theater was about half full so i just went and found another seat the new seat was a much better viewing angle so i thought that the couple talking was the universe s way of finding me a better seat i have had a ton of problems with people taking and i have yelled at a few people after i asked them to be quite i love going to the theater but i now have to pick my seat and what time i see the film a lot more carefully
i know people were disrespectful assholes before the pandemic but i think covid broke a lot of people s brains
it s been pretty hit or miss for me lately while i haven t seen racial slurs thrown around i have seen people become more impatient than i remember and be increasingly loud with some people going on their phones during the movie or talking about something else as well as this one isn t really new nobody knowing how to throw away trash or pick up after themselves
it s hilarious the way people are blaming covid trump social media and other modern societal scapegoats on their poor movie experiences kids have always acted like morons in movie theaters it s not a trend or anything even remotely new
y all need to meet their energy lately i ve sternly told people sitting in front of me can you get off your phone during a super quiet scene in the movie and it always works these morons feel empowered to be on their phones because no one says anything
a lot of people are complaining about misbehaving teens but old people who don t know how to use technology are also terrible i had a senior next to me have on the audio description function where the phone describes everything audibly you press so alexa or whatever is blasting full volume while this dude is scrolling his phone i was in fucking shock that it lasted for about minutes until he fixed it and it was a fucking play i don t think i ve ever cringed so hard in my life
i feel so lucky that this hasn t been my experience
laughs in alamo drafthouse
scrolled past an r oldschoolcool post of high school in and came to the same conclusion as i did after seeing your comment smartphones have ruined almost everything
i go to movies a lot and besides laughing at funny parts i quietly went woo when bane broke batman s back that s the extent of my acting out at theaters often i am also a little buzzed but i m quite as a mouse
i ve never had a bad experience at a movie except for puss in boots where kids were occasionally talking and i work at a theatre i ll never stop prioritizing a theatre experience
i read the title and was wondering about this new wholly unacceptable movie that must ve just came out and was curious as to how it makes cinema staff uncomfortable
just a cock tease article to get you to download their app
people still go to movie theatres weirdos i haven t been to the theater since avatar showed because of people in the theatre
people still go to the cinemas
they lost me when they took out the stadium seats in favor of those fancy buckets some things didn t need an upgrade they reminded you why you were there in the first place you want to sit in a lazy boy to warm a movie stay your ass at home
the problem is i don t want to get up to complain to staff and miss some of the movie they need to put the first minutes of every new movie on youtube so i can pre watch it and then if someone is being disruptive i ve already seen what i m missing
without clicking i m going to guess it s the amish
unless i explicitly want a group activity i will always prefer watching movies at home that said i find it interesting that while some people agree that cinemas have gotten worse others don t have problems with other patrons even if you don t count alamo drafthouses so i wonder what determines which theaters are respectful and which aren t
my dad was cheap as hell the only good thing i got from him and he d only take us to the movies for matinee screenings preferably on a weekday and almost always after the movie had been out for or weeks so the theater would be virtually empty it s something i still do to this day i m now of course between ticket prices being insane plus it being easier than ever to have an excellent home theater setup i basically don t go to the movies anymore for a while i would still try to at least hit the imax for the big tentpole movies mostly the extra buzz worthy mcu films but i don t even bother with that anymore the last two movies i saw in theaters were spider man nwh and ghostbusters afterlife and i don t see anything slated to come out in the next few years that ll make me come back
this was probably our own fault for going to a kid s movie on a weekend but we took our dad to see lightyear bc he was a huge toy story fan when we were kids big mistake not only was the movie awful but it was like fucking daycare in the theatre kids running up and down the aisles everyone was talking teenagers very clearly snuck in alcohol and kept making inappropriate noises as loud as they could during quiet moments seriously it was like a zoo i m really excited to see the mario movie but petrified of stepping foot in a theatre again
i manage a local cinema and we ve had to ban teens outright because of multiple dangerous incidents that we were fully unequipped to handle including a person brawl where someone eventually pulled out a firearm it got really bad and now we are stuck having to argue with angry parents all the time because they can t just treat us like a babysitting service and leave their kids here for or hours
yeah maybe but honestly i doubt it these fucks are pretty tech illiterate i wouldn t be surprised if they just shoved the ear buds up their nose or something
tell me again about how great it is to share the movie experience with other people i love that fairy tale
our findings are a resounding call for the industry to do better by its workers and for audiences to consider and amend their behavior that ought to fix it
this is a clickbait article that includes one anecdote about dudes giving a guy a wedgie then running out of the theater not discounting that weird things happen in public but this article is awful
this thread will get triggered if you scroll through i m fuming right now and i haven t even been to the theater for like a year
this is happening everywhere
movies theatre is an awful experience all around stupidly expensive moronic people
i get mondays off and i am the only one in the theater even on release week
matinees are one of life s greatest pleasures
god going to the movies by yourself is the best i would ve never tried it until i got fired but had to make it look like i still had a job and yea i m a piece of shit for that but i found something i really liked so fuck it
this is the way i ve been soloing tuesday matinees since the joker perfect blissful experience every time i can even sneak a beer in and fart xd
i can t remember the last time i went to see a movie that started after pm the later showings are just filled with teenagers who aren t allowed to go anywhere else on their own and are bent on ruining the experience for everyone around them
i can t remember the last time i saw a movie in theaters on anything other than a tuesday
fucking hell the old lady s club is some of the worst talkers around me
hey that s how i saw eeao and ended up with three year olds talking the entire time
its been throw away the moment social media started turning the stupidest humans into millionnaires
public pranks need to be outlawed unless both parties consent do what you want in the privacy of your own property but having total strangers get gaslit constantly creates a general sense of unease also the idea that you can have anyone follow you around recording pointlessly without any consequence is ridiculous
who could possibly have predicted that creating a society that encourages people to care about themselves would result in a society of people who only care about themselves
yeah outside of some actors and musicians generally speaking most people got ahead because among other things they projected a general understanding of a social contract or good graces we have waaaay too many people in politics now who got to the top precisely because they are openly a monster that s emboldened a lot of bad shit in our society and it s come on pretty damn quickly
ipad kids are growing up
i agree and wonder if anyone is noticing the same as me year olds on phones audio on high watching videos or speakerphone for calls completely unaware that no one around them wants to listen the worst is if people are scrolling through reels and the audio changes every seconds the last few years i ve started to notice this everywhere i go trains coffee shops standing in the mall as a youngish person living in a country where age respect it can be hard anxiety provoking to ask them to turn their audio off and they never have headphones in contrast i find young people carry headphones almost everywhere so i rarely notice them doing the same this is part rant part question anyone noticed the same
worse in some circles better in others with social media came a weird detachment that incites people to behave anti socially but feel validated about it but cameras on everything has definitely put the fear in some that would otherwise be unafraid of being held accountable for being a piece of shit
covid really did a number on society basic respect for other human beings has largely gone extinct
agreed a few years after everyone got a smart phone decency went out the window
yup stopped going to movies for this reason
yep the days when strangers would sit in a dark room and behave for two hours are over just release every movie on streaming and let theatres die already
especially over the last three years i ve mostly stopped going out since before things locked down can t say i really miss it and being out and about in general is taxing cause of this shit imo
no you just hear about it more
welcome to america where the people that are vocal about the deterioration of the family unit are called bigots and idiots it all goes back to bad parenting every social issue goes back to bad parenting
if you have an alamo next to you don t give up on movies it s made clear to everyone that if you talk during the movie you will be removed
my girlfriend and i went to see a couple of family oriented movies a while back one was sing i can t remember the other and in both instances a huge group of teenagers came into the mostly empty theater and were constantly on their phones talking joking and generally making a ton of noise two of the boys in the group were supposedly trying to be funny by running out and screaming in the entry hall to the theater the teen closest to me was very obviously uncomfortable that he was a part of that group because he kept apologizing to me and telling his friends to keep it down i hope he didn t get bullied after that for being courteous i never did anything obnoxious or distracting like that when i was in my teens so maybe i m just boring but from a purely logical standpoint i don t understand why anyone would spend all the money for a movie ticket just to not even watch a movie you can socialize and be wild in places that are free
literally went to go see air today and a family came in late and i m not even joking within like minutes the dad pulled out his phone and started playing games i managed to lean back a bit so the light wasn t in my view but i did notice a woman in front of me literally put her hand in front of her face to block out the light from the phone i usually go to thursday night showings since most people that go seem to be more engaged in watching the film but yeah lately i ve been dreading going to the movies on the off chance that i encounter people being disruptive
a few weeks ago my and my girlfriend went to see a horror movie called huesera if you don t know the movie it s a very graphic and disturbing movie about a new mother who s haunted by an entity that takes the shape of a woman whose bones are bent and broken in all sorts of ways again very disturbing stuff so imagine my surprise when minutes into the movie and during a very graphic sex scene the entire row in front of us gets filled by a group of unsupervised children i almost lost my fucking mind
this is why i pretty much have given up on going to the movies it used to be me favorite thing in the world to do now i hate going because of how shitty people are exactly i used to go to the movies almost every single weekend if i couldn t get a friend to go with me i d check out something by myself now i have to sit there and really think can i wait a couple months to see this or do i want to see it now with john wick i had to see it now with dungeons and dragons honor among thieves i figured i could wait till streaming to see it especially since the crowd going to see it will probably be younger which means there is a bigger chance of interruptions and distractions
i m curious to ask where you live or what kind of area i always read these horror stories but am fortunate enough to have rarely encountered issues at the cinema and can count on one hand experiences that were annoying and i go to the cinema maybe once a week
i wonder what their thinking was they paid all that money to watch half a film on top of everything other egregious thing they did
just went to go see john wick and these parents brought their year old daughter with she was surprisingly pretty ok and kept to herself she would have an outburst every once in awhile but god what horrible parents
some highlights from the article alex convery was an unproduced screenwriter with a few scripts on the black list including one about stan lee and jack kirby at marvel after having his heart broken several times he vowed never to write another screenplay until he saw potential in a boardroom story about nike s rise thanks to a segment in the michael jordan documentary the last dance affleck and damon did a rewrite pass on his screenplay but gave him full credit partially because they knew how tough it was to get their first screenplay good will hunting made
the last dance was actually really great
it s kinda wild they re just straight up making a feature length commercial for shoes and releasing it in theaters
i guess you could say damon and affleck were good script hunting
i want an expanded air verse with mj playing a small cameo role in each film milkman bus driver etc
thought they were talking about save the last dance with julia stiles lol
for a moment i thought this post was about the band air until i realized it s r movies
they make a reference to what air is about in the lakers hbo series and it s really great they offered to magic johnson what they eventually offered to michael magic wasn t willing to take a chance on it and signed with converse or reebok instead i forget which
they should do a sequel to air called clay about phil and travis knights takeover of will vinton s studios and how it eventually became laika check out the documentary claydream if you want to get some insight into this story
this movie was fantastic
can t wait for the movie about the making of air
i don t give a fuck i m not watching nike propaganda
deleted
movie looks like a snoozefest
i misread the title and thought he saw save the last dance spent too long trying to connect those dots and realized i was an idiot
if my brother responsible for driving excitement for youth sports wrote this article i d ask do you want the brother feedback or do you want some notes
i just hate line in the trailer what s a nike nike bruins were popular in the 70s everyone fucking knew what nike was
given how kevin smith basically used his rep in the 90s to get their foot in the door with their screenplays it s nice to know that they pay it pack on the flip side
it s bonkers that a few guys that young achieved something as good as good will hunting although i have to give robin williams some credit too
that is very kind of affleck and damon they remembered the struggle so there is empathy in their action
affleck and damon did a rewrite pass on his screenplay but gave him full credit partially because they knew how tough it was to get their first screenplay good will hunting made worth noting that someone i genuinely don t remember who helped them with rewrites on good will hunting and went uncredited as well so i see it as repaying the favor in a weird way edit his name is william goldman
so good i just rewatched the whole thing again for the second time just fucking riveting
why do you say actually it s at almost on rotten tomatoes with basically a avg
it had great footage and access which makes any documentary great but it was kinda watered down a episode jordan commercial i prefer documentaries that don t need the principle subjects oversight the tiger woods documentary on hbo is a excellent example of a documentary where the subject didn t get to dictate the story
the corporate business world has been a big setting for movies for the past few decades
origin stories are always fun
we re also getting a feature length commercial for barbie this year and apparently one about flaming hot cheetos and the feature length nintendo commercial is blowing up the box office as a write this
a story about a company that uses sweatshops is now a feel good movie it s like the fifa movie all over again
realize that the shoe named after michael jordan is iconic and not the other way around put some respect on his name and how hard it is to achieve greatness but yea a shoe movie
not the first time honestly the original space jam was basically a nike commercial
the part series did so well might as well bankroll a nationwide theatrical reimagining
space jam literally was directed by a dude who made commercials maybe feature length commercials is just michael jordan s thing
where s my jennifer government movie ffs
how is this comment getting downvotes
it s about the atmosphere all life on earth owes its existence to the creators of the last dance and that one guy who watched it
magic and larry were both signed w converse
i would assume clay would be a muhammad ali movie tbh
it s crazy how that kind of ended up working on all fronts promoting his son who was pretty much just an intern to run the studio and then their first movie coraline ends up being one of the best animated films of all time
it sounds like you give a fuck
good for you
generally means someone who is employed but in a way that does not fully utilise their skills a trained screenwriter working as a waiter would count as underemployed you can t call them unemployed because they have a job
zoomer has to use google challenge impossible
maybe they re still atoning for forgetting to thank him during their oscar acceptance speech
they reference that in dogma
i remember ben and matt having an hbo show back in the day about people getting a movie made seemed like the concept of the show helped the movie get greenlit they seem like solid dudes in the business
i loved williams check their ids at the door joke when he accepted his oscar but yeah still amazing they pulled that off so young
ben and matt actually have a movie studio where they pay the crews more than normal if the movie gets made quicker and under budget or something i forget but he said the crews deserve more credit ben was on the smartless podcast will arnnet jason bateman and sean hayes and he talks about it the part i talked about above starts around the 41min mark https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/smartless/id1521578868?i=1000605884098
kevin smith as well
they were young but they had both been working actors since their early teens so they had a knowledge of the industry and of quality material by their early twenties add to that their passion for film and having each other throughout high school to share those experiences and deep dive into filmmaking it definitely is still bonkers just less bonkers than anyone else that age achieving something that good
i feel like what they did was amazing anyone can try to do what they do but most don t for me it goes without saying that you have to do extra and get out of your comfort zone if you want to break out of anonymity so what they did was a awesome thing for people like me that when i want to do something i dive right in
they had a lot of help from william golding
as ropey as that crypto stuff was damon seems like a generally good egg plus that artists equity thing sounds like it might genuinely do a lot of good in the industry
goldman denied this
i usually don t enjoy documentaries at all and this one kept me engaged throughout
no see you re expecting people on r movies to have watched a lot of movies common mistake
ahem the lego movie
people need jobs dude jeez nobody wants to work anymore
realise you re having a hissy fit because a guy called a movie about a shoe a commercial for a shoe
guess people arent ready for the future of comedy
yeah what a reddit crime
or a clayface origin story
yes about the exploited and the robbed youth who made the sneakers
overemployed means your job requires more skills than you have an example might be a trained waiter who works as a screenwriter
no reason to antagonize by insulting a generation of people besides you re wrong
don t remember the scene from dogma but they definitely do in jay and silent bob strike back https://youtu.be/h2ah4sg80va?t=135)
project greenlight season was on hbo and season was on something different like bravo or something
having worked in the music industry as an recording engineer producer i appreciate this there are many parallels between the two industries more established people particularly the more narcissistic ones will bully themselves into taking credit for other people s work while underpaying the people who made the magic happen by working a bunch of all nighters and giving up doing anything but work for several months it s gross
awesome thanks for sharing
i just listened to that today fascinating
according to golding he just gave them advice on the script he didn t actually write any of it
he s debunked that rumor
he said one of the reasons he did it is because his water charity didn t make any money during covid and they needed a windfall he did the crypto ad and the crypto guys matched his salary and gave same amount to his charity
edit i stand corrected
i have seen the entire marvel and dc cinematic catalog thank you very much
i am sorry you are correct
hell people that make movies don t watch a lot of movies
i only watch good movies and by good movies i mean about movies that were revered in the 80s and 90s
blah blah
but your kids are gonna love it
i hope you put your feet where your mouth is because most shoes these days are made with extremely cheap labour overseas
i m still waiting for good will hunting it s hunting season
affleck was the bomb in phantoms
i watched some of it that show proved that some people don t break through for a reason
damon always seemed like a pretty standup guy so that was disappointing to hear about but if that s the case then i gotta give it to him
stories like this always read as just pr cover which i d imagine a guy like damon pays a lot into maybe i m just too cynical idk
vinny chase stiffed him again
here is a direct quote from his book which lie did i tell more adventures in the screen trade a great book that i highly recommend along with the first one the real truth is that castle rock had the movie first and rob reiner no fool he was given it for comments rob had one biggie affleck and damon in an early draft had a whole subplot about how the government was after damon the math genius to do subversive work for them there were chases and action scenes and what rob told them was this lose that aspect and stick with the characters when i read it and spent a day with the writers all i said was this rob s dead right period total contribution zero
he basically told them to drop the movie and focus on the interesting set up the original script was a action movie with matt damon being a spy and shit apparently
glad to see there s still some true cinephiles around these parts
yeah man but how they gonna have time to watch all these movies when they re making all these movies
apple sauce bitch
it definitely can be pr but at the same time you gotta remember that celebrities and athletes arent exactly fintech savants and unless someone in their inner circle waves a red flag crypto wouldve been sold as a new investment vehicle i think we can definitely blame damon and other celebs for not doing enough due diligence but at the same time crypto has always been about finding the bigger fool and there are a lot of fools in hollywood and in sports lol
i think he underestimated the value of his advice goldman was a highly respected novelist playwright and screenwriter who took the time to read their script and then advised them to drop an unnecessary subplot it was a minimal contribution but good advice which they had the good sense to follow
fair enough i ll check it out
jesus christ that s jason bourne
good job they dropped it no one would buy matt damon as a spy
my kids are gonna go nuts for this
matthew lillard is playing william afton interesting choice love his performance in scream
it s in theaters and on peacock october the film follows a troubled security guard as he begins working at freddy fazbear s pizza while spending his first night on the job he realizes the night shift at freddy s won t be so easy to make it through jim henson s creature shop made the animatronics josh hutcherson matthew lillard elizabeth lail kat conner sterling piper rubio and mary stuart masterson are starring
last i heard this was in development hell glad to see it finally exists i feel like it could be really good tbh
this is either going to be a masterpiece or awful with fnaf there s not much of an in between
i kinda realized that we don t really see the back of the animatronics a lot in the games cause i don t know what to make of golden freddy in the pic yet lol also what is up with these video game adaptations like the slender movie and the upcoming minecraft movie that are made waaay after the peak popularity of their source materials
can t wait for mattpats minute theory video on this image
they are making a movie oh fuck beware the fox that fucker is the worst
i thought they already did this movie with nic cage
if they don t put the living tombstone s fnaf song in this anywhere then it s an automatic
man i loved fnaf when i was like then stopped caring but still interested in this movie hopefully this is good if they do it right it ls gonna be disturbing as fuck
is that kids right hand a hook
my kid is going to watch this and god knows it ll be way too much for him
the movie got some serious actors in it and of course matthew lillard the shaggy is in it i hope it s good gonna have a fun time watching it
i almost did background for this filmed in new orleans would have been a blast
really like the animatronics articulations thin metal joints makes it clear these aren t people in suits
if you guys want something to hold you over before this comes out ex blue not only built the restaurant from the first game but they had people actually play in real life as well as making a movie
this will be a horror movie for kids so this is the nitpickiest of nitpicks but why would the bear on the sign look like a robot be drawn with th obvious joint parts and such the mouse at chuck e cheese was a normal cartoon mouse the mascot wasn t the creepy looking mouse robot
they nailed the cheap crap aesthetic at least
this movie alone will help matpat make more years worth of videos where he pulls things out his ass for minutes
can t wait for my little cousin to inevitably force me to watch this one with his shithead friends
hold up hold the fuck up i knew this movie was being made but its being made by blumhouse woooowww color me surprised
i genuinely hope this is good i m a huge fan of the older five nights at freddy s games but kind of left the whole fanbase around i m cautiously optimistic i don t expect it to be a perfect masterpiece but i hope it at least stands on its own as a good horror movie
i will be seeing this movie in black tie attire anything less would be a disrespect to god
i hope they make this so horrifying that the kids that go to see it because of let s players get scared crapless lol
idk much about fnaf except what my youngest tells me but in this pic the child holding freddy golden freddy s hand their hand looks weird almost animatronic is there a character that resembles that edit asked my son and he believes that the person next to freddy is eleanor
god i remember being crazy excited as a kid when i saw a clickbait youtube video on a fnaf movie so glad it s actually happening
i can t believe i ve lived to see a clickteam game become a movie that boggles my mind
oh my god i don t care if it s shit i ll still watch it in theaters
damn then what was that nic cage movie i saw
i was confused because this looks and feels a lot like willy s wonderland https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8114980/) starting the unbearable weight of his massive talent our lord and saviour and sexual tyrannosaur nicholas cage
can t believe there s an ok chance of this being good
honestly i feel weird that fnaf is still decently popular considering like how decently old well not old but like the original came out what so to imagine like kids after that still being interested in it is very very interesting though it might be more that it became an icon rather than a persisting popularity i mean hell i remember being in middle school and then finding out about a fnaf when one of the older student played it and show me to it
is it on purpose that fazbear sounds like the german fassbier which means draft beer
it would be really cool if this had in practical effects costumes that people wear at conventions for these characters look insane can a movie do that just as well as a fan made costume is anyone an expert on those crazy costumes or movies
when s the five nights at fuckboys movie coming out i need to watch his night of debauchery
matthew lillard is in this well now i gotta watch
it ll be interesting to see how this translates i don t closely follow the series lore but i understand that its well thought out and has a lot of potential
i ll stick to willy s until then
all i m hoping is we get the spring trap scene
you had me at matthew lillard
hyped
blumhouse produced fnaf i ll take it i don t know jack about the game not really but this could be great
i can t stand jump scares how tf do kids okay this game and not lose their shit the atmosphere in these games are bonkers i could only get to night in each game this movie is gonna be scary af
my daughter reads alllll the books only way we could get her into reading she also collects the fnaf plushies but don t put the game in front of her she s terrified very confusing
as a fnaf fan for a solid years this comment section makes me sad
why are they remaking willy s wonderland so soon
i feel old af reading these comments
gotta admit it looks kinda scary
i don t know what to expect but i do look forward to see what they could do with this
i m very curious what this movie is gonna be rated i mean i m fine with the rating no matter what it might be but just sayin
that s great news to hear they got the wheels rolling
freddy looking menacing asf
whenever i think that there s no such thing as true evil i remember someone somewhere said at a meeting hey let s make fnaf but in vr
what s this image why is freddy outside and looking in with a kid
how does this compare to nicolas cage vs fnaf
let s eat
tmw despite being the main mascot you re to big to fit through the entrance to your own restaurant
i hope the animatronics are real animatronics and not cgi monstrosities
super excited for this movie glad to see it s finally happening after like years
is that the bite of
can t wait for the cast list to be revealed and seth mcfarlane is revealed to be playing freddy
please have markiplier be the security guy
the whole thing is actually just be gonna an hour and a half of fnaf lore and then a jumpscare stinger
i hope it ends up rated r even though the biggest audience will be kids i don t see how you can do the story justice without all the graphic child murders
but we already had a five nights at freddy s movie and it nailed it willy s wonderland
my son is gonna lose his shit we love going to the movies and he s obsessed with fnaf
i honestly hope this is good i want a good video game movie i played the original game it was ok there is potential for a story here but will they skip plot and add plot
oh fuck yeah this better be rated r
wasn t willy s wonderland with nicholas close enough to a five nights at freddy s movie
willy s wonderland was all i needed
so excited for this been wanting a fnaf movie since elementary school
rich evan should make a cameo
five nights at freddy s is pure nightmare fuel
i see blumhouse i watch
i always thought the game could be a great horror movie idea
no way
why does every kid know about this character my year old always brings him up
it s crazy how kids can handle the scary game better than me i could never handle games like this and the movie looks interesting and probably faithful but i d be too scared to watch it and then in strolls some kid with no fear at all
bro i m this shit released when i was like i am going nuts for this shit
here been waiting for years for this film to see the light of day not just the kids
i m happy for them if that s the case
i m hitting my 30s and i m going nuts over this
there not gonna go nuts when they see the age rating
what in the hell is this i have no clue don t kids just watch gundam like i did as a youth
there s already a version with nicholas cage
bruh i m and i m going nuts for this i ve been a fnaf fan since fnaf
same
he even looks like william in the silver eyes for the movie i have faith he ll portray the character well
zoinks sweep
matthew lillard please go watch slc punk now if you haven t already
they really made shaggy a child murderer
he s great in a movie called dead man s curve or in some places the curve where lillard and micheal vartan plan on killing their roommate for a passing grade in collage if you have not seen it similar era lillard the movie is bad and good just a lot of fun to watch if you like that 90s lillard which who doesn t
zoinks michael
he plays a small role in twin peaks the return that is really memorable specifically because of a scene with his character s wife where he gets very menacing ever since i saw that i thought he would make a great villain
yeah wonder if we ll ever see him as springtrap spoiler tag is probably unnecessary but eh better safe then sorry
i guess if there s anyone i trust to do puppets and animatronic effects right it s jim henson s creature shop
it really does depend cause you have examples like kung fu panda where the casts nail it jack black angelina jolie ian mcshane dustin hoffman all of them knocked it out of the park but at the same time you absolutely have a long list of actors and actresses cast in animated stuff where it just doesnt work overall i think it really just comes down to who you re looking at and for what part it s for cause even recently hailee steinfeld is great in arcane and spider verse
this was posted earlier today and the consensus is that big name actors have been voicing animated movies for decades i get everybody here is pretty young and is not aware of the world before the 2000s but you d even be able to go back to the 60s and 70s and see other big name actors of that time voicing animated movies
it s a lot easier to promote a movie when you can send one to a listers to gma or today to yak it up with kelly ripa robin williams let the genie out of the bottle with aladdin hey and hollywood was never able to go back to strictly professional voice actors
not inherently but not every big actor is well suited for voice work tbh pratt s pretty good at it
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines
there are so many talented voice actors that you dont need big names for big movies its more of a marketing strategy than anything
yea
ultimately i think viewers need to ask themselves who those movies are even for sure pixar movies or whatever used to include some fun adult jokes for the parents to enjoy but i find it hard to believe that any kids that are watching these movies give a s that chris pratt is the voice of mario the only ones that seem to be worried about it are people who probably aren t the target audience in the first place so who really cares about their opinion
from what i ve heard it sounds like the voice cast was the least of the problems with the mario bros movie
no
money ryan george screen pitch
these films are mostly for children i don t think they care about the big stars i don t even think they are needed for marketing come on hollywood be a little bit more creative
yes
maybe
if an actor has talent the movie can benefit from it but actors like chris pratt and the rock completely ruin the movie cause no matter what character they play they will give the same performance hollywood needs to be smarter about casting those movies sure actors like them are efficient at promoting a movie but in the long run their mediocre voice acting will hurt the longevity of the work
regardless of what side you re on you have to admit that s a pretty rad title
i don t understand why studios are rushing to pay way more money for way worse work
yes
yes because most can t voice act
i am so sick of chris pratt
wow the ultimate ragebait article to maximise clicks lmao
my issue with alot of actors doing voices in movies is they dont try or cant mask there voice therefore kinda breaking the fundamental appeal of a animated movie or show which is immersion your selling me a new world and the voices are the literal heart of it doesnt matter how good everything else is mel blanc tara strong tom kenny roger bumpass squidward also professor membrane can and could pull enough range to sell the character this feels like it was made by a committee and is cold and calculated with how the voice actors were picked i dont go oh thats how bowser would sound i go oh thats jack black playing bowser voice acting and movie acting are sepearate skills sets and its rare from someone to do both
i don t like chris pratt
i don t see any reason to blow up budget with big actors feels like waste of money
yes
depends sometimes you get brilliant examples in idris knuckles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w04olxmm6yi) woody and buzz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlwd8tzqhc0), or befitting the article s primary example jack black going above and beyond as lord bowser but other times you get well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plz1_7oj9bo) rule of thumb if they re a has been they ll suck hard but if they have a rep to protect they ll usually at least kind of try
yes because they are just using their normal voices they aren t really voice acting of course there are some exceptions but i d prefer to hear actual vas in a pixar movie than ellen degeneres or tom hanks just being themselves
i look at it more on a case by case basis personally i like seeing career voice actors get big movie roles for all the issues the michael bay tf movies had having peter cullen as optimus was not one of them but i do think that some a listers can do very well in animated movies
absolutely
yes especially in the last decade specifically
i don t think so they re movies for little kids so i don t think they really notice it
nope
it s ultimately the creative team behind the movie that needs to ensure the voice acting serves the story rather than the other way around
yes it s absolute garbage that animated films and commercials have been taken over by movie and tv celebrities voice and commercial actors are completely screwed while these already rich celebrities rake in more
the problem isn t big name actors it s that a name s recognition across sectors seems to take priority over whether the actor is good or suited for the role feels like the studio checking boxes because this guy will bring in another million and this guy another million but you only notice it when it doesn t work nobody wishes hanks and allen hadn t been casted for toy story so real voice actors could get a role
portuguese dubbing has this strange habit of inviting non actors to do voicing in animated movies so they can splat their names one posters and commercials
no they aren t chris pratt was just a poor casting for this movie and even despite this he s not a terrible voice actor lego movie onward
probably a lot to do with direction too the english cast of princess mononoke were phenomenal
ian mcshane was in kung fu panda holy shit i would have never guessed
matthew broderick was simba ferris bueller himself with darth vader and mr bean as supporting cast among others
this right here how often do we talk about how great the animated movies of our childhood were guess what they were literally riddled with hollywood stars
another big reason is that by having big nam actors these films get more acclaim from the academy
hollywood banks and runs on those guys and guys like adam sandler and tom cruise because they re safe producing films is an investment and why would they take massive risk when they can take safe bets these actors always just play themselves or small variations on themselves audiences and studios know exactly what they are going to get everyone goes home relatively happy does it make for groundbreaking cinema no does it make dollar signs and easy entertainment yes
i disagree moana and the lego movie were great
i enjoyed it
he s so cooooool dammit miyamoto just say universal wouldn t pony up the funds for mario unless celebs like pratt were in the film it s okay we all know it to be true anyway
these movies aren t made for adults though i grew up knowing tom hanks from toy story not from forest gump or whatever ellen was just a fish to me until years after finding nemo came out
let s be real that pinnochio movie would suck regardless of who s voicing him
shout out to andrea romano
overall i ll say the ghibli films have some of the best english dubs of any animated films disney went way above and beyond to do that and i appreciate that
indeed https://youtube.com/shorts/pfapgzplo9s?feature=share)
it s interesting as i don t recall ever watching an animated film just because of who the voice cast were it s also funny you should mention ellen to me and my family she is and always will be the voice of dory we ve never seen or heard her in anything else in fact i m not sure if my family even remember the name of who voiced dory i think that s ok though not everyone is interested in removing a layer of the magic i think the only other film i ve seen tom hanks in is castaway so yet again to us he is simply the voice of woody it s the same with tim allen and buzz
true possibly not the best example rob schneider in norm of the north maybe
the goat for her work on the dcau
quite
holy hell he sounds great dreamworks john wick movie when s
casting and direction in the dcau and in general wb cartoons in the s are unmatched
i can already tell the glass eating sound design is going to stay with me for the next years much like the mirror face cutting in the last one
groovy
oh nice ready player one reference at the end
funny the blood usually gets off on the second floor
looks good but all the comments on this youtube video read like they were bought and paid for also hoping some of the campiness will remain which i didn t see in the trailer
if that happened to me i would just go klaatu verata ni cough and all would be sorted in a jiffy
i m definitely going to see this because i love the evil dead franchise even the remake but there s something about the vibe of this film that just feels off
i would prefer a gigan rise movie but this will do
deleted
i saw it last week at the overlook film festival in new orleans see it in the theater
it doesn t look very funny raimi is a master at blending just the right amount of comedy into his horror movies this just looks like a straight up horror movie disappointing
looks like a messy clob made of hellraiser and evil dead
needs more boomstick
i want bruce
really oddly aggressive vibe on these post comments lots of hardcore downvoting
looks disgusting can t wait
thanks i thought i got rid of that sound
i haven t watched the trailer but the idea alone is a lot
the tongue slicing in the film was what got me also the shower boiling scene
the needle in the eye sound effect lol
it was the syringe to the eye that got me in evil dead
visually the scene looks pretty poor compared to the rest of the trailer when she bites the glass it s very obvious the glass was added later and her face looks like it was done with a phone filter kind of surprised they didn t use something as simple as ice and make up for that scene
oh how dare you s
you little shit
dude that s fucked up
it looks like there ll be a lot of space for the main deadite to ham it up which is sort of essential for an evil dead villain in my opinion but otherwise not so much which is like fine the original evil dead basically set out to make as an excessive a horror film as possible and if they so the same here they re definitely sticking to their roots
i know a lot of people are excited about it but i think it looks terrible
i think your vibes are off this one looks really good i love the demon and very curious to see how it all takes place in the apartment complex i m getting silent hill vibes
yeah i can feel that a bit even at its grimmest moments the original evil dead trilogy and ash vs evil dead had a dark sense of playfulness to them though part of that could just be the 80s practical effects talking this one just feels disturbing like bruce campbell himslef said this one s so much scarier than anything before and really that s also fine it s a different up and coming creator s take on the formula with the blessing of raimi and campbell and with a franchise like evil dead that s kind of what you want
i think it s the structure of the trailer most trailers tell some sort of narrative that previews what the film was about this was more like a compilation of horror shots it doesn t really feel like a trailer
im in the same boat did you like the show i feel like there are two veins within evil dead and the show this and the remake are all leaning into one of those channels the way gorier more realistic gore side
from the trailer it feels like they slapped the evil dead license on top of a horror film
well it s a new installment there was a remake that had a different vibe but it works had a different vibe from army of darkness is completely different and the show has its own vibe i m stoked for this
i only saw remake and love it shoud i still watch the olds
what do you mean many trailers have used things like that for years decades even it s just like putting a snippet from a review on the screen many horror movies do stuff like that in the trailers not a new thing
deleted
i m guessing you didn t watch the remake
it looks kinda like the movie that it s s sequel to
but i like both of those things
both plus the arm removal electrical saw service the girlfriend offered herself on discount
it looks like it has to intensity and gore of the film mixed with some raimi esque filming camera work and humor
i m also glad we have moved away from a cabin in the woods
the original was an attempt to be actually scary but they just lacked budget it got more slapstick as raimi and bruce got older because they liked it the remake was dark and this one is following the aesthetic
i think that might be what it is the movie poster where the demon is hugging the family is absolutely terrible as well imo
lol idk why you re being downvoted that s pretty spot on
the necronomicon and deadites are what make evil dead evil dead what else do you want
if you have access to them then i d recommend watching them
right it s not really any different than stars or two thumbs up
its cringeryiyeus hihihk crimbeyyy cringeeeee cringey c r i n ge
people just only remember when the disagree and forget the last times they were on the same page
this looks suspiciously like a statement pulled from deep within your butthole why even bother making such a sweeping statement that you have absolutely no way of backing up lol
you do know how rt ratings work right
yes the movie he made when he was was basically a straight up horror movie then when he matured and had a bit more of a budget he made evil dead which was a brilliant horror comedy and more or less a remake of evil dead what does that tell you he was finding his voice with and nailed it with then he made army of darkness which was basically a comedy with some horror i m not saying the movie s going to suck i m just saying from the trailer it doesn t seem much like an evil dead movie to me at least not a raimi evil dead movie which is a shame because i m a long time fan of raimi s horror and i m surprised he s not directing the remake was fine but it wasn t very memorable you wouldn t think raimi would be willing to hand over the reigns again so easily horror comedy is a very difficult concoction to get right so it s a pleasure watching a master pull it off horror is horror i love it but there s a lot of it out there especially these days evil dead is a special franchise i would have liked to see them stay true to the creators vision
it s not a sequel to the remake it s a standalone film that just takes place in the evil dead universe it follows the lore mentioned in army of darkness of there being necronomicons
i feel so much better now yeah that still gets to me
i wonder if there is gonna be neighbor residents in the complex what s going on can t other residents hear the demon scream or stuff won t police get called i m assuming something is preventing all this
i will then
though to play devil s advocate the rt rating of is a bit deceptive and that could mean that film got like a on sites that actually input critic ratings thumbs up was also another questionable rating system since it was giving writers the power to sink or save any movie they wanted to star ratings and number ratings and their aggregates are really the only ones that should matter if people pay attention to anything at all
sure yeah you got it bud
you yourself know that the first evil dead movie by sam raimi was an attempt to go out and make the scariest most horrific film they could the remake is an entirely valid and amazing love letter to that spirit and let s not forget that the remake as well as this move were produced by raimi and bruce to the point they hand picked the directors so to say these films are out of touch with what sam raimi wants to do is laughable also i downvoted you for implying that becoming something other than a straight up horror movie is maturing put more respect on the genre my guy just out of curiosity did ya watch ash vs evil dead because you got seasons of exactly what you re looking for
just a note for evil dead as it can be kind of confusing the beginning minutes or so of it is a recap of the first movie sam raimi wasn t able to get the rights to the first one so he couldn t simply show footage of it so he had to film a recap and that s what you see at the beginning of evil dead
i think this is just a generational thing you sound pretty young so it makes sense that the classic disney movies weren t the movies that you would grow up with
you re too young for those to be what you grew up with if shrek is one of yours
i m sort of with you in that as an older disney kid the films i grew up on were the live action disney movies of the 70s the shaggy dog the absent minded professor the cat from outer space blackbeard s ghost snowball express bedknobs and broomsticks etc i ve never even met anyone who saw any of these films and the last disney cartoon i saw was the lion king i ve never seen mulan the emperor s new groove pocahontas aladdin etc so i m missing some serious pop culture references here and there that said i loved those cheesy disney films of yesteryear condorman the watcher in the woods something wicked this way comes they definitely shaped my taste for certain kinds of superhero films and scifi horror i don t think i would have loved mystery men as much as i do without condorman
you sound younger than the generation that grew up on the disney films you mentioned
ray harryhausen was more my thing
i didn t even understand english growing up
the first disney movie i remember going to see at the cinema was black hole before that i d seen snow white peter pan and also lady and the tramp though i d hardly call it growing up with them disney films were rare when i was a kid i watched heaps of films from 1920s to the 1970s eras as a kid
i just don t really care about those movies am gen x grew up with the older disney movies and cartoons but was a teen by the time stuff like aladdin came out and it just seemed like movies for little kids as a result i have no nostalgia for that era
i did but not the current generation of them i got my dad s hand me down disney with stuff like robin hood best disney film btw and cinderella and sleeping beauty little mermaid came out when i was and it was for little girls anyway lion king i was at that point in my life i wanted movies with f bombs and heads exploding i was born in so actually it was the don bluth films that inspired me as a kid american tail and all dogs go to heaven and secret of nimh
the big disney renaissance was late 80s mid 90s so it s mostly a cusper millennial thing we were right in the prime for the movies in theaters and on home video the merchandise disney channel the expansion of disney world parks the birth of pixar etc if you grew up in the shrek generation you missed disney peak at that time disney s big film contribution was pixar and until frozen traditional disney animated was kind of fallow plus they shifted a lot of their live action stuff to tv movies for disney channel
i was born in the early 80s so little mermaid aladdin lion king were all about the right release years for me to enjoy them and shrek chicken run etc were kind of past the time i was watching kid movies though i did watch shrek eventually but i mean my movie tastes were probably also shaped by the videos i checked out time after time after time at the video store the last unicorn jason and the argonauts the labyrinth red sonja the evil dead etc or the movies that played relentlessly on tv star wars top gun goonies lots of things influence your tastes hard to say how much would be attributable to which kid movies were coming out when you were of an age to watch kid movies
the computer wore tennis shoes
my family let me watch all movies as a kid so i skipped disney and went straight to lethal weapon and predator those were my childhood favorites
no but i watched the fuck out of like pixar movies and dreamworks movies to this day i can answer the incredibles questions like it s child s play
i grew up on just about all types of movies so i did maybe that s why i m not very picky about my taste
yeah i didn t see those either i think i started with monsters inc the incredibles ratatouille and finding nemo
i was around twelve when the little mermaid released in so although my friends and i enjoyed most of the films the big disney renaissance didn t exactly shape our childhoods i remember seeing pocahontas in the theater with friends in high school and cracking up when the grandmother willow character appeared pocaho s grandma is a fun fruit tree
i think the last movie i was that was disney franchise specific was aladdin back in and that was on vhs not a theater i saw more disney cartoons than disney movie cartoons i ve seen very little if any disney specific movies since like the little mermaid or the lion king just never cared to i love cartoons but hate the songs even though i love musicals i just hate music for kids even as a kid i hated the kid songs
pixar was where i was at a bugs life was my first dvd ever i think followed by monsters inc
so depending on your family i might have a cultural panic that may have been the cause i remember my religious family removing disney everything because ellen degeneres had the first female female kiss on tv in the mid 90s and somehow disney was the bad guy probably would have caught the reason if i ever listened to as much talk radio as they did
eh i can t say i ve grown up on disney movies i was too busy watching spider man and star wars on loop
what a tragedy you should have to completely redo your childhood again
the only four disney movies i remember seeing before the age of were chicken little wreck it ralph big hero and zootopia all of which aren t magical or disney like
all the ones you listed came out after those classics those were early 2000s where disney was starting to falter somewhat excluding pixar films i too didn t grow up on those classics but i did grow up on toy story monsters inc and finding nemo
you sound like you could be my nephew my cousin made sure he grew up without disney in his life also no fighting movies no violent toys no processed sugar kinda feel sorry for the kid
when i was young the animated disney movies were directed towards girls for the most part so i was never a huge fan my sister liked them and i respected them i was into the mighty ducks and stuff like that so yes i did but the animated movies were for girls
i was growing up right in the midst of pixar s hot streak during the s their movies were the only disney content i really watched a lot as a young child well that and mary poppins but that s an isolated thing
disney has been around for so long that your grandparents probably grew up with them if they had a tv
i didn t watch disney movies despite having them on vhs but i watched the hell out of pixar movies i could never get into disney classics i didn t like musicals still don t that s why i always preferred pixar no real musical scenes the only classic disney movie i think i ve seen is the lion king never seen anything else like dumbo aladdin pocahontas mulan etc
i think the main difference is to establish what is a disney work and what is disney channel disney movies are countless classics but the disney channel produces countless crap
some of us are from some parts of europe and grew up on fantaghiro pingu moomins asterisk and obelix fantomas that s life three wishes for cinderella still the best cinderella pipi long stocking sandokan and argentinian and mexican telenovelas also pokemon
the only animated disney movie i ve seen is fantasia and maybe dumbo on tv when i was a kid i never got around to watching any others yet
yeah that period of disney films was not the greatest sure there were some pretty good ones during that time but it wasn t non stop bangers like some other periods
i think it always boils down to parenting lotta parents have vhs or dvd copies of classic disney movies after all
for sure not true lol i grew up in the dreamworks pixar era and watched all those but also watched all of the renaissance disney movies many many times they weren t even ten years old yet lol lion king and toy story merch especially was still everywhere throughout the 00s
do you think home video didn t exist
i was born in relate wholeheartedly with op we owned all the 90s disney movies on vhs but i fucked hard with shrek i definitely watched all the disney movies but aside from like a few key scenes songs they just didn t do it for me except for the lion king love that shit
well you should do yourself a favor and watch the emperor s new groove that film is fantastic and hilarious
those movies aren t only in english
gotta remember that bigger subs skew very young nowadays gen xers and up like ourselves grew up in the dead zone of disney so we were more influenced by all the other weird stuff the world had to offer
now owned by disney
growing up my dad tried to tell me that planes trains automobiles and caddyshack were comedic masterpieces and others obsessed that star wars was peak scifi but jurassic park and dumb dumber trump those all day long to me and we had the former on vhs
so i m guessing what you said means you really liked the movie shrek
so i m guessing what you said means you really liked the movie shrek
yeah i d say that the secret of nimh the neverending story and gremlins all made a bigger impression on my childhood
i guess that s true hahaha but they weren t back then though i guess sony still owns those movie rights for spidey
except disney gave lion king little mermaid aladdin etc massive heavily marketed dvd releases when they came out of the vault and for kids my age it was like they were brand new movies
if this movie sucks kanye is going to hate the jews again
hill is writing directing and starring along with reeves outcome will star reeves as reef a damaged hollywood star who must dive into the dark depths of his past to confront his demons and make amends after he is extorted with a mysterious video clip from his past
hope it s good that whole cgi kiss situation was hilariously brutal
i like jonah way more as an actor than a director writer
this is a very interesting combination
it s high time keanu starts doing comedies bill and teds were from years ago and in the past years he s only had two comedies one with winona ryder and the third bill and ted film man can be quite funny
more hill and apple original films are developing a grateful dead biopic with martin scorsese s sikelia productions which will be directed by scorsese with hill starring and producing with dines under strong baby
everyone in these comments roasting hill for being in one bad movie completely ignoring the fact that keanu has been in bad movies since before they were born ever heard of johnny mnemonic give the guy a break he directed mid90s a great film and has been in some bangers like the jump street films has everything you done been a major success it s part of the process and we all make some duds i m not a hill fanboy but i m also not pompous enough to think that one bad film should sink someone s career
keanu should do darker stuff my favorite performance of his is from neon demon where he plays a pedo motel manager owner creepin on young girls
the last movie jonah cowrote had a great cast and was still a huge bomb keanu doing comedy sounds fun tho even tho his latest acting is more wooden than it s ever been he s fine if you use him right not too much dialogue
hill ted
thank god it s on apple so i couldn t watch it
for the culture
cant be worse than you people
jonah hill looks like my cocaine dealer s dealer s dealer
this thread is a disaster
jonah hill said he was teasing his next directorial effort next week on instagram this was like years ago didn t realize i had to clarify directing a film in the movies subreddit
is this movie gonna end racism
jonah hill lookin like he gonna try and sell me low t pills
apple s really killing it lately i was skeptical about them as a streamer at first but i m considering swapping netflix for them at this rate ted lasso finishing up shrinking s2 with ford to come severence s2 to come the morning show with carell i ve seen bits of the job stewart affairs show big scorsese di caprio flick to come then this plus them wanting to land their movies in cinemas too unlike netflix suggesting bigger movie aspirations to match the bigger screen
jonah hill looks like the dude you buy coke from
man you people was one of the biggest letdowns he finally was the leading man and no channing tatum in sight and wham worst movie fucking ever the cast was stacked and it just didn t work if the movie was about the parents it would ve been good enough eddie murphy nia long vs david duchovny julia louis dreyfus l all their scenes were the best ones of the movie
am i the only one burnt out on jonah hill
people in here who don t like mid s probably watched top gun times in theatre
they better have a good cgi kiss scene or i m not even bothering
when did jonah hill become grizzly adams where s ben
how much coke is jonah on
jonah is really committed to that hair style hey
jonah hills new look bothers me
jonah hill seems to be a pretty popular actor but for some reason i ve never been a fan of him always found him just slightly annoying
jonah bill has gone from overweight nerd to slimmed nerdy dude to nerdy wwe wrestler look
keanu reeves in a movie with jonah hill written and directed by jonah hill was not on my bingo
unfortunate i ll not be watching this i m really not keen on jonah hill
jonah hill sucks lately the stuff he s been in has been terrible hopefully he doesn t pull keanu down with him
jonah hill should change his name to jonah hole because hollywood throws money in him and it never goes anywhere
apple has been nailing winner after winner tbh
for the love of god why jonah hill is so very overrated i think i ve seen the length and breadth if his comedic takent
jonah hill is an a lister huh
removed
thank you jonah hill
as long as jonah doesn t write it we should be fine
i love that picture of jonah hill
is that jonah s look now i thought that was just for you people
dang that s a good combo i think keanu acting is much better with comedies
jonah hill peaked in superbad and has been trying to be someone he s not ever since
keanu good edit thanks for the gold
shame it s on apple tv and no one will watch it
straight to appletv is the new direct to dvd
i do wish keanu would spruce himself up at times much as i love the scraggy look sometimes it needs a trim
so wholesome epic keanuuuuuu
removed
that would be legendary somehow
if it s anything like you people it ll prolly kinda suck
hopefully it s better than jonah hill s latest comedy that movie was soooo bad
kanye s gonna love this one
keanu reeves yes jonah hill no i will pass on this
you people wasn t even that bad i like this combo
damn jonah hill put on a lot of weight lol
i can t even imagine what jonah hill felt when he heard about kanye s post it s so extremely bizarre
if it s anything like you people kanye will never like jews again still bitter that i wasted those two hours
i m not gonna say what kind of director he was he was a jew
thought this said keanu not kanye was like i will not believe keanu said anything bad about anyone
this literally made me tear up from laughter
does anyone else think kanye was actually making a strained criticism of jonah hill s movie you people the one that tries to unpack jewish black race relations i feel like he was calling out the movie but just swapped the title with jump street as a joke and people missed the reference his tone reads as sarcastic towards the films ability to actually change anyones mind
don t worry though he won t watch it for another years
fuck kanye and fuck you
if he saw war dogs he d hate jews more than he hates fish sticks
its probably him dressed up as the matrix
damn i honestly have zero faith in jonah hill writing and directing another movie after watching you people that was by far one of the worst movies i ve ever seen it was so unbearably cringey and i m surprised i made it through the whole movie
hill needs to spend some time detoxing before he should make another movie keanu may have to host an intervention
so another comedy with recycled jokes and some shock humor
hopefully its better than hills last novie he wrote you people that was real bad
jonah can t write a good movie
this is gonna be bad edit thanks for likes edit who downvoted lulz edit back to ten likes woo baby that s what i m talking about edit i can t believe this in a matter of minutes my comment was relentlessly disliked sending it into negatives please if you were one of these people take responsibility for your actions and make things right what have i done to deserve this edit aaand we have just hit dislikes seriously guys this isn t funny take back the fucking dislikes immediately
ugh that sounds like the worst plot ever another movie about being an actor great jerk off motion
the kiss between keanu and jonah will probably be real keanu is too wholesome to fake it
ultimate cringe
that movie was honestly one of the rare i ve watched i almost hated it entirely
cgi sodomy in this one all hologram butts no cap frfr
what movie
i realized it was overblown and probably due to covid when you see them kiss for real a few times movie wasn t amazing by any stretch but i found it enjoyable for eddie murphy s performance and i enjoyed seeing a movie where two characters actually communicate their feelings quite well idk i d give it a or
the movie was made by the jews to punish a black people for kanye
he was amazing in wolf and money ball
i wanted to like mid90 s as a kid that grew up in them but i just didn t like it not really sure why in my personal opinion i think jonah hill s best performance was as donny in don t worry he won t get far on foot he blew me away with that performance
i can t wait to see him as jerry garcia
i think he really does not have a lot of range he s good at playing an anxious nebbish and that s about it
mid90s is critically praised and has a high rt audience score love the movie
yea he s really good on screen but his writer director stuff has been dreck some people just can t admit their own skillset
this might be a stretch but hey didn t they say that about jordan peele before get out was released i guess we will have to wait and see
johan hill keanu apple yes i wouldn t have guessed this at all
he did always be my maybe
he really phoned it in for b t3 tho alex winter jumped right back into the role but keanu wasn t very good in it
the winona ryder one is called destination wedding it s just minutes of them talking literally no other characters speak i honestly thought it was really funny though
i loved him in toy story haha
and swedish dicks on television
dk rap tease
was that the original voice actor for mario at the beginning
one thing that didn t feel right to me was the use of modern day songs i think the soundtrack should have been totally original
my favorite easter eggs were level sign with the tune playing da da da da da duuun in the sewers punch out pizza they need to bring this to snw at universal studios although not an easter egg that yoshi tease at the very end credits was nice
was anyone else expecting bowser jr to show up after they made a big deal of mario and donkey kong having parallel daddy issues it felt like an obvious thematic thread to me for bowser to be a canonical dad who spends way too much time focusing on his own self gain at the expense of others instead the three threads the movie keeps jumping between mario peach and toad on their road trip luigi in a cage bowser pining feel weirdly lacking of connective tissue you of course know that the entire point of the movie is mario defeating bowser and i didn t go in expecting much more than that but i still wish there was more done to build the antagonism and rivalry up between the two of them as a relationship that matters enough to justify being the basis of an entire game franchise instead they lack any connection beyond peach and they never interact until the end
honestly not as bad as i thought it was going to be though i wished luigi had more of a role in the movie and the plot felt too rushed
showing mario and luigi s back story with their family makes me wonder how they ll introduce walugi or wario in the sequels
i do think the movie did play it a little safe so on that note i really hope the sonic movie embraces the edge of its source material like forget the kids the parents who grew up on those games will lose their minds if live and learn plays the movie was enjoyable princess peach definitely stole the show but to give a comparison i think the sonic movies were better and the voices were fine unless their intention was to hide chris voice before the movie they did a horrible job on selling it and instead letting the controversy bubble up
a lot more imagery than i was expecting
i actually enjoyed it jack black stole the show wish he had more musical numbers it s clearly a kids movie though but millenials who grew up playing mario will enjoy the little details also that double down spike at the end of the movie was felt by all smash bros players also is bonnie tyler is having a really good year with holding out for a hero being in this tetris and shazam also twitter is going to take bowser in the jar and run with it
the dog nodding at the end was funny
did anyone notice how they specifically showed some of the cages did get submerged in lava and then the penguins don t show up for the rest of the movie rip little penguin guys
did anyone else find it sorta funny how princess peach waited for mario to train himself up on the obstacle course like she knew that turtle hitler was on his way to destroy her kingdom and proved herself more than capable of beating the course handily herself but chose to hang around for at least a full night plus change to train this guy she d just met x200b it s not actually a serious criticism of the film but the optics of that made me chuckle
the decision to play take on me when they arrive to kong s land is odd it s a world of primates with wood plank roads barrels and palm trees something with a little more edge would have been better maybe wild side by motley crue or even welcome to the jungle but that one is a little obvious
as could reasonably be expected jack black absolutely stole the show especially with the piano scene
the blue star was the standout for me nothing like the sweet relief of death
kranky kongs voice sounded way too young also was it just me or did the two guard toads at the beginning sound like cuphead and mugman
highlights of the movie and moments that made my theater laugh our princess is in another castle bowser boasts about how he will get peach to marry him and one koopa blurts out doesn t she hate you and then bowser burns a hammer bro to a dry bones bowser singing while playing the piano mario ignorantly eats a mini mushroom in his battle with dk bowser rehearses what he will say to peach in the wedding with kamek dressed as peach bowser says to peach i guess it the star makes a guy come out of his shell or something like that then a koopa comments i told you that line wouldn t work mario saving luigi right before he was going to hit the lava mario and luigi turning invincible and destroying bowser and his army bowser gets fed a mini mushroom and thrown into a jar bowser singing while playing the piano again during the credits while detained in a cage also the nostalgia factor was a humongous plus with the enemies game mechanics and music
i love that bowser called the princess peaches the whole time and no one corrected him
mario picking the mushrooms off his plate was hilarious
this definitely felt more like a mario flavored themepark ride than a movie the dozens mabye hundreds of easter eggs and musical motifs were absolutely fun and invigorated the decades long diehard mario fan inside me but i sincerely hope this film does not set the standard of storytelling for future nintendo projects
i don t think i ever woulda expected luma to be the standout in a mario movie but luma is indeed the standout wickedly funny movie s a blast
i need a hero has been in so many movies recently it must be free to use or something
am i crazy i m sure mario s dad was based off talon from ocarina of time
bowser singing his peaches song was worth the price of admission alone jack black absolutely stole the show
i legit enjoyed it and so did my kid that s all that matters also how they explained mario s voice in the beginning was genius
the main cast actually killed it imo fred armisen as kranky kong was an outlier didn t quite mesh well with the character on screen but i feel like pratt deserves some credit he actually did better than expected as mario the easter eggs were abundant and fun kid icarus the arwing bowser s tux the other kings bob omb and boo at the wedding jumpman foreman spike the balloon fight sign at the end all well done without being too self indulgent the after after credits sequence has me wanting more give me yoshi s island story and luigi s mansion and absolutely give me a captain toad i admit fully i m coming at this as a mario superfan of years but i love the cinematic world nintendo and illumination crafted on this one give me more
full theater i m talking every seat filled lots of kids and parents dressed up in mario costumes was a lot of fun i think a lot of the reviewers must ve watched it in relatively empty theaters because the full theater experience definitely elevated the movie a lot for me plot was exactly what you get from the trailer but it lead to some fun moments lots of callbacks and a love letter to mario fans animation was also fantastic so i m not sure what those reviews are even talking about solid family movie
i felt they overdid it with the slow motion bullet time scenes one is okay but they kept using it again and again the score was wonderful but the pop songs were unnecessary i was hoping for easter eggs callbacks and this movie didn t disappoint although a zelda reference would ve been nice
shoutout to this movie for going for the super deep easter eggs any fool can throw in the blue shell or having alternate reality donkey kong arcade machine be called jump man only legends can have a easter egg related to diskun https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/diskun)! the software store in the background during the final fights edit other standout easter eggs beyond the obvious like princess is in another castle the duck hunt ducks appear both on the wall in the punch out themed pizzeria itself an easter egg and on the french cuisine place nearby an arwing from star fox is on top of the bros television also as u bigpoppajosh1994 points out mario was playing kid icarus on it blink and you ll miss it i m not sure if it was there or if i m imagining things but there s a poster on the wall of the bros room that showing a showdown between two of the characters from nes wrestling there s also a baseball poster which could be a reference to how there is a mario baseball game or how baseball was a launch game for the nes it could just as easily simply be there because mario lives in new york u mynameis_jordan says that apparently there was an f zero poster which i ll have to keep an eye out for next time i watch again the gamecube start up music is luigi s cell phone ring bowser s piano is a ludwig von koopa brand you can see the ice climbers polar bear on a sign in brooklyn the infamous rainbow road shortcut drop the implication that the smb lost levels poison mushrooms exist mario peach and donkey kong all use some moves from ssb you can see card game images on the sides of a building in brooklyn that i think are nintendo s hanafuda cards but i d have to see it again to make sure it might be a reference to one of the minigames in smb3 instead u octorokhero points out that there was balloon fight signage on a building during the final battle u puttyarrowbro points out that a pikmin statue was in the home of the first clients
overall enjoyable movie although it felt really rushed could have benefited another half hour but i understand it was more for kids which makes sense
the most designed by committee movie that can exist but i still enjoyed it pratt actually did an ok job as well not going to lie black absolutely stole the show though but is it just me or did peach s design look a bit uncanny valley ish something about the way she looked looked odd also fred armisen as cranky did not work omg there was such a disconnect between his voice and the dialogue
there s obviously stuff to poopoo and nitpick but i thought it was heaps of fun and had a grin on my face the whole time one thing i would say is i think it s held back a little bit by illuminations mandate on minute movies even just minutes more to give the quieter bits a moment to breath would ve been good
imo if i were a man rt score generator i d put this right at the bottom of certified fresh so like i suppose judging the movie just on the merits of what it was trying to do it needed more of the classic mario action anytime the action turned into classic mario game elements it was done really well it actually translated pretty good into advancing the plot of the movie but the whole last bowser encounter scene should ve been a big climax build up of mario and luigi doing a little platforming adventure through brooklyn rather than what it was basically a standard fight scene leading to them grabbing the star i do agree with the critics it needed more in terms of good plot writing characterization thematics something it actually did exceed my expectations for that especially based on the reviews that were coming in but it could ve done better had just a bit more substance it had a little bit too much of an annoying cartoon character thing going on at times in particular i didn t like anything with cranky kong it also needed more mario luigi interacting beyond the beginning and end of the movie tbh they have probably like minutes of screen time together i d guess the whole merit of the movie is based on being faithful to the games and nailing the references and translating the gameplay to on screen action and they did get pretty much slam dunk that in terms of improving it i would ve streamlined it to get a little bit more of that because that s when the movie was at its best put a little more meat on the bones in terms of substance in characterization or arcs themes improve the writing etc but for the most part it s perfectly adequate in that regard also yea chris pratt was a perfectly fine mario the beginning explanation honestly surprised me for how well it worked in contextualizing translating the character to a whole movie it s one of those where the most you can say about it is that it s fun but it did do a pretty good job of that so i enjoyed it
was very cute hopefully we get a decent sequel in a handful of years featuring more luigi i request danny devito and willem dafoe as wario and waluigi
the peaches song by bowser is absolutely something that tenacious d would make
i think i agree with both the audience score and critic score this is a movie made for kids but toddlers rather than say elementary school it s a very fun but extremely shallow film i think it deserves the critics gave it and the audiences gave it my biggest problem was how often they used pop mainstream songs instead of the game s themes it s a very safe movie so it s hard for me to feel strongly either waty
not too sure how i felt about this tbh maybe i m just being cynical but it was very much a kids movie with a look at the thing you recognise element
this movie was pure super mario franchise nostalgic fun and anyone who was worried about chris pratt s mario voice it was fine and a non distraction
the reviews weren t really wrong it was generic with a paper thin plot which is an odd complaint considering outside the rpg s mario games always have paper thin plots but i thought it was pretty fun and the soundtrack was awesome with all the musical cues from the series plus i actually didn t hate pratt s voice and the little joke at the beginning with them doing the traditional voices in the commercial was pretty good
okay but the galaxy music playing over bowser s castle s entrance as he burned the penguin kingdom the ground went hard as fuck in a theater sound system hell give me a galaxy movie next with the full soundtrack please
this felt like the sonic movie where it was a pretty solid first movie but felt like a 2nd movie was gonna be a lot better which it was for me sonic is still the gold standard video game movie but i m definitely excited to see what they do for mario
as a longtime mario fan this was more like watching a fireworks show than watching a movie i found it delightful to ooh and ahh over each easter egg musical callback etc always keeping an eye out for what was coming next or else hidden in the background
cool references easter eggs throughout charlie day as luigi made me laugh a bit jack black voices bowser pretty well seth rogens laugh writing seemed like it could ve been better pacing too fast but obvious that would be the case due to being a kids movie animation was nice i think it left me wanting more
i just got back and i m honestly conflicted haha x200b on one hand you got a super mario bros movie that is everything you actually wanted out of a super mario bros movie it s fun colorful funny and hits a lot of the references with a lot of style the illumination humor really helps the thin plot doesn t bother me because im not expecting anything out of a mario bros plot because its never been the focus of the series x200b but on the other you have a movie that is just that a thin plotted mario movie with a lot of references references the movie i would hope that the movie would actually add depth to the characters since this would be the place to do it since the games don t but no the most we got out of this was mario being a failure in his parents eyes and him redeeming himself at the end x200b i get it it s nintendo it s a movie for kids and its mario and mario is for kids miyamoto and nintendo have been against making movies for years now because they have a certain vision in mind for their franchises super mario land at universal studios is a good example of that if you watched the making of and anything from miyamoto over the years they don t want their movie to be anything but fun safe and what mario has always been but i think this movie should of done more with some heart x200b i had a lot of fun with the movie though i enjoyed the references i liked how mario got his ass beat almost the entire film and the mario kart section was great but i can also see it from a critic point of view and yeah its disappointing so yeah i m conflicted haha x200b my two biggest gripes really though is the illumination pop culture references that they usually have the holding out for a hero and take on me are not needed in a mario movie there is soo much mario music out there and donkey kong that there is absolutely no need for it the other was luigi being shafted in the film he s gone for almost the entire film and thats a shame
sorry thought it was stretched insanely thin they might as well have called it the paper mario movie mario is one of my favorite properties i get that it s a movie for kids i get that there s not a lot to the story of the games and i had lowered expectations from the reviews and actually went in hoping to be a huge contrarian about it and love it but i feel like there was so much more depth to be mined from this world and these characters and the movie was happy to go with flat obvious and inoffensive at almost every point i m happy people like pointing at the 70th easter egg and shit like that but i feel like me you the kids and mario deserved more is it really enough that you got to see several of the boxers from punchout in the background to make you love a movie this felt like a really nice greeting card cute maybe gets a chuckle out of you but the little generic written note from the greeting card company is basically meaningless this movie is like the best possible theme park ride onboarding video ever made in a derogatory way i m sad to be so let down when the awful sonic movies allow for more depth to be plumbed from knuckles the echidna and sonic s human friend s wife than the entire main cast of mario bros i just feel like we missed the mark the movie is watchable but i feel like that s a very low bar for the second film outing of the biggest video game character of all time years after a bunch of other games have made the jump just fine to clear the only positive takeaway for me is the knowledge they ll be making shitzillion more of these so maybe they ll make a good one i also very much cared for donkey kong
one praise the animation was almost impeccable well detailed colorful and masterful movements it made me wonder how much more interesting the movie could ve been if they had tossed out the paint by numbers script and just went for a minimal dialogue no celebrity va anthology one grievance the non videogame licensed music got to my nerves i didn t need to hear thunderstruck battle without honor or humanity welcome to the jungle holding out for a hero or other songs i ve seen a half dozen times in other movies and far better used especially when you have access to generic music or the some of the catchiest or most iconic video game songs of the last half century
you know when a youtuber compiles all of the cut scenes from a video game and uploads it as a movie this felt like that and not a bad one actually a very good one but it felt just like that
i went in with low expectations based on reviews and walked out pleasantly surprised honestly visually the movie was beautiful there wasn t much to full on surprise the audience with but there was enough entertaining stuff and nostalgic callbacks that i didn t find myself checking my watch at any point in the movie i think that s worth something and there was enough bits that got the high schoolers in my party to laugh that i d call it an overall success
this is the third time in the last month that i ve seen a movie in theaters and it has had a scene that plays bonnie tyler s holding out for a hero tetris shazam and now mario this is hitting take me home country roads in levels of insanity where that song was in alien covenant logan lucky and kingsman all in a very short span i want to be clear right off the bat it s gonna sound like i hate this movie because i have a lot of criticisms but this isn t a bad movie it s perfectly fun and watchable and clearly aimed at small children who don t give a shit what i think and despite the story and character criticisms this is an exceptionally beautiful looking film every frame my biggest issue with this movie is that it is very much aimed at small kids and that s not a bad thing but as an adult with no kids who was hoping for something so good that i would be excited for sequels and spinoffs what i got was a very pretty but very basic and by the numbers movie with few surprises or subversions from what i expected peach being a badass rather than a princess in distress is an idea that would have felt subversive a decade ago and while it s still a fine way to go if that s the biggest surprise you ve got in store for us i m already kind of bored with it the voice cast felt strange to me and this was something i didn t think would be a big deal popular actors do voice work all the time and while i don t love the pratt casting i wasn t ready to write this movie off for it but watching it definitely felt off there s something about these very famous actors doing voices for these even more famous characters that have classically been without dialogue that reminds you you re basically watching a long commercial i was never like wow i love this bowser or peach performance i was just like oh that s jack black and anya there was a sort of a disconnect between voice and character that was very distracting i guess the most disappointing thing as an adult watching this was that the themes and world building weren t very strong the humor the look the voices etc were what i expected but with the current trend to make every family movie have a strong emotional core and have some kind of deeper meaning i was bummed that this movie wrapped up with mario basically getting a cheat code star rather than winning because he learned anything or solved a problem there was also this strange obsession with the bros being stronger together but the moment where they reiterate that in the final fight feels empty because no one has doubted or challenged that idea the entire movie they were apart for most the movie sure but it wasn t some sort of plan to keep them weak just random occurrence the world building was whatever but i found it to be a lot of strange decisions kids won t care about this but as an adult i was so taken back that mario seems to instantly accept that there is some sort of magical plumderworld the scene where he first meets peach and they both totally trust each other and what they re saying that he is from human world and she is the princess of this land and about to wage a war i was basically pulling my hair out that nobody had any questions about all of this the ending too where mario s family who are straight out of moonstruck btw had zero questions about why a giant turtle was attacking new york and why mario who has been missing for days now with no questions is the hero of the story to me it s the epitome of a movie that is telling kids how to feel and react rather than giving them the information is the world aware of this plumderworld why isn t everyone freebasing power ups all the time is peach constantly powered up by the base mushroom or is she simply that big what is this world where dictators are just moving their armies against each other constantly when mario asked peach if she was from his world and she says there s millions of galaxies i was like but youre human right like can we just agree that it s likely i know kids don t care about this stuff but it was bothering me the whole time like i said that all sounds harsh but it s apparent to me the positives of this movie i feel like speak for themselves it s very pretty it has its moments where it s really funny and it s a quick good time for kids the real villain of this movie though was expectation nintendo staying out of film for 30ish years then making a deal with illumination for an animated mario movie had me hoping they wouldn t want it if it wasn t a certified banger clearly they are planning sequels and spinoffs and maybe other franchises and my question is how excited does this movie get me for all that and the answer is sadly not very which is a positive score r reviewsbyboner
the good outweighs the bad by a ton but i get what the critics are talking about so much of the plot feels unearned and some interesting developments are dropped after being introduced like did brooklyn ever get saved from that flood would have been nice to have it referenced at the end could have easily been a small story about that bad plumber sabotaging the city for his business and did dk throw the fight it would have been interesting to see him having his own ideas and plans for his kingdom like that throwing the fight because he wants to help the mushroom kingdom against his father s wishes would have liked it if the blue shell guy did more than that one mario kart reference the unearned stuff also seems like the writers just dropped the ball like the way bowser keeps getting intelligence updates but then there s no spy or mistake on the good guys part that makes it feel earned but overall illumination delivers what it does best a great family experience that holds back on the heavy emotional arcs and gives stakes that don t come off as very intense
god how i love minute movies bring back minute blockbusters hollywood
people seem to think that you either watch a movie with the intent of giving it an oscar or you have to turn your brain off and just have fun roger ebert used to review each film exactly as it was presented a kids movie still got reviewed all the same to see if it was a good kids movie but still a movie first so many people in this thread seem to think mario doesn t have to be good because come on it s for kids there are hundreds of children s films done better with more effort and intent that doesn t mean mario is bad but it certainly doesn t mean it s good just because they winked at the camera about the weaker aspects i still want my nieces and nephews to see it and they will have a blast i m sure but it s not as good as ghibli films kubo and the two strings pixar etc you can make a children s film well
ngl pretty fucking good
i didn t think i d enjoy it as much as i did loved all the easter eggs and callbacks to mario s and nintendo s history the biggest surprise for me was that chris pratt s voice didn t bother me as much i thought it would
honestly not that bad of a movie it was a pretty fun watch visually illumination knocked it out of the park i also enjoyed all of the musical callbacks to the video games and there were a lot of little easter eggs and references hidden throughout the film that nintendo fans would enjoy the criticism that this movie gets over its plot is entirely deserved i was honestly asking why things were happening throughout the whole movie and after it ended i wondered what sort of story it was trying to tell if that was the amount of development growth we were going to get if i wasn t already familiar with the characters i would have been entirely lost on their motivations as well it sort of felt like they were attempting to recreate the vibe of the lego movie but missed the mark by quite a bit i think this is attributable to how nintendo likes to treat its flagship franchise and they played it entirely too safe with the movie this is how the latest games in the mario series feel as well technically excellent and polished but relatively safe with nothing new or groundbreaking for the franchise this is probably why the plot is the way it is with nothing really happening or anything being progressed
kevin michael richardson doing a really good peter lorre impression was a nice surprise great choice for kamek
did he do it did he do the mario
not a great movie but definitely doesn t deserve to be rotten on rt it s a very fun movie which is exactly what it needed to be my year old cousins absolutely loved it and that s the important thing it s a kids movie that adults and fans of the games can also enjoy
movie was absolutely fine pratt was better than expected and jack black was fun there were funny moments and cute gags but most of the jokes fell flat story barely existed my biggest laugh in the movie was when mario and donkey kong abruptly got serious and confronted their personal demons in the belly of an eel as if they had character arcs a true point and say the thing you recognize movie shout out to the parents behind me who kept shushing their kids while shouting insight like that s from mario kart jack black is in tenacious d and i love easter eggs through the entire runtime
why did this animated movie have better cgi than all the marvel movies that sewer scene with the water looked so real haha pretty decent movie but wished they had taken the toy story approach and made it kid yet adult
movie was fine kids loved it i probably won t watch it again i really think they could have halved the amount of content in the movie and then used the time they saved to flesh out the rest and the movie would have been much better they just kept introducing things for the sake of introducing them but never did anything interesting with them bowser is going to the mushroom kingdom because he s going to use the star to destroy it so they need an army they go to get the army then they lose the army bowser doesn t even need to use the star to destroy the mushroom kingdom he just has a big ass bomb so the star would have made him unbeatable meaning an army wouldn t have helped the army got captured so they didn t help he didn t use the star so he didn t need it so him getting it was just to create the conflict that drove peach to seek out the army that wouldn t have been able to help i think i m not complaining that it doesn t make sense i m complaining that the lack of sense it makes means that there s an entire section of movie that is just completely irrelevant they didn t introduce things to solve problems they fabricated potential problems to offer justification to introduce new things everything in the movie wound up feeling rushed they never had time to explore anything because they were constantly trying to zip through whatever was happening to get to what was happening next
jack black was great as bowser i really enjoyed his character and his singing in the piano scene
why did people hate this movie took the wife and kids and everyone loved it even my year old sat still for it
i had a lot of fun definitely a fan service movie not the best pacing or story but if you played anything nintendo ever you d enjoy this
i m a huge nintendo fan but i can tell this movie isn t aimed at the older audience and that is fine i still had a fun time and felt like they put in effort with the hidden easter eggs punch out duck hunt etc my issues are the fact that they didn t have the actors do a voice l like it was seth rogans laugh on dk and that is just weird the have a huge library of mystic to pull from and they use 80s hype music which i felt like was out of place i didn t really think making mario a joke for of the movie was a good idea but it is the story they wanted to tell so it is what it is it was a fun time for what it was but i feel like a lot was left on the table
was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but boy did i enjoy myself thin characters and a thinner plot serving as a vehicle for minutes of nostalgia inducing leo pointing at the tv fan service moments is basically exactly what i signed up for it being an actually good movie would ve just been gravy but i got what i wanted so i m happy
it was better than i thought it would be and worse than it should have been like a b as a mario movie for kids it was fine as a movie the one was better if for no other reason than it was wildly creative and had better pacing seriously give it a second chance and don t think of it as mario so the good the animation is spectacularly gorgeous everyone looks and moves great and most of the action scenes are a ton of whimsical fun without taking themselves seriously the brooklyn origin story for the characters is back in full force and is executed well the references to older lore some of the movie s initial and finale beats are actually directly inspired by the movie to my surprise are done well in a way that humanizes the mario brothers at the start better than most of the games have in a long time the casting is great with charlie day s luigi and jack black s bowser being perfect surprisingly chris pratt does a very good mario in line with the older brooklyn voice tradition of the character he emotes and twists his voice around a lot more than he s ever done before if you re familiar with the late 80s and early 90s mario prior to charles martinet voicing the character then this will strike a chord that older brooklyn mario was always my preferred version of the character a naive working class everyman thrust into a weird world he doesn t understand and who has to bumble around to eventually succeed some people complain about seth rogen s donkey kong but honestly i thought his voice and laugh fit the character well cranky was a bit inconsistent but wasn t important enough of a character for it to matter much in my opinion the weakest of the major cast was anya taylor joy s peach who sounds generic and sometimes seems to read lines in ways that don t really fit the rest of the scene the most surprising aspect of the story that was an unexpected hit since it wasn t in the trailers much the dynamic between mario and donkey kong the movie spends a significant chunk of time pairing the two characters and delving into their rivalry of egos and it s pretty much the funniest parts of the whole movie it s also straight out of the early 80s mario donkey kong games media where they re just hilariously petty assholes to each other the neutral all the game references and easter eggs and stuff they probably should have focused more on the story than on the references to the video games but i can see why they did it the way they did the petty use of 80s pop music at some points some slow motion scenes that they intend to be funny but aren t typical illumination lowest common denominator stuff it s not obnoxious or overly prevalent like it is in their other work but every time it happened it would still make me just ask why who is this for not even kids like this i think the bad the worst thing about the movie is the pacing the first half is just way too rushed there s no breathing it s scenario to scenario non stop when at times it really needed to just stop and flesh the scene out for it to make any good narrative sense and for things to have a proper impact on the viewer i hate to say it because i generally prefer shorter movies over unnecessarily drawn out things but at minutes it really could have used at least another minutes the story itself is thin as hell in part because of how it s rushed the biggest sin is that there is no grand adventure at any point in the movie that portion just gets completely skipped over in the rush to the next big set piece so there isn t that sense of travel and wonder in discovering the world like there was in the japanese animated movie or even in how the movie explored its hellscape this also means that the characters don t get what they need to shine i get that nintendo wants to play it as safe as possible but there is very little character development except for mario a little and to a much lesser extent luigi and donkey kong a lot of characters are just straight up sidelined when using them more would have significantly improved the movie the biggest sin here is with luigi who goes completely underutilized for most of the movie he does have stuff to do in the last act but his character arc is underdeveloped and it would have made a lot more sense if he had been more actively involved earlier instead we get a lot of redundant princess peach action and yet she doesn t even get her own background plotlines resolved and toad just kind of ceases to exist for the last part of the movie focusing on him more would also have been a better move than what the movie does instead he ends up not really serving any purpose at all the wedding scene would have been immeasurably better if for example luigi had figured out a way to break the prisoners out before they were taken to the wedding and led them to crash it lumalee s role in the galaxy games was to sell the player items you don t think that might have been a way to use the character better than just comedy relief perhaps having luigi bargain with the nihilistic luma for an item it would have given luigi his own parallel understanding of how items work in the world leading a prisoner revolt army would harken back to his role in the super mario adventures comic and crashing the wedding would have been a nod to super paper mario s intro it was all right there in front of them such a better twist and yet all wasted in favor of giving peach another generic action scene and having mario do a basic last second rescue in contrast to the mario vs dk dynamic other than in the beginning the mario bros don t actually interact with each other much at all since they re separated for the whole movie and that s a damn waste because their relationship at the start is really the most heartfelt and well executed part of the movie the reason for all this is definitely because they re gunning for sequels and a cinematic universe wanted to set up the world now and leave enough room for character development later can t use luigi now when they might need that character arc for a potential luigi s mansion movie it s definitely not a coincidence they portray him as being afraid of dogs to set up for polterpup later but it s to the absolute detriment of this movie the fact that this movie is so threadbare in terms of story and character is getting it slammed by critics justifiably so and that risks the potential for sequels more than if they just had done a better job of focusing on this one movie instead of planning a cinematic universe anyway overall it was a fun movie but it could and should have been a lot better i m really hoping that they get the sequels they want to do where hopefully they can slow down and let us appreciate both the world and the character interactions more
first rotten tomatoes ive been to where people clapped at the end
i definitely understand there s problems but i had such a blast with this movie i had a huge smile on my face throughout if i was a kid this would ve been my favorite movie
i saw this tonight at a vip theatre with no one under and everyone enjoyed it it was absolutely awesome how they tied in so many of the items and even the music from the different games into the movie
great movie it s exactly what i expected a mario movie to be loved the original soundtrack and the animation was incredible it was really fun
all the voices were a ok and whoever snuck that f zero poster in i appreciate you more than you know
this was pure enjoyment from start to finish theater was filled with a great crowd and i can t remember the last time i got so much good feels from seeing a movie in the cinema
kids loved it and so did i peaches song was the best part and finding the easter eggs all throughout no one mentioning ballon man or the ice climbers polar bear
the story fell flat
i thought it was pretty good decent i will say though that the movie felt like it was missing something maybe it was just the pacing or how some of the jokes landed but the movie kinda felt like a rough draft think if they tweeked some things and added a little to it could ve been one of the best animated movies of all time also the soundtrack didn t quite hit well for me and think cranky kong s voice didn t really match his character should ve been more older sounding and used the crankeyness to land a few more jokes other than that it was enjoyable
saw it yesterday and i loved it it was everything i dreamed of for over years definitely going to watch it again soon
i never thought luigi deflecting a fire blast from bowser with a trash lid was gonna give me goosebumps
this movie wasn t for me it was clearly made for a much younger demographic which is fine that being said what got the biggest laugh out of me was the year old next to me when the opening credits started little bit mario and luigi came out and the nintendo logo revealed to them jumping around this kid goes to his mom i have no idea what the heck that was
i enjoyed the movie but the voice acting for cranky kong was awwwwful
it s fine a perfectly serviceable sometimes funny but illunimation movie lots of nice deep cut references like it better than the minions anyway my one pet peeve is that they have the greatest collection of video game music with koji kondo s decades of work but still feel the need for super random pop songs except the jack black songs those were great and the nihilist luma hope we get rosalina next
what a weird end credits scene is yoshi the big bad of the sequel joke i love yoshi but i feel like almost any other character would have been more hype they seem like a character that should have just been there already
mario was a big part of my life growing up and is still a part of my life as an adult this franchise means a lot to me i saw it with my brother and one of my best friends who are all diehard fans of the series it s probably the most fun i ve ever had at a movie theater and i loved this movie there are so many little references and callbacks the music was fantastic not the pop songs they felt the need to throw in there i just wish this movie would have let itself breathe a bit the plot went from one thing to another at lightspeed there were a few moments that came to mind that had the potential to be really heartfelt and moving but the pacing didn t allow that to happen the first one is at the beginning of the movie after mario s dad embarrasses him and calls him a failure for not only ruining himself but bringing his brother down with him luigi brings mario his dinner and tells him that he s not bringing him down instead of letting those two have a nice moment mario sees the city flooding and the movie cuts it off and has the two brothers rush to try and save the city the other moment that came to mind was after mario and dk had been swallowed by eel mario says his dad thinks he s a failure too and instead of having them bond and connect over their inabily to please their dad you have dk throw a witty one liner that kind of kills the moment i loved this movie but i think having some of these character moments could have taken it to another level i hope to see them maybe add those in a potential sequel but hearing what people on here say about illumination i shouldn t get my hopes up lol
the end credit scene totally reminded me of the end credit scene from godzilla https://youtu.be/rroxxvr5rk0)
saw it yesterday didn t think much of it my biggest gripe is jack black playing bowser playing jack black the songs were out of place and not necessary it s a whole lot of remember this and nothing else of substance fans will dig it now but it won t hold up over time
i had my scepticism about the casting for the new super mario movie like most i thought chris pratt was a questionable choice at best but after seeing the movie today i was decently impressed with all the voice acting minus seth rogan i can t be the only one who ll think this he did nothing and i mean absolutely nothing to contribute to the role of donkey kong barring that it was a fun movie if you or your kids enjoyed either of the new sonic movies i definitely recommend the mario movie but i really hope rogan gets some well deserved criticism over phoning this one in
i initially gave the movie a because i found it serviceable at best but like the rise of skywalker the more i think about this movie the more it pisses me off because of all the missed potential x200b if i were given the task of rewriting the movie here are a couple things i d want to change the beginning of the movie is pretty much fine i m personally not a fan of the dog section but whatever we can keep it also the massive flood in brooklyn is never explained so maybe just throw a line in explaining how that was actually the brothers fault from the earlier mishap maybe we can tie that into mario s motivations show that he s a screw up who s trying to become more also i d really like to dive into why they chose to become plummers the idea that mario and luigi quit their job to pursue their dream of plumbing is a choice but if i m given a bit more motivation for why they are drawn to plumbing i can accept it even if the reason is simply that they want to own their own business that s more characterization than to current movie gives us could give us opportunities for fun character moments later in the movie what was the deal with the warp pipe in brooklyn let s explain that a bit more here we have an easy way to tie into the flooding issue maybe the plumber s mishap somehow burst a line next to the warp pipe activating it and warping gravity and yadda yadda or don t do that but at least give us a bit of lore into the warp pipes how did it get there why was it sealed off ok here s a nitpick why is mario a parkouring plummer i like that he is but we could easily give some character details that show why also the world side scrolling bit was cute and this was a good way to show off how mario has his platforming skills in the mushroom kingdom unlike ok onto mario getting to the mushroom kingdom first the idea of separating the bros is a good one and i dig the inversion of having the rescue mission be about luigi instead of peach we ll keep this basic plot in tact also the sections with bowser are pretty great and don t need to really change i love that he s on the warpath just because he s in love with peach and wants to impress her it s true to the games and a great surprise however the stuff with mario is where we get to the real issues with the movie first his quick befriending of peach she s like oh you re human and you want to save your brother cool come on this diplomatic mission to the apes with me like her logic doesn t track she s the ruler of a kingdom and mario has done nothing to warrant her attention he only comes along because the plot demands it he doesn t even finish the obstacle course speaking of the moment the movie really started losing me was the obstacle course section this part of the movie is pure fanservice it s an excuse to get familiar visuals from the game and put them in the movie and to explain how powerups work here s the thing tho it completely stops the movie in its tracks i see a lot of complains about the movie feeling rushed and i think a big part of why can be tied back to this scene here for like minutes the characters do nothing of import mario just keeps trying to get through this obstacle course so he can prove himself worthy of this mission and peach literally sits there and watches i turned to my wife and asked doesn t she have anything better to do and they re at this like all night long peach is the ruler of a kingdom she must have other things to attend to than watch some guy do parkour all night the real kicker this scene isn t needed because we ve already established mario as agile earlier in the movie we don t need a training scene so here s what i d change about this remove this part of the movie make it so peach needs a mcguffin to travel and tells mario that if he can fetch the mcguffin he can come along what should the mcguffin be how about one of the many super stars you collect in mario how about this peach has a super star ready to go to power a warp pipe or portrait or something that will take her where she needs to go then mario runs into her and somehow breaks it she s pissed and is convinced this new guy is just a screw up getting in her way tying back to the themes we establish earlier in this rewrite she now has to go collect another super star in some remote location but mario tells her he can get it so she lets him show his skills and collect it himself this impresses her when he does it and so now he gets to join the mission this works better than an obstacle course training montage because again he is already capable this is another chance to show a fun new location from the games and most importantly it gives him and peach an actual conflict to overcome in their relationship i think probably we don t need the kongs in this movie they are a major contribution to the big problem of this movie has too much stuffed in it this movie needs to make me care about characters mario peach luigi and bowser the problem is that instead of doing that it throws everything from the games that it possibly can at me so that i do the leonardo point as often as possible and yeah some times it works but references and easter eggs are shallow they re fun but if that s all your movie has going for it it doesn t make for a strong movie the lego movie is jam packed with easter eggs and references but never loses sight of it s themes and it s character s journeys and that s why it s so beloved i cant say the same for this movie mario barely has a character arc peach does not that is a big problem donkey kong has more of an arc than mario does right the kongs yeah cut them lets be honest they re just a vehicle pun intended also not my original pun for the mario kart set piece and the donkey kong fight and okay i think the concept of a mario kart set piece is really fun but man so much of the screen time ends up devoted to this set piece it seems like a really great concept for the sequel not this movie and donkey kong he s pretty fun i m still not really loving the idea of him being a seth rogan character let alone talking period he s got some funny lines no doubt but i wouldn t have made the apes talk i wouldn t have given the apes this crazy advanced civilization either again probably shouldn t have them in this movie period but if we have to have donkey kong lets really be true to his origin lets have him fight mario early in the movie in brooklyn while mario is trying to save pauline maybe he got through the warp pipe kidnapped pauline who is mario s ex took her to a construction site mario ends up taking him down in that construction site he runs off mario chases him back through warp pipe then later in the movie they meet again and become reluctant allies and dk would be the only kong we meet peach s mission would be something else entirely maybe a quest to recover more super stars before bowser does give luigi something to do maybe have him interact more with bowser throughout the movie like replace him with kamek in a lot of bowser s scenes could even have an interesting bromance between the two that could be funny from there the ending can be more or less the same i guess that means for me the first and third act generally work while the second generally doesn t that s a problem because that s where we are supposed to really get to know our characters so that by the time the third act comes we re rooting for them the third act is fine on paper but it doesn t hit the way it should because the second act is so weak x200b this is all frustrating because i think some of these notes aren t that special or impossible to figure out i think things happened nintendo must have been a real pain to work with and didn t want to their characters to have real flaws to overcome which made it hard to write a good story around them hence double down on easter eggs and set pieces and then there s just let s call it illuminations house style frenetic goofy humor and action gratuitous needle drops didn t even get into those remove every single one and not a lot else not inherently bad but also must have contributed to the movie being so shallow i think both these companies prioritized making a crowd pleaser over making a strong story you d think the two are the same thing but clearly not you can have both but you have to start with a strong story
bowser s peaches peaches peaches peaches song absolutely sent me jack black is amazing
really really wanted to love this one big mario fan pulled my son out of school he s only four so it s not like it matters with a surprise trip to the movies and it was just alright visuals were well done as expected the music was excellent and the acting was great but man the movie had very little else going for it the character interactions were meh it was incredibly shallow and i think worst of all it felt very generic mario is a franchise with so many iconic looks and places the mushroom kingdom had elements of what people loved creatures blocks etc but a lot of the inclusions felt surface level like the world could ve been from dr seuss and very little would ve changed i loved the first minutes and thought the movie was going to be a massive hit i still think it ll do well and probably spawn sequels but it could ve been a lot more tbh i m never big on kids movies outside of the greats from pixar ghibli etc but this was even more for kids than i expected just with some nods thrown in my son enjoyed it which is what really matters
that was probably the most fun i ve had watching a movie i was smiling for most of it it made me so happy the score was amazing and seeing all these characters from my childhood bowser was definitely my favorite part
i really enjoyed the movie not sure why the critics are tearing it my theatre was all adults and was laughing out loud for a lot of the portions sure it s basic but i don t go in expecting a shakespeare from mario solid i think
plot was not the strongest but the humor was top notch and they could not have done the games any better justice which is all you can ask for
i love mario and nintendo but this film didn t really do much for me the plot is so rushed and ironically the best part of the movie for me was the slow paced opening act where mario and luigi were plumbing once the action begins it never really stops and just becomes mindless cinema all the character building is rushed as well for instance mario meets peach and within seconds they are best friends i much prefer the sonic movies to the mario movie at least sonic takes the time to let the characters grow into actual characters i know it s a weird critique but i also feel like mario bros is too videogamey there s lots of scenes of mario platforming and collecting power ups which admittedly do look nice but are kind of boring to watch it would be like if the sonic movies spent most of their runtime focused on sonic running around loop de loops and collecting rings thankfully the sonic movies are less videogamey than mario for me but my kids loved it
meh imo while the visuals the references and the fan service was there the story was un inspirational predictable and made investment in any of the characters it just jumped from one set piece to another and that was about it the fights the action sequences were the same as other mediocre movies before with all the ideas in the world crammed in it felt like an animated fast furious movie at times found most characters and their voice actors annoying except for bowser and toad and chris pratt as mario definitely didn t work for me
i ll be that guy this movie was pretty much devoid of emotion despite the charming animation best parts were donkey kong having seth rogen s laugh and that masochistic star thing even compared to illumination s worst this was pretty watered down keegan jack black were both underutilized i smell a lot of overbearing nintendo regulations on this one also peach got as much if not more screen time than mario but i m not even complaining because mario pretty much lacked any semblance of unique character here and despite some strange dialogue from peach she was pretty cool here and i enjoy what they did with her character
honestly this sucked was nothing more than minutes of hey remember when this happened in the game without any substance behind any of it at least the animation looked good
frankly i found it rather shallow and pedantic
i wished the movie could ve been a bit longer but overall loved it and hoping for a sequel
i think the coolest easter egg i ve seen nobody talk about yet is how when mario and luigi break through the wall in the brooklyn sewers the hole in the wall is shaped like the bit nes mario head
i don t know how to handle this information
he is one of our most rectangular shaped actors
half expected the rock to show up like he does everywhere else
it d be pretty funny if since it s live action it was like people wearing cardboard boxes the whole time
the superhero era really has ended and now we re stuck with video game adaptations
i would have loved to see rob mcelhenney s take
isn t this movie based on the minecraft book the island by max brooks author of world war z if so i won t mind seeing it read the book to my kid and it wasn t bad
why did they have to make it live action
this post reads like a middle school food dare like i dare you to mix your chocolate milk the lima beans and the potatoes with jelly and eat it
i didn t exept to wake up to today expecting a live action minecraft movie to be announced actually no one did
first five minutes of the movie is building a dirt house
voiced by chris pratt edit cameo appearances by vin diesel as groot as a tree the rock in a recurring role as gravel sharon stone as stone and thomas haden church revising two previous roles flint marko as flint and also sandman as sand
i need help reacting to something
i don t know how to feel
well granted minecraft steve does have enough superpowers to be an avenger superhuman strength speed and agility near endless stamina supernatural healing factor can extend his reach over two meters wielding of magic tools and armor etc
featuring nicolas cage as the enderman
what
what tf has happened this week
napoleon dynamite director jared hess this could be fun
april fools is over my friend
what exactly could the plot even be about
this feels like an ai generated news headline
my brain just melted like a bowl of ice cream in the oven
this better be about a villager seeking revenge against steve
this is a week too late from april fools buddy
so how exactly will this work will momoa have a squarehead
quite literally one of the worst ideas i have ever heard
is this real life
why would you not make this cgi are they going to make it aimed at edgy young adults and lean into the dark horror of the minecraft world i would rather minutes or computer generated blocky joke filled shenanigans tbh
honest to god you could ve put any actor actress for the title and i would ve been like alright sure
nah chief this ain t it
can we stop calling these heavily animated films live action
this should be on r nottheonion
who asked for this crap
i don t believe he s a good actor
jason manoa to be voiced by chris pratt
this is going to be the citizen kane of live action video game movies
but like why
guys april fools was last week
fucking why
but why
he sucks box office poison i get that he has broad appeal but for fucks sake
so it s a movie about a guy surviving in the wilderness and he builds a house and then finds some diamonds and goes to another dimension to fight a dragon alright it could be cool i guess
this has to be the dumbest thing i ve heard in a while a minecraft movie in live action is just a movie about some guy living in the wilderness
i was hoping for a michael cera you know he d get caught by a creeper
i would ve expected an animated movie and that has as much potential and room to work with as the lego movie did so that could ve been awesome but no they decided to remove the key art style which removes the entire identity of minecraft by making it live action what the hell were they huffing when they decided to greenlight this
surprised we haven t heard christ pratt will voice steve in the minecraft movie yet
this movie sounds like a flop from the jump who is making decisions in hollywood these days oh that s right millennials are getting their shot
if it s anything like the minecraft parody nigahiga made i m on board
who else can punch trees without getting hurt
why not at this point it will make a shit load of money and probably sell an unfathomable amount of merch
forget cinematic universes that was so 2010s now we just make video game adaptations even though the screenwriters directors and most of the actors don t play those games
it finally happened they are running out of movie ideas
yeah i wanna see this so bad
why
creative bankruptcy
i hate it here
no one asked for this movie please stop
he s looks like that uncle
who asked for this
pack it up boys they are mining shit now this planets done
kill me i don t wanna live on this fucking planet anymore
so steve looks like jason momoa is canon now
the title of this post is the dumbest sentence i ve read in a long time that s not american politics related haha
california needs to pass a law that for a whole year no movie can be released that is part of a pre existing ip god that d nice
i mean if he s gonna play steve the casting could definitely be worse tall dark broad shoulders is really all you need
can t wait to see momoa facing against the ender dragon
i guess hollywood is fully embracing video games now that superheroes are beginning to wane
can someone like my comment i m trying to up my comment karma pweeze i ll be forever in your debt also video game movies usually suck but hopefully this will be good
no material is better suited to live action film than an bit video game absolutely nothing mark my words this will be a cinematic masterpiece
wat
no way we re not in a simulation for a fucking marketing company at this point my god
what ideas and who s pinching them up at hollywood and who tf approves them
it does make the special effects cgi budget cheap this looks all blocky and low res good job guys
those are all words i know and understand but when you put them together like that i just can t comprehend it
it ain t minecraft unless every thing is cubed shaped give me boxy khal drogo or nothing at all
fucking why
what the fuck does this even mean is everything going to be realistic just block shapes is it just momoa in minecraft is he going to be blocky if so how is that live action
is this a movie anyone really needs
what about the animated minecraft movie is that s still happening
hope he plays the giant who smashes everyone s buildings
wut
oh come on
i m guessing live action is about as accurate as the sources that said the mario movie coming out this weekend was going to be live action
it s nice when they let you know it s going to suck up front
sounds like a random ai generator headline
please don t
i literally loled
what
live action disappointing
i mean that sure is going to be a movie
my kids have tried to get me to play minecraft as far as i understand it the plot is dig a hole until you fall through the world then break antigravity trees and mine rocks with your bare hands until a zombie kills you then you start over this movie s gonna be terrible
bleak
no
how the fuck do you make a live action minecraft it doesn t have a protagonist to use
no comment
yep we are teaching stupid levels of the live action trend
how about make an actual fuckin movie and not just an ad for an ip
sure why not
animation better be similar to puss in boots
usually only have chance in your life to see a given movie in theaters
shit i go see movies in theaters that are already available streaming or i own a copy of
to my wife and i one of our favorite dates is dinner and a movie we like the whole experience sure we could order delivery and watch a movie on streaming but it s different and not always what we are looking for
most moviegoers will still go to the movies well yea they re moviegoers how many are no longer moviegoers because they know the movie will be streaming seems like a deliberately misleading headline to make it seem like theaters aren t struggling as much as they really are
there s a million things that can distract me whenever i m watching a movie at home in the theater i have no choice but to stare at the screen and pay attention
i m old enough to have lived through blockbuster and local rentals and my attitude is basically the exact same as back then if it looks worthy of seeing on a big screen i will if not i ll wait until it comes out on video streaming cable the high seas
maybe make movie tickets cheap again and you d have plenty of people going it s not worth it to go to the theater
i go see a movie in theaters for the experience not because i don t think i ll ever see the movie again
theater is always a mixed experience in my opinion yes big screen decent audio and all that but also annoying other moviegoers who can t shut up don t turn off their phones etc overpriced snacks seats that get more uncomfortable as it goes on it s never been a completely good experience for me there s always something that makes it a bit meh for me
those are two of the many findings in the symbiotic future of theatrical streaming a new report from uta iq the agency s research and analytics group the page report offers extensive validation for the traditional theatrical release model using data collected january to from u s consumers between the ages of and interesting that this is a study of consumers conducted over days but yes it s also an obvious answer to an obvious question most people who already like going to the theater will keep going to the theater even though their tv is arguably just as good in terms of pq and they can access the stuff on their tv really easily the size the exclusivity and the sound make it worthwhile the problem isn t that people are picking streaming over theatrical exhibition because people still really like theatrical exhibition it s that theatrical exhibition is run by an endless parade of absolute nitwits who insist on making going to the movies so cost prohibitive that the only thing that makes going to one worth it is knowing that the money you re spending will result in as much spectacle as possible for the money you spent which by default limits what kind of movie will justify itself theatrically which necessitates forever upcharging everyone to make up for the folks who keep deciding to just stay home until you re basically left with an amusement park that specializes almost entirely in kids films for grownups
guilty as charged i prefer seeing movies in cinema even though i can sail the seven seas at home
movies generally have incredible sound and picture which really immerses me in the movie in my opinion a theatre is the best way to watch a movie
i would love if they would bring back more older hit movies or even tv content to the big screen i would pay to bring my kids to see a harry potter or star wars or lotr movie on a big screen we loved watching the demon slayer anime in the theatre recently too
for me personally it s a good reason to get out of the house on days when there isn t any obligation to keeps me from becoming too depressed and sedentary
it s not impatience that drives me to the theater it s wanting to see a big spectacle type film on a big screen with big speakers
people being inconsiderate assholes has ruined movie going for me personally i used to love to go now i honestly can t stand it
i still love going to the theater i spend each time i go and i don t care because i know it is keeping the theater open top gun dungons and dragons john wick if it s an action movie i go to the theater get a giant bucket of popcorn and a soda and enjoy the experience especially now that theaters have nice reclining seats and don t jam you in like sardines
not me i d rather rent a new release at home for than spend at the theater just to have the experience ruined by people who don t know how to shut the fuck up or leave their phone in their pocket for hours i can t remember the last time i went to a theater and had a good viewing experience people suck
it s about the experience most people will still go out to eat even if they can cook at home
the worst thing about theaters are the other people it has only gotten worse in my lifetime i may never go to a theater ever again
i thought that i was in the majority in thinking that the theater experience sucks ass people talking opening loud packages opening their bright phones in a dark room fuck that i prefer to create my own distractions at home
haven t been in a theater since i have no desire to return to one no matter what experience i m being sold the convenience of my own home my own control my own food and my own toilet is better people and theaters are gross
whichever is the least expensive and least annoying option is the one i go for
still upsets me to this day that i couldn t watch the irishman in theaters
it s almost like many people don t have the huge screens and great sound systems at home plus there s still nothing like seeing a movie at the theatre
i go to see movies i own on dvd in theaters all the time guess what its about the experience i will never have an interest in watching some films in theaters while others i ll always want to see in theater with an audience
shocking news people who enjoy the experience to see movies at the theaters go to the theaters
i ve always hated the movie going experience and it s only gotten worse i have zero interest to spend that kinda money on tickets and popcorn for a movie i m gonna be surrounded by people talking or with phones out on max brightness no thank you
unpopular opinion for this sub movie theaters are inconvenient and awful the people are noisy and distracting the movies always start minutes late you can t pause for a quick bio break and the showtimes are often inconvenient
i have severe adhd it s the only way i can force myself to pay attention to movies
amc shorts ready to close
i go to the cinema to watch movies i m really excited about other movies that i m interested enough in to add to my watchlist i ll watch online later
makes sense to me some movies really are made for the big screen
i m always going to prefer going to theaters thankfully my theater is awesome and clean and they have tuesdays and free popcorn with membership card which is free so i just sneak in a drink
movie theaters are at their best a really wonderful experience
so i like movies my tv and sound system are better than cinema quality for a 15x25 rec room but i still really enjoy the movie going experience so much that i go at least once per week streaming has had no effect on my theater going and i don t think it ever will
nothing beats a cinema
a good movie in the right theatre can be a great experience
well yea seeing as you have to go to a theater to be a moviegoer
until i have a massive screen the size of a small building and super surround system and no glare on my tv and super blacks yes i will
your telling me audiences will go to an expensively built and crafted theatre to experience a movie over watching it on their phone or tv at home colour me shocked
hell yeah i love going to the movies i loved it since i was a kid and in the last years we got an incredible new movie theater brand in my country too
i m glad that theaters are still strong despite the rapid rise of streaming
yes i don t have a ft screen and surround sound don t ever let the movies die
to be honest i like going to the cinema not only just for the experience but also because it kinda forces me to go and watch the movie it gives me a limited window in which to see it while it s out so i ll actually make plans to message my mate or speak to my fiance and arrange to see it one evening whereas if it s coming straight to streaming i kind of just mentally add it to my list to watch eventually as there s no rush or pressure to watch it soon and i find i often just don t end up watching it because the list just gets bigger and bigger
theatre going is an experience entirely unlike streaming different people do it for different reasons too like a group social activity a date or just viewing alone
i love the reality of this it doesn t matter how much companies with a certain mindset will try to use convenience as it s greatest weapon to win over consumers people still want to have a memorable experience even if it s something as small or simple as watching a movie in a movie theater these types of experiences and pastimes still matter to people thankfully
the experience in movie theaters are just irreplaceable sometimes i think movies are just best watched in theaters to fully appreciate its value
movies are an escape for me they are perfect for my self care days i love going out and treating myself to a manicure before going to the theater the experience is just different i suppose
i pay so much better attention to movies in theaters plus it s a night out of the house great experience people should do it more often
haven t been in a cinema for years maybe i am just lazy but watching from home is much more comfortable in many regards having to dodge spoilers for some time is the only notable downside for me
the silver screen is a magic experience a journey into a story we share in a communal setting it s completely different than your living room or on an airplane etc
so many things have been killing off theatrical for decades dvds cable vhs tv its a line of thought that has been wrong for decades but people keep trying to sound insightful by proclaiming that this thing will stop people from going to theaters problem is people want to go provided there is good product to see seeing a movie in a theater is a fundamentally different experience than watching it at home its equivalent to asking when people will stop going to stadiums to see a ball game or a football game sure some people will stop going and opt for the home bubble but that has been an option for a very long time
i m not one of them i don t wait for streaming though if it s a movie i know i will buy on 4k i ll just wait to buy it i have a nice tv and nice atmos system so no need to spend the same amount on the movie twice
streamed top gun maverick shortly before the oscars and spent a good amount of time wishing i d seen it in theaters some films are just meant to be experienced that way it s been a few years and i really want to go back thinking back on my theater going experiences stand out titanic days later no country for old men each are still powerful in their own right at home but the theater experiences were unforgettable for a young kid teenager at the time
can t we get some kind of moderation on banning everyone who uses this style of title writing
i would go see everything in theatres problem is they fill half the damn screens with marvel movies and animated movies no screens saved for movies that involve writing and acting
so most movie goers go to the movies most car drivers drive cars
of course only on reddit are there movie fans who despise the idea of going to a theater lol
i am not one of those people but i m glad those who want to go to the movies can do so
some people go to cinema not only for movie but other thing like date or family outing
i am so glad that some people still feel the magic of the big screen i love going to the movies if a movie comes along that i feel good about i wouldn t miss the opportunity to watch it on the big screen especially if the movie is in 3d
i gave up on theatres pre covid when i went to see it chapter and the guys next to me were smoking weed and shouting over the movie so i asked the theatre employees to intervene and they instead just offered me a voucher for another night no experience of seeing a movie on the big screen is worth the strangers i have to watch it with
i haven t been to the theater in years im all for streaming at home
okay and these comments are great but its still just for tickets for family the concessions are out of control and yea you kinda can recreate a theater experience now not to mention the bathroom pretty sure tom cruise wrote this article
not me lol
no one i know has gone to a movie theater since or the experience sucks audiences suck prices suck and movies just aren t that great
theaters lost their attraction for me when i got a decent big screen and surround sound in the late 90s for me the theater experience means overpriced food drinks a screen that s always at least a little less sharp than my tv and if it s crowded there will be noise even when people are trying to be quiet i d rather wait a month or two or three or four and pay to stream it
it depends on the movie time who i m watching it with etc some movies i d rather watch whenever at home others i d always go to the theater for i do wish they d shorten the gap between theater and streaming or even do both at the same time
i have found that if i don t see a movie in the theater no matter how much i want to see it i will rarely go back and watch it at home once it s available i simply don t enjoy the experience of watching a movie at home nearly as much as i do in the theater watching a movie at home doesn t give me that sense of escaping the world for a couple of hours that going to the theater does sure there s the occasional asshple but considering how often i go to the theater those kinds of encounters are thankfully quite rare
idk why but this makes me really happy
so they can put shit out on streaming right away then if it s not affecting the people who want to go to theaters which is what i alsways assumed then there s no good reason to force those of us who don t want to go to theaters to wait right right i m going to watch at home one way or the other might as well make twenty bucks on me renting it on release night instead of making four bucks on me three or four months later when i rent it
most moviegoers will go to the movies shocker
can t beat movie experience imo
i have a great television and fairly nice setup down in my basement and with that there are still movies that need to be seen initially in the big screen big screen big sound other like minded movie goers all around you can t be replaced
literally i don t wanna be at my house i can t afford atmos ain t no dolby ain t no none of that i was forced to stay home for two years fuck that
nah they won t but good try
in the same way we ll still go to a concert even though spotify has of the songs you want to hear for free cheap per month yeah it s a different experience
because the experience is so much better in a theatre i saw the super mario bros movie a couple hours ago where i live it s already available in imax 3d and holy sh t why don t i go to the theatre more often
i think most people enjoy movies more when they are at the theater so many movies where i watched them at home and was disappointed because i m less immersed the movie is broken up by distractions im on my phone and i know i would have enjoyed it more in theaters banshees of innishirn is a recent example for me i normally love movies like this but i watched it at home and it just didn t grab me the way i know it would have if i watched it in theaters my buddy didn t like eeaao but he also didn t see it in theaters where everyone was cracking up or crying that communal experience adds something to the film
there s aspects of the theatre experience that you can t replicate at home like being focused just on the movie without being distracted by your phone or family members or sneaking in a pizza to eat while you re watching the movie
glad to know that people who identify as moviegoers go to see movies in theaters thanks for this study
i love this it makes sense too i think people online often think everyone else is online as much as them and aware of all these windows release dates and industry games strategies that the average moviegoer doesn t really care about they see a trailer on tv or wherever and catch the movie when they have time if they miss it they miss it
the whole point is seeing it on the big screen so of course
i don t tbh maybe if it s a must see like avatar or something but those are few and far between now
nothing better than seeing a big blockbuster on opening day with other excited fans
that s the best place to watch movies
watching at home is great but with movies like interstellar br2049 dune avatar maverick etc the big screen is an absolute must for me watching at home doesn t even compare
i know i can order take away and eat at home but food somehow tastes better in the same restaurants me
i saw glass onion in theater rather than at home i enjoy a movie theater experience that said i tend to go on discount days tickets are just too much
maybe i m in the minority but i enjoy waiting for most movies to come to streaming there are a exceptions a year usually where i have to see the movie because i am really excited about it other than that i ll wait because i am a introvert at heart the exceptions this year are john wick beau is not afraid and dune out side of those ill wait
i can play darts at home but it s more fun at the bar same concept
there s still no substitute for a big screen
the movie theatre is an experience it s not the same as watching the film at home
press x to doubt
well yeah that s because if you aren t going for the experience you stopped going in like when it became too expensive not because of streaming
i went to see top gun maverick like times at the theater movies was made for big screen and i love planes so great combination also watched elvis a couple of times the amc by me had old movies so i went to watch jaws and enjoyed also had the chance to watch the original top gun on theaters since i wasn t born when it came out and it was a fun experience even tho i have watched several times there s something about watching a movie in theaters that can t be replicated at home
i go to the theater because i don t have a popcorn machine at home microwave popcorn isn t the same
united talent agency in case anyone was wondering what bastion of unbiased and properly evaluated quantitative research was behind the study
doubt
aw i guess your parents never told you huh i guess we all have to learn sometime i hate to tell you this kiddo but martin lawrence isn t real
i don t know but google seems to keep getting dumber which makes no sense considering recent advances in ai i just looked up bad boys and martin lawrence is listed but he s the 38th name on the list
no clue why google would do that but i d use imdb either way it s much better for that type of stuff and it definitely has him listed in those movies i checked for ya
i m not clear where google gets its info not imdb one weird one i noticed is the ides of march on imdb doesn t have ryan gosling in the first names despite being the co star and being on the poster but when you google ides of march cast it shows ryan gosling 2nd on the post itself though gosling s name is actually 1st ahead of clooney even
maybe he filed a right to forget grievance with google
can t say for martin lawrence but google famously alters and censors search results for whatever reasons see of the time financial they deem beneficial
https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11msa95/google_is_now_listing_charlton_heston_at_the/ it s just a thing that happens sometimes almost certainly a glitch in some code somewhere but if you can find a conspiracy theory that connects charlton heston and martin lawrence then go for it
my guess lawrence hasnt done much in a long time and seeing as a lot of his more recent newsworthy moments have been controversies his treatment of tisha campbell and the story about him groping her on a live set for instance google may be censoring him from the results either intentionally or not so intentionally
i still can not believe they digitally altered him from titanic he was behind dicaprio holding kate the entire time
very strange just checked with life and same thing if anyone hasn t seen life top tier comedy of all time
not sure why i m getting downvoted just curious since i ve never encountered this before
google sucks lately it can t even produce relevant search results anymore
omg that s wacky
this happened with arnold schwarzenegger a few months back as well
i feel a great conspiracy theory about to be born
who uses google for this use imdb
but then who played sheneneh one of our parents but but then who was the host of def comedy jam one of our parents
noooooooooo next you re gonna tell me that santa isn t real either
omg
my personal theory on this is the search engine is just a dead site and the real work is happening elsewhere the real reason is probably due to algorthmic fuckery happening by both the public and google themselves the site is about ads it was never about searching
ai is actually the problem google hasnt adapted well to the new technology so much of the internet is just ai regurgitated crap nowadays it used to be that you could ask a dilapidated question with half of everything spelled wrong and goodle would practically read your mind and absolutely nail it but that s because google was designed to read what real people were doing on the internet and it had perfected it s process over years ai was essentially a wrentch in the gears
planned obsolescence make the old technologies dysfunctional so people will feel compelled to migrate to the new ones companies after all are just shells for capital so large investment firms can leverage their positions over competitors to push technological trends in whatever directions they deem most profitable in the long run i suspect search engines have been deemed a non optimal technology and are being phased out
imdb is so fucking slow to load a lot of the time ever since they redid their site
yeah all other sites are accurate it s just strange that google results are like this never encountered such a thing before just curious if there was a reason behind it
i was just looking up christine taylor because of the brady bunch thread just to see the side by side of her as marcia brady with maureen mccormick had to type in the full christine taylor marcia brady because the autofill refused to do it despite trying to fill in thigs like christine taylor married to ben stiller or christine taylor math that happens all the time for some inexplicable reason despite that being one of her easily most well known roles it just wanted to talk about anything other than that
he just blended into the night but ask lawrence and hell say that james cameron didnt want a black man front and center so he digitally altered the shot
you fool delete this immediately the fastest way to get downvoted is to ask why you re being downvoted
reddit hates one thing above all comments that make sense and are interesting
vunter slaush
santa is real yetis are real bigfoot is fake though
i find myself just using google to get to wikipedia whatever i m searching for add wikipedia and you have the starting point for what you re usually looking for when i realized how much i was doing that i stopped skipping over whenever they ask for donations it s one of the few corners of the internet that hasn t gotten worse and ots because it stayed as a not for profit organization it has its flaws but if it ever got the elon musk twitter treatment i can only imagine what it would turn to
ummm it was about search before that we had cluttered messes like yahoo search it s about advertising now but in the before times google was a breath of fresh air
they ve definitely added some ai features to try to make it smarter like pick out relevant bits of an article but it actually seems to yield the wrong answer more than the correct one a lot of it probably has to do with money too a lot of garbage sites get favored probably due to them giving google some ad revenue ad blocker or not
they saw the internet conglomerating and read the writing on the wall they want to be your everything and curate information and present it to you without you asking they want you on the site more and that s kind of the antithesis of what a search engine should aspire too reason being how much value do they really add if i go on google type nike golf shoes and they take me to nikes site what should nike do give them a dime for the hard work i was already a customer they don t care about search anymore now search has useless markov chains for auto suggest
idk if this link will work but i saw some people talking about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lagy8q/odd_detail_about_cast_lists_on_google/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1 idk if that s what s going on though
over the past few years it s been harder to get to wikipedia on my phone when i search things not sure why that is but its incredibly annoying for such a minor thing
hmm that s pretty interesting didn t know that they used imdb starmeter as a parameter could be the issue but martin lawrence seems to have a higher score than his fellow casts very strange
imdb died when they got rid of the message boards
imdb is populated by users like wikipedia there are producers on the shows and movies who are supposed to update with that info but i think they care less lately or it falls through the cracks
perhaps that information has moved to imdb pro https://pro.imdb.com).
oh my god those boards were a blast a fucking mess but a fun one
i was a regular on the lost board during the show s run and am still friends with some of the other posters to this day the show ended years ago
i saw the devil
man on fire is phenomenal i think i checked and didn t see it mentioned

kill bill is about as revenge based as it gets
double jeopardy was action packed for sure not the best film of all time but it stuck with me and several others have mentioned kill bill which is a classic now
harakiri
lucky number sleven
peppermint
the count of monte cristo
conan the barbarian
pawn shop chronicles you won t be disappointed as it has a bunch of big named actors playing bit roles with interwoven narratives related to or directly surrounding revenge and redemption it s f cking weird action packed and bloody paul walker plays a meth head and brendan frasier plays an elvis impersonator proposed with a faustian bargain if that says anything about it
inglourious basterds the wrath of khan once upon a time in the west carrie unforgiven to death and the maiden the crow leon the girl with the dragon tattoo mad max
the shawshank redemption
the virgin spring
hannibal rising
ben hur
kill bill
true grit is a good one it s not super action packed but it s still a really great movie and revenge is the central plot i m talking about the new one with jeff bridges i haven t seen the john wayne one yet so i don t know how similar they are
just watched hunter hunter today not exactly what you described but there is certainly a revenge factor in it hard to explain without spoiling but definitely worth a watch if you haven t seen it
a tale of two sisters but the revenge is a spoiler but the movie is very psychological unlike the rest of the movies recommended here
taken
the gift
cold in july one of the most underrated films of any genre in the last years hands down
one i haven t seen mentioned yet sleepers
the nightinggale it has a bit of a different setting tasmania in the s its very brutal and hard hitting but also very good get subs for it as there quite a lot of non english speaking parts

not a movie but since it s as good as revenge stories get i ll say it attack on titan it s not a movie that s not the name of a movie
star wars episode iii revenge of the sith
the vengeance trilogy directed park chan wook is more great revenge porn from asian cinema it s three unconnected movies that share revenge as a common theme it consists of oldboy sympathy for mr vengeance and lady vengeance
confessions https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590089/) is another great foreign revenge movie a psychological thriller of a grieving mother turned cold blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter s death
this was going to be my suggestion
just wish they went darker with the story like in the book
lucky number slevin the lonnnnggggg con
i will always upvote psych
fucking payback hubba hubba
count of monte cristo and lucky number slevin both rule unspeakably hard
how is john wick not on this list
yes the count of monte cristo
was basically scrolling down to find count of monte cristo such a satisfying story the prestige is incredible but seems more about a rivalry than a revenge story it s about how far one would go to be the best at their craft and what it might cost them
except the good guy lost in that movie
to add to this you should watch the whole vengeance trilogy sympathy for mr vengeance oldboy and lady vengeance
just watched blue ruin today that s a good one
hard candy was tough to watch
lady vengeance mr vengeance i believe the order goes vengeance old boy then lady vengeance
the man from nowhere is also phenomenal since we re talking about korean revenge thrillers it s the original john wick imo
the revenge in sicario is stone cold
salvation is great
there s always paint drying https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paint_drying)' a film protesting censorship in the uk it s hours of watching white paint dry on a wall
master of disguise is pretty punishing every joke falls flat and never in a so bad it s good kinda way it s just bad all the way
although the deer hunter is an epic film it is a hard journey to go through
i wanted to see the new lion king out of morbid curiosity got past circle of life turned it off when i heard jon oliver cracking shitty jokes as zazu just soulless
just figured out the movie i was talking about it s called wavelength
i have been trying to get through leaving las vegas for two months now it s such a great film but if you have ever experienced any of the flaws or addictions represented in the film it s brutal
i haven t seen these yet but satantango is over hours long jeanne dielman is hours and minutes of a housewife doing chores river of fundament is over hours involving excrement
i feel like this has been my answer for a lot of these sorts of questions lately but unfortunately it s the true correct answer in my opinion dragonball evolution
the rifftrax version of birdemic is great give it a try and see how unwatchable the movie is while having fun watching it such as seals
i saw airport recently and boy was it was a chore i like some of the actors in it so i stuck with it but it took me probably nights to finish it lol
leaving las vegas the only item of entertainment that gutted me great movie though
the sequel to national lampoons christmas vacation cousin eddie s island adventure good lord that was some hot garbage
martin lawrence has you covered with black knight or national security take your pick eddie murphy s holy man is a pretty damn good contender too along with a thousand words
minutes or less i ve tried twice and couldn t get passed minutes not one character is interesting and it just seems like a slog
i ve been trying to watch dances with wolves from start to finish for the past years and have never once succeeded mainly because it s hours long and it feels hours long i always end up watching it in chunks

la flor it s hours long baa baa land it s on youtube good luck sitting through the first minutes https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uyglv4znhw
apartment 1br is probably the one i can think of most notably i got to the part where they roasted a cat alive and i was just like no thanks it was pretty dry before that but that tipped it over into a non finisher
i still haven t finished hard to be a god
public enemy it s so boring how do you make a boring movie about a notorious bank robber
the nightmare on elm street remake i ve tried many times and can t get past half an hour

pearl harbor
love actually for me
philosophy of a knife was a goddamn slog i ff d thru most of it still nearly died of tedium
eeaao
actually hours and minutes those last minutes are without doubt the greatest minutes in film history it has an imbd rating of and the reviews are worth reading my favorite is i laughed i cried i went down to the sea to reflect i even found god this is the defining movie of the century
i fucking loved this movie as a kid i am terrified to rewatch it as an adult
this is the worst movie i ve ever seen i honestly could have made a better one and i can t write for shit
tuuurtle
agreed i m glad i saw it but once was enough it s one of those movies where i think the actors could legitimately claim to have issues stemming from filming some of those scenes
most underrated vietnam movie
same exact experience for me it was awful
very much so
heartbreaking is an understatement
really i know it s bad but isn t it a pretty easy watch like a terribly composed song that manages to be catchy
national security is hilarious your comment is borderline libelous
what black knight is great
what black knight is good
reminder this won best picture over goodfellas
lol five minutes in you re not even past the newsreel at that point
minutes is hardly trying
same
its a good movie ahead of its time captures the times and the classic sci fi movies very well
which version though
i don t down vote often but when i do
wtf these are good movies
where you afraid you were gunna get burned by the molten lavaaaaaaaaa
maybe try some of the norweigian train travel slow films
i really wanna watch this but i m afraid this is gonna happen
this is how i feel i know i won t hold up lmao
uh no
what the problem is
i m not a big comedy or martin lawrence fan but i love that movie steve zahn is the man
reminder they sold the vhs at mcdonalds in for you could also buy dirty rotten scoundrels for the same price with purchase of any large sandwich
i know just so used to more modern movies i know it s a classic just hard to get into it feels like reading took me months since it wasn t an easy read now it s one of my favourite books though not sure i could read it again
pretty sure they had the indiana jones movies too
my recommendation would be to watch it s a wonderful life first and then go into kane thinking it s the anti version of that movie which it is in a lot of ways similar non linear structure about a man s life both 1940s black and white movies i found kane to be surprisingly accessible for a movie from tbh thought it would be a snooze but it really captivated me it s not the goat movie for me at all but i can see it s influence and why people think that
dune part2 oppenheimer megalopolis
guardians of the galaxy volune huge marvel fan loved the first gotg films and can t wait for the third already got my tickets booked for may oppenheimer not bothered about christopher nolan i can take or leave him as a director but the cast is absolutely stacked with actors i love mission impossible dead reckoning part one the mi franchise doesn t seem to miss can t wait to see how they many to make the film even better than the last transformers rise of the beasts i really enjoy the transformers films mindless fun
dune then everything else
dune and wonka
for this year indiana jones and the dial of destiny
barbie i m not even joking it looks like great fun https://youtu.be/gryt3ov4zz0
barbie and oppenheimer
dune after dune it will be again dune this is a cycle fingers crossed please give me some media of god emperor
oppenheimer and beau is afraid
the exorcist october asteroid city june mission impossible dead reckoning part one july dune part two november megalopolis
i m pretty pumped for a lot of what people are bringing up but my top right now would be killers of the flower moon and fincher s the killer
gotg vol megalopolis dune mission impossible still haven t seen d d yet the flash across the spider verse transformers oppenheimer mutant mayhem napoleon rebel moon
megalopolis sounds interesting we ll see if coppola s still got it
gotg3 is the first marvel movie since endgame that i really want to see guardians always had a family vibe that really connected with me
god i had such a huge crush on lauryn hill back in the day from watching sa2
look i am not remotely catholic never have been probably never will be but hail holy queen https://youtu.be/ctjg4mjjwea) from the first movie is absolute fire
sister act and sister act are hilarious
sister act both one and two are my wife s favorites well amongst her favorites i enjoy them as well some good family fun and a good movie to put on while laying in bed together and relaxing
she was excellent in ghost but total agreement sister act is ace
given that hairspray and soon mean girls have movies based on musicals based on movies they should do sister act the musical the movie saw it on broadway and the songs were so catchy especially i could be that guy and lady in the long black dress
i really liked sister act i liked sister act a little less because of the how do i reeech these keeeds premise which i found less compelling but it was still a lot of fun
whoopi in the late 80s and early 90s was great very funny and appealed to a broad audience i actually think her decline started after she hosted the oscars in lol
i love it i love it i love it and where it goes i ll follow i ll follow i ll follow
shout out to maggie smith she is a treasure
liked them both when i was younger liked the sequel better because i wasn t raised catholic so i identified more with the sequel i also love this cover of the final song joyful joyful sister act tiffany mann kyle taylor parker david rowen melissa victor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kp3xizrzhq)
i love both sister act movies my toddler is currently obsessed with them so we watch them quite often
i like it but i also feel like this series is a great example of where the sequel is better than the first film maybe that s just me but the second one was just so much more fun than the first
i love both movies i think the first one is better than the second but both have a great cast and standout scenes it s pretty tame even by 90s standards but who cares it s freaking funny
i try to avoid whoppi whenever possible as i m not a fan of her shtick didn t mind her as guinan though and ghost is too good of a movie to let her ruin it for me
for some reason i have only seen sister act and i have watched it at least twice lol i seemed to catch it when it was on tv i should rewatch it
literally just finished watching sister act great sequel
both movies are good family fun
my mother s favorite movies we would watch her vcds remember those lol of it constantly when i was a kid for a good while they were her comfort movies recently rewatched the first one after so many years it was the first movie she wanted to watch on disney after we subscribed and you know what it holds up pretty well i only just realized then that the bad guy was harvey keitel
i was a choir kid in high school and that went hand in hand with loving the sister act films lol we knew all the songs never formally performed them or anything but we d always sing them on bus rides and such
sister act i didn t know it was a movie i thought it was the name of episodes from rugrats and the loud house
love the first one but i find the second one is more memorable regardless each are fantastic
my brother
sister act is fantastic watched it while suffering from a strong cold and it was such a good distraction
sister act kicking the habit https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9413018/)
it s a good film and i enjoyed it but it s nothing compared to the blues brothers https://youtu.be/rtxszrhc0qs?t=131)
loved them as a child loved them during my rewatch last year
she is so pretty
same i still pull this up at random times also i will follow him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppd-6x3teo)
that s lovely thank you this is why i love catholicism it has given us so much beautiful art music etc i m still an atheist though
i wish my significant other loves sister act as much as i do
love ghost also
yeah i prefer her in ghost and the lion king
i want to see the broadway musical adaptation of the movie adaptation of the broadway musical adaptation of the movie
maggie smith is a treasure
you re one of them yutes
yes i m waiting for the time when my nephew is old enough to appreciate the movies
love it
maybe i should watch it again x
that s lovely thanks for sharing
fuck yes
i hate catholicism because of the million or so known child abuse cases this past century and the countless more unknown ones in fact even this movie is solidly anti catholic in its messaging
well i won t say i love it as much as her but i do enjoy it i m all about slapstick vulgar offensive comedies i e the hangover not another teen movie scary movie etc but she hates those and i don t feel like arguing much so i comply lol
that film along with sister act was some of the best acting from her i think even though ghost had a serious story behind it she still managed to pull of a little comedy
molly you re in danger you can t just blurt it out like that let me say it in my own way molly you in danger girl
i was born in
i have yet to watch the hangover love ed helms from the office though
it s the law that the response is you in danger girl
you know a g o d well you know me
god i love ghost so much my mom actually gave me the middle name patrick because of patrick swayze she supposedly watched ghost every day she was pregnant with me and man as funny as the movie is i cry every goddamn time it s amazing molly the love inside you take it with you
you down with g o d
love that x
filming is beginning later this month which means this is probably coming out next spring
full cast elizabeth debicki moses sumney michelle monaghan bobby cannavale lily collins halsey giancarlo esposito kevin bacon and also mia goth
wow this is going to explode six degrees of kevin bacon connections
bacon to be the porn director who made maxine a star
liked pearl more than x but that s a great cast excited for this
moses sumney love his music interested in seeing how he is as an actor
average michelle monaghan enjoyer
that s wild x and pearl are both so good my favourites from last year but both are small scale small cast films primarily set in one single location i m excited to see how maxxxine differs from that with this much star power
wow there are some great names in this x and pearl are both outstanding if maxxxine manages to stick the landing this could be the conversation for best horror trilogy
omg lily collins and halsey
halsey lookin like she s being taken over by venom
i feel like elizabeth debicki is too attractive to play a human being
at first glance i thought that this film was part of the xxx franchise and i wondered if vin diesel would also be in it
ma goth deserves the world this movie is my most anticipated for sure
i don t think they needed a higher profile cast
giancarlo is in almost everything and i m so happy to hear it he s gonna be in marvel next it s only a matter of time
just thought that giancarlo esposito was awesome in breaking bad
i m so happy that ti west is getting his due it s a long time coming
i feel as if i really like the idea of this trilogy but find myself underwhelmed by the actual films
caught x on showtime but havent seen pearl yet keep waiting for it to hit some streaming service
starring mia goat
i love that they ve finally confirmed that x pearl and vin diesel s xxx movies are in the same universe
you had me at giancarlo esposito
mia is amazing that scene in pearl where she is sitting at the kitchen table towards the and she talks for like minutes straight without stopping was incredible the emotions
giving bobby canavale and elizabeth debicki the professor and mary ann and the rest treatment
oh interesting cast i really like x and pearl so i am excited to see what ti west would bring next
am i the only one who read that in the voice of lady camden
i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine she tests positive and tells you that her act s clean
idk what this is but giancarlo is in it so i m on board
i am so excited for this x pearl was such a great combo and i have high expectations for maxxxine
love me some bobby cannavale i was really hoping he d blow up in popularity after boardwalk empire but it s not happened shame he s a fantastic actor
i m always concerned when an upcoming movie has a really strong cast it s either going to be phenomenal or trash
damnnnnn this is a stacked film
no idea what people see in these movies x started promising and then halfway they have that cringe inducing minute long sex positivity lecture and it goes straight to shit with some of the lamest kills i ve seen whole movie was honestly so tame for a slasher movie about pornstars should ve been like showgirls with kills but instead it was as racy as friday the 13th then yall hyped up pearl like it has this masterclass performance in it and then i watch it and mia goth who i typically like is doing one of the hammiest most ridiculous perfomances i ve ever seen plot of the movie is dull a shit too just an awful film
i love seeing the birth of a new great horror franchise mia goth is awesome gonna check this out
this is my most anticipated movie of the year i loved x and pearl mia goth may be our greatest living actress
wow quite possible the worst movie title i have ever seen great cast terrible title
x was fantastic pearl was certainly a movie
that just sounds like a porn actress
idk how i feel about this i felt a limited scope worked better on the previous two bangers but let s see
sounds like it s gotten too big for it s own good
nope ti can t trick me into watching another one of his movies
who is halsey and how dare he she it go without a second name
what a let down horror does not need big names or fame hungry washed up pop stars
i fucking love this
umn yes yes and more yes
i am so ready for kevin bacon
which means this is probably coming out next spring
i stan bobby cannavale so i m fucking hyped
i really loved x more than pearl but i liked how different they both were i also love how pearl used ghosts for dread definitely on board to see where they finish this wild ride
that s a stacked cast for 3rd entry in a smaller horror series
well holy shit i was not expecting that one bit this is pretty much an a list ensemble cast
hoping for a cheesy 80s slasher movie style
so all these actors now have bacon no
can t wait to see sumney in it hope he has something to do with the music of the movie too
damn the budget must have increased a hell of a lot
new people added to the ole degree club
holy shit that cast alone probably cost them more money than the entire budget of pearl lol
can t wait
moff gideon represent
did anybody proofread this article
why are most of the headshots they used for the article like years old
holy shit
is it just me or does it seem like there are more proportionally more ensemble casts each year lately
looks terrible
this is going to be such a fucking good musical
so is this based on the short live uk comedy maxxx xd
this is going to be killer we all love bacon
idk who it is but bottom row number looks like zoolander
yo moth gideon is in it
is this a remake of the vin diesel film xxx with a female lead
that s a little budget increase
i thought this was going to be a female xxx lmao
hell yeah love x and pearl
i m sensing a hefty budget increase
my most anticipated can t wait
i finally got around to watching x pearl i think they re among the best horror films within the past years mia goth is exceptional i m very much looking forward to seeing maxxxine
giancarlo esposito is an automatic watch from me everything i see he s involved in is gold from him
i haven t like a single movie in this trilogy
for a moment i thought this was another ai balenciaga video i even thought kevin bacon looked pretty close to the real thing
haven t watched the prequel is it as excessively graphic as the first film i love good tense horror movies but not a fan of ultra violence
the article contains major spoilers of previous movies in that franchise
halsey fucking blows but besides that super stoked for this cast let s hope she doesn t get too much screen time or can even play a role with no dialogue appeal in a cast like this now outside of that damn pearl and x were so good this one gets you excited
meaning in the uk it ll end up coming out like months after that lol we only just got pearl in cinemas a few weeks ago it s ridiculous how long it takes a24 films to come here and even then they re rarely shown anywhere but indie cinemas
i thought it was advertised for this year saw pearl a while back and that s what i recalled excited nonetheless
honestly i can see ti west dropping it later this year depending how long shooting is
so i m guessing the budget on this one is a little higher than 1m
i loved bobby cannavale in boardwalk empire i think he played the best antagonist in the series and made season the show s best season in my opinion he was also great in the irishman even though he only had a small role in the beginning hour or so
moses sumney the singer
how can you make a xxx sequel and not include vin diesel it s unfair
i often see you commenting the cast or the plot of a movie on this subreddit thanks for doing that
love how mia goth is parenthesized here
i was all for it til i saw halsey s name i tried watching her special that she released on hbo and it was pretty bad hopefully her role doesn t require much
this cast is stacked i cannot wait
i m going to assume from the lack of vin diesel that this isn t a new xxx movie
is this the first movie that moses sumney has starred in i fucking love that dudes music
that was already ruined when the guardians of the galaxy christmas special came out
he is the baconator after all
from the hollywood reporter https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/elizabeth-debicki-lily-collins-set-for-next-x-movie-1235367296/): according to sources it will deal with the dangerous world of underground filmmaking characters details are being kept secret but what is known does point the way esposito plays an agent for adult film and z list movie actors while debicki is a film director monaghan and canavale are lapd detectives while bacon is a private detective
kevin bacon in the burt reynolds role
who framed roger rabbit when i was a kid i thought it was a pretty funny cartoon movie as an adult it definitely still is that but its also a legitimately good noir movie and one of the most impressive feats of filmmaking i ve ever seen it is insane how seamlessly the animated characters fit in the real world to this day i don t think that blend of live action and animation has ever been done better
teenage mutant ninja turtles early s as a kid its just a fun movie with a bunch of turtles kicking turtle shell eating pizza and skatboarding as an adult you realize how dark the undertones are with a massive underground black market and youth cult with the foot clan a mentor getting kidnapped and chained up to die as well as quite impressive character arcs for michalangelo casey jones peeling the layers off of shredder this isn t a kids movie imo but thats exactly how the comics were made as well and i just relish both the richness of the writing acting as well as the pure nostalgia i get from watching it as early as and still rewatch it every few years
mary poppins there s an interesting phenomenon with family movies that focus on both kids and adults sometimes when you re a kid and there are kids doing things in the movie you just assume the kids are the main characters and that it s their story because as a kid if you ve had a loving childhood that s basically been your experience your whole life kids are life s main characters and whenever the adults on screen are doing anything other than singing and dancing your kid brain just kind of tunes it out like when adults are talking to each other in the room it s not for you the kid so you stop caring or paying as much attention i think i had my memory of this movie completely flipped upside down when i read the first volume of sandman in my teens and death describes the movie as about this man who s utterly a banker and until then it had never occurred to me that mr banks was the main character and that he was the one who grew and learned a lesson now as an adult it seems obvious but as a kid it was just a kids movie about and for children and the adults were just window dressing what a difference
ferris bueller s day off i m aging gen x when i first saw it i wanted to be ferris later i understood cameron now i m just rooney
hook is a completely different film after becoming a father
the land before time as a kid i thought it was a fun movie with dinosaurs when i re watched it as an adult i noticed that it told a story about racism and the importance of diversity inclusion
jurassic park it s just not a good movie
city slickers as a kid i thought it was hilarious now its still funny but very poignant my friends and i are the same age as the characters and some are affected by the same woes as those guys one line that stuck out to me was how phil ans his dad bonded over baseball my late father and i did the same but with film especially after my mom passed years ago
the hunchback of notre dame when i was a kid i mostly liked it on a surface level but as i got older i realized there s alot more to than the funny gargoyles or the colorful city the film covers themes like hatred the general population hating and ostracizing quasi cause of the way he looks or count frollo and his hatred of the romani ppl religious corruption count frollo uses religion as the reason for his hatred of quasi and the romani he tries to enforce his beliefs on the general populace as well religion and state should always be separate misogyny while count frollo hates the romani ppl he lusts after esmeralda he blames his lust on the way she dresses and acts when she rejects his advances he attempts to kill her
dazed and confused i was younger than the characters when i first watched it and older than them now still good but different experiences younger punk rock obsessed me loved that pink took a stand against the football pledge as an adult its a cringey attempt at rebellion for something that doesn t matter at all shamefully wooderson seemed like a cool older friend and now he is kind of sad and seemingly trapped in his situation he feels a lot more like ryan reynolds adventureland character these aren t criticisms the movie portrays all this very honestly so it is always anything and everything it needs to be in the moment i still have fond memories of just laughing at the jokes and pranks and being excited about having the kind of freedom that a car a lack of curfew and a case of beer might bring me but now i see all of the drama too there are a lot of different expectations that hanging over the heads of kids and now that i m older i know that some stakes are higher than they let on and some are lower than they let on as an adult i see so many adults who are just faking through it it definitely helps that unlike a lot of comedies about this age group there is no romantic sexual assault at least none that i can remember
the ring i liked it a great deal as a teen and i m kind of picky with horror movies as an adult i rewatched it more than once and recognized just how good of a mystery tragedy it was i also really like the detail using color
not to mention the shyamalan twist you find out that dude in the hair piece the whole time that s bruce willis the whole movie
let me tell you kung fu panda definitely didn t have this many jokes when i was a kid damn they absolutely flooded everything with comedy
jaws the year old me was terrified in the theater year old me loved the action when viewing it in hbo or vhs year old me saw the tragedy of quint s character year old me sees how that it was a brilliant film because of its cast direction pacing and character development some movies are better over time because you can appreciate them more
never ending story it just hits harder as a adult
shyamalan is still one of the best directors of his generation with two caveats no matter how badly he wanted to be the next spielberg his intimate meditative style did not translate well to blockbuster filmmaking cameron nolan coogler and the russos all all had a snappy intense style even in their indie days that only improved with bigger and bigger budgets shyamalan s sensibilities are closer to say sofia coppola s it just ain t gonna work with collapsing buildings and laser battles shyamalan just isn t as good of a writer as a director and he has been somewhat held back by writing the majority of his own films that said i m glad he s gone that route because i find his writing style eccentric and unique if often clumsy
billy madison really lost its shine for me as an adult it s just sad not enough norm and chris
i was about when i first watched audition and i thought it was fine i mostly watched it because i knew about the ending and was curious about it it didn t make much of an impression on me i forgot pretty much everything about it and didn t think much about the themes i was too young to appreciate what was going on i watched it a few months ago and it blew me away absolutely masterful the camera work was fascinating and beautiful and the story had so much depth and nuance to interpret i m still not sure what was real and what wasn t but that s one of the things i liked so much
this one goes around on these types of topics alot i was when starship troopers came out i went to see it and loved the action all the satire passed way over my head that movie is anomaly it works on many levels

commando with arnold schwarzenegger young me saw it and thought it was a totally bad ass action movie older me saw it and thought it was an absolutely hilarious movie that was basically a spoof of over the top 80s action movies
disney s gargoyles as a kid i loved the idea of flight and changing into stone during the day as an adult i am overwhelmed by the incredible character development complex story arcs and odes to william shakespeare seeing the annihilation of the gargoyles in the greater contexts of genocide slavery colonialism on the latinx and africans bitchtopher columbitch christopher columbus and epic time dancing narratives made me wonder why disney cancelled this show due to power rangers and the o j simpson trial coverage
back door sluts doesn t really cut it for me as a grown up
we tried to watch austin powers the other day we guessed it would ve aged badly and been offensive but honestly it was just so fucking boring lol every joke was just waayyyyyy too long like they d repeat the same thing over and over for so long it was just unbearable
the original psycho a shocking scary horror movie always but so much more as you come to appreciate the genius of hitchcock
quest for camelot as a kid i loved it as an adult i realized it pretty much sucked
batman and robin i know i know i was and still am a bit of a bat nut but back then it was a batman movie and i loved it simply because it was a batman movie now i am an adult and i only see that movie as cheesy it s a silly cash grab that should have stopped production the instant a bat credit card was put on screen
the brave little toaster when i was young it was just another cute move about anthropomorphic characters adult me appreciates the dedication to the animation the history behind this being one of the catalyst that got pixar into the studio it is today and the fact that all these appliances have a fear of being outmoded or outliving either their use or their own owners so the songs are somewhat depressing at times
wow are you me rewatching the sixth sense now as a parent i m just overwhelmed by everyone s sadness i must have cried times that movie s got layers like an onion and makes you cry like an onion
the neverending story i read the book and loved it so i obviously just had to love the movie watched it again as an adult and oof so clunky terrible dialogue dubbing awkward editing truly atrocious special effects just not good compared to a movie that i loved like labyrinth that truly does hold up it s a pretty big disappointment
star wars ep1 as a kid seeing it when it came out i just loved the ships and jedi and the podrace now that im older i can more understand what was going on in the larger story with the senate and the trade federation which didnt make sense to me as a kid other than they were the bad guys
any of the great satire films like starship troopers are a completely different experience from kid to adult when you re a kid it s all the ham comedy and physical comedy that gets you when you re an adult is when you get all the satire
ferris bueller as a kid its a just a car what s the bid deal as an adult yikes as an adult enthusiast crying but also cringe laugh at these lines ferris look it s real simple whatever mileage we put on we ll take off cameron how ferris we ll drive home backwards but also this bit as a single male adult is so true ferris cameron has never been in love at least nobody s ever been in love with him if things don t change for him he s gonna marry the first girl he lays and she s gonna treat him like shit because she will have given him what he has built up in his mind as the end all be all of human existence she won t respect him cause you can t respect somebody who kisses your ass it just doesn t work
nezha defeats great dragon lords a hong kong animation i loved it as a kid then i watched it as an adult and holy fuck nezha is an absolute sociopath like if we need to talk about kevin had kevin as the supposed hero no idea wtf the scriptwriters were smoking
this
the jackal remake of day of the jackal as a kid i watched the movie because i thought it was cool seeing bruce willis as a hitman doing stuff as an adult i almost never watch it because i realized just how ridiculous everything is in the film such as him needing a 14mm autocannon to take out the first lady none of the secret service responding when a gun was fired during her speech etc
spirited away as a child it was so more magic than it is still today
most animated flicks
batman forever watched that vhs pretty much every day as a kid loving it no such luck as an adult though atrocious what hell must my parents have gone through back then
i was obsessed with one of the great ewok adventure movies as a kid caravan of courage i can still see that stone moving by itself in the dirt it s unwatchable but i still get a kick out of the set design costumes art direction etc
same for a kid the sixth sense is a full brown horror movie but for an adult it s really more of an unsettling drama
debbie does dallas
when i was a teenager i thought garden state was the most profound movie ever lol kids are so stupid
labyrinth
e t the extra terrestrial
a tale of two sisters very scary as a child lame ass as an adult
space jam loved the movie as a kid watched it recently for space jam and i hated it really wish i didnt rewatch it
milo and otis the movie is animal cruelty i was repulsed when watching it as an adult
rush hour saw it in theaters thought it was fucking hilarious watched it on dvd a few years later with my dad i still thought it was hilarious but my dad wasn t laughing at any of the funny parts that i liked this puzzled me but i guess it just wasn t his thing anyway several years later i m an adult now and my sister and i recently tried to rewatch it on netflix and i did not laugh at any of it i don t know why going through all the funny parts that i remember i just didn t find them funny anymore like i get the jokes they were making it s the same thing that i laughed at but i just could not muster a laugh at all it was a weird feeling edit oh well i guess this isn t much of a positive example huh lmao my bad
field of dreams basically just thought it was a great movie about baseball now as i m older and have a family career aging parents i realize that it s all about a young father realizing he is becoming just like his father and realizing it
a goofy movie was a very fun animated movie that entertained me enough as a kid but it mostly stayed in my childhood until i met my wife it was her favorite movie growing up so i ve watched it a bunch of times with her it is a great little movie about a single father who just wants to connect with his teenage son it is way more profound than it has any right being and it also has some genuinely laugh out loud moments
i mean it s not a good movie but back to school with rodney dangerfield it s incredible how poorly it aged and as a kid i always though jason was right to be upset with his situation but wow what a whiny fucking incel
grease
the wizard when you realize the bad guy is really just doing his job of finding runaway children and doesn t deserve what happens to him
milo and otis through an adult lens its clearly horrific what those poor animals were put through
heavyweights as a little kid i thought tony perkis was just a wild and wacky guy as an adult i realized he s a fucking lunatic
i recently rewatched movies like primal fear and mystic river and have to say they were very underwhelming at the time when they were released those movies were the talk of the town and pretty much everyone i knew enjoyed watching them including me i remember them as impactful with plot twists but as i watch them now i find them very boring the story is obvious and some of the acting very forced
behind the green door
bugsy malone https://manapop.com/film/bugsy-malone-1976-review/)
national lampoon s vacation x200b something about an entire subplot regarding chevy chase trying to cheat on his wife right under his entire family s noses just doesn t sit well anymore
et and harry the henderson scared the bejeezus out of me as a child not very scary now
the brave little toaster as a kid it was a fun cartoon with a bit more edge than disney as an adult it was wall to wall despair
spoiler alert the guy under the hairpiece was bruce willis the whole time
batman x200b love this movie probably one of the films i watched the most in life as a kid it was utter perfection as an adult i love it despite its problems now i see all the reused sets the plot holes and no one ever talks about the alfred subplot where he s desperately trying to force a relationship between bruce and vicki
i need to watch this
that poor shoe
they ve have tried numerous times to do live action and animation mix but no film has touched that one in the years it has been out it s a masterpiece my parents hated that movie bc it s all i watched
just saw this at a local theater i am blow away by the animation and effects
had this experience a few years back watched it for the first time since i was a kid and realised how legitimately great it is
i feel like kids today will feel a similar way about zootopia when they grow up
as a kid teen actually i had no idea what noir was or why there was an old timey setting the adult me appreciates it
what s funny is that with greenscreen soundstages being cheaper than actual sets who framed roger rabbit feels like the template for modern filmmaking and yet everybody asks why they never tried to do something like that again they do for every movie just with one percent the planning because the render sweatshops can take care of everything
it s weird to me how good that movie is it really had no right to be as well made as it was
unfortunately the studio didn t think it wasn t for kids either so they forced the creative team to lighten the tone for the sequel while i still like the 2nd one it s just not as good as the first most of the reason is the much lighter tone
yeah as a kid i liked both of them pretty equally the fight scene where they toss the ooze around in the second one was great so i guess the studio kind of succeeded with both films for children but the first one is just a legitimately good movie and a good watch as an adult
i did not like this as a kid i wanted the cartoon version i wanted their cool van and beebop and rocksteady but the film was really and adaption of the comics not the tv show now as an adult i see how good this movie actually was
greatest movie about fathers ever
yeah even when i was a kid i realized how different the first one was to the second film even the color palatte is different
growing up i loved mary poppins it was such a treat to see the kids having fun and laughing with adults as i got older around the bird lady made me cry i remember asking my dad why the father wouldn t let his son by food for birds he told me that s the entire point of the movie to cherish the small things in life like flying a kite i m now kids of my own and they love it just as much as i did but these lyrics floor me every damn time though her words are simple and few listen listen she s calling to you feed the birds tuppence a bag tuppence tuppence tuppence a bag though her words are simple and few listen listen she s calling to you feed the birds tuppence a bag tuppence tuppence tuppence a bag
ever since i ve become a teacher i understand rooney s anger he definitely overstepped his boundaries but it is so annoying to have a cocky student who thinks their shit don t stink
oooh yeah parts of that can get at ya run home jack myyy boy no my boy
and grief
first time i ever cried at a film
it sounds like a very relatable movie for you good to have that
good pick
thats shocking i night need to watch it again holy fuck
are you trying to say we should have a spaghetti day
they look like good strong hands
does it loved it is a kid but as an adult i thought the plot was pretty thin
fair point i remember watching the movie and sadly questioning if it would be as successful today with the reliance on jump scenes and zero plot that so much horror has today
i was going to post this watched it the other night and was like damn this movie kinda sucks now and needs more farley and norm they even cut out norm singing a verse of the gum song happy gilmore still slaps hard tho
as a kid it s funny as an adult you want someone to slap him the whole movie
perfect answer for this as a kid seeing it on tv i loved the action and the effects as an adult i see it as a complete satirical masterpiece still love the action and effects too
the vim and vigour of youth doesn t last forever unfortunately
i admit i cried several times and couldn t do anything to stop it
there s a solid political thriller buried in the prequel trilogy
glad you agree
well i was going to watch it last night but watched the sixth sense instead
childhood favorite i watched it a few years ago and it was baaaaaad another one like that for me was air force one and independence day better than the jackal but still mega corny
doesn t he also make out with jack black at one point
hopefully it s good
to all of the people saying oh this doesn t sound good for fnaf s quality i think it says more about peacock s quality as i m not even sure that service is still gonna exist by october
doesn t sound like they re very confident in the movie s quality if they re dumping it on the streaming service the same day that it opens in theaters
i hope it s good cris has stayed on blum s ass
i ve been watching more and more peacock lately it s a great deal for some great re watchable shows so i m happy this is coming to it the games were never my kind of thing but i get why it s creepy the cast is also interesting too
why are they doing this doesn t that really hurt the box office potential
so its going to be dogshit is what youre saying idk what anyone would expect from a five nights at freddies movie anyways
think it s got decent movie potential was never huge on the games but they were alright but casting shaggy that s a deal maker
sounds promising i know nothing about the video games never even heard of them to be honest i love mary stuart masterson josh hutcherson and matthew lillard and i have peacock for month all year so i m excited about this news
oof simultaneous streaming release that does not bode well
when did they start filming i feel like the filming is still going on if not early and if that s the case this release date seems pretty quick especially with post production it s seemingly going to need despite the practical puppets
when trailer
the banana splits movie was fun i m hoping this will be too
my little sister who s played all the games tells me i need to watch lets plays before the movie to understand the lore is it true or can i go straight into the movie
i don t want to hear anyone at universal complain about it not performing well at the box office
i can t wait for how shit this will be genuinely excited
idk why more movies don t do this charge more on opening day at home i d pay
har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har
welp now we know it s gonna suck
it s still going to make bank regardless
it comes with a free frogurt
peacock isn t awful it started pretty rough but it s still better than paramount
because the last few simultaneous releases have sucked hard i e halloween ends kills firestarter they them etc
peacock paid wwe billion dollars to get rights to wwe streaming library and it s ppv they are not closing shop till that year deal is dead at the least
eh peacock is not just going to fold altogether but it will probably end up making sense sooner rather than later to merge it with another streaming service which is frankly what i see happening with all of these services that are built around a single channel that s not going to happen by october though
i can live without everything on there but poker face
they used jim henson company to do the real life animatronics they clearly are trying to do this well lots can still go wrong but they are clearly not half assing this
damn i always feel alone on an island in saying that peacock is my second favorite streamer behind hbo max
idk the office superfans have been my go to lately meaning peacock has been a big go to lately
man i love peacock between the office and wwe network for only a month plus movies and as a cord cutter i get my top chef too one of my favorite services
i have xbox and they re giving months free to people subscribed to game pass gotta assume they re hurting even when peacock was free tubi was and is still superior
actually i think putting it on streaming and theaters at the same time is in line with fnaf this franchise was always known to be accessible by having pc games ports for ps xbox and nintendo switch a vr game mobile games etc putting it on streaming makes sense
peacock needs more content and subscribers that s why
to avoid blame for kids seeing it in theaters and getting scared now kids can watch it at home no matter what it s rated and their parents don t even have to be aware of it
watch it still do great at the box office and then we get to laugh at disney films underperforming being blamed on d
the last couple of halloween movies had the same release strategy and both of them did pretty well most horror fans would rather go to the theater because the genre just plays better in a dark room with a big crowd
if you have to artificially prop up an industry by refusing to accommodate the consumer s demands then maybe it needs to change
the henson company is doing the costumes so that could be pretty damn cool
man never seen scream apparently
i believe february was when they started filming
how
that s good
they them was actually just a peacock exclusive i believe that never came out in theaters at least in the us
which is frankly what i see happening with all of these services that are built around a a single channel they should name that new streaming service hulu
yeah all the steaming services are going to merge down to or most likely within years or so ones like peacock and paramount are simply trying to inflate their catalog and subscribers as much as possible regardless of profitability in order to maximize their sale price to the big netflix disney hbo after the great streaming shrinkening we will no longer see prime content like this being put out for free on opening weekend
they gave me six free months of peacock just because i went to halloween horror nights for one night
actually this kind of makes sense in a weird way i could see some kids watching this at like sleepovers if it s good enough for that lol doubt but you never know
meh i have my doubts the interest is really there for this to be a big hit unless it s surprisingly good maybe years ago it d be huge anyway but i wouldn t bet on this franchise having that level of pull anymore maybe i m completely wrong though never was interested in these games as a kid so i m not really the target audience
didn t the last get panned by both critics and fans maybe it s for movies they don t think will have great legs
it s my favourite film ever lol but i just called him that bc it s easier
it s releasing simultaneously not to mention getting fast tracked release date similar to other bad blumhouse pics statistically is a sign the studio doesn t have faith in the film
the frogurt is also cursed
except hulu is probably going to be owned by disney by next year
they still made money
my boy the creator of the game is the one who helped with the script and shit
that s bad
good point let s call it 2lu
so doesn t make him a good screenwriter
but it comes with your choice of topping
that s good
the toppings contain potassium benzoate that s bad
can i go now
the spoons still free
she was uncomfortable being alone with him because he was acting erratic even when he asked her out he was addicted to pain pills showed up to the bar with a mask and got absolutely plastered then pestered both of them repeatedly he was his own worst enemy after the accident so she unfortunately decided it was a bad idea to try and give him a chance in his dreams she came back and everything was fine butnin reality he never saw her again and judging by the memorial scene she didn t really keep in touch with bryan either
i think it s because david was always oblivious to the fact that brian and sophia were actually the couple
underrated movie vanilla sky i never saw the original though they really don t come out with a variety of commercial films anymore it seems like
wana get an uber wit me
i think it was just a way to get closer to sydney
i think the point is that there are so many reporters following sydney non stop they re just blank faces except for gail she even comments when it s revealed that she barely recognizes her because she got a lot of work done on her face and lipo i think
bad writing
it was just for the audience s sake that way the second killer would be someone we knew of beforehand instead of a completely anonymous character which might have felt cheap
despised the ending
oh maybe but wouldn t it make more sense to just watch gail from a distance then waiting for her to make contact with sydney so she would still not risk revealing herself to sydney though
i thought it was because mrs loomis lost weight was the line but maybe you re right idk all i know is that we both agree there is some throw away line about it edit the exact line from sydney is sixty pounds and a lot of work later and mrs loomis claims it s called a makeover so we are both right
oh okay but what was her interest in being a reporter though i know her interest in being a serial killer since that was explained by why does she want to be a reporter too
i like scream but this is the real answer lol
well i don t mind it being an anonymous character if the character had a natural reason to keep anonymous unless every reason a character has to keep themselves anyonymous can still feel cheap
oh why
i would assume knowing as much as she can about what police have on the killers following gail getting closer to sydney and just being so present that no one will really suspect her as a killer
i heard there was a script leak and they had to change da killas
the writer director s probably felt it would have been disappointing to the audience to be an anonymous character considering they expect it to be someone whom we ve seen beforehand ironically i think mrs loomis is the one anonymous character that would have worked considering she s billy s mother and all but still
ohhhh interesting i hadn t heard that i should check out the commentary i do love wes
that makes sense what if they wrote it so that mrs loomis was not pretending to be someone else and was working with cotton weary to get try to get syd to do interviews for media exposure would that have made more sense than her pretending to be some reporter to get closer to gail
yeah but her role in the film isn t a big deal i just accept it for what it is it didn t make sense but your idea wouldn t make much sense either no offense considering she would be taking an even bigger risk of sidney recognizing her doing it your way
that s true i see what you mean but if the writers felt like audiences wouldn t like a villain who came out of nowhere at the end then why don t they just establish her as the mother wanting revenge from the beginning why bother to go for this who whodunnit big twist stuff if it doesn t make sense for her to be reporter and why force something that isn t there instead of just establish her motives from the beginning does it have to be a whodunnit
well yeah part of scream s gimmick is that it s a whodunit story people like to try and guess who the killer is and the writer likes to keep their motives a secret till the end and how would showcasing her as billy s mother who s out for revenge not spoil the whole thing
well i just don t understand why every scream movie has to be a whodunnit but also there are movies that have been made where you know the killer beforehand and it s still good i just feel they should have either found a way to make it a whodunnit that it would make more sense to incorporate the mother character into the plot beforehand or give away that she is the killer from early on and don t hide it or have her first face apperance be at the end and own it
i didn t think i d like the twist of bringing him back to life but they actually made it work quite well imo i think the second movie as a whole is an improvement over the first
i agree bringing him back actually helped the film because it made the motive more personal and added an emotional hook in his rivalry with jake and relationship with spider i don t think they achieve that if they introduce a new villain from the ground up
yeah having the same boring villain twice will do that
with three more movies i wonder if they ll build in a redemption arc for him sully s gonna need a lot of help to fend off earth s entire population in the next movies might be interesting to see sully and quaritch team up a la aang and zuko different series same name
on one hand i did like that they brought him back with some hand wavy movie magic i doubt that was planned in but it sure is convenient they backed up everyone s brain to give us a good villain with a personal vendetta but on the other hand the overall threat of avatar felt so nothing to me the first one is that the human forces will be destroying their forest na vi s way of life and in this one it seems like there s no overarching threat as long as jake and his family either hide or confront quarritch i know there are seeds planted that they want pandora to be the new earth but the conflict of the sequel to the biggest movie ever felt so much smaller
at a certain point specifically when he tamed the flying beast i had hopes that they might give quaritch a redemptive arc would have been more interesting storytelling to have him align with jake s people against the humans but i think it s safe to say after this film that s not happening
i agree they improved him but i would ve preferred a new villain over resurrecting the old one
the dynamic with his son was interesting to explore but once you can bring your villains back from the dead it creates narrative problems you can just recreate an army of navi trained marines over and over for me it made the final fight almost pointless you kill him and then what the army 3d prints out more quaritch for the sequel
i fucking hate that movie i spent three days saying and why did or and what about to my boyfriend after seeing it it was so fucking boring and i was super uncomfortable with the little boy being practically naked the whole movie felt like we were one breeze away from being sex offenders
i couldn t even finish this movie it was almost identical to the first and not very original every scene was predictable i can t believe they are planning on making another
i love this movie so much better than the marvel crap
so good but the fact that they couldn t even have the guts to kill him in the sequel and try other fresh characters shows how they don t have much fresh and innovative content to provide conflict in the upoming films franchises tend to do this a lot
deleted
agreed
it worked fine but i just can t see the justification in universe of doing it in the first place why bring back the guy who ultimately failed last time and was actually the biggest reason for that failure in the first place and i just can t see the character from the first film agreeing to even store his memories in the first place in case he dies he s too stubborn and confident for that they thought the fight would be a cake walk
pretty sure carmella soprano is the main villain in avatar or she s the henchman to whoever the corporate villain is they didn t get edie falco just for the two minutes of screen time she had in the second movie quaritch is going for a third act face turn in part three too spider rejecting him at the end of gives them a good jumping off point for quaritch to wonder if he has to be the same quaritch that died or if he can be his own person we know from cameron s comments on the sequels that either the fourth or fifth movie will be on earth and that there will be a large time jump between movies three and four my guess is jake and quaritch die battling the humans in avatar but quaritch makes a back up of jake s mind which neytiri and or jake s children will insert into a new jake avatar that is grown on the long journey to earth between the third and fourth entries or something like that
i mean who would be the next villain a giant sea monster
what i think is that due to the way the recombinant works in avatar universe we will end up with multiple quaritch in the 3rd film perhaps somewhere during avatar the quaritch that bonded with spider goes missing and or is injured so the usa militaty just deploys a new quaritch recombinant this would cause a huge identity crisis on the a2 quaritch causing him to defect once he realizes how expendable he is his own life is said to be usa property in a2 i feel that cameron introduced the concept of recombinant with the purpose of a future recombinant rebellion led by a2 quaritch
am rather tired of such ridiculous redemption arcs to please fans where the leads suddenly forget about the massacres and other crimes by those baddies turns the leads into such weaklings
the conflict of the sequel to the biggest movie ever felt so much smaller i think this was intentional and i think it made sense and was a good strategy often times we see sequels that have to up the stakes from the original in some way with a badder villain or larger scale consequences in the original avatar the stakes are already pretty high and going bigger probably would not have worked by making the focus of the conflict just sully s family vs quaritch s team with some help from the tribe and the whale hunters it made it more personal allowed more characterization and helped set up future conflicts for the remaining sequels i loved that they set up this native quaritch who is no longer human and now has some moral confusion about his own values regarding his son the na vi and humanity overall when it was announced that his character was returning for avatar i didn t really understand how or where they would go with him but they managed to make a very compelling future for him
pretty sure stephen lang was announced to return as quaritch when the sequels were first announced around or so cameron and his writer s room had an entirely different sequel planned out originally called the high ground which cameron ultimately scrapped because he wanted the story to be more personal and low stakes for the sequel the high ground was reworked as a comic book that is cannon to the universe though i actually found the smaller personal stakes of the sequel very refreshing every blockbuster has the world s at stake anymore and i m frankly tired of it jake wasn t trying to save pandora he was trying to protect his kids quaritch wasn t trying to kill all the na vi he just wanted to get back to at the person who robbed him of his body and over a decade of his life jake and quaritch both have nice arcs that parallel each other too with the whole spider subplot adding a good bit of dimension to quaritch without cameron and his co writers going overboard to rewrite the character s entire personality the movie felt kind of like a western to me more specifically a loose remake of the searchers but john wayne is the villain and the native americans are the protagonists i think cameron was definitely drawing a lot from tarzan of the apes for spider s story too the original novel not any of the movie adaptations it wasn t the most original film but i thought the things cameron drew inspiration from were more inspired than anything else coming out of hollywood s blockbuster slate based on some of the leaks that have popped up online about the other sequels which seem to be true based on the title leaks from years ago being accurate i m actually very excited to see where cameron takes the story from here as it sounds quite ambitious avatar was saddled with doing a light reboot of the story since it was almost fifteen years since the previous movie building the larger story arc for the following films in the series as well as telling a complete story within its own confines the fact it did all of those things rather successfully in my opinion is a real testament to cameron s abilities as a filmmaker and storyteller
it doesn t make sense he would have a personal vendetta though his downloaded memory wouldn t have any knowledge of jake he literally wouldn t know the guy people are just telling him he doesn t like jake not to mention backing up the brain completely changes the first movie the whole point of the first movie is you need the body of the human the avatar body is made from it s the whole point jake is on pandora in the first place to replace his dead twin brother and you re telling me the army couldn t have just booby trapped one of the trains they attack and just blow all the navi up the entire army is helpless against a small tribe of people fighting with sticks and some stolen guns also once jake left the jungle there was no reason to follow him the government would waste billions of dollars and the lives of well trained military to stop guy who s not a threat anymore
it s not really convenient when it was a requirement
i think he ll have a redemptive arc in terms of no longer caring about doing the rda s bidding but he won t necessarily be a good guy
it took a decade and a half to grow the marine avatars and transport them from earth to pandora they can t just create another xerox willy nilly
thats what i was thinking all those other marines were useless fodder in their avatar bodies though it would look incredibly dumb there was no reason why they couldn t just make a squadron of like quaritch as apparently one quaritch almost beat jake would make it light work maybe they ll do that next time just keep sending more and more quaritch until in avatar they just have like a million quaritch invaders
i think it s an expensive process and they just choose quality over quantity
the na vi don t even have private parts the same way humans do they aren t mammals
the visual effects was a lot better though
wait she turned down to be in the second film
it worked fine but i just can t see the justification in universe of doing it in the first place why bring back the guy who ultimately failed last time at the time of his death he was the most experienced and knowledgeable soldier on the planet but they gave ultimate authority to general ardmore secondly the first films was the exception not the norm to the rda the local biosphere had a one off reaction to the human military presence so they manufactured hybrid soldiers to circumvent this so all the perks of the last guy but not the weakness as far as they could tell
i think it s because a almost everyone with any experience of pandora is either dead or working for the other side and b they ultimately don t want to annihilate the entire pandoran environment so either you create more avatars and start the learning process all over again or you take advantage of the fact that you ve got people with some knowledge of pandora on data sticks and create avatars to download them into and i just can t see the character from the first film agreeing to even store his memories in the first place in case he dies chain of command
cause he was the most respected and valuable asset in the army all the soldiers respected quaritch and admired him plus he was a tactical genius
i can get used to him staying the villain for like the first movies but if cameron decides to keep him the villain for all of the movies he has planned that s gonna get a little tiring seeing the same guy over and over try and take out jake and his family
you basically just summed up the plot of the first two seasons of westworld
that s a great idea honestly i d be pretty satisfied
i didnt like avatar but exploring is the clone its own being or just a copy and should a clone be held accountable for what the past self did are two very interesting angles to take a character
totally agree i just got the feeling they already started softening him in movie so we ll see where it goes i also hope it s not movies of sully vs quaritch
forgiveness is not a weakness
you re not wrong it just feels backwards in hindsight like if john wick was the one about him getting revenge for the dog after we ve already spent many hours in the world of assassins and the continental and all that but at least there does seem to be a clear path forward for the huge conflict to come in the next few avatars
just to add to the stephen lang part i watched a q a with the cast and both cameron and lang confirmed that his return was always intended and a part of their first meeting he ended filming the first one knowing at some point he would be asked back
to re misremembering he remembers everything up until the final fight in avatar where he is killed they did the backup before going out that time he had made an enemy of jake long before that but everything else you said makes sense
it s not a requirement the sequel could have existed without quarritch but cameron wanted to tell a particular story so he finagled his way around a character s on screen death
yeah kinda like rattlesnake jake he just goes gg bro you win
no the humans left pandora for most of that time and the avatar marines were produced after the war restarted in an effort to get close to the navi hideout since the bird things dont attack navi unless they also started growing them the second they left pandora at which point why didnt they grow more
i mean it can t be more expensive than colonizing an entire planet to mine anti aging whale brain serum
i m talking about the tarzan kid he was human
that still assumes that nobody told the rda what actually went down which i don t see happening the scientists as well as parker and any of his crew who weren t with the soldiers would tell their version of events and there s no reason not to tell the truth the militaristic security forces got out of hand instigated an armed uprising and forced the natives to retaliate
it does open up plot holes for the first movie the whole reason they needed jake was because of the genetic similarities with his brother but if they could have just had a backup of the consciousness to upload to an avatar why did they need jake at all
i love how the description of the program is boiling down to customizing video game characters
except he kinda wasn t he had an inner circle of his best men but we rarely see him in the field or interacting with his men and by all accounts his tactics relied entirely on having better tech than the natives his plan to attack the tree of souls was to fly straight at it no reconnaissance no forward scouts they were taken completely by surprise twice during the battle his only command during the fight was weapons free i e do what you want and good luck as soon as he spotted jake he tunnel visioned and didn t even notice while the rest of his forces were mopped up it was a massive tactical and strategic failure
i have a feeling that after what happened with spider and the fact that he s essentially on his own now as a na vi he will become a more sympathetic character at least he probably won t be the main antagonist moving forward
my theory is being in a na vi body inevitably draws you closer to ewya that s what happened to jake in the first movie and will probably happen to all the recombinants they basically have a shelf life as a soldier until they get naturalized
you must hate fun and thrills if you didn t like way of water
and gave him a son out of fucking no where
i mean him downloading his memories as a requirement
the scientists as well as parker and any of his crew who weren t with the soldiers would tell their version of events and there s no reason not to tell the truth the militaristic security forces got out of hand instigated an armed uprising and forced the natives to retaliate what s not depicted in the film is the quaritch had done a similar operation before and it worked just not on that scale a scene was deleted that depicted the colonel as acting outside company limitations however it was scrapped because cameron wanted to depict his radicalism being supported by protocol parker is back in avatar and part of ardmore s presence as a star general is to make sure secops doesn t have any more authority issues edit another piece of perspective is jake as a rogue element was to blame moreso than the colonel he organized and instigated a na vi coalition agains the rda used stolen weapons and materials coerced traitors and then evicted the rda after killing his former comrades very easy to blame it on him too
they didn t think he would die since he was a scientist same with sigourney weaver also the rda s politics with the scientists vs the mercenaries is like night and day so they also have priorities on who gets the upgrade there s probably ethics that play into it too which is reflected when recom quaritch talks to spider how he s not the real quaritch but only a clone
it took them a decade and a half to grow quaritch and the other soldiers avatars because of the dna matching the trip from earth is a really long one jake and neytiri had enough time to have multiple children one of whom was almost an adult when the humans return to retaliate the first movie even features somebody could be jake i don t remember off the top of my head mention that the avatars grew a lot during their cryo sleep from earth to pandora the rda built in a contingency plan for the long term if the operation at the end of the first movie went sideways preserve the memories of the most experienced personnel and if they lose and are driven off pandora they will return with all the knowledge of people who died as well as a bigger military fleet quaritch and his recombinant soldiers are grown en route to pandora to be special forces for general ardmore to use as unconventional warfare specialists to undermine the enemy kind of akin to green berets in the us military
this was a new thing that happened after jake s brother died either that or jake s brother died too early after all he wasn t riding to war he got stabbed to death
true but in mediocre plot films often they don t show military leaders as competent by how intelligent their strategies are instead its like he s the leader so he s the best at 1v1 combat but then the whole film felt pretty disjointed and also had a bunch of unnecessary stuff in there like do we really need a ten minute explanation of each step to hunt the whales why is the only element driving the plot kidnapping children like times in a row surely by the 4th time he d chop off a finger or something to prove there are consequences
i just assume at some point he ll plug into the soul tree thing and sort of like a big psychedelic trip have his mind massively opened
that isn t really a theory cause it did work
i wish there was a little bit of either of these plot points set up in part
well there was a comic series explaining he had a romantic relationship with a pilot who died in final battle in the last movie
i don t know what you re trying to say and i m not sure you do either
yeah it s hard to quantify some of the deleted scenes on whether they re canon or not i liked the deleted scene in the first film showing parker fighting against quaritch s operation and demanding he stop enlisting miners to do security operations he was also a lot more reluctant to go ahead with the battle in the first place including the first attack on home tree
i would have found it interesting if there was a requirement that avatar users should have twin siblings as an insurance policy that would have made the use of jake in the first movie a bit more natural
i mean when your boat is sinking and there s probably serial killers on board when will you have time to chop a finger off
in the comics we see who is mother was she was a pilot and coworker for quaritch but in the final battle her plane got shot down
i liked the deleted scene in the first film showing parker fighting against quaritch s operation and demanding he stop enlisting miners to do security operations he was also a lot more reluctant to go ahead with the battle in the first place including the first attack on home tree i miss the deleted scenes too despite being superfluous its all great content that positively effects the story i m miffed that a complete extended cut isn t in the cards
ok but is there anything in the movie to suggest they had a child
i love movies with mythological elements so count me in
i really enjoyed this book but i imagine the movie to be in the divergent maze runner level of teen chosen one movies it just feels like that kind of movie
let me guess theseus volunteers as tribute to go to the labyrinth
i just want the sequel made in hardcore henry style but yeah i agree with you
binoculars to not waste a flare when no one is around also could reflect sun light in hopes of someone seeing it
it fit the plot i suppose i have no idea what would be up there in real life a bigger box with a couple of parachutes wouldn t be a bad idea
i ve been thinking about watching it would you recommend it scale of what would you give it
i don t think the idea behind the inciting incident is logical whatsoever but the sense of vertigo you get during the movie and the suspense behind it had me saying nope more than a few times between a and outta for me good direction and connection to the audience through suspense but not very logical
there wouldn t really be anything up there because it would be impossible to stop from corrosion and lightning strikes happen regulary
parachutes are not an option you really can t expect people to understand on their own even with a manual how to use a parachute the first time they get one
yea i was just curious if they adapted this detail from the real world or if it was just a plot device
a bigger box with a couple of parachutes wouldn t be a bad idea maybe it s not high enough for parachutes to work
well they definitely did a great job of inducing vertigo or whatever it s called the camera and cgi really make you feel like you re right up there with them but they either didn t do their research on climbing or didn t care about getting it right overall it s a pretty good suspense flick
would give it a go
i need to watch the movie but people base jump off hella low things but they re pros
okay thanks

i think nintendo s constant blunders in the 90s are hilarious the development of the gameboy and snes cd are like set up set up punchline nintendo wants to make a new unit they partner with another tech giant they screw over their partner and give an advantage to them they still succeed anyway gameboy nintendo partners with sharp to make the dot matrix display sharp delivers a crappy screen nintendo contracts citizen instead to make a screen sharp secretly works on improving their screen citizen and sharp both present nintendo with screens sharp s is better so nintendo renegs on their deal with citizen to save face nintendo promises citizen they will be contracted for a colour screen in a few years and as part of the apology sends them schematics of their colour screen plans these schematics were just a mock up by a junior engineer and not official at all a year later sega comes out with the gamegear nintendo does a teardown and discovers a screen by citizen that has been designed based on the unofficial plans of one of their junior engineers the gameboy is a success anyway playstation nintendo works with sony to develop a cd rom add on for the snes they get cold feet after a few years when they can t come to an agreement over who will own the technology that sony researched and developed nintendo partners with philips to make snes cd and sony takes what it learned from working with nintendo to make the playstation nintendo loses the market this time

there seems to be a trend right now of taking the richest and most powerful people in the world and trying to show them at a younger age right now the only examples of this that i can think of are the social network and air and they were released years apart so it doesn t really seem to be much of a trend
i mean there are only so many times you can do a parody before it gets boring
you should check out the subversive faux period documentary about the birth of a i computer chess https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007360/reference/
they did that already unless that s happened more than once
i mean i would watch that definitely but i think in general you could tell a fairly interesting story about the creation and filming of that show

jobs steve jobs the founder house of gucci were what i was thinking of air should have been called house of nike
yes but i can say the same for these overly dramatic half truth biopics coming out a good parody would keep them in check plus parodies generally age better
excuse me while i go slam my head in a wall for an hour for forgetting those
eh i think they don t get as boring because they re not as reliant on novelty so it comes down to the execution of it while there are only so many jokes you can mine from a particular topic also most parodies age horribly lol
biopics are reliant on embellishment and sweeping things under the rug a documentary accomplishes the same goal with less cruft on top of that if something comes out about the subject it tarnishes the movie and there are so many good examples of parody young frankenstein airplane top secret walk hard space balls scary movie naked gun ed wood galaxy quest austin powers etc and movies with parody elements like robocop starship troopers tropic thunder to name a few
biopics are reliant on embellishment and sweeping things under the rug not inherently a weakness though and unlike novelty it doesn t get depleted in the same way a documentary accomplishes the same goal with less cruft i don t think a biopic seeks to accomplish the same thing as a documentary though and there are so many good examples of parody and there are also many good biopics lol like raging bull goodfellas malcolm x serpico etc and scary movie is terrible lol and all the movie that tried to replicate it were even worse
the movie has an interesting history larry cohen wrote the rough draft of the story for alfred hitchcock when he was working as a writer on alfred hitchcock presents hitchcock wanted to develop it into a movie but they couldn t come up with a good enough reason to get the main character in the phone booth so it went into a drawer for decades cohen came up with the sniper aspect in the 1990s and took the script shopping and that s how it ended up being produced by david zucker and directed by joel schumacher
you know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy he cocks his gun now why didn t he have it cocked because that sound is scary love this movie colin and kiefer are both great in it
interesting fun fact it was not filmed in nyc the establishing shots were but the phone booth itself was in la funny how a bluish tone gets you that ny feel
what s so interesting about phone booth is that this was the last time that phone booths were ever really used not too long ago after this was the end of being confined to a single space that made every second using a phone booth that much more intimate important there was a time on the internet that i stumbled upon a forum of people who called phone booths and the allure for the caller and the random receiver wondering who is calling and why any movie that tried to use a cellphone to draw thrill has always been horribly cringe it really makes me appreciate phone booth that much more i always find it so watchable too and the intensity and progression is amazing for a film that takes place all in one location too if you haven t seen phone booth i highly recommend it especially if you can let your mind go back to the very early 2000s and just let go
goddammit man you gone made me hurt my dick hand true art this movie
jim carrey was originally the lead could you imagine how that film would ve played out
yo remember when that hooker said goddamnit man you gone made me hurt my dick hand
my favorite part of phone booth was that it was less than minutes i don t mean that in a bad way i appreciate that they didn t feel the need to unnecessarily stretch it out to hours
this movie along a tabloid culture obsessed with his celebrity life seemed to convince the public at large that colin ferrell was a sick joke of some sort i remember well that he was the toxic hollywood douche for such a long time and ultimately phone booth wasn t even that bad of a movie it s better than most michael bay movies anyways i love the fact that since or so colin ferrell has more than proved he s an actor worth his salt his performances in the lobster true detective s02 the killing of a sacred deer in bruges and banshees of inisherin all speak for themselves
kiefer sutherlands voice is liquid gold on a surround sound system along with the reloading sounds
wait til the prequel rotary phone takes you for a spin
the entire movie i wondered what the sniper would have done if the guy just passed out from stress like he fainted in the booth asleep on the ground i don t think he would have shot him since he wanted to teach the man a lesson and feel fear and control but i guess if he didn t shoot him odds are a passerby would open the door and pull him out at which point the game was over i actually told myself if i was ever in this situation i would just pretend to hyperventilate and pass out you know on the incredibly likely chance this exact scenario occurred
ahh yes the movie which showed the killer on the cover and also had his name on every ad piece for the movie the pizza guy is the shooter me well the pizza guy isn t keifer sutherland so no its not
remember seeing it on 42nd st when it came out and roaring laughing when the pizza guy tried to deliver the pizza eat the pizza yourself you look like you could use a good meal after i walked up 8th ave to where the fictional phone box was not a bad flick with a good cast
filed under the category of excellent thriller to replay on cable
whenever i think about this movie i just can t help but admire the brilliance a large portion of the film takes place in a single set a guy in a phone booth with extras walking by talking to a voice off screen they got colin farrell forest whitaker katie holmes and kiefer sutherland together for an minute feature film for million
one of the greatest lines ever is in this movie by the prostitute after she slaps the side of the phone booth gaaawddamnit maaaan you made me hurt my dick hand
phone booth what the fuck is that i dunno but check your cell to see if jeff called back the end
i liked this movie when it came out but i remember it was almost universally panned it was a pleasant surprise to find it has a bit of a cult following now or at least newer audiences seem to like it a bit better
interesting thanks also many new films use plot devices that require the period to be in the 90s or 00s to avoid smartphone availability
i should watch liberty stands still
phone booths were on their way out in the narrative of the movie
everyone said this movie was atrocious when it first came out now it s lauded as a classic lulz
hooker damn it man you done made me hurt my dick hand colin farrell aww i m sure you re just as good with the other hand go away
if it came out in the 70s or 80s it would ve been viewed as a masterpiece i love this movie
anybody else remember the heated phone booth in front of mister donut on iyannogh road in hyannis
it s been a while since i ve seen one of these omg read me i m so cool i have a hot take on a years old movie articles i had hoped they went away at least this one is in r movies and not some pop culture sub
this is one of the only movies i ve ever walked out on from the theater maybe it just hit me wrong but it had so much potential and was just so bad is there any reason to give it another chance
and hearing gun noises every time you see down the scope works to infuriate anyone who s ever seen or heard a gun ever in their life
this movie made the best soundboard for prank calls only to my other buddies though
well not all of us carry around one of those intrusive devices where ever we go i ve been stymied more than once by the lack of public phones after riding public transit and needing a ride from the bus station
i liked this movie but it was greatly undermined by sutherland being the voice took out a lot of mystery that would have made it a better movie
i didn t realize that this is r movies and thought we were talking about the thrills of using an actual phone booth
i ain t reading allat
i remember watching this as a kid however i still stand by my opinion any movie that a character is sitting in the same spot for the entire duration of the movie is inherently boring
i still have my ticket stub from when i saw it in theaters
kids these days i remember on youtube lgr did a video where he talked about connecting the computer to a landline and he had to talk about it in another video to explain to people about what a landline is since all the comments were asking about it i find it strange that people really are clueless like they don t watch old movies and see phones with cords heck it is and i still own a landline and i need it for my adsl connection at home since fiber is still on it s way since lol
i did not enjoy this film i think it sucks
it is an exciting movie for sure that kiefer sutherland plays an intense psychopath and sniper by his voice only every moment has a element of surprise and urgency farrell plays the victim magnificently and you feel the dread and fear as he answers the phone
kiefer sutherland was so menacing as the caller one of my favorite performances of his
interesting timing for this article since the movie has been in my mind randomly lately cool movie man it definitely was a topic of discussion when it first came out or even when the first trailer was released cheap to make relatively too a cheap hit a studio s dream
one of my favourite underrated movies just a great example of how to do so much with so little having said that what the fuck is obsolescence come on author you don t need to try that hard haha
this movie came out when i was quite young i have one fairly stupid question is it good it literally just seems like it s colin farrell in a phone booth for most of the movie how good can it be
this movie is dope
i watched this at the cinema but i watched in on disc with my mum a few weeks ago and she hated it
great movie simple concept but excellent acting
i feel like rear window is sort of the same way even though there isn t really any outdated technology that is necessary for that film and indeed it has been remade a number of times disturbia for instance
i remember being years old and thinking that guy was john stamos lol
i worked at the studio where this was being shot and i ran the dailies it was a small production very lean and finished relatively fast i know this movie was directed by joel schumacher but i tell you that wasn t the ground truth matty libatique the cinematographer made that movie i had heard stories of directors who had their names on films despite not having done the work but phone booth was my first time seeing it firsthand
david zucker comedy movie writer director produces thriller til
it s kind of amazing it took him thirty years to come up with the idea of there being a sniper but to the point of the article the increasing obsolescence of phone booths and having farrell juggling all the calls on his cell phone certainly adds to the story i also couldn t think of a better voice for the caller than kiefer sutherland i used to watch it all the time whenever it was on fx
that is interesting til
neat
hitchcock s hunch was right this movie felt contrived
deleted
link to the scene for those interested it s just as good as i remember https://youtu.be/jii91igl180)
i remember a guy i saw it with was like damn i thought that was rutger haur the whole time
it s a movie i can watch over and over again and never get bored of colin and kiefer are both incredible
slightly orange we must be in mexico
i ve always felt it s really hard to make anything involving smartphones feel cinematic for some reason
a small town near me has a pay phone in the town s only bar it was set up only for outgoing calls so you can get a ride home i verified it does not accept incoming calls i am probably not the first to dial the number and feel disappointment at a lack of ringing
if bluetooth in a car counts i think locke does a great job of it
the last time that phone booths were ever really used how will clark kent ever turn into superman now
buried uses the idea of him being buried in a coffin with only a lighter and a cellphone progressively loosing battery very well
i agree about the cellphone thing with one very important exception the departed one of the films most thrilling scenes is even centered around cell phones
the worst imo is when they put the phone screen on the main screen as if it s another window open or something it just looks so odd and takes me out of the movie i see it done a lot now and it always feels weird i don t know how you can show a text conversation in a movie well but putting a pop up of the phone on the screen probably ain t it
i remember when i was in nyc i dragged my mom to the street they said the phone booth was at in the movie and i was so disappointed that it wasn t there when we got there i thought it was real and would be there and got my mom all there for nothing one of my best memories still of the movie as it s something i ll never forget good movie too very suspensful
any movie that tried to use a cellphone to draw thrill has always been horribly cringe it really makes me appreciate phone booth that much more nerve was really lame whole time i thought they d get super creative but it s just like meme dares made into cinema
in my opinion one of colin ferrel s best movies but i may be biased because i saw it way back in the mid late 2000s it was definitely tense
also minutes one hour and minute movie i was going to watch the new d d movie until i saw it was hours minutes sweet jesus why does every single movie need to be as long as fellowship of the ring
yesterday was years to the day of the first cell phone call
repair guys used to have a number you could dial and the phone would ring back to itself amused myself a few times as a kid setting up pay phones to ring and watch people answer them
as for films that try to use cellphones to build tension i agree nearly none of them work but i think personal shopper assayas does an incredible job
i love it i never got bored of it colin farrell s performance is gripping keifer sutherland s voice performance is chilling i love the whole tone of the movie the soundtrack the directing it was one of the first dvds my family got when i was a kid when dvd s just started taking off and it feels very specific to that time in a great way
the humble phone booth helped us achieve freedom from government wiretaps from katz vs the us the government s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner s words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment
first movie i ever bought on dvd
the voice of trudy proud proud family no less
oh i m sure you re just as good with the other hand
top line delivery in film history
he played a pretty good broken man in the number
jim carrey can do sleeze and with his humor it would make sense why people might miss him being such a huge douche
it was an extremely profane movie
yeah pretty hilarious dangit now i have to go watch it again
agreed it is the perfect run time for the story it has not a breath of wasted air time i wish more movies werent afraid to be tighter
hats off to this comment reminds me that we need more 90min movies
i often choose a film to watch purely on the basis it s mins or less
i think colin would admit himself that he went to hollywood did a load of drugs drank a lot had sex with lots of women and didn t really give a shit about his career for a bit
and thirteen lives as well watched it the other week he s always great seven psychopaths the batman fright night he is one of the best actors around today
perfect voice for the character intimidating and also a sneering dickhead when he s fucking with colin really liked the ending protagonist wins in the sense that colin is mostly unhurt and his character becomes a better person but kiefer also completely wins accomplishes his goals and gets away
say it
this movie made me wish kiefer would play villains in movies still waiting
doesn t that just twerk your jollies
each stew was a direct hit to my eardrums
the writer of this movie actually wrote a movie called cellular i think it s just a coincidence though
pretty sure that would just be sorry wrong number
the dvd cover showed keifer but the movie poster didn t
pizza guy was my college drama teacher you should see him on cop rock https://youtu.be/guftrg2jqf4)
could be more than one
everyone knew who it was aas soon as you heard his voice it s not like it was a big mystery
the movie wasn t panned but its release was held up because of the very real sniper serial killer terrorizing the east coast this was made and on its way to theaters during the beltway sniper killings

gibson s max or hardy s max
which batman
first half of my version would have alot of non consensual sex second would be either murder or suicide
good question i was raised on gibson s max but hardy did a better job maybe because he s a better actor hardy s max definite answer
i m gonna go with afleck a more aggressive but also a veteran batman not the young one like robert pattinson which there s nothing wrong with his i m just thinking as whacky as possible
the teachers screaming when davy jones goes on stage and the students having no idea who he is was perfect
sure jan
jan come back when you re pregnant and girl you better work it
i have a copy of the movie on vhs signed by davy jones micky dolenz and peter tork who i got to meet backstage at a monkees show they were all pleased to see the tape and said working on the movie was a lot of fun
it most definitely was it was a sarcastic comedy making fun of itself the entire time and the premise is perfection take that family and just place them into modern day executed near perfectly it doesn t get enough credit
this was top tier meta humor before we even had a word for meta if this movie were released today with a few joke adjustments to suit modern audiences it would be critically acclaimed it was well received when it was released and was successful enough to spawn a sequel which was also pretty good just like last action hero 90s audiences had absolutely no problem wrapping their heads around the absolutely mind boggling meta concept of the film
i think the sequel is one of the best comedies i ve ever seen
one of my personal favorite comedies great cast
when i first heard back then they were making this movie i figured it would just be some modern day adaptation what they did was genius taking the exact same family with identical looking sounding actors and dropping them in the s while they were in the s so many good bits davey jones was hilarious or mike trying to sell his design and it was some outdated building and he was all proud of it
once you ve heard marcia say skle and diyep you can t say them any other way the over the top hair swishing is perfection too
put on your sunday best kids we re going to sears
a very brady sequel is also really good
i wish more reboots remakes whatever would go for a more satirical approach i thought archie would ve made good satirical material but they decided to turn it into a moody teen drama
loved this movie when i was in middle skuewl
it s me the new jan let s knock over a
i disagree about the timing as it was designed to appeal to gen x that grew up watching endless reruns of the show because there was nothing else on if you tried to parody it today i don t think it would work with a modern audience for the record i absolutely love the movie and still tell my family to put on their sunday best we re going to sears whenever we would go somewhere nice
i fucking loved these movies when they came out
before we had the word meta like bc you mean
the word meta is latin
something that really hit me hard with nostalgia recently was watching this series where the original brady house in the exterior shots was purchased and remodeled to match how it appears in the tv show i realized i had a really fond attachment to the show https://youtu.be/8ea8q5k0g-u
i ve seen these movies when i was young but can t remember much about them also want to point out and not in a rude or sarcastic way that meta art and texts existed long before modern times my favorite book is don quixote except it s not just one book but two books published years apart and in the second book which may have been started out of cervantes frustration at copy cat novelists writing what he considered inferior copies of his characters publishing laws and printing were much different then compared to now everyone has read the first book and they all know about quixote and his adventures this is frequently set up in a comedic way for cervantes to denigrate other people who wrote adventures for his knight not sharing this in meanness but rather in the spirit of sharing knowledge meta texts are incredibly common and audiences in the 1990s would have been very aware of what they were
i quite like both of these movies oh no i m tripping with the bradys
i m glad people still watch it they were still stuck in the 70s and the rest of the world has moved on shouldn t have worked as an idea but it totally does
you think there wasn t anything meta before
gem underrated ahead of its time you got all the movie sub buzzwords in lol
i know it is meant to be exactly what it is but jeez can mike design something other than his house it just frustrates me
moesha moesha moesha runs away crying
i was a very sheltered child at the time and actually watched it because i was allowed to watch old brady bunch episodes i didn t realize ru paul was a man in drag which is now very funny to think back on as an out gay man
considering meta humor has been used in films as far back as the 1940s hellzapoppin and the 90s were literally full of films using meta humor i d say the brady bunch movie wasn t years ahead of its time it was perfectly in line with the times it was made
your thoos will thlip in the thuice also jean smart as the drunk neighbor will never not be funny
addams family values is the blueprint so it wasn t really ahead of its time
am i an old because i m so bothered by the meta part of the post
reset the counter
it s really funny jan steals the show i think it drags in the last act but it s still well worth it
the origins of the movie is interesting there was a sketch group in the early s that andy richter was part of that would do shows where they would just do episodes of the brady bunch on stage and not change the words the satire became obvious by just talking like that in the s the shows became really popular hollywood caught on and we got the movies
it s what those scooby doo movies wanted to be
a very brady sequel was pretty good too
it managed to walk the fine line between parody and reverence for the source material better than any other film i can think of the sequel holds up pretty well too the cast was excellent
i randomly found this movie flipping channels a few years ago and was very quickly caught off guard with the adult themes it was perfect and i agree such a great comedy
his name is george
what s his name jam
i feel like this movie actually gets better with age because now we have the added layer of 90s nostalgia on top of the original 70s nostalgia austin powers achieves a similar effect
hey there groovy chick you re pretty happening in a far out way
you know how dittmeyer michael mckean has a neck brace at sears for some reason and is carrying a new toilet it s all part of a deleted subplot where he dumps his daughter s science project in the brady driveway only for tiger to pick up the termite infested wood and carry it back over to his house cue mckean and toilet falling through the floor ceiling the next day not kidding https://youtu.be/bqwj96yx2ew)
deleted
no i mean like cutting that mousy hair capping those teeth and losing about pounds my little sausage how do you feel about breast implants slaps joe isuzu cut my hair
i reckon it s the best of the long list of movies based on or parodying iconic tv shows the cast was great the new peter nailed the goofy grin
i miss when meta comedy was exclusive to the muppets and a random few examples like that as nowadays it s hard to find major movies that can fully commit to sincerity
this movie had some over the top dark humor don t bend over https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=095aqqrtz0u) robert reed who died of cancer in also had hiv https://www.google.com/search?q=robert+reed+aids&ei=_tguzng4jieegabox6vacg&ved=0ahukewirq-7opjt-ahuhasakhejjcqgq4dudca8&uact=5&oq=robert+reed+aids&gs_lcp=cgxnd3mtd2l6lxnlcnaqazokcaaqrxdwbbcwazopcc4qiguqyamqsamqqxgboguiabcabdoicc4qgaqq1ai6bqgueiaeogyiabaweb46cagaeiofeiydogoilhckbrbdeooeogcilhckbrbdogsilhcabbdhardrazolcc4qgaqqxweqrwe6cwgueiofejeceooeoggilhckbrcrajolcc4qiguq1aiqkqi6dqgueiofemcbenedeem6cagaeiofejecsgqiqrgauncewjzeyi1faajwaxgegahiaygbih2saqywlje2ljsyaqcgaqgwaqdiaqnaaqhaaqqiargi&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)
i thought of this movie when i saw the new barbie trailer seems like they re going for that sweet spot of campily poking fun but in a loving earnest way
i loved this movie and the appearances from some of the original cast members made it all the better there was florence henderson og carol as the grandma ann b davis og alice as schultzy the truck driver barry williams og greg as the music producer maureen mccormick og marcia as kitty and christopher knight og peter as the coach the movie perfectly parodies the og series
it s a shame this was shelley longs only noteable work after cheers she was so good as diane
it was respected enough to get a hilarious sequel
i was a kid when this movie came out so i didn t totally understand the meta humor i just knew something felt weird about the movie lol i can t remember if it s the first or second movie but jan leaving a hairbrush behind and making the airplane go in reverse still makes me crack up till this day
my wife and i watch this at least once a year it s one of a handful of movies that we were surprised and delighted to learn that we both loved we quote it all the time usually in very inappropriate moments something suddenly came up
i thought very brady sequel was a lot funnier though both were entertaining not many 90s comedies still make me laugh when i watch them now but these have still aged pretty well assuming you re familiar with stuff like the sears reference for everyone s awareness more time has passed since than the time passed between and when bb first premiered
this movie and a very brady sequel are classics i don t think it s a coincidence that the barbie movie seems to have a very similar tone
this was not the hot take i was expecting to read as i sipped my morning coffee but i appreciate it
the scenes where the dad keep hocking his home as models for new businesses makes me laugh so much every time
it was great that it wasn t a straight reboot brady bunch was absurd in the 1960s
christine taylor absolutely nailed it as marcia carol and alice s portrayals were incredibly good too i wish they d release an extended version with the cameos of all of the original cast maureen mccormick s was cut amongst others
remember liking the show and the film but i totally forgot it existed
i could just never get over how much christine taylor just seems like maureen mccormick teleported in time
i hated it they were stuck in the 70s but why it s never explained
meta humor is nothing new in the late 90s early 2000s people were joking by saying that s so meta https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/whats-the-meta.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/whats-the-meta.html) the meta craze in criticism soon reached a point of parody about self conscious parody on salon com i found it on metacrawler a diogenic searcher of search engines stephanie zacharek reviewed the film adaptation calling it a massively self indulgent metamovie adding that if you re so meta that you re completely unimpressed with how meta it is then you are only reinforcing the movie s point you ve been so meta consumed by metaculture that you re no longer able to take pleasure in art in fact in meta was already blase
this brady bunch movie is underated thread is made about two times a month and this is the worst version of it yet dunno when the term meta was coined but self referential humour is literally ancient i m not even trying to sound mean but you re just spitting out silly statements as if they are fact
i forgot the word meta was invented in the 90s i remember in college my psych books said we ll think of a word eventually physical
i remember that the audience clapped after seeing it in the theatre
you are a brilliant person bravo
i saw it in the theatre with my year old niece i don t remember anything about it except that the marcia was a perfect replica and alice wearing an s m outfit also my niece was bored unless cindy was on screen what is this greatness that i m not remembering
it absolutely was i didn t like it when i was a kid in the 90s but looking back now it s hilarious that they made it the way they did absolutely the kind of post post modern irony that didn t get popular until the 2010s or so i think you re spot on
this film works so well because the creators clearly enjoyed the show but also know how to make fun of it in the right places there were other remakes around the time where there was clearly no love for the source material but they just made it cheap adult and raunchy beverly hillbillies starsky and hutch and i legitimately enjoy the grunge tinged version of girl with davy jones
i always felt like the rock arrangement of girl was really well done
that s because he s a transfer student he came in the last week of school he s really good looking and he thinks i m super cool
i used to be reeeeaallllly into the monkees i didn t get autographs but i did drive to different states to see them back in or so
agreed and yet it was never mean to the source material it was despite roasting the shit out of the sitcom a very loving parody these things shouldn t mix but they do and it really made something special
exactly the film made the bradys the anti addams family instead of a creepy kooky spooky family smack dab in a modern society its an overtly 60s americana sitcom family living in modern society somehow it works
it actually spawned two sequels i m not joking
man last action hero is a fucking gem
is meta just what we call postmodernism now did jordan peterson ruin this too
i love last action hero but critics and audiences absolutely had trouble wrapping their heads around it it was critically panned and considered schwarzenegger s first big flop due to box office
i love how much high concept shit was in the 90s just watched what women want okay early 2000s here and was surprised how much i loved it
moesha moesha moehsa
oh my god i m tripping with the bradys
he said the b word
funnily enough tim matheson would play the vp on west wing only to be replaced by gary cole a few seasons later mrs brady had a type
some of my mushrooms oh no i m tripping with the brady s
gary cole and shelly long are so perfectly cast
mike trying to sell his design and it was some outdated building and he was all proud of it the model was the brady house
skle that s such a perfect way to spell that
don t greg and marsha end up fucking
oh my god i m tripping with the bradys
i thought archie would ve made good satirical material but they decided to turn it into a moody teen drama i mean they tried it with josie the pussycats movie which actually had the same writers as a very brady sequel and the movie was misunderstood at the time no wonder they gave up on such approach riverdale does get meta at some points tho
i kinda thought this approach would work well for power rangers as well
saved by the bell did this mostly wish that got more seasons
you re not wrong i suppose i mean heck when you tell your family that the kids are probably like what s sears
basil i suggest you don t worry about those things and just enjoy yourself to camera basil that goes for you all too
he didn t say criminally or masterpiece or cinematography or villeneuve
the vibe i always got was that he loved his family and his home so that s the design that makes him truly happy and why would he give his clients anything less
me neither straight woman but i remember thinking the guidance counsellor had a cracking pair of legs
after this and ford vs ferrari what does everyone think will be the third installment of the matt damon is an innovative businessman involved with sports trilogy
whenever matt damon was giving his big inspiring speech to the jordans all i could think of was his crypto commercial fortune favors the brave lmao
as a lifelong basketball fan sonny s matt damon speech to michael jordan where he predicts exactly what he will have to go through and endure to become the greatest of all time being crosscut with some of his most iconic highlights and life milestones was so incredibly moving for me also i read the book shoe dog recently and they do capture the essence of what makes phil knight although it s played up here for laughs the name air jordan growing on him the original dimension name some excellent real life touches that showed how well researched the writing was most importantly who would want to watch charles barkley on tv foreshadowing the most beloved nba analyst of our time and other little touches like stockton ewing and more were all just so great call me biased saw it a week ago and will see it in theatres again this is the type of movie i want to see it ll get my financial support
ben affleck is a great director a great film in his oeuvre for sure
the phone conversation between the agent and sonny has to be one of the funniest scenes that i ve seen in recent memory the entire theater was laughing and the fact that sonny was laughing too just elevated that entire scene
you could tell everyone was having fun with this one it felt like since it was the era damon and affleck grew up in they really wanted to dive back into it definitely going to be a great addition to tnt s weekend daytime rotation
loved every performance and ben s direction great movie about knowing your worth and appreciated how it told the story as a trail blazer for players in all sports also amazing soundtrack
loved it interesting subject matter great performances by matt damon and jason bateman very strong film
i m probably not the target audience for this movie considering i don t really care for sports or shoes but i ll be damned if this was still not an interesting and very well shot story about a compulsive gambler who gambled his entire company on one player and got it to pay off like a slot machine ben affleck is such an effective director that all these middle aged men with mullets and windbreakers yelling about budgets for two hours feels so insanely watchable the dialogue is witty the story is kind of crazy and damon is putting in this great performance with a ton of conviction loved his character and how we see his relationship to gambling in the opening scene he makes like fifty sports bets hits on them then loses it all on chance we see he s a sports savant but he will risk that ability and knowledge on complete chance in a heartbeat and that s exactly what he does for the rest of the movie i said it in my tetris review but this is the year that corporate success stories done in flashy retro style seem to be hitting there is this implication of comedy just watching these people bet on what we now know was a smashing success it works in tetris and it works here corporate success stories aren t my favorite type of movie but the wrap up text at the end of this movie did have me feeling some kind of way it was a smart decision to not make this movie about jordan in a way it s kind of about his legacy and his myth so it felt right to not make him a character he s in the scenes but we never see his face and he has maybe three lines the entire movie this movie is less about what he goes on to do and more about the man who saw what he was capable of before anyone else and capitalized on it big it was actually really cool to see him thread this deal by basically saying everyone thinks you re just another good player but i know you re a game changer mix all that with some fun 80s soundtrack vibes and retro references and some really amazing supporting performances from bateman and tucker and my woman king not to mention affleck having the funniest scene being late to the meeting and this is just a very watchable movie it s a for me and if you care about this subject more than your average joe it s probably an or for you r reviewsbyboner
air is probably the movie of the year so far excellent history montage in the beginning i love those one of matt damon s best performances the passion he brought to the character is insane chris messina s meltdown is hilarious chris tucker killed in it his small role the speech intercutting with mj s life moments is probably the scene of the movie expertly directed by ben affleck well paced with excellent cinematography appreciate the choice not to show teen mj in the movie as the movie is about the people behind the shoe what is essentially a history lesson and a hour commercial for nike turns into well crafted movie with excellent performances
blown away by this film it just felt nice it s like they ve perfected the cerebral button pushing and it just lit me up proper
snappy script likable performances memorable soundtrack good rhythm wish it were a bit more ambitious overall it s a charming dramatization of a for doc
surprisingly pretty great i m not a big fan of sports but this film provides an interesting insight about nike and the dramatic elements behind the story with strong directing performances and dialogue ben affleck as a filmmaker has made some pretty good films as his works on gone baby gone and the town are pretty great his work on argo was alright and his previous film live by night was pretty bad this one is an improvement from his previous throughout the film has pretty good direction from affleck as his direction helps maintain the film s setting tone and style the costume production sets and the setting are pretty good and colorful to look through all the performances from the cast members are really good as the performances helped to make the characters interesting and the dialogue was written pretty well conversations and interactions between characters felt interesting and there was great chemistry throughout the camerawork is also pretty good the narrative is predictable and certain pacing moments could have been improved but despite that the film still was able to hold itself high due to affleck s direction the performances and writing this film could have ended up being a bland and generic biographical film but affleck is able to successfully create an interesting and sometimes tense story
my favorite movie from the past months
possibly the lowest stakes movie i ve seen in a long time obviously it s hard to build tension when we know fully going in what ends up happening even if you re not in any way interested in basketball you know about michael jordan that his shoes are a multi billion dollar success for that reason i was really impressed how engaging fun they made this movie great showcase for damon bateman and another movie that shows how good a director ben affleck is
i m a basketball junkie bulls fan and sneakerhead so i went into this movie with impossible expectations it knocked them out of the park just such a perfect love letter to that nostalgic era of the nba and nike the way they were able to convey that godlike aura jordan had without even showing him was some of the most creative filmmaking i ve seen in awhile i had goosebumps throughout but the sneaker reveal and damon s speech about jordan s greatness were incredible you could tell the humor was made by basketball fans for basketball fans which hit for me personally but i could see that not being the case for others
this movie was amazing i was embarrassed walking out in my adidas shit
who would want to watch charles barkley on tv the movie was littered with little easter eggs and references that made basketball fans like me laugh with glee
i enjoyed it i liked the soundtrack that big country song i hadn t heard before it was really good it was witty everybody looked like they were having fun it was a predictable story but it was fun and the costume design and production design really stood out to me because i love that stuff and it felt really immersive plus you put blister in the sun in a movie i m gonna give extra points to it
i walked in knowing absolutely nothing zero all i knew was that it got good reviews ben affleck matt damon something about sports michael jordan that s all i walked out wanting nike shoes from someone who knows next to nothing about sports i barely know michael jordan except that he s famous and i remember him on my kid basketball rack decades ago i knew nothing about anything nike or mj much less that this deal was a big thing i didn t get all the little references and a lot went over my head but i loved it all the actors were wow made it through a very confusing opening for me and i was along for the ride this was such a fun well crafted and immersive movie for me matt damon is a delight to watch i had a long bad day and found myself laughing along with all the well times wit the actors chemistry was brilliant everything was just so well acted between matt damon ben affleck jason bateman viola davis it felt so natural great job to the whole cast and crew that was a fun ride loved the shoe reveal loved that powerful speech at the end i ve seen a lot of movies recently that i loved and never really bothered to write about any of it the fact that i ve already written this much for probably no one to see means something this movie had an effect on me and that s pretty freaking cool
i smashed my work phone a few times as well after watching it love this film
really enjoyed it thought the montage of jordans career during damons speech was brilliant
people rag on ben affleck but the fact that he can direct a film where i know full well what is going to happen and i can still be in suspense about if it is going to happen is incredible both air argo had me anxious about the outcome for air specifically i found it had an excellent pace great believable dialogue fun s throwbacks wonderful acting delightful music placement characters to root for will they won t they suspense the boardroom meeting scene was painful wonderful to watch how many of us have prepared for and invested so much into something only to totally bumble it when it was go time plus i got choked up during the career speech montage needless to say viola davis was perfection insert chef s kiss
enjoyed this movie quite a bit good performances interesting camera shots solid atmosphere and engrossing from start to finish ben affleck directed the heck out of it
this is the best movie about shoes since like mike this was just a clean well told story it s kind of a magic trick that despite the fact we know how the story plays out the tension and stakes of the movie never suffer there s a simplicity and sophistication to the narrative structure that kept me on my toes sonny is immediately established as a gambling man he s longing for the big hit but he s not just blindly praying he s a dedicated scout he s doing the work what follows is a series of growing obstacles and successive triumphs they don t want a meeting so sonny knocks at the door a decision has been made so a simple favour is requested the risk is deemed too big so a compelling pitch is made a shoe is required an icon is crafted a meeting takes place a speech is made it s not just about making a shoe or signing an athlete it s about the countless moments leading up to it all and the resolve and conviction that carried our wily protagonist through having said that shoutout to matt damon who carries almost the entirety of this movie with his natural charisma we learn very little about sonny vaccaro he has a penchant for gambling and he loves basketball that s about all the setup we get the rest of his character is revealed simply by the narrative it s a simple trick that not only makes this movie feel as lean as it does but it helps invest us all the more in his journey as we see it unfold i was super impressed by this the supporting cast is also incredible in their own right viola davis nearly wrestles away the movie from matt damon in the climactic moments and jason bateman and ben affleck are great too i ll add that another thing this movie manages to pull off is making nike seem like an underdog i m sure they were considered as such when this story takes place but the idea that we re supposed to feel inspired or any kind of warm fuzziness when we re told nike eventually bought converse or that phil knight donates money made me want to roll my eyes despite all that i think this is an undeniably well made movie told in a super compelling manner
this felt like a short story extended out to hours well directed and shot and they hit the time period feel very on point if not overdone sometimes i didn t feel the acting was anything special and outside of matt damon and the other characters felt forced or intentionally exaggerated acting and mannerisms this movie seems to be told from matt damon s perspective and the other characters actions felt like it came from an unreliable narrator or just his perspective of other s personalities i think this was intentionally done this way but it was a bit too much sometimes it was a cool behind the scenes style look and being a jordan and nba fan this was more interesting to me since i already knew how drastically this deal changed sports but seeing in action was a a fun romp i do think they downplayed how absolutely wild this deal was and how massively this single deal changed sports forever it could have used something other than just a few snippets of text at the end but i also get that wasn t the story they were telling it was about sonny and why nike got chosen that said this could have just been a direct to streaming movie no need to pay to see it in the theater go see the d d movie instead for a better theater experience
i know nothing about basketball and have no interest in it i also know nothing about shoes and have no interest in them despite that i thought this was pretty amazing the cast was brilliant matt damon plays his role so well and viola davis can do no wrong
i was excited originally when i heard affleck was directing again even to the point of defending the potential the movie had in the latest poster thread we saw on here man oh man it s a fucking satisfying feeling what a fantastic fucking movie affleck killed it again and i d be shocked if there are multiple oscar noms thrown at it
why did they do peter moore s voice dirty
matt damon was excellent the chris messina as david faulk was the other standout great choice to never show jordan that would have made it felt way more fake the posters in the office were awesome and overall this was a great nostalgia movie music budget must have been crazy as a native oregonian who grew up around a lot of nike people i didn t buy affleck for a second the outfits were awesome the accent was terrible he just did not act like phil knight and there were parts of the movie where they re doing their best wolf of wall street impression even though nobody at nike would use half as many fucks as they did bateman acted much more like a nike person
just saw this with a girl i m dating who isn t a sports fan and we both absolutely loved it the acting writing pacing and the chemistry between affleck and damon were top tier you can tell they are clearly longtime friends irl there s just something about jordan s legacy that strikes hard no matter who you are
know nothing about basketball and little to nothing about nike and mj for that matter but walked out wanting to read up a whole lot more found the film surprisingly super interesting in knowing how air jordan came to be
the scene where damon is pitching jordan his future cut with clips of his actual future mwah affleck proving live by night was a fluke it was absolutely a big commercial but hey sometimes commercials are made by amazing directors
just left the theater this is my lowkey sleeper hit if more people saw it thought it was going to a small crowd but my showtime had people i haven t followed basketball since jordan retired from the nba the first time i was pleasantly surprised how much i enjoyed this movie the damon affleck duo is usually great some funny moments throughout the film especially the damon messina phone interactions tucker knocked it out the park with his limited screentime was sad knowing what laid ahead for jordan s future but what crashes down must fly back up
didn t love this one as most i guess the characters were one dimensional and the ultimate goal of a billion dollar corporation getting richer wasn t that compelling all the actors were great though and affleck is a good director it s entertaining enough to hide how shallow it actually is i didn t hate it but it felt meaningless and emotionally empty the little bit at the end where viola davis fights to get the revenue sharing deal felt extremely forced and tacked on like they realized at the end they had a shallow movie about s executives getting rich and needed something to ground it with it would have been interesting if this was the conflict of the whole third act instead of a minor issue resolved in minutes but the movie isn t really about jordan or his parents even so it all just felt weird again not bad but you re really just going to watch damon affleck and bateman ham it up as characters who would probably be unlikable if they had any depth at all
i kind of was hoping for a reveal deep fake of mj at some point it got weird at some point that they were purposefully not showing his face
number one question for who have watched this movie since this is a movie about a shoe brand any feet shots
this cleared a low bar to become my favorite movie that i ve seen in theaters this year but as with other affleck movies i think that people are giving it too much credit the dialog and characters in this feel incredibly inauthentic and the movie ends with text that lionizes the extremely wealthy and might as well just read rich people are the real heroes damon s performance is so familiar i felt like i d already seen it before affleck didn t seem like he was even really trying to look like or mimic phil knight nevertheless although it doesn t have a lot of replay value i enjoyed seeing it once
i saw a sneak preview on saturday it was good they surely hammed it up for a couple of scenes not gonna spoil those scenes and put a lot of cheese on there but it s still fun and entertaining it served its purpose i liked bateman the most his performance was as nuanced as you could get in this type of movie the rest for the most part at one point or another had some over the top deliveries i loved seeing the cars the fashion 80s computers etc it provided a nice window to look back since i was a baby back then they sure as hell weren t kind to converse and much less adidas but i still stand by their tracksuits haha jordan shoes will be selling like pancakes it certainly made me look up rookie jordan videos
to me the first act i found very uninteresting i was struggling to get into the movie and i just kept waiting for it to pick up but once i got into the movie i really got into it i wasn t expecting this movie to be as funny as it was from chris tucker to the ceo of nike to the shitshow of a meeting i enjoyed all of it the one thing i will note is that it never felt like a very emotional movie i never felt very intrigued by it it was enough to keep my attention and not drag along it really felt like i was watching a documentary i think the extent of the gambling addiction wasn t touched on enough i couldn t tell if he was broke from it or just some sort of hobbyist they kinda left it quiet for the sake of playing it safe i liked the way they deified michael jordan you can feel a huge on screen presence when he s the focus when he doesn t really have any lines and we never even see his face overall it was a movie that was a commercial i d give it like a or it felt a bit too corporate for me i could never really feel good about a company making millions off of a shoe that s made in sweatshops which is hypocritical of me to say as i live in modern society but it is how i feel i also don t like how it frames jordan as a hero for making billions of dollars it kinda felt like the theme was rich people are pretty cool i want to add on that i am not the intended audience of this movie a zoomer who doesn t care about the nba or shoes it just ain t for me and that s fine
i seriously loved this movie big bulls fan but i was born in so except for some wizards stuff i have the greatest fomo of all time that i didn t get to watch jordan this movie honestly pissed me off a little because it captured his magical aura that i didn t even experience firsthand so insanely well it amplified that fomo i simply have to see this movie in theaters again i loved all the plotlines in this one i loved how 80s it was and every joke hit in my opinion the absolute climax of the movie is matt damon s speech predicting a future we all knew would come to pass i was balling my eyes out scrambling to find the nearest time machine so i could experience the legend first hand the point that mj doesn t need the shoes but we need mj to wear the shoes so we have some greatness we can look to for inspiration in our lives man that just knocked it out of the park it s one of those speeches that just makes you want to do push ups in the theater to instantly better yourself it was everything i was looking for and more instant recommend and instant classic for sports fans
great storyline and acting but i would expect a movie with a rating on rotten tomatoes to at least show the face of the guy the fucking movie is about
went to see this really rooting for ben affleck to hit with me with another banger movie pretty disappointed i must say wasn t expecting the town or anything but found it to be a bit of a nothing film performances were fine but it was all so slight in terms of story and stakes and character development also the impassioned speech predicting jordan s future was pretty cringe inducing in my opinion the contrast between the real life situation and movie dramatization never felt more apparent suprised to see it getting such rave reviews love me some ben and some matt and am always happy for their success but was really taken aback by what a non story this was competently made for sure and won t shit on anyone who loved it it just felt it was like a hard seltzer of a movie a faint taste of an actual film but too slight to impact the tastebuds like the real thing would downvote me into oblivion as you will falk you
i m in the uk and with the exception of a period in the 90s early 00s space jam then i doubt most people would even recognise michael jordan here which makes the decision not to really show him just a bit odd from a non american perspective but i recognise he is an almost godly figure in that part of the world it s a bit of an odd thing to make a movie about but it s credit to affleck that it s actually a really engaging movie because of the characters who provide a lot of laughs and are very likeable the soundtrack is great the whole 80s setting is very easy to enjoy it s well worth a watch
do they talk about sweatshops and child labor at all or is this one bit capitalist fantasy
it was weird how much i recognized phil knight from a cursory memory of what his son the director travis knight who heads laika studios as well looks like despite it being ben affleck who was representing him and me not knowing what the ceo of nike looked like back then hard to explain but do you feel me
i enjoy docudramas and this movie provided the back story i needed
this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in theaters and this is coming from someone who goes into every film with an open mind it could have easily been minutes the whole time watching it i thought to myself why was this film even made a movie about michael jordan s life would have been better
deleted
it s amazing that a movie from a great director starring a great actor about a pop culture icon and his brand is getting such great reviews reddit collectively shit on this movie since the first trailer its a two hour advertisement its about a big corporation
this movie was filled with amazing acting but the performance of viola davis stood out for me she s more or less playing her typecast but she really steals the show in every scene she s in wouldn t be surprised if we see her nominated for a supporting actress award
was trying to work out where i recognised the shoe designer from then i realised he was wade in gta
and i am still waiting for it to be on amazon prime like there is not much to be watched so hopefully i am paying for it just to see air the sooner the better
i thought this was extremely propulsive fun and quite engaging one of my favorite movies of so far dadcore is back
is this a documentary about the second best french electronic band
i watched a media screening for the film and it honestly is a good film but better ad it s surprisingly funny has a couple of great moments from the cast and ends relatively well but for me it felt like a massive ad by the end almost like you were tricked into watching a nike ad a bit slimy dunno if most people will have that reaction but its the feeling it leitor me with at the end particularly because of damon s speech it does work as an ad though i never in my life wanted a nike air jordan but now i keep thinking about it xd
love chris messina s motivational rant
good movie understood they were trying to capture the rock star essence of jordan and the bulls but the dennis rodman threesome scene was a little unnecessary imo
curious how it handles jordan s father
the most interesting bit during the preview was the black audience s reaction to the mom asking for the percentage of the sale lots of reaction there for a good period of time to what is mostly a small dramatic film dedinitely made the preview showing worth it to see in theaters
does this movie have an mj lenderman needle drop or not
i thought this was a fine well made movie but i just didn t care about any of it i m not a basketball or sneaker fan and michael jordan is an asshole so i just couldn t force myself to get invested not bad at all just not my cup of tea
another day another movie r movies thought that would suck and bomb wonder where all the people said this movie would suck and who would want to watch a movie about a shoe lol excited to see this
what this is a micheal jordan movie
i really enjoyed this movie it s a solidly well made film with some really good performances especially from matt damon and viola davis and an engaging script with a lot of fun dialogue it s a bit of a throwback to the adult dramas they used to make in the 90s it s doesn t break any new ground but it s so smartly and competently written and directed that you re able to enjoy the ride even if it s ultimately very predictable i hope this does well in the theaters because i miss these kind of mid budget movies that used to be a staple of my childhood but now seem like a lost cause for most studios affleck again is proving himself to be a talented filmmaker and know how to hit the right notes i ve been impressed by his work as a director and l m looking forward to seeing him behind the camera a lot more
surprised people like it so much i enjoyed it but didn t think it was great the soundtrack seemed tacked on and didn t fit the mood good 80s songs for sure but they didn t fit too many quips and a pretty standard underdog trajectory no need to avoid but not a must see but any means
ben affleck gave us an all star directed film giving jordan the wizard kelly treatment was smart
damn this was good didn t know what to expect from ben affleck but this was absolutely gripping from start to finish very solid film with humor that was actually funny and a few touching heartfelt moments probably the best film i ve seen in the theater in a few months matt damon was spectacular but something about ben affleck s character was also very intriguing but of course spectacular performance from the whole cast
this is a little embarrassing but throughout the whole movie i thought mark wahlberg was the actor playing rob
while i didn t love the movie i will say there was a clear best part chris tucker he was only in it a little and he mostly played himself hah
i understand why this movie would be highly fictionalized and leave a lot of information about these people out but i do recommend watching the for documentary sole man because air might as well just be fiction
the return of my favorite actor chris tucker man he didn t disappoint
i really appreciated how they actually said bye to each other at the end of phone calls rarely happens in movies and it s one of my pet peeves
if i dislike phil knight but like basketball will i enjoy this movie
i normally think chris messina is good and he shows range in this but i felt he was overacting trying too hard i can see ppl enjoying his character though
it was nice getting to see chris tucker in a movie again

that quote is frequently attributed to pliney the elder who is said to have exclaimed it in ad before setting sail to the eruption of mt vesuvius where he proceeded to succumb to toxic gases and die along with much of pompeii i guess if you viewed cryto as an impending catastrophe that will mercilessly swallow those who dive in it is an apt quote to use
i m not a basketball fan at all and i m giving this movie a i was thinking a but honestly there s nothing that could have made it better than it was for me
that charles barkley line was great big ole women in san antonio
disagree
i went into an early screening for this having seen a poster and vaguely knowing it s about air jordans but nothing else really didn t expect this to be a funny movie especially not in a wqy we don t really get that often these days the characters aren t telling jokes for the audience or even to each other they re just naturally funny really refreshing to have an unexpected good laugh in the cinema again
my theater enjoyed that scene too the dialogue felt like the actual kind of conversation that would have happened in this context and it just kept going and getting better i always love moments like that where the entire theater gets to laugh together
a trail blazer for everyone except the trailblazers
yes but will you be damned
you only thing u missed talking about is that this is one of the best viola davis roles knowing that michael jordan basically requested that she play his mother she really does channel the energy and smarts of delores jordan she is to me the soul of the movie is she playing her typecast yes but sometimes thats ok she s our modern version of denzel in that she can just play herself and it adds to nearly every movie she s in just an all around great sports flick
i gotta ask and i mean no disrespect but has there ever been a movie you haven t been able to see upon making a discussion post hell i didn t even know air was out today

the strangers and they shot that franchise in the face and ruined it
murder mystery
sicario
sin city and were not only unnecessary but came out when the iron was ice cold
i mean how was the hangover not on that list
virtually all of them for some movies it s very natural to continue the story ie terminator and others have sequels because the story is so big or the books already exist ie lotr but the vast majority of sequels are just money grabs and almost always fall flat
majority of them no exaggeration majority of sequels are unnecessary and that s why they never live up to the original the ones that do like t2 aliens toy story empire strikes back the dark knight the godfather pt top gun maverick it s because the original story did such a great job establishing the world that the second film can skip the exposition stuff and hop right into the action they usually are very rich worlds built by incredible creators and visionaries and the sequels that do not work are almost always made by new creators who do not explore the depths of the material the way they deserve to be

toy story is a awesome idk what you re talking about the movie i pick that absolutely did not need a sequel is anchor man it didn t need to happen it was stone cold awful

what movie needs a sequel lol
blade runner
the matrix
blade runner the story was an incredible beloved stand alone with no real loose threads villeneuve managed to make a sequel that was in my opinion as great a story as the original capturing exceptional performances from everyone and even somehow managed to replicate the poor box office and cult following my sole complaint is jared leto because i really don t enjoy him but it was originally meant to be david bowie before he passed away so i try to imagine that whenever i think about the film edit misspelled story
this is kind of cheating since it s not one sequel but several the original star wars trilogy the prequels failed in every way of telling the backstory to the original trilogy and the sequels ruined everything our heroes accomplished in the ot
joker lol
scary movie the first had a lot of funny moments but then it just went downhill and became very dumb humor and they tried making a lot of other spoof movies that failed as well with all of them they advertised that it was from the makers of scary movie or one or two of the people that made scary movie like it was their main selling point because it was the only movie that really worked for them
father of the bride itself a remake of a film from with spencer tracy and elizabeth taylor the sequel wasn t _absolutely needed_ but the sequel was enjoyable to fans of the first film and the first film did have a rushed sequel of the daughter having a baby so the updated sequel was more entertaining and fresh for sure i suppose it s hard for me to see any reason to remake a film that isn t even years old yet as at least the _father of the bride_ film was years old and not generally accessible at all not even by video rental services when it went to theatres and then home vhs cassettes then dvds etc alas i still feel the remake wasn t as necessary because it s a lot easier to access and watch the and films than a black white film and sequel from and but _the hollywood reporter_ revealed on february that remakes of several films were in development basicallt only for the purpose of being exclusive content for the walt disney company s streaming service disney with one of those projects named in the announcement as _father of the bride_ intentionally involving a latino family the remake just seems like a cash grab to attract viewers who are going to end up seeing it instead of an already very accessible and very understandable film steve martin even uses a mobile phone in the film so it s not unintelligible to audiences of today who could have been guided into seeing it
predator that said it s not that different from alien and that had a great sequel less opportunity for world building with predator though which is probably why aliens works
trainspotting
toy story was a necessary story to tell with the fundamental metaphor of each movie being parenthood through the lens of toys woody lacked any substantive resolution he goes from one family to another but that happy ending is unfinished that kid will grow up too as all kids do provides him with a real empty nest narrative and forces him to face a life without children and ask a challenging question who are you without your kids you can argue that the film didn t work for you but i think the story itself was a very necessary step to give woody closure
the big lebowski
avengers
the exorcist is a complete actually beautiful story with stunning visuals nothing would surpass or equal that make a new movie with an original take on this subject
nothing needs a sequel but the toy story slander bugs me i agree toy story has a good ending but toy story also had a good ending and it added so much more to the story i think there s way better examples of films that didn t need sequels then toy story that movie is good and i ll always defend it
have you followed cinema the past years about of the movies that came out
more than not needing a sequel it s how you make a bad and a good sequel for eg fast and furious technically did not need a sequel it was a story based from an article in a magazine in late 90s it should have been like any action movie a one off story and over movie did a decent business that s it but see where we are in thank for the movie gods to give us some quality atrocious over the top shit not on the other end we have pirates of caribbean amazing world building was possible amazing stories could have been told but each movies got only worse and worse

okay it wasn t needed or necessary but i like it the hustler and then the color of money the first is a classic but the 2nd isn t bad at all it is still scorsese after all it isn t necessary and i don t like it as well as the hustler but it s okay
war games
the descent hellraiser
in hindsight the matrix
pacific rim in theory there was room for a sequel but they way uprising went about it was so horrendously wrong not only by killing off all of the first ones main cast in incredibly stupid ways for no purpose the reason why the first ones action felt so good was specifically because the jgers kaijus both moved in a way that had a real feeling of their weight and size to it and then uprising ruined that too

breaking news thomas harris arrested for eating family of four after buying a nice chanti
what s the story
seriously especially for movies like this it goes beyond separate the art from the artist dude was shouting to the world he s a creepo pervert see also tiger lily and film critics just fawn over how brilliant he is needs to be cast aside and forgotten also annie hall was a stupid movie
fake news it was actually for detonating a blimp above the super bowl
basically that he didn t like the story or how it turned out and that if the studio would hold on to the film and not release it he d write film and edit a film from his own pocket to make up for it generally speaking he s incredibly critical of his own work and doesn t think that he s made a single great film
he s made a lot of good movies that s why critics like him
his entire oeuvre basically screams yea i m guilty of fucking children
off topic but true _black sunday _ was a collaboration among harris and two other journalists at ap new york where he worked on the night desk at the time they split the proceeds
honestly i don t get jt i don t think i ve ever liked one of his films as a jew the whole neurotic jew schtick drives me fucking crazy and is super obnoxious
i think he should have gotten an oscar nom for to yuma the whole time i watched that movie in theaters i was like who is this guy so good
ben foster is definitely one of the best supporting actors out there if you havent check out lone survivor hell or high water to yuma pandorum hostiles leave no trace
for a second i thought i was in a football subreddit and the post was about the goalkeeper ben foster the new goalkeeper for wrexham afc ryan reynolds and rob mcelhenney team
ben foster has been a favorite of mine i love that guy
hostage was a wild movie starring bruce willis and ben fosters character as an unhinged captor is great extremely unsettling and a great role for the first movie i saw him in
i ve loved this dude since the early s he s been killing it for decades definitely someone who deserves to be much bigger than they are get over it hostage the messenger to yuma alpha dog pandorum the punisher ain t them bodies saints hell or high water hostiles galveston leave no trace and those are just the ones i can think of off the top of my head what a filmography
first role i saw him in was punisher he was great but never thought he d be different than that geeky character boy was i wrong he s a chameleon underrated in my opinion
he kinda stole the show in hell or high water
dang not one mention of flash forward
i loved him in pandorum and he was also awesome in days of night considering how little screen time he had in it
he was great in hostage
i have enjoyed him in almost every movie i have seen him in from hell or high water to to yuma the only movie i didn t like him in was contraband but that movie was a hot mess so that could also be a factor
pandorum is great
i remember him from freaks and geeks turned out pretty well hell or high water is a fabulous movie
he and kelsey grammer seemed to be the only ones who enjoyed themselves making x men
ummm hostage anyone captain wubbuh
big trouble he plays tim allen s son fun little movie with a great cast before he started all these great grown up roles
alright ben i m rooting for you you rocked in alpha dog even mechanic
he should have been nominated for leave no trace
hostage
i really liked him in get over it
hostage is one of my favourite movies idk why but hes amazing as the villain in it
do you know what that makes me a comanche he is pure gold in hell or high water
he was also in the first episodes of season of my name is earl
dude can act first noticed him in alpha dog
go back and watch him in liberty heights the scene where he plays this jewish kid that comes down the stairs to his mother on halloween as hitler is hilarious
fucking love ben foster for some reason when he is the main star the movie doesn t do too hot but i m always first to line up guy hasn t let me down since big trouble hell i ll even say get over it
adding the survivor and the mechanic
i love him in get over it i just love that film though
i love ben foster s work and i m surprised no one mentioned the survivor it s on hbo and it s based on a true story he plays a jewish prisoner in aushwitz during world war ii and they force him to participate in gladiatorial boxing with his fellow prisoners i really liked it and ben foster of course was fantastic just saying haha
i d love to see him in more lead roles him and barry pepper are two of my favorite actors to see pop up although i don t see much of barry pepper anymore
galveston is a recent one that more people need to see
foster is spectacular
check out hostage very underrated movie he plays such a good villian in many roles including this one also really liked his lance armstrong movie
ben foster might be the most under rated actor in hollywood i just watched days of night the other day he s amazing in everything he does
he s one of those names that if you see it anywhere in the credits you go yes
love ben to me he s sort of a young brad dourif to just about any role he brings that very recognizable and intense uniqueness that i feel both of them possess ben steals pretty much every movie he s in
his performance was genuinely frightening in alpha dog phenomenal actor
he was bloody good in pandorum and leave no trace you should check them out
i don t really care much about ben foster one way or the other he s not bad but imho not great either that said get over it from is one of my not so guilty pleasures when i want some wacky teen comedy type crap
it s really strange how he didn t become a gigantic star
love him in alpha dog
he s an amazing actor even when he was younger he can go from mad scary to scared and terrified to stoic and badass he doesn t get much attention he deserves to be a lead in more movies also you should watch his comedies
yeah dude always brings it in pretty much everything i ve seen him in
he has a good mug for the radio not easy to look at but as an actor it s almost like he doesn t even need to try
hi there i m conducting a screener survey as part of a passion project that involves designing a platform to help users decide on what movie or television show to watch based on their friends or social connections would you be willing to participate and share your thoughts the survey consists of questions and should only take around minutes to complete thank you for considering https://forms.gle/a9nolg4sgjqkelpva
he s so good he makes every movie better he even made an adam sandler movie better that basketball movie the hustle or whatever and he was the villain in that antagonist at least
ika
i thought this was announcement of a new movie with ben foster in which he plays a character names fun to watch i feel swindled please learn your capitalisations
i m glad he came out of retirement for the end of the season rooting for wrexham to get automatic promotion this year
listen i have no issue with ben foster and really enjoy him in a lot of movies but i do not think medieval was a good example of him making something much better i kind of laughed out loud at that final speech he gives
ehh he was good but he was always in the shadow of van der sar and de gea he didn t have that ruthless winning mentality that fergie wanted in his players
i always enjoy his performances but i can t help think of norm macdonald screaming box office poison whenever i see his name
great in six feet under
we re going to contention
definitely i first really became aware of him from pandorum and then day of night
i was on a modern western unforgiven and the ones that came out after it spree last week and i watched for the first time to yuma and he was great but i also watched tombstone also for the first time and oh man val kilmer
you boys some sorta posse
i agree when you can steal scenes away from russell crowe and christian bale you ve done something pretty amazing you guys should check out galveston he is absolutely amazing in that
alpha dog he was crazy good in that
the messenger is another great one also days of night
seen them all and love them all pandorum is a great one that not a lot of people have seen i don t think
loved him ever since flash forward
hell or high plus lone survivor alone make me love him pandorum was just soooo fun when i watched it so messed up
deleted
wait he was in lone survivor edit also warcraft decent movie
i haven t seen pandorum or leave no trace but the other four are fantastic and i remember ben in all of them
big trouble he was hilarious as the moody teenager
to be fair he is great to watch too
that was the first time i saw him and i remember being just floored by his performance he stole every scene he was in
he was terrifying as mars when i was younger
i forgot he was in that
oh shit i totally forgot about alpha dog
two of my favorites of his as well
lol yes it was
yeah i remember that movie but forgot he was in it or didn t know him at the time when i saw it
i remember watching this in theaters in middle school i loved it i re watched it a few months ago it holds up very well love it and him
i didn t know that i need to watch that show
yeah i haven t been in the proper mind frame to watch a movie like that recently movies about that time and place tend to be some depressing shit
yeah i like him as well
both were great i haven t watched hostage in a long time
yeah i liked that smaller role but he was great
honestly i fell asleep with minutes left mostly from being tired but i hard time even following that movie had to look up what the story was based on action scenes were good though and i liked the silent but deadly warrior he was going for but yes i wouldn t list this one normally speaking about his career just needed something new to watch last night
what role does he play it that i watched that when it first came out so other than the couple leads i don t remember who else was it it would be fun to go back and rewatch
he was so good in days of night not a big character but played very well reminds me of how good sam rockwell is in the green mile
i m your huckleberry
for a really modern western with ben foster definitely check out hell or high water whole damn movie is great
his performance in alpha dog gave me crazy anxiety completely unhinged and unpredictable
he was awesomely unhinged in that reminded me a lot of ed norton in american history x
got to watch the messenger pine and him have great chemistry in hell or high water so i imagine that s the case in the messenger
probably my favorite movie of his
i rented it on a whim from red box and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was i thought the twist was well done too
fuck yes thank you i forgot about that old disney show as far as child actors go he s nailing it as an adult
what a great show
i would recommend watching hostiles he plays an antagonist in the film it s not a big role but he kills it i ll have to check out hostage
yep he plays matthew axelson he s a badass in the film
gotta mention warcraft ben foster s performance outshines the whole movie
he was the guy that took out the most people while badly injured
leave no trace is the best of them all imo definitely check it out
yeah love his matchday vlogs
i d like to see them play brothers who were both former kid stars who are now hot messes in a raucous road trip movie with lots of gratuitous nudity
they are sworn mortal enemies
i would love to see a comedy where they swap identities but nobody notices
the best we get for now is paul dano and daniel radcliffe together in swiss army man there was that little joke about elijah playing daniel in a film or wherever haha
they run a hot dog on a stick in a dead mall and their only customer everyday is tobey macguire
radcliffe is much more than that wood doesn t have as much depth to his acting radcliffe can be funny or dark he can be serious he can be another person wood just does wood like nick cage he s just the person in a different role never really different
did you think of that prompt on an ayahuasca ceremony cause damn was that detailed
black swan remake
caramel by the sea robinson jeffers rolling in his stony cairn rn
i need this movie in my life
give me
radcliffe wood
sworn mortal enemies to lovers
want
i thought wood was pretty good in maniac
no just neurotic
right
i like him i don t think he a bad he s just himself in a lot of roles it s his style
i can t lie i forgot all about aquaman
remember when rob mcelhenney was at one point attached to direct the minecraft movie i would ve loved to watch that version
i was really hoping the wise guys was a sequel to the nice guys that d be so fun
in case anyone wants the dates but are too lazy to click aquaman december the color purple december the wise guys february minecraft april an unnamed movie for december
the sequel to such a massive hit really gonna take half a decade to come out
rumor is that the movie has been botched one of the main plot lines has apparently been completely cut out
i actually really enjoyed aquaman reminded me of a lot of the high concept over the top sci fi fantasy films released in the s which were a lot of fun why you guys gotta hate dumb fun so much
so right now wb is releasing wonka dec aquaman dec and now the color purple dec movies within a day period seems like uhh a lot
at this point they might as well release the batgirl film for all anyone cares about this aquaman dreck
wow they really saved this movie with the date change gone with the wind s inflation adjusted box office record better watch out
d c have got to stop trying to make marvel movies
does it still have amber heard in it
i have a feeling it will be terrible
they should have put michael keaton s batman in it literally the only reason i have interest in the flash movie
i can t lie i thought it came out already
i thought the second one already came out lol
i thought the last aquaman was aquaman
considering all the research he did to make mythic quest accurate to current video game production culture it sure all hell would have been interesting
steve hangs dong
that was so random
there was a confirmed title from shane black for his planned sequel called the nice guys mexico detectives
same whole reason i clicked actually
oh i thought color purple was a straight adaptation not a musical i ll check it out spielberg s version was so beautiful but looking forward to seeing the story again since the novel is amazing
been waiting for the last one for years now so i m excited af
yeah they should just be churning these things out like butter
the last star wars movie was it ll be at least years from that where we get a new movie and that s an entire franchise aquaman is just one character
combination of covid a busy lead actor and a second lead with serious legal and pr issues will do that to you
lots of rumors and hearsay in this comment section
i m so glad someone else actually enjoyed aquaman i thought i was the only one that movie wasn t that bad
black manta saved the whole movie
judging by d ds reception people love dumb fun i think folks don t care for dc movies is the issue
because there s too much of it
just few online communities the movie had 5x legs despite the heavy competition that too for the same target demography that s not a fluke the wom among general public was good you want people riding sea monsters and fighting with laser attached sharks and treasure hunt adventure the movie delivers it it did extremely well in international markets too
aquaman is the nickelback of movie franchises publicly everyone hates it but it still grosses over a billion
i wish they d shelve aquaman and the flash for the tax breaks both look terrible and have too much baggage attached
some test screenings said it was very boring
hopefully it s good aquaman was fun
that show is amazing like everyone is talking only about ted lasso but this pure fun accurate and really good pointed jokes i hope this show will stick with us way longer than lasso
rob s version have seconds dedicated solely to the dong shot
not if you re a true fan it isn t
ahhh it would have been funnier if they did filipino detectives haha
no years is ridiculous though but tbf dc has been on fire for a very long time
tbf though the last few star wars movies have not been particularly well received and finished telling an enclosed story with rey i guess you would have thought they d have done more spin offs but they seem to be pushing those to series aquaman should have been a slam dunk green light after how successful was and is really the only dc property people were actually excited about instead they ve put out crap like black adam no one was asking for
do we need more star wars they ve done the skywalker saga of trilogies the original trilogy prequel and sequel i don t know if it s good for the franchise that there s an expectation of a star wars movie every years
objection hearsay
the spectacular box office legs and the insane b suggest most poeple loved it legs indicate strong word of mouth
i didn t think it was bad at all haha sometimes you just want to see an octopus rock a drum kit
there is a huge difference between aquaman and d d writing is important to the quality of films
i feel like i m in the twilight zone wasn t aquaman well received it made billion dollars after being shitted on for a year before it came out
and yet i seem to enjoy the dc movies more than the mcu these days at least they try to do different things even though it doesn t always work out i am also aware i m in the minority there
too much checks notes fun
just put jason momoa in it and people will drool
there s good buzz for the flash brewing
i ve seen some say it is a candidate for the worst dceu movie yet that s saying something
to be honest i thought the first one was ridiculously boring i was actually hoping a sequel would improve on it but now that everything is going in the bin idk why i would care what the sequel does
that show is amazing it s truly great the jokes are on point and the characters emotionally complex with complex relationships my partner was saying she couldn t tell if ian and poppy hate or like each other turns out they are both narcissists and that s their friendship dynamic
a pixelated shovel hanging in the wind i never played minecraft but that is what i think might have happened
why
pandemic delay this movie is vfx heavy then wb prioritised flash for summer most importantly it is like the biggest ip among the xmas releases if i am not wrong reddit complain about the quality of the first movie but it had phenomenal legs despite the heavy competition world wide the sequel has more breathing space and 700million is sort of its floor
legs indicate strong word of mouth unlike old johnny tightlips
i was hooked from the moment nicole kidman throws a trident at an episode of stingray https://youtube.com/watch?v=45ntexv7dzs)
as someone who absolutely hates aquaman to the point of being angry i spent money to see it in cinemas the octopus playing the drums was the one good bit that and the tiny subplot about his parents
d d has a good villain that you hate charming lead a story that was fun and characters you care about
true but dc films seem to be awful at it writing
i think most are pretty eager to see the snyderverse gone already though its hard to keep people invested when they know this is all gonna be gone in a year or two and replaced with the new dc which is making really big promises
i feel the same way anytime the aquaman movie is discussed it was well received but the reddit zeitgeist really likes to shit on it even before the snyderverse was announced dead in the water the movie was a fun swashbuckling adventure with a unique spectacle to it compared to other superhero movies i d compare it to thor ragnarok but with way less tone deaf quips
it s the fast and furious of cbm films alongside venom charismatic lead cool action scenes box office success regardless of the low quality of the film itself there s a reason why it s barely above ww when it comes to the lowest rated dcu films
too much fun soon turns to misery you need balance
there was good buzz for all these shitty snyderverse movies
i still defend man of steel to this day mostly worth watching for michael shannon hamming it up as zod lol
i didn t like the first one either but boring there were way too many random explosions for me to ever fall asleep
at the end of the first one ryan gosling s character shows russell crowe s character their ad and there s drawings of them and he says to him sorry you look filipino so yeah a bit of a stretch but a funny inside joke in my opinion
wow i watched the first seasons and i have zero memory of that character lol
d d got me sad over michelle rodriguez that s a feat itself alone
but the thing is that the negative reaction to aquaman on reddit happened way before gunn announced his plans
its hard to keep people invested when they know this is all gonna be gone in a year or two i m not sure if you re into comics and superhero s but them playing with timelines is normal just like they are bringing keaton back they can bring any of these people back in the future so yes people are still invested
i think they said some dc characters and actors are staying in the new dc i think momoa may be one of them
yeah both of those films have a audience rating so if those are some of the lowest of the universe i don t understand what people are talking about in this thread
i feel like there s never bad buzz from screenings of these tent pole films because the screening audiences are just happy to be invited
i defend mos too it s quite literally the only movie we ve ever gotten where we can see two actual super powered beings going all out it sl like that action anime we all wished could be adapted to the big screen but never truly happens not the mcu superheroes with their small baby fights in an airfield or indoors even in avengers they just fought on some puny island
cavill is a good superman zod is great its got a fucking amazing score too
same here he really elevated that film plus he dropped the best line in all of the dceu imo
it honestly get s better with time for me there just aren t any superhero movies made like this
i know it worked for other people but i wasn t entertained by it at all and my gf at the time actually fell asleep
i m not as big a fan of this movie as i thought i was damn
i actually read comics all the time and those resets are almost never appreciated by the reader base unless it was one the heels of a bad run with aquaman your asking people to care about a movie set in a universe that s already a completley failed franchise that won t be returning so ultimately people are gonna be like who gives a shit wait a year for when gunn resets the franchise and hopfully better this time
bad news about comic sales
yeah both of those films have a audience rating so if those are some of the lowest of the universe i don t understand what people are talking about in this thread shazam has audience score black adam has i was talking about critic score critics loathed ww1984 ba shazam and aquaman
i can sorta understand why a dozen 11s in the final battle wasn t everyone s cup of tea but also i mean that s pretty much what an actual superman vs zod battle would be it s meant to be unnerving the opening scene in bvs only reaffirms that point that shit would be terrifying as a random bystander batfleck is like holy shit what the fuck is that
justice league was comical in that literally everyone is useless to the point where superman solves all of their problems single handedly he s faster than the flash at evacuating civilians and effortlessly overpowers steppenwolf who for the entirety of the movie is shown to be able to casually wreck aquaman and diana i was expecting something like with zod but no
it sl like that action anime we all wished could be adapted to the big screen but never truly happens zach snyder has spoken about how the action sequences were inspired by anime specifically birdy https://youtu.be/qzjbnhlodku
yeah and in man of steel two super powered beings somehow contained their fight to only two places on the entirety of earth
the best comparison i can think of is why people avoided dark phoenix in theaters apart from the fox x men series being very inconsistent there was little reason to care since disney had just purchased fox and was only releasing the movie out of obligation
with aquaman your asking people to care about a movie set in a universe that s already a completley failed franchise there are no after credit scenes in these films each stands on its own merit when i watch aquaman i m not looking to see how they attach it to all the films i personally thought the first was cool and i m interested in seeing more of the world they built i guess we ll see if it crosses a billion like the last one have you seen it that last battle scene was epic
i didn t think was bad so those are just even better what s the problem
i see no prob with that superman is meant to be overpowered after all would you rather they nerf down superman to be weak as heck just for the sake of it then you d be having the same problem with the mcu extremely dumbed down villians and pathetic superheroes like hulk being 100x weaker than his comic counterpart
mfs fought at a waffle house
just like in the comics that argument doesn t hold any fucking water
i mean yes superman is supposed to be formidable but the film lost nearly all of its stakes once he came back if steppenwolf was as tough as zod there could have been a cool fight but instead we get an anticlimactic whimper

i was just watching judgement at nuremberg and was really impressed with framing and slow deliberate camera movement the introduction of rudolph petersen and how small and isolated he looks for example https://youtu.be/_t_gb1qllko). it s a hour courtroom drama that i m watching in two sittings it just does so much with what little it has it s actors in suits delivering monologues in front of a camera but even that can be exiting when done this well
various kurosawa films seven samurai rashomon throne of blood etc etc psycho the thin man kinda cheating but good night and good luck cheating in that it was shot in color and corrected to b w in post but the cinematography is very nice regardless
young frankenstein
if you want a comedy arsenic and old lace it s got cary grant and peter lorre charade is also something of a comedy with grant and audrey hepburn
angry men it s all shot in one room for the most part but the use of lighting and shadow is some of the best of all time also pay particular attention to the use of high angle shots in the beginning slowly shifting over to low angle shots throughout the course of the film such a subtle way of conveying the dynamics of who has control over the room without saying a word about it as mr plinkett would say you didn t notice it but your brain did

a hard day s night holds up really well even if you re not a massive beatles fan it s so funny and quirky and full of energy and two of the very best romantic comedies ever made are the philadelphia story and the apartment which was definitely an inspiration for mad men if you like that show

thanks for the suggestion
yes and soon the movie might be complete shit but it will be a movie
yes
considering this is the worst the tech will ever be it got me wondering if and when it will get to the point that we can prompt out an entire pixar quality movie and have it make it for us relatively quickly or if we can just input a script in prompted or not and it can just animate the entire script for us sure i m high and this just kind of blew my mind that this might realistically be possible some day you might live long enough to act in one of them that plays in some kind of veldt style occulus nightmare
stupid people will pay to see these movies and it will be the start of the total enshittification of the culture
depends what you mean by pixar quality ai will likely be able to generate animation and a script but it s unlikely to have the emotional depth of pixar s best movies
so this will happen imagine training a model on the first six seasons of game of thrones then with plugins from blender unreal unity etc etc etc ask it to generate more seasons a part epic finale obviously output it as a mkv with audio duh a future model will be able to do this faster than you can make coffee and it would be great no doubt great this ability is years out not in an anecdotal way but generating content of higher quality than the human directors can
art video games movies books stories poems business plans study plans speeches eulogies etc you name it ai will create it someday probably very soon we are on an exponential curve growth technology but we don t think in exponential terms so most of us don t see it coming there are no signs just a snap and we re there
and it would be great no doubt great after reading through a lot of sharegpt i think it d probably be pure shit
i got my first experience with chat gpt last week at my buddy s house and it blew my mind i told it to generate a whole season arc of a game of thrones like show but starring frogs and it popped that shit out in seconds and it was good way better than a frog game of thrones ever had the right to be lol king ribbitton wasn t messing around
not next year yea i am sure if you tried this now it would be bad lol but in several years this will be reality and i m sure it won t be chatgpt
got is just an example you could just as easily ask a future model to make more episodes of m a s h
eh if we don t make this type of ai illegal maybe
the searchers true grit both versions are good but i prefer the remake the dollars trilogy the quick and the dead
open range unforgiven the ballad of buster sruggs and the outlaw joesy wales are some of my favorites
tombstone is a must see the cowboys is a great movie tom selleck in monte walsh to yuma
magnificent seven both versions are ok i prefer the older one my name is nobody a dumb and funny classic butch cassidy and the sundance kid redford and newman in top form pat garrett and billy the kid rustler s rhapsody comedy poking fun at western movies
some great ones not mentioned already stagecoach rio bravo the wild bunch the man who shot liberty valance django film hud mccabe and mrs miller dollars trilogy
sergio leone stuff dollars trilogy and once upon a time in the west sergio corbucci stuff django the great silence the mercenary other spaghetti westerns i ve enjoyed the big gundown they call me trinity dead man very different post modern western with an awesome score by neil young slow west my favorite western of the last years
lonesome dove
both shane and the searchers are two great westerns to start off with both from the 50s with no gore and beautiful scenery moving it up a notch i d try once upon a time in the west from the late 60s if you liked the other two it s a bit more violent and although made by sergio leone it s not quite a spaghetti western but has all the tropes there are countless westerns and people will be recommending all sorts but these three are a good place to start
django unchained bone tomahawk
i ll second these as must watch tombstone the outlaw josey wales bone tomahawk no country for old men to yuma the dollars trilogy is a fist full of dollars for a few dollars more the good the bad and the ugly also must watch the last outlaw the assassination of jessie james by the coward robert ford once upon a time in the west forsaken hostile territory
most of my picks are gone so i ll recommend the harder they fall
blazing saddles no blood just farts
high noon mud quigley down under
bone tomahawk viel spa
i you want to get a feel for classic westerns gunfight at the o k corral is a good choice for newcomers to the genre the good the bad and the ugly is a must see and a classic example of a specific genre true grit the version from the coen brothers is great and unforgiven is an obvious recommendation
lots of good recs here and i thought i would commit to just handing out some upvotes but i love westerns and now have thoughts briefly start with anything from john ford or sergio leone shane is also mentioned here and that s an important entry if you can t get shane you ll find plenty of great imitations including most of what eastwood does and a big chunk of wayne s work something i don t see mentioned at this point the sons of katie elder after that the following are the best of the best but also better appreciated once you re familiar with what came before the man who shot liberty valance the wild bunch high noon rio bravo the latter being a response to the former the shootist unforgiven gran torino the final westerns for john wayne clint eastwood respectively yes eastwood gets two final westerns
tombstone baby it ll be your huckleberry
i ll recommend you some spaghetti westerns westerns made by italians the dollars man with no name trilogy the big gundown death rides a horse day of anger django the great silence navajo joe the mercenary taste of killing i want him dead dollars for a massacre the ringo films a pistol for ringo and return of ringo a minute to pray a second to die the forgotten pistolero a man cried for revenge today we kill tomorrow we die killer caliber god made them i kill them shoot gringo shoot they call me hallelujah django prepare a coffin the sartana films the sabata films the trinity films
hell or high water is a good modern day entry in the genre
the hateful eight is pretty good
no country for old men the revenant the hateful eight hostiles a million ways to die in the west mad max fury road django unchained
old henry bone tomahawk hell or high water
i won t say it s necessarily good but young guns was super entertaining
to yuma with christian bale high noon
most spaghetti style western were pretty bloodless just the person who got shot puts the hand on the part which was hit and fell dead most clint eastwood and terence hill westerns are classic love those mostly s and 70s westerns
tombstone
tried justified it s a tv show but the premise is the same marshal goes to the wilderness of kentucky to serve justice and have some gunfights
the villain tombstone silverado maverick unforgiven outlaw josey wales true grit
open range kevin kostner robert dunalley tombstone to yuma russell crowe
treasure of the sierra madre technically a southern but western enough
in addition to what others have said the gunfighter winchester
if you think you d care for neo westerns i d recommend hell or high water and wind river both are set in modern day but tick all the traditional western boxes
the only correct answer here is tombstone if you watch it and don t like it westerns probably aren t for you
here s something great which hasn t yet been mentioned john hillcoat s violent artful the proposition starring ray winstone guy pearce john hurt and danny huston
totally forgot about true grit remake but id also reccomend it
came here to say the quick and the dead
up for slow west
rest in peace larry you were great
the assassination of jessie james by the coward robert ford is one of my partner s favorite movies great performances great script great production to me it also feels a little less like the typical western movie something about the tone and cinematography maybe second this suggestion
i second the harder they fall excellent movie
haha ive never themeatically really thought of fury road as a western but i guess in terms of folk living on a frontier of harsh qualities posse ing up to find people etc its not not a western heck the vehicles as stand ins for horses and trains even kinda works i guess
while the first three mad max installments are archetypal westerns i m not quite sure fury road fits the bill i ve always thought of it as a bit of a departure from the western mold you re not wrong to include it but it s something to think about it certainly has all the hallmarks to a certain extent inherited from its predecessors however genre is ultimately a language and fury road uses the language of action and spectacle rather than the literary foundation of westerns it s practical and physical rather than social and environmental i m inclined to say it s more a war film than a western but it s a fine line
bone tomahawk should cure any squeamishness
agree about the coen remake of true grit being the better version i d start there too
yes a lot of fans consider it more of an art house film with a western setting it has great beautiful poetic visuals
i would say to save this one after a few others it was good but it was gory violent and it does sort of play with western tropes so it might be a good idea to have a few others under the belt first
it also has the classic loner wanderer man shows up is reluctant to help the people being terrorized by a local gang in this case the war boys but then ends up helping them anyway and vanishes afterwards
everyone here is recommending it despite the op s opening statement might drive him off it s a great film op but if you are still squeamish in the slightest i d probably veer away from that one it s brutal even by horror movie standards
an f bomb seems pretty obvious although since it s not implicit i like that it could change depending on what region it s being shown in

such a fucking brilliant iconic movie that is not getting enough praise i guess it was only a matter of time before someone called raiders of the lost ark underrated
did you see chariots of fire op i can t stand it when someone goes snub or robbed and didn t even see the other films writer of chariots of fire said a guy behind him at the oscars was rubbing his shoulders like a coach and he went huh turned around and realized it was steven spielberg rooting for chariot of fire to win even spielberg knew it was a one of a kind film and at the time a big win for british cinema
chariots of fire is also a solid film i personally prefer raiders too but don t take the oscars so seriously
i haven t seen the film that actually won the oscar it s like dismissing older classics like lawrence of arabia without even seeing the movie in the first place also despite loosing the oscar raiders is definitely not underrated or doesn t have enough praise it s still highly popular and millions or even billions of people worldwide are still watching and referencing the movie
such a fucking brilliant iconic movie that is not getting enough praise fucking hell is this r moviescirclejerk
chariots of fire is an incredible film
i remember being surprised that on golden pond didn t win best picture
chariots is a completely different movie but i ll be honest it s an excellent movie in the context of the time it rightfully won raiders went on to household name cult status but chariots hit big in
ehh they re not looking for a good entertaining movie most people would prefer to watch indiana jones over chariots of fire certainly but the oscars is about finding a movie with themes that elevate the medium of film like how great american novels are meant to do for literature it s supposed to be like a pulitzer and not the people s choice awards now they don t often get it right and to be fair those types of movies are much rarer but films like indiana jones the dark knight or top gun maverick don t meet that criteria to begin with i think the more people understand that the more they ll realize a great action adventure film isn t going to get in that s not the goal of the oscars
raiders is a well made adventure film with nothing to say historically the oscars have tended to award more insightful movies
no das boot should have won
such a fucking brilliant iconic movie that is not getting enough praise you ve gotta be fuckin kidding me classic r movies moment
raiders was a kids adventure film chariots was a grown up film for adults that s why chariots won it s not a secret that and vangelis without the soundtrack chariots is nothing
it should go without saying at this point but awards season is not always about what is the best film was how green was my valley better than citizen kane was shakespeare in love really better than saving private ryan those are two of the most prominent ones in film but it s not unique to that industry did jethro tull honestly put out a better heavy metal album than metallica to win the grammy i even got to experience a bit of this sitting up in the nosebleeds at an awards ceremony with the host of a show i was producing and we said maybe someday that will be us on the stage the next year he was on the stage accepting the award were we really better than everyone else or did we just have a combination of the best submission and best campaign among the voting members of the academy hmm at the end of the day it s not about the award i don t think you can find anyone who seriously makes the case that chariots was a better movie good absolutely great sure genre defining and industry changing like raiders no some movies that win the trophy absolutely deserve it some don t but pardon me while i dip into cliche land time tells us what is worthy
i dont know how many times this needs to be pointed out but the oscars are an industry award not a popularity contest
bro raiders is a family entertainment film it wasnt a serious piece of cinema seen in the beloved way it is today i dont think chariots of fire deserved to win that year but i wouldn t even consider raiders as an alternative
robberies the biggest one ever was shakespeare in love winning over saving private ryan this is a movie that has been brought up many times in regards to weinstein being able to influence the voters for the oscars it received notably best pic and best actress paltrow i do think raiders was more deserving but i don t believe it was so much more deserving to be a robbery action suspense films like that just don t win oscars
raiders is my second favorite movie of all time but let s all not forget it has a talking monkey in it on second thought maybe it should have won
have have you seen cuckoo s nest i d almost almost be happy to agree on eaiders v chariots although i m sure there s a better third option but jaws over cuckoo s nest maybe you re the one needs locking up
we have top men working on it right now top men
sometimes it takes the world to see what is a great movie for instance john carpenter s the thing is arguably the best horror movie made it was heavily panned by the critics and did poorly at the box office raiders was probably too pulpy for the awards group for the time
i m not gonna say annie hall is better than star wars and i m obligated to say as anyone who brings it up is that woody allen is an abusive monster but annie hall is a great fucking movie easily top all time rom com
such a fucking brilliant iconic movie that is not getting enough praise it s a hidden gem
hot take and only checks watch years after the fact
chariots of fire deserved the win had it not we d have topics about how chariots was under appreciated even as a winner that perspective is far more justifiable than claiming raiders is undervalued raiders is also deserving of formal and informal recognition but it has and will continue to get its due in so many ways and it s not even the best indy movie
cool story
i m still fuming that alien lost the award for art design to all that jazz
green book exists and this is robbery for you damn dude
posts like this should result in a ban
looking through the history of best picture winners is hilarious it s inarguably wrong like of the time and often absurdly wrong it s always fun to argue what should have won in retrospect but it s almost never the movie that actually won i d personally argue it s wrong in all but or years but i d listen to arguments that it hits slightly more than that cuckoo s nest is at least a year that you can argue they got it right although there s movies that year i like more chariots of fire is a fine movie but totally forgettable that s the theme of most winners honestly
for sure
star wars is probably the biggest miss in oscar history not saying a bad film winning or a less deserving film shakespeare in love style i am talking about the oscar just going to the wrong movie annie hall may be an insanely great film and worthy of all the praise in the world but not way was any film better or more deserving than star wars that year changed the industry and pop culture in ways no other film has done btw close encounters wasn t even nominated that year
remember annie hall an utterly forgettable film won best picture over star wars
agree
it won the test of time poll people ask them which movie they ve rewatched more recently if even of people say chariots of fire i d be shocked
sometimes the oscar goes to the worthy recipient other times it s a flimsy effort and a joke i don t think this ones either of those but i def agree rola should ve taken home the hardware
i totally agree with you i watched that movie while in the military and fell asleep
back to the future wants you to hold its beer this is the era when prestige films started to edge out brilliant popular movies
i love raiders too but the best indiana jones movie is the last crusade and that wasn t even nominated at the oscars the best picture winner was driving miss daisy who no one really talks about nowadays and that in competition with dead poet society you could count on fingers of one hand the times when oscars were just
i love spielberg but i always get a kick out of him being furious that he didn t even get nominated for best director on jaws he blew his budget by a huge margin and went overschedule by a huge margin the director is in charge of the production and that s poor management sure the film turned out amazing but the job of a director is to make the best movie possible and come in on time and under budget that s also why irritu s win for the revenant was complete and utter bullshit but more to the point the oscars are always going to be biased in favor of dramatic realistically grounded films over genre fare it s just the nature of the beast no sense in getting upset about it history bears out which films truly matter much better than awards do cough how green was my valley cough
the oscars are almost always wrong they are wrong every year it s just a way of showing which movies align with the political beliefs of the judges the awards tell us absolutely nothing about if the films are good or bad
oscars for a long time avoided the box office box office movies are remembered while some of the oscar movies are great however not a lot of love at the box office i remember watching the oscars and being pleasantly surprised if i seen any of the movies that were nominated the oscar very rarely went to the box office winner
i saw chariots of fire when it came out never been so bored in my life great score though raiders is a far better film
wait you mean it didn t i ve never even heard of chariots of fire
it could explain why i never heard of chariots of fire
reds would be a great bp winner
dances with wolves won the award in against goodfellas and while goodfellas is probably the more celebrated movie from that year i can totally see why it lost against dww
amazing movie perhaps the greatest heist movie of all time the fact that the coveted treasure turns out to be this evil being at the end is such a magnificent twist
i ve only seen chariots of fire once i remember enjoying it but being very surprised that it won the oscar that said awards is rarely a better judge of a film s quality than box office returns basically it means bugger all
popcorn movies still don t get respect oscar bait wins awards
chariots of fire was the epitome of oscar bait and a deserving winner i remember that summer visiting my dad and there were complete page ads on opposite pages of the boston globe for e t and raiders of the lost ark and my dad asked me to choose which one i wanted to see i vividly remember the disappointment on my father s face when i chose e t of course it was brilliant but later that summer seeing raiders i can see why dad wanted to see it it s spectacular
next on r movies why wasn t revenge of the sith nominated at the oscars it s an underrated hidden gem
just found this movie a new hope just sorted this dive by top of the week and there s no discussion posts about it anyone else see this gem it s a sci fi movie but hey this there s also some fantasy elements
nothing about ops post gives any indication that they ve seen chariots of fire i ve certainly seen raiders far more often than i ve seen chariots and indy s lead will doubtless grow over time but i think that if i d had a ballot i d probably vote for chariots raiders has some well documented plot issues while chariots is just magnificent
i only ever saw it as a kid so i have a very low opinion of it vs raiders lmao i should definitely rewatch it as an adult my parents rented it and i thought it was gonna be like ben hurr it reminds me of the gag from the simpsons when the kids sneak into naked lunch i can think of two things wrong with that title
interesting fact i guess spielberg is still that way because he looked so happy when eeaao won best pic
yeah most movies that win best picture get forgotten over the course of history time is usually the best judge
the oscar s is basically just an excuse to hand trophies out that ll collect dust on a shelf as the years go on idk why some people take awards ceremonies so seriously

agreed it s actually somewhat underrated these days but yes it s an absolute classic
i dont know how many times this needs to be pointed out
i ve never even seen chariots and i can hum it s theme song
did jethro tull honestly put out a better heavy metal album than metallica to win the grammy yes
was shakespeare in love really better than saving private ryan yes and i ll die on that hill speaking of op not having seen chariots of fire i get the feeling that most people haven t rewatched shakespeare in love tom stoppard is a brilliant writer ryan has plot problems that either make no sense or are cliched and hackneyed if it wasn t for the landing at the beach it would have been forgettable and speaking of which the landing at the beach wasn t even necessary to the story
for all the times the academy got the winner wrong it still noticed the big moments where movies shine or changed the game quick google shows star wars and raiders went home with the most trophies on their nights despite losing the big one academy can be a little tone def but its certainly not blind
how do you define a serious piece of cinema
reds should ve eon if seriousness is part if the criteria
shakespeare in love is not a bad movie though it has a brilliant script and oscar nominated acting performances winning it is just that spr is a better overall film but that is mainly due to the spectacle of the opening and closing battle scenes oscars tend to go to films like shakespeare with the great script story acting etc as opposed to big wow type films i e mad max fury road winning all the technical oscars and nothing else it should have won best picture imo
problem was there was two war movies nominated for best picture that year and they probably split votes as far as best picture went plus spielberg has already won while malick hadn t in addition not everyone is into war movies life is beautiful probably should ve won but it was in a different language and that hurt its chances shakespeare in love and elizabeth were both set in elizabethan england but sil was more fun and considering all the movies nominated voters went for the fun one weinstein was also great oscar campaigns but spr was always going to have issues competing against the return of terence malick especially when he s also doing a war movie
that nazi monkey got what it had coming
that s what i said jaws is a great film but cuckoo s nest is one too i would say that jaws was a great film but i can understand it losing to cuckoo s nest where did i say jaws was absolutely better i implied they were both great movies i don t quite understand your comment the ending scene of cuckoo s is a masterpiece is my english bad or something i just don t know where you got this idea that i am putting cuckoo s above jaws edit sorry i mean the other way around it s a m over here so i am going to sleep and won t be able to reply immediately but please do respond i am curious about this
i would put the thing over every other movie mentioned in this thread
all that jazz has amazing art design
have you seen all that jazz
that actually is nuts but i guess they considered a lot of the same guys being included in the effects award instead
return of the king was the rightful winner in imo
shakespeare in love beating saving private ryan is indeed hilarious
it s not an award for pop culture impact though star wars is just not that good as a film outside of its technical achievements and production design the script acting performances and plot are at best generic and at worst outright bad
i hate woody allen and i am not a fan of annie hall but it absolutely deserved to beat star wars
annie hall is a forgettable film sure
how does annie hall impress you as utterly forgettable you can hate woody allen for a number of reasons but the movie has groundbreaking moments of originality
sorcerer should have won that year
i love star wars but annie hall is a masterpiece
bro thinks star wars is good
that s the test of popularity not of time raiders was more popular when it came out and is more popular today also indiana jones has been around for a long time now there s a movie or show every decade that means marketing which means more people see the older movies
it s not an award for how rewatchable a movie is if it was dumb and dumber would have been nominated
uh no it s not the job of a director is to make the best movie they can possibly make as the viewer who gives a shit about the budget and coming in on time
jaws has made million on a million budget anyone in hollywood would kill for a screw up like that
i dont think you know how directing works
for the time period that the op is talking about this isn t true movies like the deer hunter and the godfather were some of the highest grossing films of the year in their time people were willing to go see dramas in cinemas back then
this is so plainly untrue for the 70s and 80s rocky and kramer v kramer were both top of the box office and they win best picture hell raiders on golden pond and chariots of fire were all top in
raiders even has a better score
or e g the godfaather the most underrated mafia movie ever honestly i m not even kidding i wouldn t be surprised one bit if i saw a headline like this
also that whole indy dating marion while she was a child thing lol that doesn t really sound great today
time is usually the best judge so why the hell isn t he in the academy
i wouldn t say most but a lot of them do and a lot that don t win are remember long after those movies have faded away
time is usually the best judge but this is not an award for timeless picture after all we would have to vote pretty much exclusively on all those home alones and die hards which i view way more regularly than likes of chariots of fire but that doesn t make them better pictures
i do not think a lot of people take it really seriously but people specially movie buffs are passionate and like to defend what they love some of those dont even have watched all the movies and like to give their opinion but here lies the oscar merit its the time to people talk about movies to recommend to friends to complain to get interest and thats fair oscar is full of wouda shoulda and injustices personaly those films cited by the op are not even close to the worse offenders but just to have the capacity to create discussion of movies years later is fantastic
i wouldn t say i take them seriously i just think it s fun to follow them but that s me like how other people follow sports i never would have seen some of my favorite movies if i wasn t interested in the oscars
that is why marlon brando himself used one of the awards he received as a doorstop as he found it meaningless
oh hey i follow his wood working channel i didn t know he worked for rim or that he s an engineer although looking back that makes a lot of sense
thanks for posting this i have a love hate relationship with based on a true story stuff i hate how every true story is twisted to make it more dramatic or sexy but then again i love historical dramas and the like i m looking forward to the ridley scott napoleon film but i kinda wish we could pull napoleon himself and the people around him forward in time so they could break down what s sensationalized or not heh i remember being years old when dragon the bruce lee story came out and i ate it up that was my first taste of based on a true story being fictionalized sexy modifications being made to history the film depicts bruce having his back injured by a sucker kick while his back was turned to some other martial artist who had challenged him and lost the true story is that he sustained the injury while weightlifting these days i try to stick to well made documentaries that strive to be accurate i would prefer that dramatizations that take big liberties just change names and stuff to separate it from history edit this guy s channel looks really interesting lots of random engineering related stuff
his mechanical box jigs are awesome wood gears and all
so this guy had a rim job
this is my most anticipated movie in a long time the director matt johnson is doing really significant work and i consider him one of the most important directors working right now if anyone wants to learn more about his filmmaking style i suggest checking out this film essay https://youtu.be/t5mmym_gdki
this should be the new trailer run it instead of noovie this is also the thickest canadian accent i ve ever heard
this is a cool idea but i couldn t stand him pausing literally every seconds he didn t need to break down things like jim would have known about star wars
i do have a bit of nerd in my dna but not enough to want to watch this movie it would be hours and minutes of my life that i d never get back
i can t remember what video it was in but at some point he showed off a wooden motorised gimbal he used for testing for signal drops i think it was just like everything else he builds utilitarian and exactly fit for purpose edit found it https://woodgears.ca/misc/rotating_machine.html
i think he has said that he sold his stake in the company or stock or something and is effectively retired and youtube is just for fun which would explain why he has never done click baity stuff on his channel
one of the best engineers in canada
this is his second channel his main is woodworking lots of woodworking
sometimes they leave out a lot of really interesting stuff for the sake of telling a neat and tidy story napoleon lived such a fascinating life that i bet a lot of it will be left out of the movie there were so many layers that it s hard to depict a holistic picture of man in the space of a single movie on the other hand the movie is supposedly about his love life with josephine and that s an area that s easily sensationalized it seems ridley scott s angle is about his obsession with josephine which will make good drama but is easily over exaggerated i think it s fine to use historical figures as characters to tell fictional stories as long as you make it clear that it s fiction that is what the genre of historical fiction is all about imagining what historical figures in hypothetical situations it s not like it s a new genre and it is more impactful to see historical figures on screen than fictional ones sometimes famous figures get mythologized over time and sometimes that mythology can tell us a lot about public perception of that person or how a true story resonated with the filmmaker biopics in a way are more adaptations of legends rather than attempt to teach history
didn t the trailer say inspired by a true story completely different
einstein newton aristotle all were considered the most genius of our time until bind19 poked his head out of the comments
i see you are new to matthias wandel
i agree with this
great thanks for sharing we were all anticipating what your reaction would be
i hope he sold any shares he had after that interview with google
cutting
it s training day they re trying to train jake to be like them so they make him do all the stuff they normally do and i m sure alonzo told the gang in advance that he might have to bring a newbie by to get murdered by them but if jake worked out he would just not take him there to get murdered it s not like he s too worried about keeping information compartmentalized that gang already knows enough about him that if they ever turned on him conspiracy to commit murder would be a drop in the ocean
alonzo makes it seem like although his guys might take the fall for him but that since they all have clouded pasts it would raise too many questions he calls jake a virgin shooter above suspicion paraphrasing i think he brought jake in specifically for this purpose as a rookie in narcotics others would not question his itchy trigger finger but i do get your point i just always thought that the heat was coming down on alonzo i think the three wise men refer to recent events that have made the news that are embarrassing for the department and that he really wanted to avoid this i do think that alonzo assumes that most people can be corrupted like him and i think that he probably did give a thought to actually bringing jake in but just the way that alonzo manipulates jake the entire movie the pep talk in the car after they shoot roger is just more misdirection to get jake to stay in the car and not confess to what happened i think the plan was always to eliminate jake unless by some miracle alonzo believed he could percent be trusted just my two cents anways
before alonzo even has the talk in the car with jake he calls ahead to the gang telling them to make sure they clean the bathtub good implying he s already told them to kill jake he wasn t really trying to change jake s mind at that point
i looked at the entire movie as alonzo as just getting more desperate throughout the day so he just continued to change and adapt his plans training hoyt was a scheduled thing and it hampered alonzo s ability to get the money so he had to incorporate it into his plans
their team was dirty and he was a new clean guy a perfect fall guy also no matter how loyal you are taking a blame and possibly going to prison for years life is not something alonzo s friends would do i d say it was plan b he was training him and showing him the world and if jake joined them he would probably let him be but since he refused the money shoot roger and was clearly going to report it all plan b was a go the car talk was just to make him stay a bit longer to get him there
alonzo is breaking in jake training him to be one of the gang he needs to make sure he can trusted alonzo decides to have cliff curtis and tuco kill jake after he realizes that jake isn t going to break bad training day is kind of shitty movie that doesn t make much sense when you think about it but it s held together by some amazing perfomances by the entire cast but especially denzel and ethan hawke
wasn t jake being assigned to alonzo s team i e alonzo didn t have any control over it iirc jake is internal affairs infiltrating to investigate and build a case to prosecute alonzo for everything he s doing alonzo is paranoid suspects this right away and is putting a lot of shit on him to make his testimony highly suspect but also to see if he ll play ball when alonzo finally decides that jake is internal affairs he decides that keeping things going is too dangerous and decides it s time to take the money and run he sets jake up to be killed but he tells the killers to leave him alive for a bit so that alonzo will have time to gather up his shit before he leaves town once jake misses a check in the cops are going to try to bring in alonzo
hoyt is a virgin shooter above the realm of suspicion it s implied that alonzo and his crew have had multiple encounters which draws attention from the department which must investigate all police shootings they dig up the money in rogers house and they attempt to bribe hoyt but he says all he does is cash checks for lapd alonzo tried again in the car afterwards and hoyt declines after that alonzo has no choice but to hand them over to the hillside crew since he needs to take the money to the russians
i think killing jake was always a firm plan b otherwise there d be no need to get him high and use that as a manipulation tool
that is a good point but i think that was more of the fact that once roger is killed alonzo needed a way to ensure that at that moment jake wouldn t break down and say screw it and confess it all right then
annies screams of anguish after finding charlies body in the car fuck man that scared the fuck out of me i would never want my mum to feel this way should something like that happen to any of us brothers and sister toni collette is a fucking gun actor man
annie coming out of that dark corner and chasing peter haunts my nightmares
honestly the best and scariest thing about the film to me was the family drama and horrific event that happens it felt so real especially the direct aftermath of the event
collette should have been nominated for an oscar
the part where charlie s voice comes through annie s mouth freaked me out so bad also the grandma s ghost just standing against the wall at night in the dark this movie scared me more than any other i ve ever seen had me not wanting to get up to go pee in the middle of the night
not only was it scary but it like made me feel just straight up gloomy for at least a week
only film to make me scared of the dark and looking at my ceiling for months phenomenal film though in other words your point completely agreed
the piano wire scene really stays with me because it was so shocking just the rhythmic way she goes back and forth with it and the look she has on her face that was the point in the movie where i really knew that shit had gone sideways and the audience basically sees everything
i had a bit of a different relationship to that movie i was an intern at a production company reading a bunch of really bad scripts to pass onto my boss whether we should consider buying it or not one day i was assigned to read hereditary was immediately the most engrossing script i ever read at that job then i got to the scene you know the one it was written so authentically and numbingly that i had to excuse myself to the bathroom for a good while to process i liked it forgot about it watched it in theaters and when the scene happened on screen i was like oh goddammit this movie they made it
i ve never seen a movie that better depicts what it s like to grow up in a totally fucked up dysfunctional family one of those if you know you know deals i ve watched it three times over the years don t plan on revisiting it for a long while just hits too close to home not because of what is depicted in the film which is obviously over the top as befits a horror movie but because of all of the shit that has gone down within my extended family since i watched it last this hereditary trauma experience is most definitely generational with no end in sight
there s something kind of funny about seeing this post here right after the moderators over at r horror started to ban all heriditary is good posts
brilliant horrible movie the scene of peter lying in bed after the accident where you hear his mom saying goodbye and discovering the aftermath is up there as one of the best pieces of filmmaking i ve ever seen
the sound of the delayed thud of the mother s head after the scene changes was something i didn t know i expected until it didn t happen when the camera was on her and the timing was spot on it was almost funny sort of charming in a warped way it was correct but it was not funny and i twitched
yeah this movie disturbed me deeply i enjoyed it i don t know if that s the right word and appreciated its craft but jeez i went for a hike the day after watching and although it was broad daylight i was constantly looking over my shoulder for creepy naked people watching me in the forest
i find most horror films silly and while some are enjoyable i m never really engaged hereditary haunted me for days still does years after to some extent the scene where the mother bangs her head on the ceiling specifically was the first time i truly felt horror while watching a horror film probably since i was a kid it didn t help that my gf dragged me to the cinema and i had absolutely no idea what we were going to see part of the horror for me came from the fact my mother was mentally unstable when i was young and seeing a mother go crazy like this probably triggered some repressed memories
it s pretty good but that s my r movies bingo for today
the mom shouting at him at dinner about having that face on your face only to realize later that him smiling back to himself in his reflection was how he was looking at her the whole time
the head banging on the attic door was nightmare fuel and it was just a couple of seconds long
i watched it once i have severe anxiety and the moments leading up to the car scene and the mom finding her were too much for me i finished the movie but i have not even thought for a second about watching it a second time since release
it s my favorite horror film i never really cared too much for the films that rely too much on jump scares the slow burning dread feeling makes it feel a lot more intense to me it always leaves me feeling very unsettled when i watch it fantastic movie ari aster is amazing and all the actors did such a fantastic job overall
this film more than any other i ve seen in the genre plays games around the line between mental illness and the supernatural the result being that you never feel like you know what s going on and that underlying confusion adds to the overall tension and creepiness madness is also a theme in the movie to the point where they play cinematographic tricks to stimulate hallucinatory phenomena even the title suggests that it could be mental illness that is hereditary in the end i felt like i still wasn t sure it wasn t all just a delusion absolutely brilliant i think the best in the genre
ive been watching horror films for years and this one genuinely shook me ari aster is a genuine horror auteur
i m reading these and remembering this chilling movie and my kid suddenly enters my room from the dark out of nowhere and i jump and drop my phone wtf man i m years old good job reddit
it s my turn to post this tomorrow
don t downvote me to oblivion i saw this in theaters and was looking forward to it but i didn t like it i thought it was just a genuinely bad horror film however everyone talked it up like it was the best ever i just don t get it this film did nothing for me
thats a lie i know for a fact the scariest you have seen is whinny the poo blood and honey
when she just kind of swims up the stairs it s so abnormal and so realistic really weird to see
i m one of the few that thinks this movie is overrated maybe i will watch it again
it s just ok i didn t find it scary overall there were parts of it that were good but i found myself getting bored at times
my husband and i watched it alone in the cinema we were shitting our pants and just wanted to leave great movie never rewatched it because we were so scared
guys it s a good movie but please i m begging you watch more horror movies
we need a national conversation about the tortured meaning of phrase and it s not even close
i hate this movie with a passion because of posts like these i saw posts and comments how scary it was how it gave the people nightmares etc and bought it on blu ray it was okay but it certainly didn t live up to the expectations set by reddit the movie has become a meme in my circle of friends because i can t stop bitching about it when it s mentioned it s my dinkleberg of movies
i thought it was silly and unintentionally hilarious or maybe that was the point because i found midsommar ridiculous too to the point where it almost felt like a comedy
i see this claim that its a scary film but a lot of the film i found myself laughing more like a comedy e g the scene with her banging her head off the ceiling
that time of the month already
i ll never understand what people think is scary about this film
the s of posts about it on r horror made me hate it
it was scary how tedious it was
there was so much good stuff in there and then mom is off flying around the ceiling in her nightie and i lost it no more horror just pure silliness
the dinner scene amazing heartbreaking just such a masterpiece of a movie
i saw this movie in theaters i m currently in bed with lights on because of it it shook me forever
i m not the biggest horror fan in the world but this one was insane i wasn t the biggest fan of the ending it was a little too weird for me but that s kind of an ari aster specialty annie floating over the bed is the creepiest thing i have ever seen i still wake up in the middle of the night and check the corners of my bedroom especially if my wife is out of town
i loved the film and it s probably one of the best horror films i ve seen but the only thing i feel like let it down was the pretty ridiculous cgi of the mother crawling around the walls and ceiling and then slamming her head into the loft entrance it kinda killed the fear and made me laugh but that s just me
the whole cinema was laughing at points in this film especially the ending with the tree house and all that business there were parts that were meant to be scary but it just got lost on the atmosphere somehow
it s perfect it doesn t rely heavily on jump scares gore cg or any of the things have have contributed to the decline of horror films i cared so much for the characters because the acting and writing is better than i could ve expected when the villain finally does show their face i was in such a state of awe and bewilderment i was covered in goosebumps and my heart was in my throat immediately following the film came guttural moans and oh my gawwwwd that was amazing then shortly after silence while we contemplated what we just witnessed my first viewing of hereditary was a true movie watching experience but when i watched it on lsd my brain fell out my butt
unpopular opinion hereditary is one of the most over rated horror movies and isn t scary
i wanted to like it but besides a few shocking things i found it kind of boring i didn t understand the hype
the thing about ari asters films is that they all feel like we could all be in that same situation as crazy as that sounds there a sense of realism at all times and it scares the shit out of me i love it if you like his other works like midsommar and eggers the witch i recommend you see the korean film the wailing edit forgot to add eggers
nah
ari aster has that indefinable quality that is reserved for the masters of the genre he simply understands how to invoke the deepest sense of dread inside you the way he uses sound and movement just burrows into you and terrifies you on such a psychological level i ve thought so much about hereditary and midsommar as these twin totems from aster that it s almost crazy to me that i get to actually watch him add movies to that list and see his career and filmography unfold in real time it seems like his ambitions lie beyond the horror genre which is simultaneously exciting as hell and also a little disappointing to someone like me a die hard horror fan who feels like aster is the director i have been waiting for my whole life no matter what i will be there opening weekend for any movie he makes for the rest of my life
you have not seen many horror films i take it no films really scare me but i thought the vvitch descent and even it follows were spookier for more modern horror films
really scary until it s last act for me the random naked cult guys smiling and just standing there were hilarious and took the tension away for me
the absolute circle jerk this movie gets is so baffling to me i watched this movie separate times trying to see what everyone else sees to me this movie is garbage and so is midsommar the ending that everyone thinks is so scary is comical ari aster is probably my least favorite main stream director i can think of
i don t have to read any part of this to agree just based off the title now after reading still agree and love ari aster if you haven t seen midsommar go watch it you ll at least have a great time also go back for a second watch in or months you ll start to see that charlie has been watched from the beginning watch from start to finish with knowledge of the end it ll fuck with you harder lol
this has to be some elaborate troll people keep posting how good this movie it is so at this point i am assuming ari aster is paying these folks this movie is so boring so tedious and so silly that i walked out during the screening collete screams after every event there s no subtly to her fear or performance it s all one note my biggest memory is the ridiculous opening of a mother demanding a high school kid to take his middle school aged sister to a high school party what just a shitty movie and shows how far cinema has fallen that people are eating it up
i like the film but i feel like this is one of those movies that got way too much hype i enjoy the omen and the shining as well as rosemary s baby and think they are scarier than hereditary which basically reveals the shock and gore within minutes of the movie to each their own though i enjoyed the film as well
i have no idea why but my wife and i are the only people that didn t like this movie both of us love horror movies love being scared by them we only watch these movies on nights i don t have work in case she has nightmares but this movie didn t scare us for some reason and we don t know why everyone we talk to loves it but sadly we aren t on the same page with the rest of horror movie lovers
come and see is the scariest film i have ever seen
average film but far from scary imo crawling around on the ceiling pretty silly to me maybe when you get older horror movies don t scare you as much so pretty overhyped
it was good but i didn t think it was all that tbh
bro please use a thesaurus for absolutely
i agree i was terrified the whole way and it s so good i desperately want to watch it again because it is that good and i did enjoy it but i m also too scared
the most unsettling thing about the whole movie is the ending like seriously wtf was that felt like i inadvertently took part in some kind of weird ritual by watching that
instantly got the heebie jeebies after reading this you said it best how scenes will stay with you a long time this one still makes my soul feel cold when i think about it
top notch movie
solid horror flick the only thing that comes close is the witch
nah it s scary but nothing will ever top strangers
it was a good movie but it personally didn t cause me to be scared or have nightmares
my girlfriend and i watched this for the first time weeks ago we said wtf a lot and yeah it s our new favorite
i felt like i wasn t supposed to be watching it and i never will again lmao
brilliant film i never want to watch again
very rarely do i see a movie that genuinely creeps me out when i m alone later but this one did the level of tension in this is incredible
i love it personally my favourite horror movie it s about more than just the scares i think it s a masterfully crafted film if you watch horror for only the scares i dont think you ll like it much
the scariest part of the film for me is still the beginning when toni colette turns off the lights in her studio and is about to leave when she just catches sight of her barely visible dead mother standing in the corner of the room sometimes at night if i m letting the dog out for a wee i catch myself looking into the darkest areas even years later i think that s the scariest imagery to me just barely perceptible figures
it was a great psychological horror there was that slight disturbing atmosphere and the actors were amazing but i honestly didn t find it scary advertising it as the scariest movie made me expect scare level of e g conjuring so i left the cinema disappointed
absolutely horrifying and i love every minute of it it is a crime that toni collette didn t get an oscar
hereditary is easily one of the funniest films i ve ever seen my whole cinema screening was laughing their ass off at how bad and unscary it was if this is the scariest you ve ever seen i would presume you are years old
this movie was so goddamn stupid
i looked forward to it since many people said how good and scary it was it was not either of those
i know i m the minority here and probably desensitized by decades of slashers and psychological thrillers but i found the movie extremely slow and outright dull during most of it yes i understand it s a slow burn but to me outside maybe a single scene towards the end it wasn t scary at all
the entire theatre i saw this in was laughing their asses off by the end no one was scared everyone seemed to think the movie was a comedy
i ve seen alot of people saying this about the movie and i just don t get it to me it is just another mediocre horror movie
my issue with what seems like most a24 movies is they set up this awesome narrative and then end the movie it s like they are all the lore for the movie i want to see which is what happens after the story they tell
yeah hereditary is fucking terrifying and it has a brilliant plot for a horror movie too none of that family moves into a haunted house crap
i love the subtle clues that the cult has been trying to influence annie even before the woman confronts her in the parking lot you can see someone putting a pamphlet in the mail slot that gets tossed aside and see the cultists in the background they were persistent and if something didn t work they tried a new tactic the family didn t have a chance
on your scene with her over the bed in the theater this was incredible you could hear people s reactions but because she s hard to see at first the reactions were spread out as everyone slowly realized she was there it was like popcorn popping ever second a couple more people would go oh or shit such a fun experience it took me a couple of seconds and based on reactions i knew others were seeing it and i wasn t that made it even more scary holy shit what a scene
your post must be great but i wont read it because i dont want to remember the scenes you describe
i liked hereditary but i didn t think it was that scary one of the scariest films i ve ever seen was the descent i recently read that the cast of the movie weren t even aware of the twist until they actually filmed the scene so the jump scare in the middle of the movie is real don t want to spoil the twist for people but basically it s a very scary movie about a group of women who decide to go cave exploring one of their group who is supposed to be the navigator changes the plans without telling the rest as a surprise thinking they can become famous for being an all female team that discovers and charts a new cave system my only biggest complaint about that movie though is that it s a bit low budget and the hair and makeup people were awful most of the girls look like pornstars but not in any way good
texas chainsaw original for me i was laughing at the mom pounding her head on the door like a raver lol
this movie was ok i would not say it s the scariest it had good acting decent plot and some good jump scares shock factors as somebody who watches a lot of horror movies i think this movie is just a little overrated
i don t understand at all i m generally a giant pussy and can t handle scary movies but this one just wasn t there s so much hype around it being scary and i just don t understand it
how that film sucked so bad
i feel crazy sometimes because i just don t see what s so good or scary about this movie when i watched it i just felt bored i felt the movie was less scary and more depressing i guess depressing can be scary but there was never a point where i was unnerved i felt that way about the witch too or vvitch i suppose i just wasn t scared by it i was bored i think it s just not for me
this movie is sooooooo overrated when it comes to being scary
idk if there was a theatre cut and final release but it backfired in the theatre when i watched it first of the film was downright good horror but the last act was badly timed where it became really funny because certain parts just backfired and looked like cheap slapstick horror whole audience in the theatre was laughing chuckling as was i
i must just be completely immune to horror movies because i was completely unfazed
i agree with you hereditary is one of the scariest films i ve ever seen too i watched it with my friends and we were all terrified and shocked by the end i think the film does a great job of creating a sense of dread and horror that stays with you long after the credits roll the scenes you mentioned are definitely some of the most memorable and disturbing ones in the film i also think the acting is superb especially by toni collette she really sells the grief and madness of her character i think hereditary is a masterpiece of horror and a must watch for fans of the genre it s not for the faint of heart though
you haven t seen many scary films or you must be very young i take it i consider it more of a comedy because the headbanging and the head falling off via roadsign scenes had me in stitches word of advice if you think this is scary then don t watch any of the herbie movies a volkswagen with a mind of its own if that s not scary then i don t know what is
have you seen the exorcist i thought hereditary wasn t bad but i didn t get scared as i did when watching other horrors the thing the descent and even the conjuring i found those scarier
how about glengarry glen ross based on mamet s play it has some amazing quotes to use for essays like that and some of the best acting in cinema
revolutionary road about the disillusionment and anomie of postwar american suburban life
death of a salesman
uncle buck would apply buck was a hard scrabble blue collar ne er do well who found himself thrown into the unfamiliar territory of the married with kids suburban dream
for some reason a place beyond the pines has jumped into my head three narratives that in some ways correspond to the concept of what the american dream could be from three different perspectives
pursuit of happiness is literally about the american dream
minari
a raisin in the sun
first cow
stroszek by werner herzog is imo the best film about the disillusionment of the american dream from an immigrant prospective
scarface
west side story the spielberg remake
man push cart
if you started with a streetcar named desire keep watching elia kazan s filmography and you ll find a lot of gems that i think it can be related to the american dream theme like on the waterfront america america and splendor in the grass my favorite
frances ha
i like nightcrawler success at any cost without any regard for other people brutal competition forces you to be ruthless in order to succeed
if you organize it you could do a comparative essay with two different cultures that unfortunately deal with the same type of mentality parasite and streetcar comparative analysis would be pretty cool
dolemite is my name
i love han ye ri in everything i ve ever seen her in she doesn t even need to speak her face tells the story
i disagree
i disagree with your disagreement since your argument was so compelling
giving a textbook definition of american dream it s about freedom being an opportunity for individual prosperity success with upwards social mobility for oneself family through hard work in a capitalistic society with few barriers frances ha is about a woman s career and hopelessness but i see it as microscopic focus on frances herself as the title suggests rather than a macroscopic commentary on america capitalism upwards social mobility in society and the american dream it s much more of a relatable quirky character driven movie about frances being carefree happy go lucky and as a result aimless in the big wide world of late20s new yorkers so she s still childish while her friends are getting on with careers marriage and more there are small elements to take from it on careers success but overall i don t think it s an american dream focused movie in the same way pursuit of happyness or an f scott fitzgerald story are frances could be non american and the movie wouldn t change much frances isn t explicitly shown to be seeking upwards mobility or success so many moments in the movie are superfluous to the american dream frances running thru streets or taking a spontaneous trip to paris it s much more of a whimsical character piece than american dream movie imo i d consider it about the american dream by the same metric i d consider any slacker movie to be about the american dream so frances ha qualifies as much as adam sandler s big daddy does for example

jon favreau nails a monologue that is the beating heart of the break up directed by peyton reed who directed of the best movies in the ant man trilogy spike jonez held his own with george clooney mark wahlberg and ice cube as the 4th king in kings warren beatty was probably a better actor than director but he was a hell of a good director john huston is still my favorite gandalf sydney pollack was phenomenal in michael clayton there are others

a lot of tv series too but wernor herzog most recently with the mandalorian but even did an episode of parks and rec was a villain in jack reacher he has a very unique and great villain voice great for voice roles
kenneth branagh for christopher nolan dunkirk tenet oppenheimer can t say about oppenheimer as it s not released yet but what is interesting about his characters in dunkirk commander bolton and tenet sator is how different they are both are stoic men but one is heroic while the other is utterly evil
david cronenberg has appeared in quite a few movies
not a film but david cronenberg starring in alias grace i didn t expect to see him in that
not a movie but werner herzorg is in several episodes of the mandalorian

william richert probably best known for winter kills as fat bob in gus van sant s my own private idaho he s fantastic and he almost didn t do it except that river phoenix whom he d directed in a night in the life of jimmy reardon cajoled him into auditioning correctly assuming he d be perfect also it s a delight whenever john waters shows up in absolutely anything at all but i particularly enjoyed his casting in feud bette and joan as b movie director william castle about whom he s written admiringly many times he looks nothing like castle whatsoever but he s clearly having a ball oh and since lynch has already come up he actually plays the romantic lead in s underseen zelly and me opposite his then girlfriend isabella rossellini and he s completely normal and absolutely lovely
todd field in eyes wide shut
martin scorsese has somewhat big roles in guilty by suspicion and anna pavlova
he also wrote that movie so i m not sure if it s the best example especially when qt in little nicky was sitting right there
speaking of korine it s certainly not a major role but he has a super small cameo in park chan wook s stoker unmistakable once you hear his voice in the scene lol
sydney pollack in kubrick s eyes wide shut and allen s husbands and wives pollack really might be the best director turned actor ever his one scene in death becomes her is so good
maybe not major role but major funny role
he s also very good in three kings
man i always forget about this it has to be the weirdest example
of the best movies in the ant man trilogy he directed all of three lol
peyton reed directed all ant man movies and also bring it on
david cronenberg in jason x and nightbreed it s always great whenever cronenberg acts and it would seem he s willing to act in your movie if you ve ever done anything for him acted in one of his films did the lighting gave him your parking space etc but his jason x spot is especially fun because he wrote that scene himself and you can kind of tell apparently he d always wanted to be killed in a friday the 13th film god love him
he s also in the tom cruise jack reacher film
major acting role second cameo
as weird as it is he did a great job
he also directed the best of the ant man movies

oddly formatted trailer but those tracking shots of ducks in flight are super cool as a duck enthusiast edit i kid you not i watched it again later and actually teared up a little bit at the beauty of the flight sequence there s a solid chance it ll be packed with trite jokes but they sure damn well portray the flight of a duck beautifully in that clip
minute of telling you the studio seconds actually telling you about the movie
what the fuck this is written by mike white
this trailer was mostly illumination using their incredibly popular ips to tell you to also watch this movie here s hoping they pull off an actual story rather than a long funny clip show
illumination really struggles with putting out marketable characters i know they hit big with minions and how popular they are but they really need better marketed characters especially if universal wants to grow out their theme park brand
ernest celestine s director is helming this the big focus on other franchises is probably to get the attention of people who only care about minions maybe the marketing department was concerned about this film s lack of a fart gun and overcompensating
ducks hiding from the rain are ducks afraid of water
having tested a near finished minute trailer for this last fall i guess they were trying to hit the original xmas date mario had it s kinda bizarre they spent over half of this teaser talking about their older stuff that being said based off what i saw it looked cute devito actually got a couple chuckles from me with some of his lines and the animation was actually pretty stunning at points still looked heavily like an illumination movie but more like one of their better ones
holy fuck illumination loves pharrell bruh wasn t the exact song in this trailer written for a despicable me movie
ignoring the absolute nothing burger that is this trailer announcing it now makes me think they re trying to hype it up because it kinda sucks
i m a birder and a fan of animation in general but spending half the trailer talking about other work the studio has done to sell the movie is a massive red flag i hope it s just a poor editorial choice and not indicative of the quality of the picture overall
ay are the mario fans still gonna say the critics are out of touch when this one releases to
half of that ad was just an ad for previous films
the real reason illumination made mario is so they could fund their true passion project the secret life of ducks
when i saw this before mario i thought it was a duck hunt movie lmao
i honestly thought it was a fake out intro for the mario movie like it cuts to them flying across the screen but they suddenly get cartoonishly shot because it s actually duck hunt
this is an illumination movie so i m predicting songs on the soundtrack that are about flying
til some duck species migrate i work outside all year round and see ducks all year round
to its benefit the shot of the lead bird flying out of the forest was beautiful
when the kung fu panda duck dad makes another movie
illumination films in one year yep sure know how to pump them out as fast as possible
for a second i though it would be like a spin off to storks which i oddly enough really enjoyed
oh new animated movie who s mak illumination no thanks
this looks like a i made it
what song was playing the background of the trailer
half of this trailer was the studio reminding you who they are and the other half was over a song that they already used in a previous movie
it looks like a family road trip movie but about migrating ducks which is a cool take
i think i heard about this movie and it s the latest work from the co director of ernest celestine
they do realise december is still months away
guess with this and mario illumination s trying it s damnedest to branch out of it s safehouse as much as possible the style is very much mitchells vs machines i think they front loaded that trailer cause it s the only way they can appeal to non film audiences who don t care about structure for a new ip
i just can t like the illumination style of animation it just annoys me to look at
dat pharrell track sounds
quack quack quack mr ducksworth
my nsfw comment when the littlest duck did a mid air somersault it sounded like he yelled fuck yeah i mean even duck yeah would be kind of going too far on a kid s movie
i miss kumail
you know a movie gonna suck when they bring back voice overs for the trailer
interesting that no voice cast has been announced anyone figure out whose voices they are in the trailer
felt like the kind of trailer you d see on a vhs in the 90s
my dad wants to see this just because it s about ducks what s with old people and ducks anyway
interesting take what are your thoughts on bird law
then a closing creepy shot of an eye and leg followed by this christmas with a pharell song in the back this trailer is all over this place
yeah that was really weird is the movie so bad
that s pretty typical teaser trailer stuff spielberg movies used to always be announced with basically a list of his filmography it s how you build a brand and are able to sell stuff that isn t a franchise or ip the irony is that it s illumination so it just assures me the movie will be milquetoast but i m sure families will see this trailer and get it on their radar because i think the illumination movies have been big hits with that demographic
weird too that they be flexing on mario when that movie barely come out what today
they ll milk the mario movie as much as they can to promote whatever work they have right now which is emm this movie i guess
it s very odd at first but the more i thought about it the more it makes sense there is going to be a lot of young children seated in the next few weeks at their local theaters for the mario movie and they are trying to let kids know that the minions and mario people are giving you another movie this christmas it s a very off putting strategy but it will probably get some kids excited to see a movie they probably wouldn t have want to see otherwise very few adults are probably signing up for an illumantion movie that doesn t deliver some form of nostalgia fan service for them gotta get the kids to bug their parents to take them to the movies on their christmas break it s gonna have to compete with aquaman for that money though good luck
these ducks they are trying to murder me
the ernest celestine director
chuck duck
oh hell ya as long as this isnt an emoji movie type situation
the white lotus but with ducks would be interesting
i wonder if they think its bad or if they are just scared that since its not another minions sequel no one will know its the minions people when it comes out
jfc pixar does the same thing for their teasers
i don t know the new guy in their new movie seems pretty marketable s
i think illumination and universal in general really have an astro turfing problem they don t have as many really big properties as they think they do want us to think
besides a few despicable me attractions at orlando a second coming to orlando soon hollywood and japan there s a sing attraction at universal studios bejing called sing on tour and a secret life of pets ride at hollywood
this makes me much more excited i was the only one in my screening of ernest and celestine but i loved that movie immensely just like the first one
ducks love the rain but it s harder for them to fly in heavier rain younger ducks are also weaker flyers and have fewer feathers so they tend to not like colder wetter weather
it s thunder and lightning they might get fried plus they appear to be hiding from the stork
poor pharrell he has a year long career producing for some enormous names in the music industry but most people know him for the minions happy song
think it s a new song
or to have it out there to show before mario
the lack of voice casting raises questions
i m holding out for the double showing
storks is a good movie so there s not really anything odd about enjoying it
storks was a really good movie but it was made by warner same company that made the lego movie illumination are not clever enough to make that kind of movie
fair despicable me no thanks sing didn t even make it to the end secret life of pets looks to be the smuggest film since scott pilgrim mario ok i ll concede mario looks fun
wasn t just you
my first thought was the what year is this meme very strange to see a trailer like that in that isn t a spoof of pre movie trailers
just saw it in a theater i went to as a kid playing in front of the super mario bros movie i took my kid to see thought i time hopped for a second when it came on
it totally did and i ain t mad gave me old movie night vibes where you grab your friends a random movie that will either be amazing or utter shit and chill snack and watch
you ll understand when you re our age
can i offer you a nice egg in this trying time
a pharrell song that they already used in despicable me
the movie isn t out until christmas
the studio has been focused on mario bros so the fact this is being released in the same year indicates that the film is some combination of rushed to fill a scheduling hole and made by the studio s b team
they tried their best to make you not learn about the new characters and focus on their established stuff they know it s going to be bad
it s not a trailer they called it a announcement so dunno if that makes a difference
i imagine since it looks really different from the studio s other output they re relying on their other successful franchises to sell it
maybe they thought it would be hard to sell a duck movie if they didn t tell you who made it makes it seem like they do have faith in it and they want to make sure people see it
these are some high end drakes
or the other illumination is noting the increasingly lack of interest in anything minions anymore
nah dude compare this to the og teaser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggv082dbgcy) for wall e and it s night and day this is just clips of their previous films chopped up pixar at least attempts to tie in their movies artfully
more like they do realize it and have to push it harder
which could explain the acquisition of dreamworks by nbcuniversal a few years back
there s a second one ernest and celestine is such a gem you ve just made my day
it s not it s just a cloud away
and it was shown before mario
the mario trailers were deceptively good the film itself is the most illumination movie illumination has ever illuminade
i think the first despicable me is decent everything else wasn t
omg it s not just me this tralier percent gives me animation vibes everything about it it s crazy
name of the song
i know but the trailer makes it look like the studio has no faith in the story
the wall e teaser when it comes to editing trailers that teaser is a work of art
this trailer alone made the fake wall e in toy story video believable even if for just a moment
shocked pikachu face
nah if it were the most illumination movie illumination has ever illuminade the goombas would ve acted like minions and there would ve been fart jokes i m shocked there wasn t a single fart joke in the whole film the mario movie is probably their best or second best movie looking at the rest of their catalogue
just a cloud away
its a this is all we have fully rendered trailer
it s an announcement its not even labeled as a teaser it s got like months to go before release what exactly are people expecting
i mean it was critically and financially very successful not really eligible to be a true cult classic
i really liked it overall lots of good laughs and it felt tense at times but yeah the final fight being they go home and hit each other in the garage that was pretty lame
what other movies are in your top for
you are confused on what a cult classic is pulp fiction is not a cult classic it was nominated for a slew of awards meghan is too new to even be considered one a movie has to be barely seen and kept alive by a dedicated fan base something like boondock saints attack the block or rocky horror picture show i would argue you can t even call something a cult classic before years post the films release at that point look back and see if the fan base is still as passionate about it as they were when nobody saw it during its theatrical run
some people just really shouldn t post lol
i thought the editing was notably awful it s like they made a good movie and then in some boardroom they went cut out all the tension for the adhd tiktok kids and cut out all the violence for the soccer moms and the end result is this wildly inconsistent mess with gaping holes where the fun bits were there s a good director s cut in existence on a hard drive somewhere
you re probably going to be banished to the phantom zone by this sub for your thoughts but i am glad you liked it i don t personally see it standing next to the fervent fanbase of movies like rocky horror picture show bladerunner dazed and confused or heathers but it definitely will have a fanbase to carry it onward to sequels as for becoming a cult classic who knows really if there are people still doing the dance and quoting the movie in years then you re absolutely right just consider that it would need to stand next to giants like the big lebowski repo man the warriors and twin peaks not an easy task
europa is good i ve heard great things about his tv show the kingdom but haven t watched it he did an interesting film called the five obstructions that s more of a thought experiment than anything else but it s still worth a look
i ve never heard of that movie or have i seen it and i didn t read your post but i d think madea goes to jail or madea s family reunion would be a logical next choice maybe madea s witness protection
thank you what about the idiots
thanks
it always struck me as him being a provocateur for the sake of it i know a lot of people say that about several of his films but the idiots in particular just didn t feel like it had a lot of substance maybe i was just missing something
i will watch it tomorrow and will tell you my thoughts
agree with the above commenter it s honestly one of his weakest works it was mostly just lars experimenting with dogme95 and some somewhat controversial themes that s not to say it isn t entertaining though it s a fun film that can get pretty wild just lacks the critical depth of a lot of his other movies
oh okay but i do love his work i might actually enjoy this as well i also watched haneke s funny games i didn t like it are other movies of him good or i should just move away
it is definitely an enjoyable movie i had fun with it just didn t really connect to it on any philosophical or existential level haneke is probably one of the more inaccessible arthouse directors i don t blame anyone for not liking him but he does have a wide variety of works so you might find something you enjoy if you liked dogville from von trier then i d take a gamble saying you might enjoy haneke s the piano teacher if you don t like that one either then he probably just isn t for you
oh im definitely going to watch the piano teacher it s been on my list for a few days
a totally different vibe but equally challeging in stucture cloud atlas
the usual suspects and pulp fiction are two other great films shot out of sequence the usual suspects also has an ending that leads you to question everything you just saw
it s a tough watch but irrversible don t say i didn t warn you
if you re looking for something which plays with structure the way memento does you might consider looking at tenet if you re looking for something as disorienting as memento you might consider checking out the game if you re looking for a plot revolving around an amnesiac trying to piece together his own memories like memento you might consider checking out dark city
not so much in structure but similar in the feeling of being unmoored and off kilter are adaptation and being john malkovich
rashomon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rashomon), might scratch that itch since it deals with memory and perception but it is a bit simpler and slower product of its time i guess
following also by christopher nolan also run lola run is a must
last year at marienbad happy end
while it s not about murder and revenge and such coherence is another movie with a very jumbled up structure there are some other indie movies as well that experiment more with the storytelling style instead of the classic linear ones
most of alejandro g irritu filmography fits that pattern but the where it s most apparent would be grams babel bardo
betrayal a romance movie shot in complete reverse chronological order it begins with the lovers breakup and ends with their first meeting and falling in love it s all about the journey not the destination
the machinist
not identical but similar pulp fiction go and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
different structure but similar must watch old boy not the american version edit you might like natural born killers that s kinda all over jacob s ladder original 70s version
i watch that when it came to dvd after it s initial release and it was life changing for me a movie fan around the same time i was inspired to watch following also nolan and requiem for a dream and pi darren aronofsky
first dates
not a movie but the assassination of gianni versace has a very clever time line dynamic also if your interest in narcissistic personality disorder this is the most accurate depiction of that disorder i ve ever seen on tv
watch the show shining girls
the invisible guest very good mystery thriller it s told backwards and requires full attention
did any one else have trouble getting through this movie i must have tried to watch it times before i ever got to the end before falling asleep it would knock me out in minutes i was really interested to see it hence all the attempts but damn something about it would just put me asleep
same ambience first snow gattaca maybe the shining a friend among foes a foe among friends
the korean film peppermint candy one of my favorite korean films shot similarly to memento segments backward in time
as a fan of the book and it s author i was so disappointed by that film
pulp fiction was my first thought
forreal great movie but not for the faint of heart only horror movie to make me cry
be careful with this movie lol
the game was the first movie i ever saw that i wished i could completely forget so i could feel the impact of watching it for the first time all over again
90s
is that one good it kind of came and went and i haven t heard much about it
i like them both but for different reasons
as a fan of the book it hits the notes but it s totally different i like both even the author has said he doesn t know wtf is happening in his book
i really enjoyed it not one of the best in recent memory but definitely worth a watch if you enjoy a mystery crime combo
i wanted to like it so bad but i was really put off by the cast not a tom hanks fan and they had to change the hawaiian story a bit to account for his age and then also changed the ending so they go to a different planet halle berry was solid but someone like zoe saldana or rosario dawson might have fit the roles of both meronym and luisa rey more closely to how they were written halle berry looks like a model in everything she does so her just being too pretty kinda took me out of the story hugo weaving s performance was kinda forgettable for me except for his role as the nurse which i felt was offputting i did really like the actress that played sonmi although putting her in white face and putting that other guy in yellow face i felt was pretty cringey in general reusing cast members for different roles makes sense given that there are several reincarnations of the same souls throughout the book but i think an audience would be smart enough to figure that out without their faces looking the same it kinda makes the comet birthmark less relevant in the film since you know right away who is supposed to be a reincarnation of who just by looking at their face the feature film format isn t well suited to the story imo maybe two ten episode seasons on hbo would work better and allow space and time for the characters to breathe but there is just too much in that book to cram into two hours
jacobs s ladder is an oldie but a goodie
the dark and the wicked is what you re looking for
the mothman prophecies is another one with great creepy atmosphere but slow development
in the mouth of madness
the descent it follows the visit
rosemary s baby
the legend of hell house is my favorite for creepy supernatural atmosphere i guess it is probably a bit slow moving for modern tastes but it takes time to develop atmosphere
you might like something wicked this way comes
the innocents
drag me to hell
epic is prob not the right word when talking horror movies
a dark song scratched my heebeejeebee itch
the void lovecraftian horror about a cult that wants to open a passage to another dimension scary but low budget the practical effects are awesome
the babadook quite spooky the descent more like a quiet place than an actual paranormal horror the others more paranormal
babadook and gonjiam if you don t mind subtitles
the empty man pearl as above so below deadstream all of these were fantastic the empty man pearl were of my favorites in the last years
sins deliver us from evil
damn it you stole mine
wait wasn t it all inflicted by ptsd
yesssss
the scene with the kid on the bicycle gets me every time
my favourite carpenter s adaptation of h p lovecraft s work prince of darkness is cheesy but also good
i actually found it kind of comical
one of the most unsettling films i ve ever seen
it s very very bleak just be warned lol if you haven t seen hereditary that s another good one
that s not unintentional it does have dark comic undertones
uh oh am i going to be traumatized i did see hereditary it was decent more of an ick for me if i recall correctly
alas nothing against it but comedy horror isn t my jam
it ll sit with you for a bit for sure
omg i m never sleeping again recommendation hyperventilates in corner
hahahaha glad you liked it
he was pretty open that moving to america was hard for him and kira so don t just give up maybe it s just his feelings right now migrating like this can be devastating for any person
if this is true then that would be a devastating blow to have made the kind of films he s made at just is beyond remarkable i hope that this isn t true and or that he s just going through a rough patch right now
who
i don t know i think him deleting his social media is extreme but his long time producer alexander rodynansky hasn t said anything i wonder what kantemir will do now he can t stay in america and he s already had to leave russia for being outspoken against the war i hope he stays in the industry and does at least screenwriting he s such a phenomenal writer so sad we will never be able to see butterfly jam
it literally says in the first line of ops post these bad faith comments are always so useless
i d say deleting the socials is quite common for the creators i d advise just wait for more details for now edit dunno why you re getting downvoted
i ve always felt that it follows is one of those movies like the purge where there s a high main concept they want to get across but no real way to reconcile it with all the related specifics like what you re wondering about
https://i.imgur.com/81azfra.gifv
if it kills everyone i assume it would start by killing the next partner of victims that is still alive also it would be the person that penetrated first
while i enjoyed the movie and it has its moments it s a fresh concept that raises more questions than it answered which i think is part of the fun
there s a lot of people in this world and they do a lot of fucking
but what about the end magical geasa are never logical like the entity would also run out of prey if its potential victims stopped creating new victims daybreakers thinks about this problem you might like it it almost transended its concept if it left out the subplot with wilhem defoe s character it would have been kind of a masterpiece an argument that makes sense to me is that monroe s character has come to terms with her experience at the end of the film and is no longer concerned with it
mark this as spoiler
true i love the movie and i hope people don t take my question as criticisms or something that i didn t like wasn t explained just curious what people thought
i know but who does the entity go to after killing the last person in the chain because that chain of sexual encounters only goes so far but i suppose that depends on the origins of the entity and how the chain starts
i considered but nothing in my post points out anything other than the premise i never said what happens
yea it s a legitimate question to ask i believe the creators just thought billions of people a lot of sex and everybody s connected somehow on some reverse adam eve thing basically impossible to catch up with the killings so nobody should question the concept so how dare you coming to reddit and question their logic lol
all of the kfp movies are great but is just on a different level maybe my favorite animated movie ever
the show is pretty good too
zen ball master is goated
i couldn t believe that they made a peacock villain threatening but those madmen pulled it off
among my favorite too it s a masterpiece
was anyone else expecting a you wanna go for a ride after the hi ken
that cut to michael cera who i didn t even know was in the movie i fully lost it
lmaoo michael cera is in this
will farrell s really carving out a niche for himself as the business guy in all these toy to film adaptations
the hierarchy of power in the barbie cinematic universe is about to change
gonna be wearing all pink when i see barbie oppenheimer the same day
ok that high heel shoe joke is hilarious and is anyone else thinking of toy story all of a sudden
i loved the permanently tip toeing feet just like real barbie
i just gotta say that the costume design and production design is fucking beautiful really captured the toys nicely
christopher nolan better release a new oppenheimer trailer cause shit just got real
i m assuming everything we saw is only the first or so minutes of the movie most of it will probably just be robbie and goessling in the real world i can t tell if this is going to be amazing or terrible but happy movies are taking swings like this again
i did not expect that last joke lmao
ryan gosling s line reading of beach both of us off is majestic
i hope they play the credits straight barbie margot robbie ken ryan gosling barbie kate mckinnon ken michael cera etc
i just fell to my knees in the sistine chapel
boys will watch oppenheimer men will watch barbie
i never thought that i would see a masturbation joke in a trailer for a barbie movie but then again i also never expected that as a straight man in my mid 30s with no kids that i d be exited to watch a barbie movie but here we are
barbie wars gonna be sick af
i m excited that a new generation gets their own brady bunch movie
this movie is so unrealistic who would want to come to the real world
wake up babe new personalities just dropped
ryan gosling looks like he s having a great time
this set design is giving lazytown energy
surprising how so far they ve kept a large chunk of the movie under wraps considering the plot synopsis wouldn t surprise me if all the footage we ve seen belonged to the first minutes of the movie
this movie looks like a fucking fever dream i ll take all the tickets please
i have no shame in admitting i m going to do a double feature of barbie and oppenheimer when they debut
it ll be glorious if gosling wins his oscar for this
my money is already on ryan gosling being the best thing about the movie he s commiting hard to the himbo vibe and i love it
allan is our savior
as many pointed out on a previous thread this is gerwig and baumbach this is not a kids film
when i do the barbie oppenheimer double feature i think i ll start with oppenheimer and finish with barbie
god i m so happy to see ryan gosling in a comedic role again
this looks brilliantly silly i never thought i d be so excited for a barbie movie
when ken pulled out those roller skates i nearly died this looks incredible easily in my top most anticipated movies coming out later this year
this is camp
you just know this is gonna be one of those movies where you come out dancing down the stairs and sliding across the hood of your car just me
i like how kate mckinnon s barbie is the version of barbie who got her hair cut haphazardly and her face doodled on like how kids would have that one barbie irl
we live in a world where there is a non zero chance that barbie will be nominated for multiple academy awards and i m all in for it
and here s michael cera
to do what i m actually not sure
this looks extremely fun and holy hell what a cast
this actually looks so bizarre and i m such a fan the set design is nauseatingly toy like and the performances make it all feel like it s a fever dream
hi barbie
so if will ferrel is in this movie in a business suit in a business meeting is he mr business and does this connect with the lego movie
the random michael cera shot of him just staring as they talking about beaching each other off really got me lol
simu liu is gonna be a scene stealer i can see it now
rumor has it that quentin tarantino directed the first scene
love simu liu as the second leading ken get em
this looks fantastic greta and noah can do no wrong
marvel cinematic universe who
this will be the movie of greta is gonna cook
finally some good fucking food love when ryan gosling does comedy he s so funny i have faith in greta i think this will be great
this movie looks so fucking ridiculous of course i m excited to go see it
this looks so fucking camp and i cannot wait
this looks fantastic i have no idea what it s about but i ve seriously missed movie sets like this i hope the kens kiss no notes

the amount of pink in this this movie was made for pink enjoyers
you son of a bitch i m in
never in my life growing up as a tomboy have i ever cared about barbie i m so excited for my double feature of barbie and oppenheimer this looks great
the hierarchy on july 21st may have changed
two main thoughts this is a weird concept movie and i m kind of actually into it the visuals are great from the toy world aesthetic to the costumes so i m definitely into it
greta gerwig never disappoints really excited for this film and ryan is already impressing me
can not wait this looks so fun
soooo can i take my year old daughter or not lol
i m gonna stay the night tonight ok why we are girlfriend and boyfriend to do what im actually not sure
i don t care if ken has no genitals gosling whole daddy twink look is doing it for me
regardless of the movie yall are on fire with shitposting i laughed multiple times in these threads looks like a lot of fun though definitely looking forward to this self aware barbie is always at least entertaining life in the dreamhouse was fire i can t believe i m more of a barbie fan as an adult even though i was literally the target demographic as a kid lmao isn t it weird barbie grew up with me in a roundabout way
i can t believe i m saying this but i actually want to see this part childhood nostalgia and part curiosity to see how they execute a movie like this and now i need to go listen to barbie girl by aqua cuz this reminds me of that
opening day i will be there no matter what
holy shit visually it looks great
this is so weird that i want to watch it
i dunno why but this reminds me how psyched i was to see the flintstones movie as a kid looks like great fun
can t wait to see dualipa as a mermaid barbie
prediction my hopeful plotline there will be a murder barbie has to solve it all the handsome folk accuse michael cera the one average looking guy of doing it barbie must prove cera innocent but the twist is that cera did do it the moral of the story is that handsome people can never do any wrong cynical wink to the camera as the movie ends
margot robbie is an absolute smokeshow
i hope the beach boys are a big part of the soundtrack they fit perfectly
i love that margot s almost twin emma mackey is in this
they have confirmed that song will not be on the soundtrack owing to the bad blood between mattel and aqua but i think they might sneak it in with the closing credits or something as a surprise
it s ok it appears like he didn t even know he was in the movie
it just reinforces that meme idea that micheal cera didn t intend on acting and that he just showed up
i think that was mr manager
he looks like he walked into the beach in the middle of the shoot and just happened to be appropriately attired so they cut to him middle of scene
yeah the beach you off joke is funny but michael cera s expression sells it hard i m getting some lego movie truman show vibes from what is implied of the plot
jump scare
finally michael cera and john cena in a movie together
john cena is in the cast his name among the many others
he probably got cast for his beautiful voice
he fits perfectly in this universe he never ages
my dude just wandered into the wrong set and just went along with it to not make it awkward
there s only one allan
that half second of him in the trailer sold me on this i m in
they needed a manager so they called mr manager
him
lmaoo michael cera is in this seems he is an allan https://barbie.fandom.com/wiki/allan
i m going to assume he s playing the same character as the kid s dad from the lego movie until proven otherwise
exactly what i was thinking will ferrell as president business the sequel
pixar have great short movies that are funny but do show diversity bao is cute
minutes is a series of shirts directed by jim cummings he s an upcoming director who s made several of my all time favourite films each short takes place in one continuous shot and deals deals with some kind of social issue with a very interesting grey character at its centre one of the best things i ve ever seen i believe it s available on amazon prime but some of the best shorts in the series are free on his vimeo page jimmy c cummings is the full name
not as straightforward about diversity but it s definitely part of it imo traction on youtube partly cloudy disney short
maya deren s famously inventive use of dream language meshes of the afternoon which david lynch said has inspired his own film language is fantastic especially if you show a version with one of the better music tracks also here s another surreal short which can inspire some deep conversations the brilliant jonathan glazer s the fall
cressa maeve beer s coming out
maybe yu ming is ainm dom
i apologize that i don t have a specific movie to recommend but youtube has a ton of short movies if you search for them i mostly look for sci fi and horror but i m sure you can find something that you ll like just type in short movie diversity and something is sure to pop up
this is the kind of scrimblo movie analysis posts that we need more of keep cooking
but where does the chihuahua fit into saw
thats a good question
i liked the montage of thor and jane s relationship and break up in thor love and thunder the roller blade gag is one of the only times i genuinely laughed during the movie
batman s warehouse fight scene in batman vs superman it s truly the best batman fight scene of any batman movie makes wonder what an afflek batman movie could have been
nuclear godzilla and his atomic breath attack in godzilla king of monsters
baseball scene in twilight is cinema
the opening to die another day james bond film is one of the coolest opening scenes in a bond movie the rest of the movie is really bad though one of the worst in the franchise
i didn t think too highly of the ridiculous but vanilla ice as mark twain was sublime
i ve said this before in another thread the opening ten minutes of lord of illusions sets up a way better movie than what follows https://youtu.be/1881sljwkyi
i liked the dinner scene in don t worry darling because finally i felt some tension and was excited what was gonna happen next overall the movie wasn t good and especially the ending was meh
the basement elevator scene in the first annabelle movie a real masterclass of sustained tension and on a technical level excellent lighting and blocking i like that it starts with the jump scare and then let s you revel in the fear the protagonist is feeling as she tries to escape as she finds refuge in a brightly lit elevator and the doors close and the tense music fades out it gives you the viewer the same sense of relief the character feels the direction is excellent here as the camera is placed behind the character as the elevator malfunctions and the door opens back up you the viewer are in the same brightly lit elevator looking out into black nothingness where something is lurking you feel the same panic as she gets the doors to close a couple more times only to open back up to the void and lastly when it come apparent that the character has to leave the safety of the lit elevator cab and back out into the darkness the camera you the viewer have to follow along right beside her excellent scene in an otherwise poor horror film
brad pitt s ending monologue in killing them softly
in the same twilight eclipse i liked the scene saying the end
the opening bank robbery from the dark knight didn t care for the rest of the movie
the opening battle scene of saving private ryan the final fight scene in once upon a time in hollywood
the bar scene in the shining
i don t really like rogue one but the darth vader hallway scene is fantastic
last jedi sucked dog s balls but the throne room fight scene was decent
ride of the valkyries scene in apocalypse now royale w cheese scene in pulp fiction
the asteroid belt scene from attack of the clones
darth maul fight scene in the phantom menace
breaking dawn part ii aro s fucking ridiculous laugh when he sees renesme sic it s creepy but also unintentionally funny
good the bad and the ugly the climax is really good
master gracey trying to convince sarah to remember her past in the haunted mansion https://youtu.be/0h6ffibepj4
although i never saw thor love and thunder i might watch it and review it in the future
i also liked every scene with gorr and i loved whenever jane used the broken pieces of mjolnir as projectiles
ooh that s a good one
never saw the ridiculous though if its rotten tomatoes score is to be believed for critics and for audiences it doesn t look like a movie i want to watch
i think the rotten tomatoes score is more than fair

this website is dead
that s john kelly his pitch for disney streaming was stay the course
didn t know johnny depp spoke french
i love it
depp looks rough
i m happy for him his ex put him through hell glad to see him acting again
some of the cinematography especially the candlelit shots sort of has barry lyndon vibes
been living in france since the 90s
i feel like the dark knight rises could ve been the best in the series if a bit more care went into the editing and writing so the whole movie no not necessarily the bones of the story are amazing and epic and you always have to take leaps of faith with nolan s movies but this one wanted you to jump over the grand canyon sometimes i just think if they sat down and thought does this really make sense and if the answer was no tweak it a bit until it did nolan and co are smart writers they can make it happen without ruining the idea they were going for also the editing is a little wonky to be fair i noticed the same thing in a lot of his movies including the much beloved dark knight there will be jarring cuts within the same scene that don t flow very well anyway i think it would ve been much much better received if they had just taken a bit more time to smooth out what at it s core is a really great story
if you want to mask text with a spoiler tag you can t insert a paragraph break you either need to add tags at the end beginning of the break or delete the break altogether also to your question i think tenet goes from whatever is lower than f to a c if it has competent sound design
babylon
a i just fade to black with the kid in the submersible praying to the blue fairy the end brilliant moving thought provoking movie

that cringey piece of dialogue so you came back to die with your city no i came back to stop you he could have said anything else and that scene would be more meaningful
if anything they needed to fix talia s death scene can t believe they went with that take it made me think for years that marion cotillard was a bad actress
thank you i was wondering why my post broke
i think everybody who suggests this and it s suggested quite often completely misses the point of the actual ending which completes both of the narrative s main themes the ultimate evolution of a i as well as the conclusion of the story s fairy tale aspect paralleling pinocchio where david actually becomes a real boy as soulful as a human
agreed
i read somewhere that she actually saw that take and basically begged nolan to do another one and he was like nah it s good enough i don t know how true that story is but seeing how good she is in other things i wouldn t be surprised
the sting with redford and newman
i love inside man

matchstick men with nick cage one of his more underrated movies imo its not quite a heist movie per se but it has the same vibe cage plays a conman who is convinced to pull off one last big score before retirement
the town
i really liked den of thieves as fas as i know a sequel is in development
the asphalt jungle
i know it s not perfect but god do i love ocean s eleven with clooney and the gang funny dialogue great what an asshole glad we can steal from him with andy garcia s casino mogul just an all around fun movie with a good payoff

blue streak
heat
wouldn t call it the best heist movie of all time but the hot rock is a very underrated heist comedy that more people should see
national treasure and there s no argument
baby driver was good one of the newer ones
that s one of my favourite genres too and it s too hard to pick just one so here s my top kelly s heroes sneakers ocean s the score inside man
le cercle rouge
rogue one is up there
reservoir dogs
not sure if you could fairly characterize it as a heist movie but dirty rotten scoundrels great cast great supporting characters great musical score dialogue ahead of curve with great feminist twist ending
unironically solo a star wars movie
an honorary mention the anderson tapes is gritty with a very different take on things the planning for the heist is revealed through various surveillance methods none of which stops the heist from happening
if you ve got kids and want to get them into the genre bad guys https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8115900/)
mission impossible series
heat not only best heist movie but top movie of all time it is a genius movie
den of thieves it s pretty ridiculous and gerard butler reeeeeally goes for it but the heist aspect is top notch and surprisingly grounded it s very entertaining and a bit over the top but it takes its self very seriously which i love
i thought widows was a really great heist film
the score deniro norton and brando ronin this is a cool movie with deniro as well
le cercle rouge the red circle nobody kicks more ass than melville
gotta be the sting heat is also awesome
heat
kelly s heroes
kelly s heroes ww2 gold heist behind enemy lines

don t know if you ve seen it hasn t been recommended here but i like triple
lucky number slevin just for the cast list josh hartnett morgan freeman ben kingsley lucy liu stanley tucci bruce willis
den of thieves is really good
there is no competition the original will always be the best rififi
thunderbolt and lightfoot the bank shot the hot rock
heist is great didn t know there was a franchise
star trek iv the voyage home
bob le flambeur
unpopular opinion so please dont down vote me but i really liked the heist sequence of fast and it also felt like the last good one after that the series went downhill
heat and inside man come to mind but there s a few others that are almost as damn good and others like hell or high water that idk if western or heist or what
the good thief with nick nolte
foolproof
hell or high water
money heist for tv the original spanish version
the italian job the bank job both very good imho
foolproof such a great old ryan reynolds film with poirot showing up too
kelly s heroes and the italian job
heist david mamet starring gene hackman
you can t beat the sting redford and newman you just can t beat it
baby driver
oceans
is snatch considered a heist movie because if it is yes
inside man is one of my favorite movies ever extremely re watchable
i thought the the losers and layer cake are some good entries
ronin
inside man
rififi the most referenced sequence in heist movie history comes in the second half of rififi a wordless robbery that s impossible to watch without sweat beads forming it s the work of american director jules dassin whose bitter experience of mccarthyite blacklisting made him perfect for this story of desperate characters backed into a corner these men spout tough guy dialogue i liked you macaroni but you know the rules should really get quoted a lot more regularly and hold to a code that crumbles when their too clever by half hit on a parisian jewellers goes south it s magnifique
lock stock and two smoking barrels
heist gene hackman delroy lindo danny devito
repo man
i think inside man is a pretty underrated heist movie
does mission impossible and ant man count
big fan of rififi quite literally one of the best heist scenes in cinema while being minutes long with no dialogue
thief the taking of pelham assault on precinct the killing the next days dog day afternoon
the movie heat with al pacino and robert deniro
heat obviously three kings
the italian job original with michael caine you were only meant to blow the bloody doors off
the taking of pelham not the remake the original from the 70s
goodburger
i heard the plot is about her husband dying and leaving her a cat so she s not lonely and a gang of russian women break into her house and kill the cat before stealing her vintage el camino
no time to die proved she s got the potential for the wick style action if they can maintain the style of the wickverse i ll definitely be checking this out
you were excellent
bond franchise missed their window to spin off her character from no time to die easily best part of that movie wick franchise out hustled them
curious to see how much ana de armas commits to the role with the training the training reeves went through was no joke and it really showed on screen just how skilled he was when it came to the action i m excited for this one and any other spin off in that universe
i want a movie with akira that osaka arc in the beginning was dope but her story felt incomplete
she could sit and watch paint dry and i would watch it
i ve wanted an action movie starring ana ever since no time to die and this should be the perfect vehicle for her so i really want this to be great which is why i m so nervous about it due to them inexplicably people len wiseman to direct it i know he s done some decent stuff on the tv front but his film output leaves a lot to be desired
sawayama deserved her own spin off
they paired up the director of those underworld movies with the writer of army of the dead
this is the proof of concept https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_utizqijss)" they made for the movie
and lance reddick being back i ve got some bad news for you deadline edit appears i jumped the gun with this comment they ve already done principal photography so it looks like reddick will be in the movie
len wiseman though is it
pretty sure this will be a success simply because half the dudes on reddit seem to be in love with her i m a bit skeptical about the director though this franchise is nothing without the phenomenal action and len wiseman has no experience with that if we get another spin off with akira and or caine i hope stahelski directs it
this is going to be terrible an akira cain spin off is the movie they need to make not this fluff len wiseman directing and ana doing her ditzy schtick
if they can maintain the style of the wickverse i ll definitely be checking this out
uhhhhg tbh i don t find her that great and to be fair yeah she s absolutely gorgeous but being pretty doesn t make you a better actress
i only need to know one thing will her character be able to be hit by cars fall down steps fall from a story drop and still kick ass
betting on terrible
this the best we could do
why don t they just light million on fire
i m worried about this movie
hopefully her character has as firm and well developed a backstory as this article suggests
i hope this movie will be good but it probably won t be
people are going to be dumbfounded when this is bad when we all should be anticipating the len wiseman experience don t know why he was tapped to direct this
please don t
don t need it don t want it
hot take anna de armas is hella cringe and a bad actress
i wasn t a fan of her during her el internado days but maybe she got better at acting
but what about a spin off from her character in no time to die
john chick
i hope this time she s not ditzy like she was in nttd it was fine for that movie but not again
they are trying so hard to make her a thing
directed by len wiseman ok yeah that s a red flag
anyone else think she can t act her action scenes were good but it feels like a parody when she s in a scene like she thought she was in a snl skit about a bond movie or something
ugh
i want to be excited but chad is not directing this len wiseman is the director and he is mostly known for directing the underworld series which are not bad movies but still
they really know their target audience
i don t get the hype around ana de armas in action roles she was alright in the gray man and in no time to die but she doesn t really sell it like charlize theron
this is gonna bomb clearly producers are completely out of touch with audiences about what they want like and how the content makes them feel which is what makes films special
this is going to be the movie that leaves a black mark on the films
i m guessing she s a ballerina that fights people and gets naked a lot
i m kinda confused akira from john wick has any connection with this ballerina spinoff i don t think so right
very excited for this
i wonder if they ll tie in donnie yen s daughter and sanada s daughter into this i got the feeling from jw4 that they were sort of setting those characters up for something especially the very end
meh any action flick with her as the lead will be cartoony she s too bubblegum for anything good downvote all u want but she s won t be in anything great just average
saw john wick last night everything being bullet proof really broke my immersion running around holding his bullet proof suit up looked rediculous
i love ana de armas but i would much rather see a butch bad ass gina carano style actress in this type of role felt the same about zoe kravitz in the batman movie these girls look to fragile to me
ana de see the shit out of that movie that girls body karate is enough to take out armies
i read a draft of this script from like years ago when it wasn t a part of the john wick universe and it was the most cliched action movie script i have ever read some of the action sequences were good but the ballerina character was so thin and the plot was soo predictable i really hope they made some major changes to it
i have a feeling it s going to suck
it is such a cool world they built
i m with it curious to see what role keanu will play in this
she s great but this movie is going to flop
i would watch her play a paper bag i will definitely be watching this one
yikes
you want to fuck me
the only movie i ever found her actually noteworthy in was blade runner but also all she kids had to do was act inhuman which she does in every movie
i hope she realizes keanu set a high fucking bar for putting in the work to do those action scenes if she can t equal that it will be looked down on immediately
this is going to fail at the boxoffice unless keanu has a prominent role remindme months
the only woman i can remember in recent memory who seems to gravitate towards action roles and does them well is noomi rapace i really hope this isn t lazily done keanu set the bar really high charlize theoron did a good job in atomic blonde obviously i don t see many women topping linda hamilton and i do think this is getting increasingly more difficult when i think back at some movies that had really good action sequences with much much much lower budgets the contractor all the devil s men the veteran all had abysmal budgets but really great action sequences
give me akira movie you bastards
hollywood s trying real hard to make her an action girl if only she could act
she is in fucking everything and i am here for it
after seeing her in no time to die and the gray man i m excited for this
baba yaga old lady google it
though i think john wick was a great end to the series and they don t need to make a single more movie i am glad they are going in the direction of a spin off rather than a john wick it ll keep them creatively fresh and preserve the legacy they ve created if they stop now john wick is solidified as one of the best action series ever made and while i don t think a spin off is needed i believe in these wonderful filmmakers
this is going to be the hardest movie to watch my wife will not like this one bit since it has ana de armas and its gonna be a run and gun film i m never going to hear the end of this
she was awesome in the gray man
as long as it s better than atomic blonde i m in
yooooooo no thx
i m glad for her she was awesome in no time to die i could watch just a movie about her character
the total recall remake from had some pretty cool action scenes like the spider cam one take shootout and anti gravity scene len wiseman has always been more style and substance so i think he can bring over some of the action filmmaking he s done in the past
she must have great ass when the titties are small
i ll watch anything she s in
i need an avenger wick style movie with keanu ana bob odenkirk s nobody lie to me and tell me it s in the same universe and another person in the mix
nice but damn i wish she was getting a james bond spin off playing her character from no time to die
woah
this isn t the girl from the end credit scene is it
why what about the donnie yen spinoff tf is this she wasn t even in the movies
keanu didn t need to show his dick in john wick do you think ana de armas will need to show her tits in ballerina
you had me at ana
what is she gonna fight bad guys while naked or something
i don t think lance reddick is going to be all that compelling in this movie
blade runner bond knives out and now this apart from the blonde stinker being attached to her her career arc will only keep going up if she keeps crushing these roles very impressed by this run so i expect this movie to be a killer
baba yaga and the ballerina
she is quite perfect
i still believe in that it should have been halle berry she was great in and showed a level of seriousness goofy seriousness that is similar to john in many ways
calling it now it s not going to do anything close to john wick numbers
boo they have so many good characters to do a spinoff with including those talented actors to reprise said roles
she looks like a cuban miley cyrus and i cannot unsee that but hey different strokes for different folks
can you believe theyre making john wick a female in the new one nothing is sacred
i thought she was the one dancing in that one scene in john wick and the camera would have a close up shot of her face sadly that is not the case
why does everything have to be a universe
still no trailer
director of underworld and the god awful diehard or was it man those movie can barely be considered good i mean i love kate beckinsale but there s only so much a hot babe can carry the film
i m sick to death of franchises pass
will they combine ballet and gun fu
lol she was in knock knock with keanu
https://youtu.be/aurtv7mmdee?t=37](https://youtu.be/aurtv7mmdee?t=37) the first minutes leaked watch till the end lol
there s something so satisying about listening to how these talented moviemakers figured out how to make practical effects work to create an immersive experience on a film it s a shame it s such a lost art in the days of cgi
for me this is the best best movies of all time list that s out there extremely comprehensive looks like jeanne dielman jumped from to after the sight and sound result
and those who like in spreadsheet format if you are using google sheet insert this formula to import the entire list into your sheet importhtml https://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php", table if you use excel just go to data and import from web and then simply enter the url https://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php, select basic and then select table done
probably the best list i ve seen especially considering it s all in one easy to read list rather than split out into separate pages like certain others the only one i strongly disagree with is lawrence of arabia in 49th for me that s a top ten film and at the very least top but there s bound to be disagreement so not that fussed
i won t bother i won t bother asking for the criticker list cos that s too hopeful but there is a letterboxd one which someone made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x982tss9ahe
just as a reminder to everyone in the comments these lists are often about trends and popularity rather than an objective best film that being said i do believe the cream usually rises to the top and anything on this list is more than likely worth watching at a minimum
its always interesting to see the divide between godfather and part on lists like this if part is how is part i view them as so equal that even if is more easily watchable and slightly better it s not by much and they should be closer also there will be blood at is offensive
when i trained to be a journalist including an uncommon acronym in a headline would result in an automatic zero i shouldn t have to do research to read any sentence in a written piece let alone the headline it might as well be 2023uotspdtt1000
a bunch of posers put together an irrelevant ranking of the best films although toy story at is nice
yeah this is the list imo and it s super accessible too maybe not the top those are quite arthouse and more for seasoned watchers but the whole list is so broad and representative of all genres and eras you can find so many interesting movies on there that ll surprise you
jeanne dielman is one of the best ever but to pretend it was put as number one on s s for any other reason than wanting to have a female director in the top spot is simply denying reality it was such a massive jump up the list that it was so obvious
meshes of the afternoon got a massive bump too to sight and sound never ranked it until last year when it went way up to
luckily the answer is both in the text of the link and the first thing you see when you click said link i also spent a half second wondering about the acronym and then saw that it was not a real problem because the answer was so readily available that it would have taken significantly more effort to bitch about
and yet this isn t a journalistic headline it s the title of a reddit post
if you don t recognize tspdt i don t think writing out they shoot pictures don t they is going to help
i also hate obscure acronyms they re so unnecessary
it gets touted as something progressive but i have this suspicion jeanne dielman at is actually a reactionary result no great films aren t something you people can watch and enjoy like vertigo they re for us the critics
equally hard to understand and unclear the problem extends to reddit
honestly vertigo didn t deserve the top spot either imo to me that makes just as much non sense as putting jeanne dielman both deserve to be top or so though definitely
the film centers around a house china court and the family that inhabits it the film follows generations of the family over a century up to the death of the matriarch in characters move seamlessly in and out of each other s timelines as they grow up fall in love fall out with each other and always pass on to those who follow them the consequences of their actions so it s kind of downton abbey the movie
no you re thinking of downton abbey the movie https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6398184/)"
no they already made of those
heh for some reason i started to watch the show just now and i didn t even know that there s already a movie
there are two movies may very possibly be a third in the future the movies did very well especially the first one
my ex read this book during a road trip and tried to explain it to me it didn t even sound like a good book let alone a good movie
this movie has some of the worst casting of recent memory i like daisy edgar jones but not as a swamp girl tomboy that everyone in town hates both of the guys were total duds just a really bad movie
yeah it was terrible the book wasn t that great either year old girl who everyone in town hates but the boy with golden locks really predictable
wdym i loved this movie personally
agree casting was off way way off
the book felt more like an atmospheric nature documentary that managed to send me to that era and location somehow rendering the storyline kinda not as relevant so the slow paced twistless plot never bothered me also assumed this was a norm in this genre which im normally not exposed to
oh my god yes they are definitely worth watching besides the squirrel just start from the first ice age
something about dinosaur movie makes them follow a trajectory of the first one being a generally real movie then the next movies in the series being the worst thing imaginable land before was a true masterpiece of animation that then got sequels that are all just unimaginably bad jurassic park is the dinosaur movie and i think some people would say some of the sequels are okay i don t think anyone thinks of any of them but the first one when they say jurassic park ice age isn t strictly dinosaurs but it feels like the same thing once some prehistoric animal thing establishes it s name it can make infinity money making infinite sequels for year old boys to watch endlessly it doesn t have to be good or try at all
and to be honest the writing is so bad it is so generic and awful however the part where the squirrel appeared were so well done if that s how you feel just find all the squirrel parts on youtube i m sure someone made a supercut of them or something
yeah the sloth
yes if you are under the age of
how about a squirrel spin off movie either that or someone needs to make a compilation video of the scenes with the squirrel from every movie
how is this person still getting roles
who the fuck keeps hiring this twat
damn i d love to see this but that guys such a creep
so ezra miller has been in character the last few years preparing for this role
can t wait to hear leguizamo whine about a white playing a latin on screen s
this dude must have some industrial strength blackmail material to be so protected and still be getting roles at this point
didn t ezra kidnap somebody
miller is a bigger weirdo than dali
thin stache
ezra miller was cast for this movie in and production wrapped in may ezra s behavior since then is perhaps part of the reason why it s taken so long to be released
which one though
the article says ben kingsley plays dali for the movie and ezra is playing the younger dali at the start
to be fair miller is hugely talented but why they hire him has to be a production desperate for an actor who will give the project buzz it d be interesting to know if they were able to get insurance on miller
ohhh i didn t knew the production history for the movie thank you for adding the data
he s perfect
well that does sound a lot better
what did they do that you make think he is hugely talented granted i only saw perks of being a wallflower and his role as barry allan but i did not see talent at all they where serviceable at best in either role
i really liked him in wallflower he was the best thing in it for me
bodies 3x was fun as hell if a bit overhyped before release
if you re looking for a very very very good movie you should check out it s shot in one continuous go it s incredible beautiful slightly emotional brutal and fuck i can t say enough good about it esp in 4k and the nightingale also very good powerful sad great character development it s got a sa scene in the beginning but it s extremely pertinent to the story and the breaking point in the main characters life it wasn t just thrown in just to make it more horror it s phenomenal and i absolutely love it even as a sa victim both are must watches imo
i knew zero about it hadn t seen or read any hype other than imdb my bad
yeah bodies bodies bodies is a such a fun minute treat it doesn t overstay it s welcome and has a killer cast pun intended especially rachel sennott
is amazing i agree brilliantly shot harrowing and emotional everything you want from a war movie nightingale i m aware of but i don t think it s my thing if you know what i mean
also maria bakalova the chick from borat
i didn t think it would be my thing either tbh i started off hating even the idea of it as most movies that involve sa use it willy nilly like it s just another way to make people uncomfortable my husband watched it before me and said theres a scene you need to skip but it s worth the shot i ended up not skipping tho i sobbed and i just wow i love it the basic premise it that two guys break into a woman s house back in olden times they r pe her and kill her husband and baby she then goes on a very treacherous journey to get revenge it s very good but definitely something that isn t everyone s cup of tea so i totally get that it was pretty amazing imo though long but very good
watch a movie from called the climb its cinematography is as good as s despite just being a comedy about friendship
best war film ever made 2nd dunkirk imho 3rd private ryan dunkirk saving private ryan these are the best war films ever made nothing comes close to the above as modern day special effects tv band of brothers the pacific then the rest
it s about spelling and punctuation
all the above why does it have to be just one
and the detachment from using them
fuck
i dmed you do wanna talk about the movie or you wanna roast me and insult me more
nah i m done you seem pretty sensitive tho
just preparing for the worst i expect more comments about grammar and what a retard i am
edit it then
agree and it could possibly happen in the next few years probably in a comedy on apple tv
smokin eggsy how about chris pine as another charismatic wealthy villain for kingsmen taron finale

i ve only come to appreciate steve martin in recent years but man not many actors have had a run as impressive as he had from so many great movies and so much variety in premise style etc
are we all friends of carlotta
that and johnny dangerously from with michael keaton make a fantastic double feature
you should check out pennies from heaven steve martin christopher walken bernadette petters
ooh i d love a dog here s something for you too
and marlowe you wearing a tie
i love all steve martin even the man with two brains https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wobl9w7_abi&t=1s
i remember martin saying how sad he was that this and several other movies he made in this time frame man with two brains pennies from heaven the lonely guy were misses all of me was considered as a comeback for him even though it had only been years since the jerk
i remember it was mostly panned when it came out and i never understood why i thought it was very clever and the editing matches well poor terra haute
i can t even imagine editing this movie without computers
the gemermans ethel merman
it s even better when you ve seen the movies the clips are from
i m a big steve martin fan i consider the jerk dead men don t wear plaid and the man with two brains to be the holy triumvirate of steve movies
one of my favorite comedies highly underrated
such a great film i always think it pairs well with hercules returns
dead men don t wear plaid i still don t know what it means
i saw this film when i was in the army i m a finn we have conscription here in the base cinema it was a riot
it s been over years since i saw this film but k remember it being good fun
i did enjoy the joke of him getting shot in the same spot and this is never going to heal but at a certain point the movie just lost me i appreciate what they went for it just wasn t for me i guess
its pretty funny indeed and cleverly done
i ve always really liked this movie it s the perfect completely opposite in tone companion piece to a film he made a year earlier herbert ross s pennies from heaven his first serious role with tragic depth a period noir in which he also had dark hair as in dead men
oh gosh i love this film so much watched it on a loop as a kid even though i probably only got something like of the cinematic references to this day i can t quite dissociate white heat from james cagney s cameo in this film
i saw it by chance on tv one day and i loved it it would be funny enough if it was just a noir parody but using and editing actual footage from real noir films was just perfection
cleaning woman
that s a scene where martin s almost magician like dexterity was really put to good use
the sigh kills me
that scene is amazing had me cracking up as a little kid
but what does foc mean it s a slang word it s when a man and a woman are in love the man puts his no no it s written here f o c
i love johnny dangerously
oh yes not quite as fiercely grim as the original british miniseries by dennis potter of the singing detective fame whose gorgeous surrealist work i keep hoping will see a revival one of these days but nonetheless astoundingly bleak for a mainstream american film and one featuring maybe the biggest comedy star of that era to boot i m absolutely convinced lars von trier watched it fifteen minutes before writing dancer in the dark
enormously underrated movie it s fantastic
the best
anne uh mel meh hey somebody get that cat outta here i fucking loved this movie when i was growing up
the man with two brains is laugh a minute hilarious
man with two brains is probably my most quoted steve martin movie
into the mud scum queen
the lonely guy is ridiculously good
they were just about to get a public library too
i think that was probably what impressed me the most the cinematography and editing was totally on point and this was done in an era where non linear editing and fixing things in post production was not a thing filmmakers really had to know their stuff even though it s a goofy comedy it s a well made film
c mon you put on your dress and i ll go shave my tongue
anyone who doesn t is a farging icehole
right i just remembered the sneezing scene and laughed out loud
filmmakers really had to know their stuff even though it s a goofy comedy it s a well made film visually the costumes are so well done and fit the period because they were done by the famous edith head who designed the costumes for a lot of the original film noirs used she knew first hand how to make the costumes perfectly match the period
my brother called me a farging icehole once once
the core is the best fun bad movie ever imo

miami connection

so is this a lego movie style thing where the characters are actual dolls is barbie going to meet other barbies and have an existential crisis
this is so many more character posters than i was expecting
i love how every barbie is showing off their achievements and every ken is just he s ken
cast so stacked we got a doctor and helen mirren in what she probably wore on recording day so everyone is a ken or a barbie except michael cera and emerald fennel along with some humans the fuck is this movie about
he s a suit oh i read it as he s a slut and was really confused
i saw simu liu s photo and almost died for laughing and choking on my lunch it reminds me so so much of his early stock photo model gigs
omg they even have the pregnant midge
this is a stacked cast god damn
wow michael cera is in this
i love the kate mckinnon one with the chopped hair and marker on the face there s always one fucked up barbie
no skipper
i never in a million year would have thought i would want to see a live action barbie movie but here we are
can t wait to see kate mckinnon play kate mckinnon
i bet the story is will ferrell plays the dad from lego movie and he s a big exec working to get rid of barbies once and for all because he doesn t see the value of having a barbie or how they could still be profitable the whole story we see is his daughter playing with her barbies one last time and incorporating all the different ones she has in a wild out there story he sees how happy she is playing with them and has a change of heart and a new barbie is introd at the end
i do not care what people said this will be a kino for me i cannot wait for people to get creative with this https://twitter.com/vulture/status/1643242831727804417) also please check this https://twitter.com/filmdaze/status/1526656852573962240). i do not think this is margot robbie lb account but good suggestions
and there is alan
he s another ken x200b i have zero interest in barbie but i m genuinely excited for this film
i m so terribly utterly confused about whether this is going to be commercial dross or biting social satire
i did not expect to see michael cera
i might be late to the joke here but i just realized that every barbie is a full personality while every ken is just another ken some sort of social commentary perhaps
ryan gosling is at least a decade too old for this role i wonder if they ll play into that
hi i m allan i think i m at the wrong audition
these posters only seem to work in gallery form he s another ken ken again did anyone else think scott evans was cgi de aged seth rogan
movies are going to have crazy ensembles to attract movie goers to theaters now every major movie is going to be one stacked cast after another
i hope this movie is the fever dream i want it to be
this makes me want an oppenheimer cast poster too same colours and font
lol these are pretty sweet
kate mckinnon looks like she is basically cynthia from rugrats
still not sure what this movie is about
deleted
please add a trigger warning next time for that simu liu jumpscare
why do i get the feeling like this movie is going to be the equivalent of the wyld stallions song that brings about world peace
didn t barbie have a little sister named skipper or something
that s a lot of posters
someone likes sex education
this is amazing
how did they get mattel to buy in on this
i can t tell if people are actually excited or if this is some morbius level hype hoax
the amount of excitement i have for this movie is very confusing
the please call me mother and just another ken really got me
this is slightly unhinged and i love it
i love how all the different kens this is gonna be great
i wonder what the message will be
this is going to be a cult classic
not will ferrell call me mother i love it
michael cera wtf
since emma mackey is in this as a barbie i hope they get jaime pressly in there too and they have a full on spiderman point scene or she plays like a 90s barbie
why do i feel like i ve seen the movie now that i scrolled through those pictures
dang it not mckinnon again cannot stand her
please call me mother
kate mckinnon looks like she s bringing the usual cringe
kate mckinnon s poster is so funny i did not imagine we d see a barbie that had their hair cut and face drawn all over presumably by a child
goddamnit 
i m going to need an a0 printout of that margot robbie one for my ceiling
i don t know what the plot is but i am here for this movie
so glad we are seeing scott evans love that guy lil bro to chris evans
i got that swim suit if this movie s anything like the dreamhouse show it s going to be great
surprised there s no john cena poster wonder what role he has in the movie
i m a simple man i see michael cera i spend bucks on a hour trip to the movies
if vomit was a movie
please call me mother
the band aqua must have jizzed their pants when they hear this movie was coming out
not one of the men looks like a ken doll should look especially not gosling
missing the dua lipa poster
looks lame af and sick of hearing everyone fawn over it already
looks like garbage
ugh kate mckinnon
if barbie gets frisky with a mutilated gi joe then my childhood will be completed
i get that maybe this isn t a huge deal to other people but as a trans woman seeing a trans woman actress playing barbie is a huge fucking deal like even a decade ago that would have been like negative possible holy shit edit do y all not realize hari nef is trans or are you just downvoting me because you re transphobic
damn oppenheimer cast got a competition
hey these are neat im lookin forwar doctor who
this looks like it ll be absolute dogshit however the same was true of the lego movie and that made an idiot of us all so i m not pre judging
is this movie still not out yet jesus all the social media posts surrounding it months ago all seem really overzealous now
it s so good
i m so glad they have a pregnant midge she was always my favorite lol it is kinda weird everyone else is barbie or ken and they didn t use any of the other family or friends names skipper nikki theresa stacie etc
sigh it s gonna be this years funniest movie ain t it fine i ll watch
i m getting somewhat sexist overtones here why are all the men just ken and the women are running the country and winning peace prizes and shit
even if this movie sucks hard i will still watch just for the effort and the concept they put on here looks like a fever dream
i just watched the trailer that is supposed to pull you in and want to go see the movie yeah not impressed
yikes
this is slightly unhinged and i love it
more activist garbage
this proves my theory that this film is inspired by the lego movie
was excited for this until i saw kate from snl this is gonna be a woke nightmare
i can t wait for the barbie movie to be reviewed bombed by adult men for being woke intentionally admitting they have seen it five times in the process
the new trailer was great but these posters are even more hilarious
i cannot for the life of me figure out what this is going to be about chances are pretty good i won t see it so don t bother explaining
kingsley has likely gotten every obama biopic script written sent to him
i am ready and will be seated as all the other gays are saying love all the kens just being ken
the marvel dc doctor who umbrella academy cross over we all needed
why make this now why not years ago
are michael cera and will ferrell real cast members omg i can t wait
why were so many actors from sex education cast in this
black to barbie pink to oppenheimer
ayyyy i see you sex education
the fact that andrew rannells elijah from girls is not in this movie is a crime
that feels like the simpsons sort of predicting the future where it s not some wacky coincidence bexhill is the part of england that is within miles of europe it s around the area you d put refugees from europe and around the area they would be crossing it s like if a movie predicted refugee prisons being in texas yeah probably
great movie apparently terrible book
btw children of men was a masterpiece when it came out and is even better now with what is happening around the world
this and the same time we have news that are now infertile prescient indeed
predictive programming
you gotta watch years years a mini series
i haven t read the book but the movie was better than i remembered i had thought it pretty good but on watching it again i thought it was excellent
that s been the case for decades however it s an old fact that s only just resurfaced in this news cycle from https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/infertility/conditioninfo/common) studies suggest that after year of having unprotected sex to of couples are unable to conceive and after years of couples still have not had a live born baby from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3717046/): approximately to of couples are impacted by infertility from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc188498/): one in six couples have an unwanted delay in conception roughly half of these couples will conceive either spontaneously or with relatively simple advice or treatment the other half remain subfertile and need more complex treatment such as in vitro fertilisation from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/10/3443/2660456): between in and in couples seek medical help for the problem of subfertility it s also worth noting that a lot of these headlines don t adjust for one of the obvious issues people are having children later and later in life and because nature is particularly harsh to women the changes of conception tend to fall dramatically over the course of one s thirties
true and birth rates in many developed countries are declining and have been for years the growth rate for world population is forecast to taper off in the second half of this century i e still increasing but at a much slower rate after who knows
some of the most natural and best world building i ve ever seen in a movie and the cinematography suits it too
people trying to have children later in life is not the whole story study after study has found that men s sperm count is on the decline what s more the rate of deline has speeded up the decline in sperm count has become steeper since https://www.focusonreproduction.eu/article/eshre-news-sperm-count-decline)
bogus fan made clip reel
this is not an official trailer mad fan made https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/mad).
this is a truly awful trailer still hyped for the movie though
throttle is on the other side
what is this
i know the shin universe is making all these famous japanese ips darker and more realistic but this really reminds me of kamen rider the first with the heavy melodrama but with potentially even less badass action scenes
ummm wtf did i just watch
weird trailer but i m so pumped for this loved shin godzilla and enjoyed the heck out of shin ultraman
i don t think this is an official trailer seems fan made from clips that have been released
a not so well edited fan made trailer using clips
honestly i knew it d be a ton of fan service over substance when the trailer showed they d managed to include rainbow road
just fell to my knees in a walmart i can t believe this isn t good
somehow the guardian is saying this film is worse than the one
mamma mia
i can t wait to read threads in two years about how this film was criminally underrated and a good flick if you just turn your brain off bro
my takeaway from skimming through a few reviews is that i m unsurprised that so many seem to talk about the story being a sticking point it s a movie that was stretched between two corporate entities one who wants to ensure that their characters are being depicted in a way that s in line with the rest of their products and another who likely was hoping to be the first pick when it comes to animating other nintendo projects in the future both partners playing it as safe as possible to create something that doesn t push beyond what viewers expect is exactly what i expected and its box office will still coast off of being a recognizable brand anyway
idk about you guys but i just saw a dude fall to his knees at walmart
any adults accompanying those children may wish they were watching the hoskins and leguizamo film instead x200b damn
it s illumination you can pretty much expect to lop off from the rotten tomatoes score from the get go if they made it the trailer even has the character flying through the air and screaming in slow motion gag that i think is in all of their movies and the two column list of celebrity voices slamming onto a black screen at the end i m disappointed but not surprised if nintendo had hired pretty much any other reputable animation studio to make this it probably could have been legitimately great i m still going to take my year old to see it and i have a feeling it ll blow his mind
in sony pictures animation was toying with the notion of making a modern popeye the sailor https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/cancelled-movies/images/b/b9/popeye_poster.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/541?cb=20200911092526) film the film actually got to the point where a lot of test animation and some promo materials were being put together and released sony s r d department found that the film was doomed for failure in their opinion as many children today had no idea who popeye was which sony felt in turn would equate to poor box office performance instead sony decided to permanently shelve the film to make drum roll the emoji movie which if you can believe it made million on a million budget universal and illumination have budgeted north of million for the new super mario bros film and even if the film is dogshit i still say it makes at least million
i expected a score around the sonic movies but the critiques are what i expected i e as an actual movie it s not good and they re rating it accordingly i assume most people aren t watching the mario movie for a great story and i don t care how bad the film is saying it s worse than the live action movie is just lol the game reviewers are more positive on the movie which is also expected but some of them talk about the movie having licensed songs that s actually shocking and not good
so my flair isn t true what the fuck miyamoto
the dissonance between the critics and the viewers will be huge on that movie
sega does what nintendon t
ouch looks like a fun but shallow kids film will probably be a good time really wonder what dreamworks would ve done instead they may be inconsistent but their bangers are surefire hits
sounds about right for a nintendo movie by illumination still excited for it regardless but tempering expectations
go see dungeons and dragons honor among thieves instead it rules
it being just alright mediocre is somehow the worst possible outcome in my opinion if it was bad that would at least be funny
illumination and mediocre movies raking in billions name a more iconic duo
this movie almost feels review proof i don t see anyone calling it boring so the fact that it s bright quick and full of easily recognizable characters locations sounds means it will likely be a big hit
ctrl f citizen kane
everyone it s a mid movie ign almost perfect
so its a shallow and bland movie what a shame
sounds like it could go either way for me most likely will be a movie audiences love more than critics i guess it depends on your expectations for this
peter bradshaw of the guardian gave puss in boots the last wish so you know his reviews aren t the best
where is the movie discussion thread
yeah mortal kombat played it safe too that s not always a good thing
just got out and this felt like a poor man s wreck it ralph i appreciated the musical nods and some of the references though
i don t know how anyone expected this to be good when every single joke in the trailers i e where they stick their best stuff was a complete dud are folk really so dazzled by thing they recognise
but it still doesn t come close to the experience of actually playing the games empire no shit
i just watched it us military base in japan so i m a day ahead and had an absolute blast the good gorgeous animation incredible cgi everything is colorful and fun and cute pure eyecandy overloaded with charm great main characters great background characters it s just so much fun to watch everyone interact zero issues with the voice actors i forgot the entire controversy a few minutes into the film jack black steals every scene he s in of course it felt like a true mario movie true to the universe not only respectful of the source material but delighting in it the power ups were great the world building was great a dozen little background jokes everywhere the music was everything you d expect and it pairs perfectly with the visuals which i guess makes sense since they were composed for the games the easter eggs and nostalgia hits right on the mark it s integrated into the universe and never feels too on the nose yeah yeah it s passe to enjoy nostalgia bait whatever i saw the thing and i clapped sue me the meh decent serviceable story they took the basic mario narrative and sprinkled a little character development here and there better than i expected but also a little formulaic some of the jokes got big audience laughs others fell a bit flat to me then again i m pushing the kids in the audience were cracking up the entire time it was clear what all the characters are doing their goals and motivations except for one as far as i can tell one character was just going about his day and randomly joined the adventure just for the hell of it the bad the pace of the movie was way too fast it felt like watching a youtube video turned up to speed mario encounters a new character and within seconds they re going on an adventure together the movie just doesn t get enough chances to breathe i think they overdid the slow motion gag shot too many too often the action scenes were amazing but so fast paced it was hard to appreciate sometimes overall out of it s a really fun movie and i had a great time watching it everyone was laughing and happy the audience applauded at the end and everyone walked out smiling it s like a theme park ride overstimulating exhilerating but over all too fast
just got home took kids and my wife she does not like video games and did not have them growing up it s a fun movie very illumination but has a lot of charm so many easter eggs in this one jack black killed it chris pratt was fine same with the others if you ve played the games enjoy the music holy mother of god it tied in very well not the pop music there wasn t a lot reviews my wife said it got boring at some points year old greatest movie of all time year old loved bowser and the movie year old she s really into mario now i guess me a year old it was fun the easter eggs were fun and the music was great i ll watch it again there is a after credits screen and post credits scene like a second one
just because it s basically a kids movie doesn t mean it gets a pass for not having a good story kids movies can still be amazing and full of story and emotional beats that being said i think the box office will get this a sequel and i didn t ever expect this to have a great story most of the games are ridiculously simple and it seems counterintuitive to all of a sudden give mario so much fleshed out characterization that he s never had
ouch ign that s brutal should have gone with the live action gritty version starring pedro pascal
saw it loved it it was just fun
i am dutch so this might be a culture thing but i just saw a guy who was wearing a mario hat fall on his knees in wallmart does anyone know if there is a correlation
fogel s script has as at least much narrative heft as the best mario games has this dude ever played a mario game their stories are explained in minutes and consist mainly of princess gets kidnapped the only mario game with a more complex story is sunshine but he said the best mario games
this movie is good it s exactly what a mario movie needs to be it s just not the lego movie it s not a selfaware deconstruction mario fans will love it
i watched it yesterday and was extremely disappointed didn t expect high art but the script is aaaaaawful everything happens too fast and some of the dialogue is cringe af along with the 80s songs like take on me and thunderstruck jack black has some really funny moments and charlie day as luigi is good up until the end where he suddenly knows how to fight without really doing anything the whole movie i also thought anya taylor joy wasn t great on initial watch it felt like every line was delivered the same like whatever she was saying was the most important thing ever somewhere in the range
the big complaint i ve been seeing is the plot being kind of basic which i mean it s mario the plot is gonna be bowser does bad thing peach tells mario mario and him fight mario win the end
honestly the playlist review saying it hasn t got the silliness of despicable me has encouraged me to see it more because i fucking hate the minions
kevin michael richardson s kamek was the highlight of the movie
a fun time no alcohol required https://youtu.be/d0-dlifhktg?t=380)" good enough for me
cutest movie i ever watched in a looooong time maybe ever if you ever played mario you gotta watch it otherwise you can skip it
just saw this with my year old she had a blast animation and sound is top notch plot is safe and basic it s exactly what i was looking for in this movie i wish luigi and mario were together more in the film but keeping the main cast light helped it
wreck it ralph is how you do fan service and quality storytelling i could have guessed this film would only possess the former
ouch i mean i was expecting the plot to be pretty basic but even other kids animated movies with basic plots do better than this
ign s movie and tv reviews have been very lackluster as of late
people are already bending over backwards to defend this movie it will have a big opening weekend i don t expect huge legs expect a sequel
peach is mario mario is luigi luigi is peach
big oooof
did grown ass men get upset when minions got bad reviews
it s an extremely nonsensical movie but it s also really fun illumination did a really great job on the visual department their best work to date being only one and a half hour really hurt it s too short for the movie with such a huge cast of characters need more minutes to flesh them out really wish to see the adventure aspect of this movie more
i m not expecting a cinematic masterpiece i m expecting me and my year old son to go enjoy it this friday
i m expecting my kids to love this movie me to nostaglia trip and go home happy that s all i don t get the internet warriors crying that their beloved childhoood game isn t marketed and made for a year old gamer shocking i know
definitely a fun watch filled to the brim with fanservice and easter eggs that almost is so inclusive of everyone that has experienced a mario game in their life the narrative wasn t anything special but i can appreciate that it successfully showcased some nice characterisations from our favourite characters my personal favourites being dk and bowser glad they utilised jack black s talent for music my only complaint would be the heavy use of licensed music it didn t seem necessary for another film to use take on me for a montage when using any version or callback to the game music would have been even more emotionally resonant we even heard some of that with the reveal of princess peach s castle and when they were selecting the design of their karts definitely recommend watching at least once
here s the mid credits and post credit scenes for anyone curious bowser sings at the piano again but it s shown he is still tiny he s locked up in a bird cage and is being held in princess peach s castle we see the aftermath of the battle in brooklyn amongst the wreckage is a yoshi egg it wiggles a few times screen goes to black then you hear yoshi
the casting of chris prat was an omen for it s mediocrity
i loved it it was packed with easter eggs and was fun to watch my daughter loved it even more and wants to go back in tomorrow it saddens me to see critics so eager to shit on it it s not a the masterpiece of animated movies but it s really well animated and fun to watch if you grew up on mario you won t be disappointed
just saw it and loved it great details at the start with punch put pizzeria only complaint not enough yoshi
if you re a fan of the mario world it s fun to see all the characters and references in great animation but it was all shrouded in a mediocre plot enjoyed it as i m a big mario fan but the story itself is just meh va s were quite alright fred armison was horrible as cranky kong though jack black was amazing soundtrack was weird some songs were great and others were totally random the soundtrack songs were great movie felt rushed there was no breathing room and everything happened what felt too quickly for me
i just came from an early screening it is no where near as bad as these reviews are saying it s like the games fun adventure filled and light on story
hearing that mario is a side character in his own movie has made my interest in this film plummet
i ll still take my kids and i ll probably end up enjoying it the most they re entering into their cynical i m too cool for this phase now i m not expecting a deep story but the animation looks terrific and i think it ll just end up being a colourful fun minute escape from reality
if you see one video game themed movie this weekend it should be tetris on apple
just saw this with the fam in sydney and we all had a great time the only downer for us was the voices some were really spot on while others were so far off they were really distracting even so the kids had a blast and can t wait to watch it again the adults enjoyed all the easter eggs and nostalgia there were some genuine laughs in there too it wasn t a mind blowing cinematic experience but it was good fun and i won t mind giving it another watch
i m excited to get shit faced drunk and see this at 2am
aww man i thought it was really fun i loved the film the animation was brilliant the world was immense and the story of two brothers was heartwarming it had some pacing issues but whatever
this will be a good test to see if branding is enough to make this movie a commercial success
big yikes i was honestly expecting scores at least in the s
reviews saying the film was better feels a bit too contrarian too many references can be bad but having little to no connection to mario is even worse
i just saw it it was better than i thought it would be but the story just seems off peach is written to have weaknesses like most modern women in film
lol slashfilm doesn t have any real fucking film critics neither does collider they and ign are wholly unserious publications and shouldn t be included in roundups that said who was at all surprised by illumination cranking out a pretty but empty collection of easter eggs and remember this between setpieces and calling it a story this was never going to be anything better than a b at best and that s fine because it s beyond obvious to anyone that nobody who makes this thing money at the box office cares or wants it to be more than what it appears to be this is the perfect time for an empty but gorgeous adaptation of one of the biggest video games of all time expectations aren t high nobody s tried this like this as of yet and there are now generations of people for whom just watching someone else play a video game isn t even a baseline negative as just watching someone else play a video game is the entire point of a massive amazon owned online video platform even if this movie was so creatively debased as to feel exactly like watching someone else play a idealized version of super mario bros kart kong etc that wouldn t be held against it by the people paying to see this but it s not that by most accounts either it s critic proof it s got years of cultural love built up behind it and years of entertainment norms shifting in the meantime all it has to do is not suck out loud and it s a win that was always the bar and the only bar the comparison that s jumping to mind is weirdly star trek the motion picture it didn t have to be great or even good and it fell short of both those things by a fair amount it just had to present something beloved for decades in a way people hadn t seen yet do that theatrically and it was going to rake cash hand over fist which is what happened
screw the critics i saw it it was awesome just understand if you watch it in a theater there will be kids
still excited to watch it i knew the story or lack thereof was going to take a beating so it s not going to convert anyone who wasn t already a fan
i could have told you it would be a disappointment the moment it was announced it was an illumination movie
so overall mixed reviews well it is illumination
jack black is good though right right
if you read review scores with the same paradigm you d read games scores you re going to be disappointed an average of for a movie is fine most movies are ok serviceable this movie is no different of course then you have ign but they re barely competent enough to talk about video games let alone movies
i like how the majority of the reviews are pretty much like the plot is horrible but you do sort of feel like you re in the mario universe so i guess it s not the end of the world
has as at least much narrative heft as the best mario games i love this line it s funnier if you assume they aren t including the rpgs
i mean look up detective pikachu and the two sonic movies their rt scores sit in the range despite them being regarded as fun movies that broke the video game curse and really pleased fans if mario manages to hold around it s at with reviews as of this post it s not that far off
film critics hate it normal people think it s decent to pretty good this is basically what i ve gathered
in a nutshell it was fine definitely not nearly as bad as some people here have said not nearly as good as the audience score on rotten tomatoes suggest
it s weirdly polarizing i think it s a case of the people expecting wanting more not setting their expectations right for the film
i feel like with something called the mario movie its pretty much critic proof nobodys gonna be anxiously checking rotten tomatoes or the guardian for their thoughts on it everyones gonna go see it it ll make a bil at least and get a bunch of horrible sequels
so only ign liked it
cranky kong was a huge letdown idk why fred armisten was cast there and the script for him was just blah
lots of memberberries apparently
it was alright but you ll find yourself comparing it to the sonic movies more and more after you leave the theater
saw it it was fine
me and my year old saw it earlier today after school and loved it lot of kids were there and they had a great time too i m surprised to see so much negativity about the movie mario games are short and involve very little plot so why should a movie be any different my kid s been playing 3d world odyssey and luigi s mansion since christmas so it was great seeing her reaction to the music easter eggs to all those games in the movie and i got a huge kick of nostalgia from the dk rap if you played play mario games and especially if you have children i highly recommend it
the movie is fantastic
deleted
just took the wife and kids to see it we had a blast we thought the movie was funny enough it even made us laugh we are planning on visiting super mario world to commemorate this awesome movie
hey guys the movie sucks apparently stop inhaling the copium because you want it to be good and maintain some critical integrity this movie doesn t have to be good to justify your enjoyment of video games or to encourage video game adaptations if it sucks it sucks seems like it sucks on another note the dnd movie actually didn t suck you should give that a try surprise of the year that one
the first audience scores are out this is going to be one of those movies that everybody except for the critics love isn t it edit my friends that seen it today said it was amazing said the theatre clapped at the end lol
it looks like a dream to me lol im going
i suppose i ll give my two cents after seeing the premiere while i m in a entirely not shroom induced haze first i think the critics complaints about plot are overblown i don t know what they were expecting from a movie titled the super mario bros movie i was actually impressed the writers managed to condense decades worth of lore in a succinct way while also managing to be coherent in addition to plot all the things that matters when it comes to movies such acting and cinematography work well enough and were never a distraction it s actually a relief to see something so unapologetically bright in an era where every new movie seems to lean as dark as possible sure it s not citizen kane but all the elements that need to work work well enough for a movie about a long established franchise something that s not easy to pull off
no way this movie is as bad as the reviews it looks way too good
i liked it more than i thought i would to be honest the disaster scenes were pretty jarring and the story as silly as it was is compelling and entertaining enough i hold it up there with greenland and as being mid tier disaster films worth watching on cable on a lazy saturday
imo it s a damn good flick neat ideas some genuinely creepy sequences and a quality nic cage performance and it hits that beautiful inflection point where it simultaneously feels like a small movie while taking huge swings for the fences but i think it was a good move to leave so much unexplained the blending of sci fi and angels was intriguing as was the general blend of biblical and alien and i think it would hurt the film to try to precisely explain what s happening as no answer is likely to be satisfying
all i remember from that movie is nicolas cage screaming the caves won t save us nothing can
my best friend is in it he s a foreground extra during the ceremony at the beginning of the film
i appreciated that the film makers stuck with what they established until the end having a movie be about the end of the world and cop out at the very end and say that people were just crazy would have been ridiculous
alex proyas is really good at denying audiences a happy ending i don t get the on rotten tomatoes i didn t mind the choice but it probably goes up points if rose b survives
i absolutely loved this movie weirdly i think the story would ve been received a lot better if it were written as a novel it feels like the proper medium to fully expand on its ideas it was pretty high concept for a disaster film
that airplane sequence was incredible had me tense for hours after the movie
it s one of my favorite disaster movies what puts its to the top for me is that despite everything the earth still gets destroyed usually disaster movies have a happy ending and knowing kind of breaks that mold i absolutely adore that hug before being incinerated scene
it s one of the few times where i think cage was woefully miscast
this movie put the fear of death in me seriously i never thought about it that hard before seeing this afterwards thinking about dying makes me sick and terrified thinking about it too long is bound to send me into a panic attack
i really liked where it was going and how it was getting there but didn t like where it ended up
i think it s really great it does a lot of interesting things and i think catches a lot of flak for being a disaster movie when that trend had basically ran its course while also not showing much actual disaster check out rog s review he loved it https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/knowing-2009
enjoyable all the way through legitimately good untill the final act
take nick cage in his prime throw in a bonkers premise some stylishly dressed aliens and the end of civilization as we know it i love it
forgotten
not great but certainly not as bad as i had heard before watching it worth watching at least once but if someone told me they hadn t seen it i m not going to shove a dvd in their hands
i lvoe this movie it s perfect something about how crazy the story is just pulls me in
i loved it until the ending in theatres
its just fine not amazing not terrible
i went through a month disaster end of the world movie binge this was one of my favorites is it a good movie no but it is super weird entertaining in a sea of generic cliche ridden disaster flicks this one deeeefinitely stood out as unique
amazing plot setup horrible execution and abismal third act
solid first act with the mystery and the chaos dogshit second act with the stupid aliens
i like it i recognize melbourne all over the place films was shot in australia the film has some ambition and it mostly works i love the one take plane crash even though some of the effects are a bit off the effect still sells through great sound design and the immediacy of just seeing the event from cage s perspective cage also invests fully into the role he might make odd casting and acting choices but he stands by those decisions until the very end i probably could do without the religious imagery at the very end garden of eden style but the movie was bold to end with an actual end of the world conclusion
the ending was cancer
it started pretty good and the plane crash scene was incredible other than that it was pretty lousy i don t get the on rotten tomatoes yeah it s not great but i personally don t think it s bad either go look up with rt scores mean the scores are not grades
strong visuals and an exemplary music score by marco beltrami that s it that s all because it s an utterly stupid movie
awful movie one of the worst i ve seen cage is terrible in it
i liked it but there s definitely areas for improvement adding in the mysterious aliens angels means there should have been a secondary human antagonist maybe someone working with them to help cause some of the disasters the ending for me hit that weak note of needing to either be more vague or more clear as it is what got just enough answers to be disappointed weirdly both the dvd and later blu ray i had of this movie both came in a pack with push also from that s actually another movie i recommend if you liked knowing both fall into that almost cult classic area
i made a point to see this film in theaters because of roger ebert s glowing review https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/knowing-2009). click the link at the bottom of the review for more thoughts on the film i rewatched in recently and still feel it holds up
i dislike the ending
i was a really sensitive kid and it s hella traumatized me that scene with the nails god
eh i think it s just pretty mid for the most part the twist was the most predictable imaginable
great disaster scenes
enjoy watching once every few years watched it twice or thrice so far i guess very memorable scenes and a neat premise
way better then i expected
i remember getting in with low expectations due to bad reviews and being positively surprised can t remember the story other than it was some kind of catastrophe movie and that i was entertained throughout it which made me think it was severely underrated
great concept well executed and honestly quite good for about the ending ruined it for me seen it once years ago but i remember really really disliking that ending
i like knowing though i m certainly in nic cage s science camp and not in his sister s religion camp i was amused when moonfall came out and they well walmart anyway bundled moonfall and knowing together so you could buy one decent flick with one stinker
i unapologetically love this movie i also love the happening not every movie s plot has to make total sense to be enjoyable imo there s moments that feel serious and there s moments that are easy to laugh at i also feel like both movies were products of their time
when i think of the movie i think of the plane crash and then i think of cage s character having to google to find out what that meant after he had already deciphered the code
i love it i will watch it any chance i get it just feels like one of those movies that no one watched saw the rt score and decided to ignore it a couple of my friends and i love movies like the day after tomorrow and legion but the same friends for some reason do not want to give knowing an honest shot i think it s a fantastic movie i don t have any issues with the acting or dialogue or even how it plays out i thoroughly enjoyed the ride even with a very morose ending
the subway kill cam is one of the finest moments in cinema
the premise is really intriguing and the disaster scenes are great but that whole whisper people bit was a mess and honestly the numbers had virtually no real impact in the ending it was entertaining despite all that though but needed a better script
this is the movie i always cite when the subject comes up of movies that are good most of the way through but fall apart at the end the first is incredible but then when it comes time for the payoff ugh
started strong than lost me at the end remind me of the forgotten
i agree
well said i enjoyed the biblical themes in this movie as well you make a good point with your last sentence it could have been a case of trying to explain something so much so it eventually falls apart with the context given it makes us think i was talking with my partner about it and we speculated and had theories and we wouldn t have had that if the movie just vomited all the exposition haha
that s so cool
yea it s one of the few end of the world movies that has the balls to end the world
the ending is a very good part of the movie imo
fuck rt
it had a happy ending tho
that s the only thing i can remember about the film pretty fucking amazing scene at the time i just rewatched the scene on yt and nic cage yelling hey at the dude on fire and him walking into flames without anything happening were pretty funny
did you ever watch seeking a friend for the end of the world that movie is one of my fave end of the world disaster movies and you might like it cuz spoiler alert the earth gets destroyed in the end i really enjoyed the knowing as well but they are very different movies
i didn t care for the happy ending
nick cage has never been not prime
cooler than any brag i have though i once stood quite close to harvey keitel in a very expensive london hotel lobby he was genuinely in a small roped off area inspecting the art on the walls that s it for me lol
not really https://youtu.be/tu_ou1p7nxa?t=112!<
these final hours is also a good one
yeah i like destruction armageddon type movies so i wanted to see more about the world ending than some pseudo garden of eden
back when i was a kid i met crush former wwf wrestler at the movie theater in kona he was from hawaii i think that s my biggest celebrity i ve been around so you got me beat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4yj44gmpvy
it had a bittersweet ending the world was destroyed but nicholas cage s character knew his kid that he would never see again and some others would be safe somewhere far away
traffic especially when the scenes were set in mexico
domino
man on fire had some crazy editing on top of a very warm palette great movie though
the matrix is the one that kicked off that trend isn t it being black and green the whole movie letters from iwo jima is filmed in color but it s so washed out it looks fully black and white most of the time

i stumbled on the ring on pluto tv the other night and i had forgotten how green they colored it
yellow i just watched it recently and good heavens it goes hard on those filters pretty sure it gave me a headache
it s interesting how that iconic look wasn t there in the theatrical release and didn t happen till it went to home video and the new 4k release actually reversed the color correction
being black and green the whole movie interestingly this didn t really happen until later in the dvd era theatrically the film while it does have some filtering going on is a lot more neutral than it was on dvd or at least later dvds i think the first release was fairly accurate to the 35mm presentation where it was pretty strongly re color timed to fit more closely with reloaded and revolutions i believe the latest 4k uhd release tamps this down somewhat if not reverses it completely but iirc the matrix as shot and presented on 35mm film wasn t aggressively timed in the way most folks remember it being on home video edit lol u genosmitts beat me to it and with less words apologies for the redundancy
it was oh brother where art thou https://gizmodo.com/o-brother-this-was-the-first-movie-to-use-all-digital-1595466651
yes true that being said it actually maintained a fairly distinct look compared to the blues oranges of the other films
being black and green the whole movie i remember the dvd had very little green in the matrix scenes plenty of blue in the real world scenes though odd
i don t know why but i describe the color palette of the bourne identity as brutalist
it s actually funny because you can see the progression of color correction throughout the franchise from fairly naturalistic at the beginning directed by chris columbus very much an 80s style filmmaker to the strong desaturated look of the late 2000s
