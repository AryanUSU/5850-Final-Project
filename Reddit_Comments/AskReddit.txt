you can use this thread to reminisce on some of your favorite askreddit moments from the past years i liked that one time someone asked about red flags to look for in a relationship or that time someone asked for an interesting fact or that time someone asked what tv series should ve gotten more than one season or how about that time someone asked for a nsfw tip all great and incredibly unique moments in this sub that i m surprised to find does in fact have mods who are alive one of my actual favorite moments was when this guy asked something like women of reddit what s your best nsfw tip and he got so pissed when of the replies were about blood stains and bacterial vaginosis
this is great let s all be more like the republic of suriname the republic of suriname is the greenest nation on earth because more than of it is covered by the amazon rainforest this also means the republic of suriname is of only carbon negative nations

pressure to perform i am confident and have good sex but it s always in the back of my mind even if someone tells me damn that s good without me even asking i still think they are lying just to make me feel good which is weird since i am confident in my ability

the initiation i m autistic and have social issues as well so a lot of the time i m trying to be steamy or flirt with my partner in that manner she doesn t notice and it falls flat then i usually just have to ask if she wants to have sex and then it just feels passionless its kinda killed my sex drive a bit tbh
it s too short wish it lasted longer
missionary when the guy is staring at you or when you start to get dry and sore and they still won t cum and you can tell they re close so don t want to tell them to stop but the pain just grows and grows
when my gf is laying stretched out over me and i have to spin her around and around and around on my wiener feels weird like its in some kind of machine spinning arround ur dong she loves that so i have to play along she calls it the spinrocker and pretends she is at the amusement park taking a ride should i shut down the park or have it open for her sake

sex
i m a woman i hate the pressure to orgasm especially if a guy tells me to cum trying to be sexy even if i m about to cum might make me lose my orgasm i m on medicine that makes it very hard to orgasm since going on it i ve gone from maybe a rate to about a rate i still love sex even if i don t orgasm i know my orgasms are an accomplishment and turn on for the guy but please please don t make it feel expected because then i feel pressured and feel bad if i can t let s just do the best we can if it happens it happens if it doesn t i still loved it let s just relax and enjoy sex

yeeees omg it s the worst especially when i peed before anything edit y all this is one of my most upvoted comments and it s about peeing lmfao edit this is officially my most upvoted comment i d like to thank my parents and my dogs and everyone who has had to pee after sex
sounds like it pisses you off
yes in a perfect world we d just lay there and cuddle nude for hours after damn responsibilities

an older woman wearing the most foul smelling perfume my nose has smelled it was a hour flight i felt like throwing up from my headache a few hours in
look this isn t the worst per se but until this happened it wasn t even something i would have considered before on a long flight akl lax i was sitting at the back of a on the side so there were only two seats the guy next to me was a very pleasant and interesting brit we talked for a while he explained that at that time it was cheaper to fly to the caribbean buy a boat and then sail it back to nz than it was to just buy it there so that s what he was doing but as you d expect on a hour flight eventually the lights dim and nearly everyone sleeps here s my problem with this guy that i liked up to that point he was a snuggler i woke up times during that flight with him dead asleep on my shoulder and snuggling with my arm his hand in my armpit the fact that he was a heavy sleeper i pushed him off me all times and it didn t even seem to impact his sleep in the least probably made things even worse for me at the end of the flight his attitude and demeanor hadn t changed in the least so i sincerely doubt he even knew what he d done
i once had the people behind me change their toddler s poopy diaper right there at the seat and oh god it was awful we all turned the vents on to blow it away but it was pretty futile people were gagging
people who don t wear headphones
i recently sat by a girl who kept blowing her snotty nose into her fingers
there was a guy on one of the travel reddits arguing that if his legspace is a little too small because of the way the row in front of him s seat legs are bolted to the floor he should be able to put his feet on the other side of those seat legs in his neighbors foot space so probably that guy

a tall person with really long legs i realize it s not their fault but i don t like being touched and having to sit through a flight with someone s knees pressed against mine is not fun
sitting in the airport right now killing time before a flight and these responses are making me nervous edit got home safe and sound the people i sat with were great united on the other hand made me gate check my carry on even though i was in boarding group which i was only in because i paid extra for priority boarding we were only halfway through boarding group when the lady at the desk announced that there was no more space in the overhead compartment and everyone from about people in front of me on had to check anything that wouldn t fit under the seat i get on board and get in my seat and lo and behold there s all sorts of empty space in the overhead compartments i don t even care that the flight was delayed and i m home late but that shit made me livid

the worst person i ve ever sat next to decided to cut a sandwich with chopsticks took them a solid minutes of sawing while elbowing me to get through it for being a small person they somehow managed to be constantly in my personal space and later on cried and screamed like a child when the flight attendant took their drink from them due to rough turbulence i stayed on the flight at the connection and the flight attendant came up after she had gotten off the plane and apologized to me
i m usually more worried about who sits behind or in front of me

i am totally okay understanding that you can t completely control when a baby cries what you can control is how you re reacting to it i ve seen awful parents on planes who will bitch and nag at their own child for crying saying stuff like oh my god please just stop shut up why are you even crying bro you chose to have this baby you chose to bring them on a plane i doubt being angry with them will make them calm down kind parents who softly shush and comfort their crying child are wayyy better than bullying parents second worst is someone who disregards hygiene before jumping on board
heavy smoker who oozes nicotine stank from every pore
a person who gets up every minutes
i travel with earplugs so even crying babies don t much bother me my friend was on a flight where he was required by the flight attendant to lift his armrest because the morbidly obese passenger next to him couldn t fit in his own seat so the entire flight he had a fat arm hip and leg pressed against him for me the worst is a smelly person please shower and or take a beano before flying

an influencer
it was i was they were months it was my lifelong dream vacation to see my beloved buckingham palace and my goal was to make one of the queens guard laugh i was so tired when i got off the plane that i couldnt think of anything funny to say
i don t care what someone looks like their body and health are their business but on a flight home last year i was seated away from my partner in a window seat very much not a fan i prefer aisle next to a man who was easily over 400lbs i was afraid the poor wisp of a woman in the aisle seat was going to pop out of the row like a tiddlywink when the plane started moving because she was already leaning out into the aisle just to be able to sit fully over on my side my ass was shoved up against the wall of the plane literally half sideways just so i could take a full breath i think the flight attendant saw the panic i was feeling because she told the woman on the end that there was an open seat she could move to and that let the guy next to me move over to the aisle seat after that i had no issues but good fucking god that was probably the worst person i ve ever sat next to just by default

ive only really ever had two bad flight experiences one involved a very large woman that needed a seatbelt extender and her body took up a significant portion of my space thankfully it was only a two hour flight cue the fuckheads accusing me of body shaming the second was a return trip from narita to lax i somehow had lucked into sitting in an empty row i was stoked a guy behind me who had been coughing and sneezing since he got on the plane noticed this about an hour into the flight and decided he d sit in my row i dont know what the fuck he had but as soon as i got home i fell ill i missed a week of work due to this asshole if youre fucking sick stay off of airplanes
a desperate woman in her late s who thinks you re rich and keeps asking you personal questions and showing you her pics on her phone and cursing the flight because she cannot show you her instagram at the same time being rude to the flight crew personal experience
it is a real toss up between someone who is too fat for just their seat and someone who is passionate about their mlm as a bonus sometimes these are the same person

smelly person also a person that gets air sick
talkative people i just want to go to sleep and get where i m going i don t want to hear about your life story and i don t want to share mine
i was once standing in line waiting to be boarded when these two women passed by me to go use the restroom as they did i caught a whiff of them and my nose started burning they smelled absolutely disgusting and in my head i thought to myself how unlucky the person sitting next to them will be and as i had that thought i knew that i was going to be the unlucky loser who will sit next to either one of them because my luck is always the worst i did for hours for a couple of months later i would involuntarily gag whenever i would remember the smell and how she sat criss cross in the seat and her wriggling toes touched my knee
been flying for years on the job by far worst is smelly feet guy who takes off their shoes
someone who s sick you know you re gonna get it by pure proximity
people that bring their own food onto a plane the wrapper is always enormous and it always smells horrible no matter what
the american guy i was sat next to on my first international flight alone as a very nervous flyer with more turbulence than i m used to telling me my wedding ring its a tungsten ring that does not at all look like a wedding ring should be on the other finger for my destination because that s what they do in germany then asked me what i was getting for my meal i said i don t eat on planes so he says get this because i want the dessert and orders for me and takes my food what the fuck dude
sorry parents but people with fussy crying children
late to the thread but i was once stuck in a middle seat on a hour flight from singapore to frankfurt blocked in by the occupant of the aisle seat a very obese woman who was both very smelly her body odor combined with garlic indian spices that emanated from her were inescapable and to top it off she had an injury that made her unable to get up to let anyone in our row out to go to the bathroom it was the longest most uncomfortable flight in years of travel yes i was in coach class i m not a small guy myself and to fit in that middle seat i had to hunch my shoulders forward to fit it was miserable the icing on the cake was that the pilot came over the intercom as we were landing in frankfort to say that to stay on schedule for the next leg to ny he was asking everyone to remain seated so they could refuel and get back in the air i demanded to be moved to another seat or let off the plane to be rebooked on the next flight to new york they found me a new seat thank god
any person that s going to pee on you or worse https://nypost.com/2023/03/06/drunk-student-urinated-on-passenger-on-american-airlines-flight/

i ll never forget as long as i fucking live the flight from long beach airport to new orleans la for my honeymoon my newlywed wife and i were on separate sides of the aisle i was in the middle on the starboard side and she had a window seat on the port side of the plane to my right is a nice girl and to my left nothing holy shit i think this could be the fucking dream the plane is almost full and they re about to close the doors when the biggest fattest most unkempt looking motherfucker i ve ever seen enters the plane greasy nasty looking clothes look like they haven t been washed in weeks no less than pounds and i m being generous oh fuck no fucking way i think as he waddles down the aisle past several empty seats he stops next to me its fucking over he crams his luggage into the overhead and sits next to me the fucking smell hits and he has to sit the entire flight with his right arm folded across his body this doesn t stop the torrent of sideboob and back of the arm flab invading my world even the girl next to me smelled it because i glanced over and she has this look on her face like she stepped in shit with both shoes she wraps herself in a blanket and turns towards the window i have no such escape the flight was hours long and i spent the entire time wishing i was dead my wife on the other hand sits next to this amazingly handsome fit man and has a wonderful chat pretty much the whole flight with him fuck it i m still salty almost years later
a person in their first week to month of taking metformin for diabetes
years ago we were about an hour into a flight the guy next to me opened a greasy bag full of buffalo wings he proceeded to spend the next minutes eating an entire bag of room temperature wings with his fingers complete with multiple dips in blue cheese sauce for each wing licking his fingers small burps the smell was unbelievably strong in the enclosed area franks hot sauce and blue cheese i was in the middle seat literally right next to him people wings are not a good option for airplane food vinegary salads fish shawarma gyros also bad ideas he then fell asleep without washing his hands of course fucking disgusting
a child sorry not sorry
fat that spills into your chair and squeezes your side

cracks knuckles storytime going to europe with my then gf first time on an international flight the flight is fully booked i m stuck in the very back row against the bathrooms so the seat doesn t recline but at least i have a window seat a very large western european possibly portuguese girl lpg comes to my row she s in the middle seat behind her is a young skinny black guy sbg he s got the aisle she tries to sit down and can t fit in the seat sbg could barely even put a butt cheek on his seat lpg is clearly mortified and turning red and about to cry the attendant said if she can t sit she ll have to take another flight being raised a certain way i offer her the window since it has an extra inch or so of space and we might be able to all fit she agrees we switch spots lpg is so large her thighs were still spilling over into my seat so much that the armrest couldn t go down she also couldn t put her knees together and was sitting kinda bow legged the smell was that obese person scent that happens when not every nook and cranny gets a proper cleaning i crossed my right foot over my left and i put my right arm in my lap sbg on the other hand smells like a hobo dressed like he was out at a rave the night before he was not friendly and passed out before the plane took off he started twitching in his slumber and sweating profusely from everywhere the smell wasn t just b o it was some kind of drug s he has passed out arms at his side paims up i put my left arm in my lap i sat like that for hours my then gf came back to check on me since she got a seat up near the front she was in the aisle and sat next to a friendly english pensioner who bought her a glass of wine and exchanged travel stories with her i was not impressed she tucked tail and ran back to nigel or whatever the hell his name was to enjoy some more wine she later said she felt terrible and thought about offering a switch halfway through the flight but decided she didn t want to put herself through that i wouldn t have let her anyway but the offer would have been nice tl dr super obese people are not fun to sit beside and neither are druggies going through withdrawal
one time i american got a middle seat between an orthodox jewish man and a muslim man on a flight from istanbul to home i love learning of other cultures so i was intrigued at first then they both simultaneously took off their shoes and set their feet into my leg room they proceeded to both take out their holy books and recite their prayers very loudly i put in the headphones and attempted to nap while the boiling pot of sweaty religious feet infiltrated the airways

diarrhea from chemo patients smells horrific
worst smell i was a plumber s assistant once and we got a call where someone had tried to put pounds of cooked spaghetti down a garbage disposal it didn t work their solution was to pour a package of enzymes bacteria on it in hopes it would dissolve it it didn t work so several days later we show up to a sink full of partially digested putrid swampy spaghetti after clearing the sink and disposal we had to empty the grease trap these are notorious for smelling bad but with the spaghetti and enzymes this was something else peppermint was had it was like popping open a casket that had been exhumed from the swamps where the person wanted to be buried with cantaloupes his pet cat ronald and a bucket of the contents from his favorite porta potty

my packed lunch after school vacation
smelled and touched through double disbosable gloves i worked a summer in a small kiosk on a public beach more of a hole really at the bottom of a sand pit that filled with ground water sold coffee and ice cream the job included taking care of the public bathrooms in the same building the ladies side had two booths with a toilet seat for whatever reason the men s side had one booth with a toilet seat and another with just a urinal the light bulb had burnt out in the one with the toilet seat i hadn t been told where to find spare light bulbs or even if there were any so i called my boss about it he said he s change it but he didn t for several days so one day when i checked the toilets before locking up someone had shat in the urinal a good healthy log at least as wide across as a ping pong ball i call my boss he says well that s a bit of a shitty situation hehe he doesn t laugh he literally utters the word by the way there are light bulbs in this drawer in that cupboard so being the dumb year old who took the piece of shit job in the first place i set out to cleaning it up i only have disposable gloves tissue paper at least it s the strong abrasive kind plastic bags and run of the mill liquid detergent to work with i double glove up and take a good look at the thing i m surprised by how tolerable the smell is kids if you ever have to clean up a log of shit don t be fooled by this once you break the dried up skin the smell is way worse dude had had corn i remember thinking how disgusting it was that it was cold but then again warm wouldn t have been much better would it almost threw up trying to shimmy it into a plastic bag without breaking it up and smearing it any more than i absolutely had to somehow i got through it i marked down two extra hours for that and the boss didn t seem to mind
the first house i was ever in a position to own was a house bought from i m not going to say a friend but someone my wife and i knew we were looking for a first home and it was impossible on our salaries the guy was going bankrupt however and was being forced to sell his home nobody else wanted it because it needed a lot of work and even the bankruptcy courts recognised that we were the best way that they d secure a decent price for the place cue months of paperwork stress and hassle in order to obtain a poorly kept house in a poor area just to get on the property ladder when we first visited the bankruptcy actions were still in full swing we were taking a huge risk getting that far and were basically betting our deposit and all our fees and other expenses that we could complete and the bankruptcy court would accept our offer that was by no means certain we could have lost it all the first visit was in the summer and with our mortgage surveyor it was to let him assess the property was worth what they were willing to lend us it was but only barely the highlights dead rabbits buried in the back yard the guy was a rabbit breeder he was basically bankrupt so he couldn t keep the rabbits alive and they all got myxomatosis and died even months later we were getting visits from the rspca because they had received reports of animal abuse at the property and were too slow to do anything about it literally the grass grew to six feet tall that summer all the dead rabbits their hay feed etc in the grass make it go insane the guy hadn t lived at the property in months because he couldn t afford the bills the power was cut off the rabbits died the water was cut off the sewage backed up the garden overgrew and the freezer had been full of meat that meat was now a lovely liquid red sheen all over the floor that had been left there for no exaggeration months the stench was horrendous it had leaked into everything covered everything was dripping off everything rotten meat liquid was condensing on the walls in the heat of summer his dog had been allowed to roam loose for weeks without him there because he d abandoned the place there was dog shit dozens of piles in every single room of the house left to rot for months and shit from a dog that had been feasting on rotten meat you can imagine flies mites roaches rats you name it everything in a ten mile radius knew that there was a rich harvest of dead rotting meat in that entire property for months and they d got in bred and were still feasting on it all the guy had hung the little sticky fly strips from the ceiling to try to catch some of the flies the fly strips were all black with dead bodies when we got there and effectively useless as there wasn t a single dot of sticky strip left visible under the dead flies for the alive ones to be trapped by he d taken to eating takeaway food yeah no money only because of the state of the place even before he abandoned it there were pizza boxes on the kitchen table it s not an exaggeration to say they were touching the fly strips that hung from the ceiling they were stacked that high most had pieces of pizza still in them there were easily boxes so that s months of food waste even if you assume one per day on the days he bothered to visit the property the bath had inches of backed up sewage in it the curtains were literally rotting as was anything fabric there was even dog shit on the bed covers and on the clothing when we met up with the mortgage surveyor we had been then an hour already and we warned him he put on a little mask and everything he was obviously unfazed by bad houses he vomited immediately when he entered the stench just got him immediately over the course of the next hour he spent about of his time vomiting actually surveying without touching anything the rest having to walk away from the house to recover and get fresh air we got the house it was very close and there were still bankruptcy and repossession notices being attached to the front door right up until the last moment we took an enormous risk but it paid off the families both came to help clean up we bought head to toe white overalls masks gloves the lot the neighbours literally told us that they assumed we were forensics teams because they had been reporting the stench for months and hadn t seen anyone come and go and they assumed the guy had died in there the nearest neighbours were getting all the rats maggots etc too coming through their floors and walls we cleaned it up we laid new floors and replaced the bath and repaired the building and did so much work on the place with zero heating even getting the utilities back on was a huge expense and conditional on us being able to make it sanitary for workmen to attend we gutted the place we bleached everything to within an inch of its life threw away anything that we could replaced everything we could afford to the kitchen ended up looking amazing a few months later we would have to turn the spare bedroom into a nursery the nursery was beautiful even more so if you were able to remember the dogshit stained bed covers dripping onto the floor and disturbing the thousands of flies i still have a photo of the nursery we made it was beautiful that was my daughter s first ever home sadly my wife and i split up about a year later nothing to do with the house or anything else i gave the property entirely to my ex wife she sold it and bought a place in cornwall rural england for those who don t know for herself and my daughter then sold that and they emigrated to spain just before brexit there s no way we could have done that without that house starting us off the reason she moved out originally the local gangs started trashing the house they kicked down our front wall and throwing stones at her and the baby when they were walking around the local town that s the kind of area it was where a bunch of teenagers would just pelt a random woman and baby with stones in the street and nothing would happen but i m sorry i don t know whatever else people have posted here i guarantee you that it s nothing compared to trying to clean up that place

my parents were once in a rather bad traffic accident and there had been a lot of blood their insurance company demanded that their blood soaked clothes were preserved for documentation and that a list of items and brands were made so the clothes with the blood was stored in a large plastic sack while they were in the hospital which was a considerable time so when they got out of hospital they turned to me for help this is when i learned about the sack of bloody clothes that had been fermenting for a month or two long story short i undertook the task of cataloging the ruined items that is so far the worst smell i ve encountered a sweet pungent smell of pure dread that lingered in the nose i assume that it resembled the smell of a rotting corpse though i have no experience with that i had to take regular breaks just to get through it the kicker is that when the insurance company received the list they were all like oh we expected to get the usual list of high end designer brands that people send us but these are all budget brands you don t need to preserve the ruined items gee thanks for telling us
one time i got sprayed by a skunk from about feet away with my mouth open it s all i could smell and taste for weeks

i used to teach 7th grade science it was my first year ever teaching x200b as we approached the end of the year i asked the other science teacher if it was possible to do frog dissections or something similar to end the year on a high note as it turned out we had a whole closet full of frogs just waiting to be hastily torn asunder i counted up all of the containers of frogs sealed buckets planned out the ratio of kids per frog gathered all of the tools etc etc etc x200b what i forgot to do was check the buckets x200b the day went swimmingly kids were grossed out by the frogs and then having to cut apart those same frogs we discussed why you can t drink the liquid in the buckets formaldehyde filled the air and children probably lost some brain cells and learning was had until fourth period x200b the students entered the room as i was collecting the final buckets of frogs from the closet they gathered round ponderously rumors aswirl awaiting the treasures within i laid each bucket upon its respective table and students formed into their cliques at said tables everything was perfect it was time to start the lesson x200b until a student raised his hand and had a question is it okay that our bucket is open well let s find out i said aloud to the class for the first and last ever time as it turns out that particular bucket had already been opened the seal was broken and the bucket had obviously been exposed to the elements but hand shut after the fact x200b i didn t find this out until afterward but apparently nobody had touched these buckets of frogs in many years they had been in that closet longer than the head of the department had worked at the school the fact that one of them was opened means it was contaminated and left there for a very long time x200b as we opened the bucket we saw simply a grey black chunky sludge it kind of looked like mud and it kind of looked like axle grease and it kind of looked like mayonnaise the looks however are not the important part x200b as soon as that bucket was opened an incredibly powerful smell exploded into the room it was unlike anything i even knew was possible i ve smelled septic tanks bogs decaying animals skunks and whatever else you can think of those are all perfume compared to this smell x200b i uncontrollably vomited immediately students all around me uncontrollably vomited immediately the sights and smells of vomiting along with the bog of eternal stench caused other kids to uncontrollably vomit which then caused further vomiting x200b the stench filled up the entire hall classes had to evacuate the building x200b x200b x200b somehow i actually won teacher of the year that year

smell i ve already told the story on here of the dead rotting cat we dug up taste only things that ever made me vomit when i ate them was tuna casserole and bbq eel touch probably deer guts my dad used to make fun of me because i used to put on gloves to clean the deer but he would go in barehanded like a man seen there were some pretty disgusting pictures on rotten com https://rotten.com). if we ignore that and only go for in person stuff maybe that enormous heroin shit that i saw outside a restaurant in seattle

there s a line in be our guest that specifies years we ve been rusting meaning they ve been enchanted for years at that point chip is pretty clearly well under when they break the spell and he becomes human which means that either the spell also froze their ages in time or the teapot version of mrs potts both conceived a teacup child with who what and gave birth at some point also there was a cupboard full of teacup children that weren t given names that also appeared to be under mrs potts s care what s the deal with those kids
marlin from finding nemo is delusional with grief the barracuda ate his wife and every egg nemo is a hallucination that manifests his grief and his journey to find nemo is actually a metaphor for him finding himself again and traversing the stages of grief nemo means nobody in latin captain hook is actually the good guy in peter pan he s trying to stop peter from kidnapping more children meanwhile peter is keeping the lost boys hostages as his own and gets upset if they ever bring up their old lives kai the butler confidant and royal advisor in arendelle is actually a spy prince hans of the southern isles knows how to manipulate princess anna far too easily and too quickly without inside help for example kai most likely overheard anna running down the halls and singing about shoving chocolates in her face later hans sings to anna about chocolate fondue kai told hans everything he would need to woo the naive girl who was desperate for love it s especially odd that hans says no one was getting anywhere with elsa a royal advisor would consult with elsa about possible marital prospects and an insider would be able to clue hans in lastly a royal advisor would also most likely be consulted about handling hans s punishment and to save his own skin and buy silence he allowed hans to return home where he would basically face no justice
i think scar would have definitely mated with sarabi and nala think about it simba was gone for like years in lion prides the lead male would breed with multiple lionesses to make sure his line is intact sarabi was the previous queen and nala a prime choice as a young female scar for sure had ample opportunity to continue his line

peter pan is a story about how you re not supposed to trust the fay think about it he spirits kids off to neverland or they never have to grow up or come back home you aren t supposed to go with him because you lose your family like how you re not supposed to follow will of the wisps
they re doing another live action adaptation that thar is disturbing
it s technically disney pixar but a popular theory states that boo from monsters university traveled back in time through the monsters doors which are actually time portals she went back to the time of brave and became the old witch evidence being a carved etching of sully in the witch hut in addition to the overall sense it makes with the pixar theory
you know how a lot of disney character s mother are dead did you know that walt disney indirectly killed his mother
ariel s mother was killed by captain hook and his crew the mermaids in peter pan obviously have had some traumatic experiences with the pirates and in the little mermaid ariel s mother is nowhere to be found it s not a stretch to extrapolate that these movies could take place in the same universe and if so that ariel s mother could have had a run in with the jolly roger that also could further explain triton being so extremely protective
aristocats the butler drugging the cats to inherit their fortune is pretty creepy

doesn t apply to the disney version but the original book states that peter pan kills lost boys whenever they seem to start growing up
lastly a royal advisor would also most likely be consulted about handling hans s punishment and to save his own skin and buy silence he allowed hans to return home where he would basically face no justice well theres little actual evidence of any real wrongdoing the most theyd have is annas word that he put out the fire while she was turning to ice so sending him back home would have been a smart move to avoid any political ramifications and thats assuming he really did face no justice he was 13th in line for the throne if his family thought there was any chance of him taking actions against other countries like that there is a good chance hed get disowned or imprisoned
there s a theory behind finding nemo that s even more fucked up from wikipedia anemonefish are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites meaning they develop into males first and when they mature they become females if the female anemonefish is removed from the group such as by death one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female the remaining males move up a rank in the hierarchy what does that mean with marlin s wife dead he will become the female and the largest surviving male would become her new mate and with nemo as the only other clownfish in the area marlin is so desperate to find nemo because she needs him to mate with
nemo means nobody in latin while true that doesn t actually make sense there is an animated movie about a boy called little nemo besides latin itself is not commonly spoken anymore captain hook is actually the good guy in peter pan i heard once somewhere don t know if it s true that captain hook and the other pirates were once lost boys that escaped peter pan but if you never grow up in neverland then the pirates and the native americans don t make sense

the timeline of cars fits into the extended pixar universe in it the modern era of toy story shows that toys are alive and sentient and reflexively hide this from humans at some point the buy large corporation takes over the world produces so much trash the world becomes uninhabitable and the last remnants of humanity either flee the planet or go extinct giant automated factories building cars still exist and since cars are just fancy toys they re sentient by toy story rules with no humans around they re free to drive themselves around and build a whole society eventually they clean up enough of the planet to make it look normal plant life has existed on earth for some time but eve drones have always been intercepted by auto keeping the axiom in deep space other buy large ships are either still out there or suffered some critical failure in the past years eventually the humans from the axiom are going to come face to face with the car society they left behind who knows they ll think about that

in fairness they re based on super old fairy tales where when people dies at like to them was to us not saying it s okay they defiantly should have translated it for a modern audience it s just super interesting to see the difference
i mean aren t they canonically confirmed in universe not a theory to begin with
emperor kuzco was a teenager too
do you have a link couldn t find it with google
it s also possible that they appear the same to us but are different species like how chimps and humans look quite similar but have vastly different mental capacities
goofy is a cow dude
goofy is also the only one of the original gang being mickey minnie donald daisy and goofy that doesn t have a girlfriend there are times where he does but rarely yet somehow much later on he ends up with a son max the show goof troop is about goofy being a single father raising his son max max doesn t have a mother though
it gets worse peter pan feeds on the children s memories he is the only one who does not age when the children get too old peter thins the herd or they escape to become pirates having lost all memory of who they were captain hook is the good guy
wasn t his fault
how
in one of the straight to dvd prequels they show ariel s mom died by getting crushed by a ship
not to ruin the theory but is neverland in denmark tho
that s not a movie theory that s a plot point
was he going to drown them or just set them in an empty place if they hadn t been thrown out of the cart
can t wait for the anne frank musical where they beat hitler in the end
well that s fucked seeing as triton and ursula are siblings
that s what they mean when they say that he liked to play craps
that one s been proven wrong it s not even a lion skull he has and lions don t just eat other lions
cringe
who punishes an year old that severely for being selfish
next time i close my cabinet and hear the coffee cups rattle they are sneaking in a quickie
one of the original books not the original and they don t explicitly say he kills them just that he thins them out and the implication is that he banishes them he does however kill several pirates
nope
what i heard is that peter pan is the only one who never grows up basically if and when a lost boy gets too old peter pan kills them since he doesn t allow his friends to grow up and that s where the pirates come from they are lost boys that escaped peter trying to kill them
yup
why in the wild makes are often forced out of the pride around years old or so nature s way to limit inbreeding
i think its actually to put the females in heat they arent down for babymaking while busy raising one
if the female cubs have already reached sexual maturity there s a chance the juvenile will be left alive but yeah no infant cub would be left alive
life uh finds a way
really what did i miss
i love how they redeem all the other villains in the twisted song but they still cant find a good reason for why cruella wanted to make a coat out of puppies
no it s got weight in a young child believes something odd way she says that pudge controls the weather which is why she gives him sandwiches so she does so in the hopes that pudge gives good weather and webb reason she is so obsessed was because her parents were driving when they had their accident hitting a wet patch or a puddle which caused them to crash
my bad thanks
here for the dbz abridged reference
the homicide rate in the republic of iceland is the lowes in the world by comparison the usa is the 129th safest country in the world the republic of chile has a much lower homicide rate than the usa so low in fact it s the second lowest of any american nation beaten only by canada

i don t say anything i just make the thx noise
not something that i said but in high school a few friends and i tried to convince another friend to call out coooookie crisp in his best imitation of that mascot right before he finished just to see how his girlfriend would react he wasn t on board at first though he thought it was funny but eventually he relented and said he would my next logical step was to tell the girlfriend what was planned and suggest she beat him to the punch she agreed immediately i don t remember exactly what happened afterward but i m fairly sure we found out it happened when the guy greeted us with you sons of bitches one day i hope they re both doing well in the world

everyone getting married i was one of the last of the gang to get hitched as each of of the gang got married we stopped really ever seeing them again it wasn t like their partners weren t familiar with us many of them were part of the same group of friends but once those rings went on poof they were gone even after i got married none of the gang seemed to want to get back in touch and everyone basically went off and had separate lives virtually none of the original gang hangs out together now so i know it isn t just me
they all died within a month to be clear they were all older guys i was about group of friends i had in my building we d have coffee everyday and watch a few sitcoms and chat fred died first which was sad but the dude was nearly then terry died he had a couple chronic conditions and a chemo treatment fucked everything up and then a couple weeks dave died from complications caused by complex regional pain disorder for him death was a mercy
two of us got in relationships and just vanished i get it honeymoon period is a hell of a drug but it hurts to know that some people are one good date away from forgetting they have friends
one of us broke up my sister s marriage and started immediately dating her after she kicked her husband out and they tried to act like nothing happened
grad school finished and we all scattered
a casual game of monopoly that got heated near the end i3 of us still keep in touch since but that was the beginning of the end i still think it would be a fun bands reunited type of show if we got back together
they were still throwing handfuls of cocaine up their nose and drinking absurd amounts every weekend well into their late 20s i d just had enough and wanted to be able to socialise with people without being off my nut
i ve got a buddy who came home to find his wife receiving oral from another buddies wife haven t really seen that group much since
on more than one occasion a pairing within the friend group that ended in a nasty breakup
one friend started dating one of the other friends ex blew apart a year friendship we had between four of us since grade school we all live within miles of each other but none of us have talked to any of the others in over years
they all got rich i did not
when they formed a secret inner circle separately from the rest of the group
i made a mile round trip by car to visit a friend let s call him mike who was in the hospital recovering from a heart transplant the very first thing mike said to me was that i should have had a heart attack instead of him and then proceeded to talk shit about me for a minute or two right to my face i have made a point to avoid him and the other two friends in the friend group ever since hanging out with any one member of the group inevitably involves visits to mike something i don t particularly feel like doing
trust issues and communication breakdown can end any friend group
good group of three of us that hung out almost everyday in high school and through college all local one of us met a girl online from another state completely hid her from us like literally at one point she was staying with him for a full month and during that time even being in his house we had no idea and up and moved across the country to go live with her without saying a word the other two of us found out the day before he was moving when his brother casually let it slip in conversation and when trying to reach out to have one last hang he didn t bother to even return our calls dude i knew from middle school and all through college he was super into getting absolutely plastered and doing soft drugs which is fine you do you but whenever he d do those things he d either make an ass out of himself by trying to sleep with other people s girlfriends or try to start fights loved the dude to death and to this date if he came to me for help i would help him but i just can t be near that kind of shit constantly as an adult
a trip to miami lmfao
the friend who was the glue of the group moved to the other coast and one of the couples broke up the same weekend i tried to invite the old gang to a birthday party and the only one who showed up was the one who moved
highschool graduation
we all graduated college and went back to the different towns states that we came from
they both joined the fucking army
time going our own separate ways in life
one of them was mad at another one of them fake names evan was mad at chris because he blamed chris for getting fired from giant tech company reality evan is just an idiot and got himself fired for never once taking the job seriously so even refused to hang out with chris chris refused to hang out with evan john and mark were friends with evan first me and cassy were friends with chris first friend group split in two over evan being an idiot and not realizing that one of the top tech firms in the world wont tolerate childish antics by childish antics i mean putting styrofoam on his head placing annoyance toys around the office everyone is still friends with everyone else except evan and chris but evan s friends refuse to hang out with any of us if there is more than of us as that would be breaking evan s trust everyone in this story is over
our wives gfs couldn t get along
covid wrecked a lot of my social life we had a weekly game night and weekly trivia night and a few other semi regular events and none of them have come back a lot of my friends have gotten married or started families over the pandemic so it s possible that maybe this was going to happen anyway but it sucks to go from a pretty thriving social routine to nothing i still have friends and we still do things together but i miss the regularity we used to have
we were lesbians two started dating and broke up leaving me w both of them but separately i started also dating the one i was closest w and we broke up too
dating an ex girlfriend of a friend
kids one of the couples got pregnant and within a couple of months it basically went from of us down to can t complain though the of us are living much better lives now
everyone slowly started disliking each other and we eventually all grew apart
growing up i had a good core group of friends i d spend time with near daily as time went on we grew up some of them had kids long term relationships i m lucky to talk to them once a year now i m equally at fault i m married and do my own thing most of the time
guys get into relationships then disappear
getting married having kids i had a great group of friends when i first started working out of college we had so much fun but one by one we paired off got married and had kids those friendships are but a distant memory now we re all facebook friends and exchange christmas cards but it s not the same
drugs slowly but surely everybody just wanted to be alone when they smoked weed
the most narcissistic members of our group decided it d be a good idea to get together but only one of them thought it was a relationship chaos ensued and we dropped both their asses but there was collateral damage our group is smaller now for sure but fucking hell is it better without their drama
i had a very large group of friend than they all got jobs and relationships found other friends also we acted dumb to one another and eventually vanished and now it s just me and other friends honestly i miss the good old summer days with the boys but when you are near your s you eventually start to change and have different goals in life i m guess i m lucky to still have some friends near my s
they turned out to be full on truthers they believed that the airplanes were holographic hiding cruise missiles sent by bush to fool the world into thinking muslims did it i asked what about the people inside the airplanes they said holographic people too end of friendship
we stopped partying together
twice now a friend group has been torn apart by a romance within it and then a really bad breakup i miss everyone hanging out together
i asked my two best friends to be my co best men at my wedding i haven t heard from one of them since he agreed years now had been friends for years the other one also bailed on the wedding the week of but he at least let me know we talk occasionally but i still can t really forgive him
i had a close friend group myself and three friends i had since high school we d always remained pretty close but life causes you to drift apart a bit but we d always get together when we could i moved across the country but we all tried to stay in contact then donald trump became president two of my friends seemingly overnight became absolute right wing lunatics and one of them blocked me on social media and stopped talking to me because i was making fun of trump they didn t even reach out to me when i was in the hospital after a stroke it kind of hurt honestly because i was always willing to put up with their nonsense and was fiercely loyal to my friends no matter what but i guess shit happens i m still incredibly close with my best friend from the group we re like brothers he found out he had cancer recently and had to have a kidney removed and i was the only person outside of family who knew anything about it until the day of we talk all the time and are about as close as two straight dudes can be
three things happening all at once one of them graduated engineering and gone to work for brazil s petroleum provider right off the bat which was a position with constant moving across the country so that was the more forgiving the least forgiving was the one who dated one of ours then backstabbed em with a one night fling because they were very libertine before having a relationship and thought this would be no big deal it was a huge deal and the third happened to myself only over another betrayal my father to my mother had to take care of her since then helping around the house mostly as muscle and handyman which meant moving back to her house and abandon everything including my career because it was too far way from the suburb she lives at have been stuck in this position ever since no job this place only got informal oddjobs that pay scraps and no friends offline on the flipside i actually got on a romantic situation that the scumbag from the second bullet point would bite themself dead in a fit of jealousy going ten years strong now so i got that going
i was suicidal and they couldn t handle it
most of us left the job we met through over a short period of time and then our dnd group collapsed because of covid and bad group dynamics now i only talk to one of those guys consistently and we hang out a lot but everyone else is scattered
i got another job and quit
business
i moved away it was always me that did the group text each weekend of where we were going and what time we were all meeting to the point my wife suggested that i try not sending out the message and seeing if anyone else made a decision no one did i moved about miles up the road and couldn t be there every week so people stopped going out so much then people drifted away
my childhood best friend started making up horrible lies about her father and i managed to spot one of her lies she said that her father died in a car accident years ago and i had actually met him me and another person stopped being friends with her
these comments make me happy that my friends and i have still survived after years nowadays we don t really hangout near as much once every few months which is normal we are busy but they are still the same people i always knew really opened my eyes to why we survived we are all within a year gap so we never really had any sort of girlfriend problems we have all disappeared for short periods of time but we never forget we don t ever talk to each others ex s easy to do because of the age gap and little involvement we have in each others other relationships
my first college roommate had a mental breakdown she started following me and our friends around and spying on our conversations to see if we were talking about her behind her back she always wanted to know what we were doing and where we were going things came to a head when she threatened to kill us and screamed at us for a good hour while threatening to cut her wrists in front of us we all kind of fell apart after that dealing with the trauma in our ways
when we were younger we had a pretty sizable group of guys that would play sports after school then two guys dated the same girl back to back and then the group split ways as the group took sides and then i was left by myself as i was usually the neutral party that coordinated everything
a sequence of facts one friend got married and didn t have time for us anymore one friend had to move to another town far away and the me and my then gf we were both part of the group broke up and no we didn t stay friends after break up after that it was just me and another friend that is until he got a job in another town
first major friend group was high school one friend was a day away from his year long deployment when he told his wife he had been cheating on her for a long time and was going to file for divorce when he returned made her and her kids move back home to deal with it by herself friend group split based on who s side they were on second major friend group was college after graduation we all kind of split our own separate ways and stopped seeing each other daily third major friend group was online gamer friends we all just slowly started playing different games from each other and i m now a father of and married so i don t have nearly as much free time so long story short life
the passage of time while only one friend actually got himself ousted for genuine reasons the rest of us just got older and more consumed by adult obligations growing up really does suck
i used to hang out with friends every single day after work we would smoke weed play video games and drink some beers it was pretty chill i went back to school and since then i ve managed to get married start a family and quadruple my income they re still smoking and drinking and playing video games sometimes you just outgrow people
trump
marriages
half of them od ed
half of us decided to live together
college kids work
a friend used his wife s breast cancer as an opportunity to try to sell us overpriced water filtration systems for our health so you will never have to go through what we went through some of us thought that was going way too far others defended him
my friend and her boyfriends sexual preferences which she just told me about like it was carrots
the lease of the house we all lived in together was up for renewal without ever discussing it before or really airing any grievances or anything we all agreed that we were done with this housemate thing after we all moved out we kept up appearances of being friends for maybe a couple of months
my wife and i started doing very well financially and we were ostracized for some reason
seeing many comments about losing friends when they get a girlfriend while i understand the sentiment i am more happy for them and try to ask them about to double dates etc significant others usually like to feel like the other friend group really accepts them this is not the case for everyone of course in terms of gaming friends i ve been on both sides of the same coin but you know your real friends when you can waddle back in and it s like nothings changed i understand the resentment of feeling like a friendship has died and some of them will and have because of different priorities but the few you have that immediately invite you to the party when you haven t been on for months or even years are the ones that you cherish for a lifetime them on discord have them on facebook or ig visit them once if you can if the bridge is strong from the beginning it ll survive the storm
maga
one member decided after years of life that she was trans and not just trans but militant trans you know they type were everything that happens in the world is a slight against her and people like her even or should i say especially when it had absolutely nothing to do with her or any of us yeah like that suddenly everything became a political rant of hers she was our dm for our monthly d d game over discord we re spread out all over the country but we all liked to play other games together too i had rented a server for various online games conan exiles days to die valheim to name a few for all of us to play on without having to worry about griefers so we were all in regular contact she unfortunately just got to be too much for people to handle and we all got tired of walking on eggshells around her one by one people stopped gaming with the rest of the group one guy even deleted his d d beyond character she s got herself a new circle of friends anyway since she came out as trans so we doubt she even misses us sadly she was the reason we all knew each other in the first place and with her being the center of the group originally the rest of us have all fallen out of touch
a fake wedding a few of my friends who were in a polyamorous relationship decided after being together for only a week to have a fake wedding did not end well i m still friends with a few of them but it definitely caused a huge rift
our little after school group of five all had a friend who we ve all hung out with except friend fifth group member who was going through some dark shit one summer said friend but not group member told three of us that she liked a fourth we convinced her to go for it by texting her feelings but our fourth group member did not reply for over a year the friend i was closest to was livid and cut out had some unresolved feelings for plus didn t really like him much anyways so was also cut out i felt terribly bad for convincing extra friend to expose her feelings we knew was a shy guy who didn t like to talk much online but we thought that he would at least reply with a no so our extra friend can move on we drifted apart from extra friend after that but i don t blame her at all for doing so it was especially bad when our fifth group member was dealing with her own shit and our shit at the same time it was a stressful year for young me in between the entire drama i only talk to and now but hear about and from time to time
he got so obsessed with wanting a girlfriend i joined some other people in not talking to him anymore we only knew each other a little over a year in a support group for people on the spectrum it wasn t my idea to kick him out of the group it was someone else s he spent six subsequent months sending threatening emails to everyone who he believed betrayed him including me
had a tight online friend group for a while one of us went hard for trump and the rest of us were like ok dude we just won t talk about politics except he talked about politics a lot eventually he and another member got into it lime paragraphs of text arguing over some bullshit we all one by one left the group because it was annoying and we never reconnected
growing apart most friends moved away and the rest of use now have children those of us with children now have a new friend group that includes the kids it s cool watching them all grow together
pussy hats safety pins on the collar and i can t believe you didn t vote for hillary i didn t vote for trump voted for johnson to get and get the libertarian legitimacy in our state which we achieved she genuinely felt burned others followed suit just dumped her again because i always make a big deal about her birthday and she doesn t give a fuck about mine oh i m so bad at birthdays fuck off
we basically kicked him out but we all knew each other since 3rd grade grew up in the same environment and shared our lives together for years although we did not share the same political beliefs granted we didn t let that have any issues until one of them decided to lash out on me and cuss out the rest for our semi conservative independent and religious beliefs after weeks of this we finally called it and cut him off from us
they started smoking and doing drugs so i quit
my friend bring cocaine into my house when i told him not to on hogmany minutes after him taking a line all my other friends left and messaged me later that night telling they were sorry but that they couldn t handle him when he was high on coke haven t spoke to him since
we all slowly but surely stopped doing drugs and going out to clubs every weekend
trump
i m going to get downvoted but i think women feel threatened by friend groups every friend i ve ever had has totally bailed after getting married even if they don t have kid s it s just a thing
trump
i said something wrong i apologized he didn t accept the apology bye
one of us moved to tennessee
we graduated n got busy with life
one fell into drug addiction the other got into a relationship and get vanished i moved to another state for higher education this marked the end of our year old friend group
people or so had gf issues which were actually def mental issues and this caused him to lash out and boom done
usually we just drift apart as a newer life takes over or the yoko effect a new girlfriend arrives and decides to hate everyone in the group and we just couldn t deal with the drama and left the group
high school ending
some of us wanted to keep partying and some wanted to settle down more
graduation
time i was in a friend group in middle school and i at the least had to leave it once i left middle school
joined the army went to jail for carrying cocaine the other of us just drifted apart without the other
high school graduation everyone went their separate ways after that then when i got to college made new friends and the exact same thing happened
graduation from college we are now scattered across the continental united states and european countries
we grew up
my plane didn t get off the runway on
community school finished british high school some went on to 6th form which is basically a extra year or two at the school but with more lenient rules i went to a college instead in the last years we ve met up as a group only three times then after just complete radio silence
moving to other cityties killed it sad but true
i moved away to the opposite side of the world others moved to other continents and another moved to another country all of this happened in less than months however our parents are still in contact this happened when i was a teenager btw and we do meet up once every few years
we moved to different countries we send emails and keep in touch but don t really hang out anymore
usually divorce
i got in a relationship my gf can be brutally honest sometimes even if it hurts you to your core assault rifle got pulled out threats were made it was ugly
last year a league of legends esports discussion pretty much all but ended my eight year friendship with a german american dude that i met playing rift back in and led to him leaving our discord group chat along with two other friends we used to talk a lot with he flipped out over me spoiling the result of a regular lec match where g2 lost this wasn t an important match like playoffs msi or worlds the issue of spoilers otherwise never really came up because this group was big on lol esports and were talking about it all the time i haven t spoken to him in almost a year neither of us have reached out to each other and given that we both play radically different games now i don t see us being more than the steam equivalent of facebook friends these days to be honest lol turns people toxic and having a friend group actively bash you and call your opinion as good as dogshit because you re still iron hasn t particularly made me want to play the game much i truly believe that the magical potion which turns dr jekyll into mr hyde is a league of legends account one of our mutual friends messaged me recently because i was playing starcraft custom maps but that conversation never really went beyond oh you playing ladder or arcade direct strike normal or commanders normal cool
i would probably spend hours upon hours reading and re reading it when i was my girlfriend moved away to go to a far away college we tried the long distance thing for a couple of months and one day i received a ten page hand written love letter from her i missed her so much and read it over and over again with tears in my eyes it was the last i heard from her we bumped into each other eight years later to find her happily married with two kids she met me for coffee the next day where we talked about old times for a couple of hours and then i watched her go as we parted ways for the last time that was twenty years ago i still have that letter i don t think i can bear to read it again
as cringy as it sounds i d probably cherish it forever
definitely a heart warming gesture it s like the equivalent of getting flowers for girls
alright i m a girl but i m gonna share anyway i once wrote my ex a letter every day up until his birthday random napkins stickies legit letters basically anything i dated it all sprayed it with my perfume and wrapped it in a box for his birthday he bawled his eyes out and seriously couldn t believe i spent my time doing it let s just say we broke up almost years ago he wasn t worth the effort but the last i heard he still had the box and didn t plan on letting go of it i ve always been a writer so just write the letters always write the letters never have i ever gotten a bad reaction from a man because of a letter edit i love this question does eta really mean estimated time of arrival i swear i ve seen it used as edit to add if not honestly just ignore me stop making fun of me idk how to reddit
my 7yo daughter writes me them they re the best
i d probably cry many men get very little genuine affection
i would assume it s from a guy posing as a chick elaborate ploy to swindle me
my girlfriend is the first one that s ever done this for me and i ve saved all of them she s probably going to open the wrong drawer sometime and find my secret stash of sentimentality and it ll ruin my sarcastic jerk image forever but i ll take the risk
i received one from my partner a few years ago it sits in my drawer of extremely important documents alongside things like the deed to our house and my birth certificate i read it sometimes to cheer me up
i would feel incredibly flattered and loved
idk i think you kinda gotta know the girl or already be together i got one from a girl i barely knew and it was just super awkward like i barely know this girl and she wrote about how much she liked me she was pretty but i didn t like her back i also got one from someone i was pretty close to and i didn t like them at the time but after talking to them some more and kinda having it on my mind i eventually started to like her back it never went very far we re back to just being friends we ve known eachother for long enough to make it not awkward and honestly the biggest thing between those two girls might not even have been how much i knew them the girl i said yes to had been dropping pretty obvious hints for ages and i made it obvious i knew she was dropping hints so it was just generally less surprising and it was more like an acceptance rather than some random thing outta nowhere that was all when i was like though so i can t really speak for myself now and how i would react but likely the same it s kinda similar to a trauma dump typa thing like if some random person just told me all their trauma i wouldn t know what to do at all but if it was a close friend we could easily work with it
my wife and i do this a few times a year it s nice to see how someone feels about you when they don t have to organize their thoughts while speaking it easier to articulate and portray the depth of your feelings it s a real treat and i love every moment of writing for her and reading what she writes
it would be a nice feeling when a man realizes that a woman is interested in him
closest thing i ever got to a love letter was an e mail from my best friend s girlfriend back in college she was about a year or two behind us i was always the third wheel on their dates and she and i became good friends as well anyway about six months after graduation she sends me this e mail one night just talking about how much she missed seeing me around campus and hanging out with me the words that have stuck with me the most are of all the people i know you re the one i most want to see happy it wasn t hand written nor a love letter but did i print it out on fancy stationary and keep it forever you bet i did
keep it forever even if the relationship fades men don t get the kind of emotional sexual attention women do on the regular i have extra weight now relationship weight but when i was in shape i got so many oogles leering and cat calls from women it was flattering and creepy when the woman was unattractive i still recall all those moments and mark a woman thinking about me in a longing way telling me how much she loves me yeah i d frame that and place alongside my college diploma because it s an accomplishment all its own my current girlfriend does things like these write me cards for my birthday or for valentine s day i keep those close to me it s what every man wants a woman that ll love him support him please him and hold him when he s feeling weak we re not guaranteed love or companionship unless we provide some kind of value that s our existence so when we find a woman who checks all the boxes and she writes us love letters i m keeping those
i d appreciate it my wife gave me this little things i love about you hand written little card for valentine s day a few years ago it s still on the dash of my truck maybe i m a softy but i think that men need to hear these things just like women do
i m a girl i write letters and make small drawings of me and my boyfriend and give it to him occasionally i found out that he has a bunch of the smaller ones in his wallet some in his university dossier that he uses everyday and has a binder at home with the rest of them when i asked him why he said that when he is missing me or is having a bad day at university he looks at them and they make him smile he is so adorable i love him so much
years ago someone put a folded paper in my bag i was in high school at that time and never had a girlfriend before the words are encrypted but i decoded it within minutes it was from someone that i am also attracted to it s one of the happiest moment of my life
i d suspect she lost a bet or tried to prank me i d still thank her if i can identify her though
ecstatic
sorry girl here but thought i would share i m an artist i used to make my ex hand drawn cards with a little love note inside and mail it to him he kept them on display on a shelf he seemed to really appreciate it i loved making things for him cards sketches ceramic pieces and miniature figurines i don t know if he still has any of my artwork but i hope he kept it
my heart would be smashed from all the feelings i would get
from someone i am dating it s sweet from someone i am not dating but i like it s cute from someone i am not dating but i don t like how do i tell her i am not interested
a 1st grade student of mine used to write me love letters she even figured out how to do it in english a language she doesn t speak and it s not like 1st graders can figure out google translate so easily it was cute sure but it really did mean the world to me
from a girl weird from a woman i would take it as a very big compliment and would probably feel obligated to write one back
i d feel awesome
one of my wife s favorite characters is samwise gamgee for his fortitude loyalty love and many other qualities when we were dating and getting serious she wrote me a letter on my birthday and began it with you really are my samwise i will always cherish it
as long as the letter isn t corny as fuck i d be elated 5x points if it s delivered by a crow or raven
i wouldn t call it a love letter but i ve received handwritten letters from two different women in the past they both expressed not knowing what to talk about then proceeding to write for pages both had great handwriting brought up how things at work were going how they were feeling at the time and other things one of them got me a warning from the postal service due to the perfume laden envelope i still have both of them the letters i mean not a captive bone collection situation
i was dating a girl just after high school it was long distance and she would write me a letter a few times a year i remember reading one she gave me as i was driving home from the airport bawled my eyes out in front of my mom i had six or seven of them that i kept and cherished would read them every so often and tear up every time i burned them when she cheated on me multiple times part of me wishes i had kept them but i know it would have just caused more pain that relationship fucked me up for years
i d be flattered but my wife would be pretty pissed
i have and it made me stay with her it was very sweet
it makes all the difference in the world how you feel about that person if it was someone i was attracted to i would be completely overwhelmed and never forget it
received several when i was a teen in the 90s felt really special and they are probably still in the stuff that is still at my parents
it is great women your girlfriend or wife does that
not much moves my heart greatly but that sort of thing would make me rather happy
i ll def take that shit to the grave
at this science camp i was at years ago we wrote notes to the people we befriended about what we liked about them and stuff i still carry those notes in my wallet
i d be over the moon
it happened once and i still remember the natural high i had all day the relationship fizzled out but i still remember how it all started with that letter
i just received a rather long one from a women it is awesome any man of value will cherish it and the women who gave it to them
not a guy but i started writing my boyfriend now husband love notes and hiding them in his cabin or his truck or wherever i could that he would find them later he struggled with extreme guilt and non existent self worth from past mistakes and was working and worrying himself to death over it it started as a reminder to him that he though he is human and imperfect he is loved it meant means so much to him that i still do it now and it seems to make his day i came across his stash recently and he has saved every one of them probably different notes on post its letters napkins we write a love letter in the cover of every book we gift each other for special events it s a tradition now and it makes them so much more meaningful for both of us
i would keep it forever even if we didn t hook up and i got married and started a family that letter would be framed and hung in the attic i mean i have it in writing that someone actually liked me men like to imagine that we could have fucked that girl years ago but to know for sure priceless
i cherish stuff like that coworker she probably knows i have a crush on her brought me a broken piece of a car engine of a racecar about a year ago and i still have it shes in mechanic school so she knows about engines i also have sticky notes from a crush now friend that left me for house sitting her place got other stuff and they remind me of happy times
it would probably make me feel the best i ve ever been tbh
confused and maybe a bit worried since i m and don t know any girls i m not related to
ah fuck now what what does she expect me to do in response
i don t think there is something more cute and i probably won t recover from it ever again and if my crush did this i probably died of happiness on the spot and laughed at the devil for seeing heaven without having to go there
it honestly depends two examples i have a gf who i like a lot and i am thinking about marrying in a few years but we ve only been dating for a little i would love to receive a hand written love letter from her i have a female friend who is basically a sister to me i have known her for years and have her and all of her family members phone numbers we are pretty close i go to their house weekly if she gave me a handwritten love letter i d be devastated i really don t see her like that and it would damage but not break our relationship x200b so overall yes but only if i am already interested
i did from my ex gf and it was magical at the time i ve read it so often it was beautiful don t get me wrong it was poorly written like we were teenagers and she wasn t a great author but it was cute and sincere after we broke up many years ago i thought about burning it in my sorrow but i decided i might want to look back at it when i grow older found it last week after moving places just skipped over a couple of lines and it s still nice of course it s of a past love and i have no interest in her or the person she was anymore but it s still a cool thing to look back to
cloud
omg i miss those days
i d be beyond happy to be honest idk about other guys but i d love to have a girl show her romantic side in that manner letters or flowers
sounds lovely i ll treasure the letter if it s from a girl i like if it s someone i m not interested in i d still feel happy but put her down gentle not sure what i would do with the letter though
i would be flattered i kept all the love letters from my ex partner in a special box
my ex girlfriend and i exchanged handwritten letters before i think it s still kept somewhere along with my papers in my room but it doesn t mean that i haven t moved on i m single yes and my ex is married i just feel like keeping it i read them sometimes if i happen to find some needed documents and i just laugh at it no strings attached those were the days i m and she s my college girlfriend
i received one once upon a time i loved it also cried a little felt love blossom even more and to be fair i still have it around so yeah that s definitely a thing that can light up the whole day
in my life i have received even though they are from women who no longer love me they are treasures and a reminder that i am capable of being loved they give me hope that maybe someday i will find someone who will want to change along with me and grow with me they just weren t it
i don t know if it s fair game or not since they came from my girlfriend then fiancee then wife but every once in a while my wife will hand write a letter and sneak it into my work bag or something she s not verbally an overly affectionate person so writing a letter once in a while is her way of showing i might not always say it but i really care most of them i have on a shelf on my desk at work always makes me absolutely melt
kept the original tossed out the dear john in another lifetime in a world that no longer exists in i was given generic letters that i was forced to reply to some lasted a couple of years i actually met a couple of the writers
flattered but also awkward since i m gay and married so i d kinda let them down over a heartfelt and straightforward coffee prolly over espresso and some fresh made scones i just made mind the coaster hun
i have multiple from many past relationships held in a specific drawer in my dresser
if i was a teenage boy i d remember this gesture until my deathbed as a married adult it would be creepy
possibly i would fall in love
elation
brilliant
that sounds really nice
i received one in i still have it
got one once from an ex girlfriend sadly i didn t love her back
it would be a sweet gesture
i m not sure i d definitely keep it since i keep anything written that is given to me i might try to meet up with them and hang out i suppose
as a male i would feel really appreciated and touched by a handwritten love letter from a girl it s not something that happens every day so it would make me feel really special and valued i think it s a sweet and romantic gesture that shows the person put time and effort into expressing their feelings plus it s always nice to have a physical reminder of someone s love for you
i love it my fiance writes them to me randomly and leaves them for me to find when she s not around i have every single one of them in my sock drawer
would love it as i use to love writing letters back and fourth to my female friends back in school good times
i d love that it lets me know she cares
i have a box full of them that i ve kept if i m honest
i feel like are you single haha jk but yeah i d love that shit true sentiment is dead these days
i d love to
i have still have it couple of decades and two relationships later
pretty stoked
id cry tbh
flattered
i would totally love this
my fianc loves them he has them in a pile for when i used to tuck them in his lunch box he actually told me he misses them oof better wrote him one for tomorrow s lunch haha
just because they re men doesn t mean they don t like flattery
over the moon ofc that is such a sweet and meaningful gift that can t be bought with money literally priceless
i would keep it forever and take it out and read it once in awhile
oooh how sweet
extremely flattered i d keep it
had a few loved em
cute i d be flattered but it won t be mutual i love my wife
depending how it s written either exited happy or creeped out
my first long term girlfriend did that for me when i was i ll never forget it
i think my reaction would depend on the girl that it s from it would make me happy regardless but i would obviously be more excited if it was someone i was interested in
honestly id love that
as a teen i would do the worst and show everyone and be a complete jackass but now that i m older and mature i d be flattered and keep it hidden somewhere prob create some inner jokes between me and her
got one from a girl when i was years old still have it now years later in perfect condition i even read it once or twice a decade was the first and only letter of that kind i had ever gotten it s funny sweet and heartbreaking all in one it s one of my most cherished possessions
it ll never happen but i d cherish it greatly
that she really cares about me
i still remember the ones my gf used to send me in so it must have worked

wall calendars the cheapest will work just fine
mexican food the best tacos you ll ever have will be in some hole in the wall in a strip mall not the trendy place with exposed brick and driftwood bar stools
i don t know of this counts as cheaping out but if you buy a safety razor it s like or if you want the kind with three blades and the replacement blades are ridiculously cheap then you never need to buy expensive plastic razors again anything reusable is better than a throwaway item if you re trying to save money also i pick up trash out of parks and beaches in my free time so i see a lot of plastic waste and we should really stop doing that
a tool when it is your first time to use it if you end up using it often get a good one
not buying those stupid warranties on every electronics device ever no walmart i don t need a three year warranty just let buy this mouse please
cables for technical devices go to amazon and pay cheap prices needed a 60ft cat6 best buy wanted walmart wanted target wanted and amazon wanted with free prime shipping needed a foot dp cable similar prices all around

pregnancy tests the dollar store ones work just as accurately as the name brands
magic erasers are literally just melamine sponges pack for bucks
i buy generics but good generics i e for toilet paper i get a generic quilted ply but i won t buy the cheapest single ply because it s a miserable experience also i don t buy the amazon junk sellers with the random names because those have all been junk knock offs but i will buy tools that are made my the same manufacturers as the top brand tools
for me toilet bowl cleaner i won t be touching tasting smelling or hearing my toilet bowl after cleaning it and it will look just as clean as the name brand cleaners since most of the cleaning is done by brushing anyway

any single use holiday product think easter eggs wrapping paper it s all at walmart and you can grab it for at the dollar store not a huge saving but hallmark pisses me off for some reason and a lot of foods as long as you check nutritional info etc i was committed to the light and fit greek yogurts until i tried the great value light greek same macros half the price

cars not advising you buy up the beater that s going to cost you an arm and a leg to repair every few months but if you re getting a decent car for 28k from a reliable manufacturer just to get around paying 35k 50k or more for a really nice luxury car may not be the best use of money it s not like shoes or sheets or something where paying more actually gets you better quality that you replace repair less in fact it s quite the opposite where luxury cars need more repairs sometimes due to their fancier features and increased electronics similarly if you have the option to get a car that s years old and a little cheaper than brand new do it don t go crazy for a depreciating asset
air filters for your furnace fancy expensive ones that filter out more stuff make your furnace work harder and reduces its life

for me nothing else compares to oh brother where art thou went and saw this at the theater with my parents and i had never seen them laugh so hard they done turned him into a horny toad do not seek the treasure

i m surprised no one is talking about the hangover the hangover
cool runnings
i m surprised nobody mentioned yet hot shots and hot shots part deux good parodies of top gun and rocky second one airplane is great but for some of its jokes and references you need to know what was happening around us when it was released like the lady saying her husband only drinks one cup of coffee you would have to know she was an actress in a popular coffee commercial in that time period or that the guy in the taxi was a reference to some politician that votes some unpopular law i m a bit unclear about it i quite enjoy scary movie scream and scary movie signs mile parody some like scary movie more but i m not into food related jokes it grosses me out it may not be the greatest but stuff like things i hate about you is worth a mention
life of brian

that and airplane dry humor is the best
you would love police squad if you haven t seen it already
and the airplane movies that was leslie nielsen s thing makes me wonder if he was a writer or just ended up in those perfect roles

me toooo lol
i need to know why shes so good looking and i need to ask her out on date
it s midday in my country i began my work day at believe me sleeping is very much what i d like to be doing hours of work ain t going to do itself though
beer tends to lead to sleep but if i were asleep i can t drink beer
gun cabinet
i hug a pillow helps me sleep better
they re usually folded in front of my chest with my hands tucked under my chin
i detach them and hang them up each night so they don t get in the way taking the second arm off is tricky though
bro my fucking arms piss me off when i m trying to sleep
one under my pillow the other between my thighs
wake up to find i rolled over on them and they are numb
hang one over the edge of the bed
dab
i usually place them on the nightstand near my head
nothing i m sleeping
a bitch in one and a bitch in the other i hold my bitches close don t believe what you hear about me i m a romantic at heart hoe ass dumb question asking ass motha fucka
usually handcuff them on the bed
omg seriously struggle with this every night lol
so when i sleep i often like to tuck my hands into the waist bed of whatever i m wearing hand on my thigh also according to my wife as i m falling into deep sleep i clench my hands quite strongly weeks ago i fell asleep and my hand was more on my nuts then my thigh and i woke up in great pain as i violently crush my own nuts in my fist
either cross them over my chest like a corpse or hands behind my head
chop em off sew back on in morning
i have a blanket from actually before i was born that a family member or family friend made idk which one i got two different people saying they made it im and ill take it to school and no one says anything thats actually helped with my anxiety to but i am always hugging holding or using it as a pillow when i go to bed
usually hand one off the bed while laying on my back until my elbow is in so much pain it wakes me up
bent hand behind my head
it varies pillow hug most nights it s really comfortable to do the dracula but i d probably scare my wife to death if she woke up to that
under my pillow
i sleep on my stomach and i put my hands behind my pillow in front of it pretty much hugging it
flap em
i have no idea why but they just naturally go over my head sorta like the tsa pose when you go through that full body scanner thing in airports i don t even do it consciously i just wake up like that
cuddle the corpse of my dead mother
right hand under the pillow and left one on the head tight hug
i put them on the nightstand so i can grab them in the morning you know with my teeth that is
i usually sleep on my side so i hug a pillow and tuck one arm underneath it while letting the other arm rest on top it s the most comfortable position for me and it helps prevent any shoulder pain in the morning how about you guys
hug my plushie
one under my pillow one at my side
handcuffed to the bed
under my pillow or stretched out
side sleeper here the arm close to the mattress is usually outstretched and the other is holding a pillow to my chest sometimes vice versa
until i saw this question i never thought much about it but now i am very aware of my arms and i don t know if i ll be able to get comfortable in bed again thank you
cup a titty
i hug a cow squishmellow because it helps make me feel safer i have ptsd and often get nightmares it seems silly but it works for me
leave them on the nightstand so the cat can play with em lol or sometimes i direct the orchestra hell i don t know what i do with them i m asleep
ya know i ve never really thought about it i usually cuddle a pillow when my girlfriend spends the night i cuddle myself she doesn t like cuddling when she wants to sleep
saw them off before bed
i either put them under my pillow on top of my stomach while sleeping on my back or i hug my pillow plushies or sometimes i just wiggle them around in any position until something makes me say yea that s good yknow
no idea because i m asleep
i used to sleep on my stomach with my arms under my pillow but if i try to do that now i wake up with numb arms so they usually just hang off the side of the bed
holding the edge of the blanket like it is a stuffed animal but then sleep me decides that it s not big enough so i grab more blanket this is much to the displeasure of my boyfriend who sometimes holds feet of blanket while i hold a big old ball
one arm under pillow other arm around the cat
i don t know and when i m trying to sleep sometimes and have to think about where they go i know i m not getting much sleep that night
wacly waving inflatable tube arm flailing tube man aka i just let it do whatever
i cross them over my torso
beat my meat
beat my meat
put them in the armoire
beat my meat
cradle my boobs
if i m sleeping on my stomach under the pillow if i m on my back or side at my side
hug the pillow
i keep them attached to my shoulders in case i should have a sudden need for them in the middle of the night
wait you sleep on your back how
the real answer is to put one arm under the pillow
i sleep on my side stomach and my arms are like twisted underneath me with my wrist bent under my chin i wish i could draw a diagram because i know that doesn t make a lot of sense but that s what i do sometimes my elbow joints get sore because they ve been under my knee for a few hours i don t know why but it s comfortable
according to my so grab her ass
at my sides for the entire ride

gibson they make base level trash guitars and haven t innovated their products in over years the prices keep rising for an instrument that won t stay in tune long enough to make it through a song they now relic these guitars for double the price just in case you re wondering what that means they take a brand new guitar and trash it to look like its been through hell for years and then charge you double for it if you dont get one reliced don t worry if you own it for much more than a decade the finish will begin to crack like cheap plastic instead of fixing the cheap finish problem they market it as fancy but the reality is it is simply just a cheap low quality finish that won t hold up over time but somehow they have convinced people that this is a premium feature it just blow my mind oh and then the quality control of instruments going out thendoor of the factory is atrocious you might purchase a brand new guitar without relicing but you might get a guitar that already has a cracked finish and the gibson will ghost you if you try to get it returned for one that isn t cracked also many gibsons are built without a valute i may have spelled that wrong but it is a bit of extra wood between the neck and headstock this prevents the headstock from braking off if you have an accident yeah well good luck with your gibson the headstock will break like a dorito

apple admittingly posefully slowing older phones to force users into buying a new iphone iphones are usually generations behind in adding features such as wireless charging and swipe keyboard although not much apple takes features already integrated into most android phones and markets them to make the consumer think it s new and apple did it first with the iphone you are receiving less in the box every year and they just rise in price macbooks don t have touchscreens even after years of touchscreen computers and i m sure that when a touchscreen macbook releases the fan base is gonna act like it s the best thing since sliced bread proprietary connectors piss me off the whole company and its die hard fanbase is the reason i won t ever buy another apple product

belkin maybe they are better now but i bought a dvi kvm back in something like it was hard to find them but belkin had one and it was a reasonable price but whomever designed it never actually plugged in a cable since you physically couldn t the plastic on the thing blocked direct entry to the port belkin support said they were now aware of the issue and would send an adapter in a few weeks well it takes well over a few months past the return period by the way and they send the adapter it does fit but does the kvm work nope

i used to take the greyhound in bc it was frequently several hours late one time it was running hours late so i tried to get a refund and you actually have to mail the head office in order to get a refund not only that but they don t do refunds for their buses being late they ended up going out of business in my area despite having a monopoly on our market that s how bad they are
yeah i got one when i was travelling the states never again felt like i was on a bus to prison
welcome to greyhound where will you beheaded
i took greyhound once to save on a car rental when visiting my parents flew to san diego and took a greyhound for the last leg i don t think i had any problem with the service or price and the bus ride wasn t all that bad but the actual bus station was an eye opening experience i don t plan on doing that again
riding greyhound in is legit nightmare fuel hour layovers in some of the most drug infested places known to society customer service nonexistent nobody knows what s going on or where everyone is supposed to go it s fuckin jacked
i love greyhound it s always a wild shitty adventure a couple years back i was riding greyhound from new orleans to omaha somewhere in arkansas a bunch of dudes right out of prison got on the bus real sketchy junky types already tweaking anyway the most obnoxious of them was this dude with a big nose i m gonna call him beaky beaky made friends with a tweaker looking lady and they got real touchy feely on the bus everyone was uncomfortable suddenly she jumps up runs to the bathroom and trips on her dress her tits fly out then shes throwing up real loud in the bathroom for like minutes she gets off the bus but beaky stays on turns out he s going all the way to omaha i try to tune him out and focus on movies on my computer we re on the last stretch between des moines and omaha i m watching james cameron s avatar and the bus pulls over cops are walking up along the side of the bus i take off my headphones and ask what s going on nobody says shit ask again and a little old lady says there s a pervert on the bus cops come on and arrest beaky not entirely sure what he did but i think he pulled his penis out you know how much that bus ride cost me like best i ve spent in my life i ll tell ya i m a customer for life now wildest dumbest shit i loved it
mega bus is worse one time i was on a bus from buffalo to toronto dying of a hangover from a bachelor party at some point we had to stop because there was a bus inspection before the inspector came on board the driver just got up and ran away we were stranded at some crappy station that only sold hot pockets and mr noodles for three hours until another driver showed up
it s funny that everyone responding to you hasn t even taken greyhound recently i ride buses regularly and just this year greyhound gave a huge middle finger to their passengers the company was bought by a german multinational and decided that they no longer want to work with the regional bus companies so at the beginning of march it became much more complicated to use buses to travel anywhere and greyhound no longer serves many stations they previously had relations with it s actually worked out well for me because these days i only regularly take the bus to my hometown an hour away and with the regional company not having to work around greyhound they ve added some more convenient times the ticket counter worker who explained all this to me predicted greyhound would go under within a couple years and i wouldn t be surprised if that turns out to be true
i rode on greyhound once like years ago and we hit chain control over donner summit on i and the driver would not let anyone help with chains so he d go set out the chains walk back to the wheel move the bus walk back and fiddle with the chains walk back he wouldn t even tolerate people just spotting his driving back and forth to the point where he closed the door rather than listen to a couple of the guys who came outside to help despite his direction not to i swear to god it took minutes to get those chains on never again
i once waited for a greyhound at the station i had purchased the ticket for a town in utah i waited two hours and when i checked the bus tracking i called customer service hey the bus is late when is it coming cs rep oh it ll be there on time don t worry it says it s on schedule me that s impossible it s already late and it s tracking says it s in mississippi so i don t think it ll be here anytime soon anyway turns out the station they sold me a ticket for was actually closed a few years back i was waiting outside an abandoned building i rarely saw any staff at the stations so assumed it was one of those deals i had to travel two hours to salt lake and wait a whole day to actually get on the bus
i m on a ten ride winning streak after a lifetime of unbelievably nightmarish experiences on the dirty dog it is surely no coincidence that the last ten successes have all been single bus runs any time they make you get off and transfer you might as well walk the rest of the way greyhound is simply not equipped to handle complicated itineraries
lol i m a coach bus driver for a smaller and much more liked company and us bus drivers all wave to eachother regardless of company except i was specifically instructed to not wave to greyhound drivers by my mentor drivers
just a reminder the exact moment that you propose should be a surprise that you re thinking of proposing shouldn t don t be the idiot who dramatically proposes out of nowhere at a baseball game restaurant tourist spot etc and gets rejected because the person he hoped would marry him didn t know it was coming and panicked
buy a ring sizing kit and then go to an amusement park that has an intense roller coaster ride it literally dozens of times you may have to pre condition your body with several visits when she inevitably goes unconscious due to the high g loads you whip out the sizing kit from your jacket pocket and slip it on her ring finger without her or her family or her mother being the wiser make sure it s snug but not too tight the blood will have rushed from her head to her fingers so the swelling might make you want to go down half a size but if you expect that she ll let herself go in later years then stick with the measured size source no fucking idea about women but i ve known machine tools and roller coasters for decades
i sucked on her finger and kept that mouth shape the entire time
jewelers have sizing sticks slip a ring you know fits her into your pocket take it to a jeweler and they ll slide it up the stick until it stops that s her size order that size of ring take the borrowed ring home and put it back voila
i took a picture of my girlfriend s hand with a ruler next to it while she was sleeping then i did some image analysis and got a size in the end it was perfect
hanging out watching tv and you pull one of her rings off and jokingly try it on however far it goes onto your finger is her size
buy a cheap mood ring off ebay or amazon and guess at her size show her it works on your pinky and ask her to try it
get a single can of play doh preferably flesh toned incase some gets stuck under her nail when she s sleeping stick her finger in the play doh to get a proper mold of it make sure you do the ring finger obviously resort to plan b if this isn t feasible she s a light sleeper you guys are waiting for marriage etc plan b tell her you wanna do a tiktok trust challenge where you make her close her eye and stick her finger in various things to guess what it is once you ve acquired this finger mold be sure not to squash the sides of the container so you dont change the shape of the mold take the play dough tub to any local jeweler and they will ask what the fuck is wrong with you and make you leave that s all i got so far
fingers can be re attached
see what rings she wears and when she takes one off secretly borrow it but do not goto her friends or family members
first i hold his penis in my hand wait what kind of ring are we talking about
my husband got a little measuring tape device on amazon specifically for measuring ring sizes super cheap he waited until i was asleep probably after a few drinks and had my exact size no problem my grandma was very impressed
a string and a sharpie wait til they fall asleep wrap the string around their finger and mark with a sharpie where the string crosses bring marked string to a jeweler and they will help you figure out the size don t propose unless you both have discussed it so you aren t disappointed
i found my old class ring and had my so try it on obviously it was gonna be too big but when she tried it on i just went wow what s your ring size you thumb must be smaller than my ring finger if it just falls off like that
just buy a ring she d like then after you ve asked her and she says yes take her and the ring back to the store and they ll size it for you
use a wire tie to slowly adjust it juuuust right and then slowly remove it while she s asleep
i was not secretive i bought this jailor keychain type thing that had all the ring sizes on it it was for an ex but at the right time i can say it s to measure my finger for glove size i dunno they surely see through it you reach an age and point in the relationship where it s just like what is your ring size let s measure
someone told me her ring size and shoe size should be about the same this was proven false
say that you d like to do a couple s hand casting kit together as a sentimental gift to commemorate an anniversary size the mold and you re good to go
i will let her finger my ass with some chilli
i m just here for the answer as well

i just had my wife go to the jewelry store pick out several styles she liked and got her ringed sized i did this about months before i proposed that way she got the exact ring she wanted the most without me guessing she picked multiple but kept coming back to one particular one i got her size was able to have it fully paid off and enough time had passed that day was kinda far in the back of her mind she did mention after saying yes that it took me long enough i just replied that i want it to be a surprise
sneakily measure a ring they already wear then cross your fingers it s the right size
turns out my wife s ring finger s perfectly match my pinkies i just use that
with an app from google play
tell them you saw something online saying that most people can t get a string off their finger without untying it get them to let you tie a string loosely around their finger and then slide it off obviously without issue take that string cut it and measure it use the measurement to find their ring size better to go loose than tight you want the ring to at least go on and if it needs to be adjusted it s far easier to make it smaller than larger
ask her best friend to find out for you
sit on couch have girl on her knees in front of you while she s blowing you gently take her hand into your hand she ll think it s romantic now wrap your thumb and forefinger around her ring finger to make a circle you might need to hold it for a few minutes to remember the size after you bust a nut go to the jeweler and have them hand you one of those ring sizing sticks make the same circle slide it down the stick and bingo you got the correct size or just roofie her whatever works congrats on your engagement
find out what size shoe she wears and in general her ring size will be two smaller i wear size in women s shoes us and size ring this isn t an exact science but it s pretty close eternity bands that have diamonds stones all the way around them cannot be resized but most other things can be by using the shoe size method you should be able to get close enough to just have to size up or down a tiny bit if it s not dead on
you ve got to have a really good ass memory
go hold a bunch of peoples hands find a hand that fits similar ask ring size please don t do this
my husband borrowed a ring he knew i wore comfortably on that finger were i shopping tbh i d link them to one of those jewelry in a bath bomb or candle things close to say valentines or birthday and ask what size ring they wear get them a gift keep the info for future use
have a friend stage a break in while you two are out have them store all her jewelry and some of your valuables off site after exclaiming that you ve seen a shady guy hanging around your home say you re going to the police station to file a report but really go to a jeweler to get her size after some time when you ve got the ring say you got a call from the police asking you to identify the suspect from the lineup bring her somewhere with your friends and family in a lineup holding your stolen things get down on one knee and say baby i stole your jewelry but you stole my heart first
ask
it doesn t have to be perfectly sized you can get it resized if when she says yes
a nonchalant amputation with a microsurgery attachment minutes later no just take a measure while she is sleeping
little known fact your ring size is exactly the same as the diameter of your ear canal so when your partner is sleeping just stick a warm wax mold into their ear and let it cool then pull it out easy peasy
here s how i did it with my wife at the time she always worn this one ring but she always took if off when getting in the shower so when i knew she was going to be in the tub for a while i went in and got the ring i put in on whatever finger it would fit my pinky and used a pen to draw a circle underneath where it stopped i then went to the jewelry store and used their sizing rings on my pinky under i found the one that reached the drawn circle comfortably
also take her ring shopping with you she s going to be wearing that ring make sure it s something she actually likes either propose without the ring and go shopping later or find a ring together and surprise her with it later you might think you know her taste but you shouldn t risk it
you re actually a genius
proposing itself can be a surprise but making a spectacle about it should be avoided imo anyone planning to propose who already doesn t know the answer from the strength of their relationship probably should find a new relationship
i feel like you could just get her drunk and wait till she passes out much more easily
this is the funniest comment i have ever read on reddit
i did something similar i asked to see her rings she took them all off and i tried everyone playfully i paid attention to the one she was wearing on her ring finger and memorized where it got stuck on my pinky didn t end up marrying her but i still remember her ring size years later
my husband did this he grabbed a ring i hadn t worn in a few months and got it measured i had no idea
this is much simpler than my roller coaster unconscious idea you sir are a genius
damn leave it to a woman i just bought oversized with a promise to have free resizing
ok so when are you coming over to watch tv
i did that
i also want my fiance to finger your ass
i never even thought of that
yeah my girl knows we re getting married just doesn t know when i straight up asked her
what are you doing oooooo
damn that s smooth
i m a woman but thank you
but the downside is no rollercoaster
if she doesn t wear rings you ll have to try something else compare hand size while you re together and eyeball how close her ring finger matches your pinkie

i would sell my soul to be a house husband what a gravy gig still though a big part of me sees that as a dual income household becoming a single income household and all financial goals are going to be achieved slower if i m not working
i did for a short while like weeks when she came home to me watering the lawn and having seen me get some water on the sidewalk told me i was wasting her money i was working again three days later she ll tell you she had had a bad day and i was overreacting but i think bad days just help people remove the what they believe is their truth filter
i would love to support my wife s career and take care of our home
i would keep her belly full and her clit empty like s
i would get bored and start a side project
my wife has recently started a business and we are hoping she makes more than me
my son s wife is a psychologist and when some orcs bought the company where he was working he got permission from her and his daughters to just take a year off and decide what he wanted to do it was heavenly for him and he just puttered around and got a lot of stuff done around the house and had dinner ready for her most nights any man who wouldn t want to be a house husband because it s not macho enough is just stupid
i d be all for it i d happily cook clean raise the kids etc so she can focus on her work and not have to worry about home
personally i d love it each couple to their own though it ll work for some and not for others
not bad at all i can finally focus on my passion options trading
wow me and my girlfriend were jokingly talking about this the other day since i do most of the cooking and cleaning already it wouldn t be such a big change i wouldn t mind doing the majority of the household tasks but i would miss my job and would at least take a parttime job
i ve been treated like shit by poor girls so now i m all about the rich mamas
i have to work even if she was the bread winner i d still have to work
i currently am a house husband i discharged from the marines a few years ago and my wife has been the only one with a job she does like bio science stuff stuff smarter than me idk maybe its the leaving of the military or whatever but i feel empty i feel like a freeloader that i am not financially taking care of our family and unborn child but i guess i got to get used to it or find a part time job
i don t think anyone would want that of me but hypothetically it would be great for me with few downsides
if it was enough to cover everything then most definitely i would be a house husband would probably do some part time work just so i don t get too bored and to have some disposable income
don t wanna i d get bored staying home all day
i am wife is a doctor and we have two kids we are a team and that s how we always imagined it would be well before kids marriage or even med school
that s literally my life it s wonderful
house husband place will be clean as feck handyman sh t is taken care of food cooked and i ll build any furniture and boats she wants i m doing most of that in my real life with a full time job
depends on expectations i don t think i could handle being stuck at home raising kids mostly alone and doing house keeping in the disproportionate way that it is for some house wives but as long as there was an understanding about what is reasonable for contribution splitting the labor and so on i d probably be fine with it
i m the wife and bread winner it s transformed my husband into a stressed out angry person into a laid back guy who s thinking about going back to school he s working too and his salary pays for our fun stuff mine pays the bills it works for us
not massive but enough my husband s enjoying being a house maid
i can honestly say i don t think i know a single man who would complain for some it might take some getting used to but when speaking for myself maaaaaan i would keep that house spotless make them lunch to take to work make the bed do the laundry make dinner try my best and shoot i ll draw them a bath and give them a full on spa treatment i d try to do as much of that even if i was the bread winner if a woman somehow looks at my baggage and quirks and thinks to themselves yeah i want to marry him then that woman was blessed cursed by god with some insane patience and she deserves to be treated right
i d love it but my so wouldn t go for it
you had me at massive salary
count me in
i dream of that shit
great straight fire
house never play tennis at the club everyday husband for sure
what who would this be an issue for
i d be stoked to have a wife and to stay at home to turn the roomba on and off
a marriage is a partnership both parties should be looking out for what is best for the unit you do whatever you need to do to make it work daddy day care is now in session
even then i would still make my own money so that we had more money
i love my sugar momma i m drinking beer in the garage right now while she s still working
not sure i want someone to have that much power over me
where do i sign up i like keeping a clean and tight ship only housekeeping demands are no citrus products allergies no latex products allergies and that we have a good dishwasher and laundry machine set that and a few vacations each year doesn t have to be expensive i just like driving
i m not a house husband i have a full time job but my wife makes a lot more money than me it s pretty awesome
it didn t work for me always felt guilty about spending money always felt like i had to ask permission to buy anything i didn t really want to quit my job to be a stay at home dad and ended up going back to work
my husband is a house husband it is interesting to see how some folks think that it is a vacation easy gig he handles the cooking cleaning and errands and i bring home the paycheck and handle the repairs and outdoor chores he does not sit around and lounge all day it is just how we decided to split up the labor and it works really well for us but i still consider what he does a full time job he likes it because he doesn t have to be abused by the public for low pay anymore and i like it because i hate house work
married to a director of finance i quit my teaching job last year and take care of our house and young son a necessity where she often travels much happier since quitting highly recommend
sign me up i d be able to pursue my passions of becoming the best youth sports coach of all time coaching year olds to hit dingers and score tds sounds pretty nice to me
i ve had a daddy daycare business plan written up for quite some time if this dream ever comes true daily fishing trips ski trips arts and crafts day nap time for them and me occasionally

these types of questions always have a stench of neckbeard hoping for a gotcha moment to them
this is a question to separate the boys from the men it is not coincidence that the word husband and the word husbandry come from the same root word houseboundry men take care of their larger community their families and themselves innate in the dna and testosterone of men is the desire to protect even those who are unknown to the man boys on the other hand are only interested in caring for themselves and those who are directly in their orbit once one is outside of their orbit boys are looking out for number one i have been lucky in my life to have known many great men my husband is one my father rip and god father rip were two others though i have known many great men it wasn t until i was negotiating a low contingency fee for the people who lost our homes and everything we owned in the woolsey fire november that i started coming across all these boys i find them disgusting and would never be in a relationship with any one of them i am wealthy in my own right so for all of you who say it would be a dream to be supported by your wife while you putter around the house know that emasculating yourself is not an attractive trait i suspect that even if your wife agrees to this initially your devotion to cybelle will forever wound your relationship
a friend was a house husband now he s a house wife
i d have a lot of time to get fat and become a true redditor
i would love it
i aspire to nothing greater
yeah that d be pretty sick i could keep the house clean easily and actually complete work i want to do
sign me the fuck up i already do most of the cooking and dishes and my laundry
i am it s fun
we decided not to have kids so pull my own weight is the fair way to go about things
awesome shit we re on the edge of being broke all the time with both of us working full time and i already do most of the housework because she has more hobbies outside the house and i have more that i do at home so i already have more time to cook and clean anyway let s go baby
she does i am and i love it
would love it
who the fuck would say no to that
i d be happy with it
jackpot let s start this tomorrow
would be fucking awesome i ll cook and clean over my real job any day of the week
i hit the jackpot d
i wouldn t want to be a house husband i like what i do for a living
where s the gif of mr clean when i need it
i d fucking love it
i d give my left nut for that type of situation
sign me the fuck up
shiiiiiiiiiiit if only
i would do a great job
not quite the same but my husband has no trouble being retired while i m not
i ll pass
my boys are and so i d be fucking stoked i like cooking and i d have plenty of time to run take awesome power naps and generally just crush it where do i sign up
all for it i have plenty of hobbies i need more time for and i would love to have more time to keep the house clean to keep the wife happy
fuck yeah
bring it i m tired of working and household chores are easy when no kids are involved
good i would feel good
sounds good to me
may wife and i totally fantasize about this all the time we ve don t have even have kids and it would be so much nicer to have one of us not work to handle things like home repairs and errands and not have to try to squeeze everything in on the weekend unlikely unless she can triple her salary but still a fun dream
absolutely i would help her be the best her she can be as long as i get my new can am ryker and some nice vacations
ok
i d be fine with it
i did this for years while i went back to school and it sucked it probably depends a lot on your spouse but i was alone a lot and i wanted money to do things and i just didn t have it bright side was i had more time with my young kids
i will answer this for my husband because we ve talked about it that would be a dream come true
what a dream
eh sure would i be allowed some kind of allowance to spend on hobbies or something like that outside of doing the chores around the house
stupid happy i ve been in the salt mine for years she can have the keys
that house would be so immaculate she could eat off the floor
it depends what s expected of me i would rather work than have to handle all household chores be a stay at home dad but like a real househusband of beverly hills with maids and nannies and shit i just lounge around get mimosas with the boys do some fitness class go shopping sign me the fuck up
fucking amazing
sign me up
i am i retired early a year ago to help care for our disabled adult son
she wouldn t like it that much i am bad at cleaning
i d gladly do it if my hypothetical wife made a really good salary i love taking care of kids especially my own actually considered it but even though my actual wife made more than i did at the time i still made more than daycare cost plus my job had full benefits and a pension if a hypothetical wife made crazy money though i d expect some hired assistance with the housecleaning yard work and such being a sahm or sahd is a lot of work
really good i would need to take some cooking classes though
where do i sign up
ask my husband lol
i got it i got it it got it i ll do it i ll do it i ll do it
that s the dream life i d be so lucky to get to enjoy that privilege staying at home spending my kids formative years with them not having to stress about work and then as they get a little older and start going to school i ll have loads of free time to pursue my passions
i love it it s a win for both my wife and i she gets to work a job she loves and i get to be a parent for our kid and give them the extra support

obviously there should and it s stupid that there isn t
i think there are more limits and requirements to get a driver s license in old age than there are to run the country
well the people who have the power to change that would be disadvantaged so that s why it doesn t exist
some people age faster than others so it would be difficult to decide what would be too old i ve known people over who were more on the ball than some people in their 30s x200b what they should have to do is take an aptitude test regardless of age
no apples and oranges there s a minimum age because you need a certain amount of life experience to be a politician there s a reason wise folks are portrayed as ancient in stories now there should be a cognitive test done on every politician at least every two years regardless of age
no that s a false equivalency children can t be politicians or do lots of other things because their brains aren t fully matured yet while there is a decline in mental faculties in later years age is not a reliable measure it varies greatly from person to person i say this as someone who would agree with the spirit of what you re saying we have far too many old fucks running things but that s a terribly oversimplified solution
no such zero tolerance laws are for people who don t want to do their jobs
your god damn right there should be and it should be
minimum yes maximum no trying to litigate the oldest would be so discriminatory that it can t really be done
i think experience and capability should be the deciding factors not age
there should be a maximum age people in their 50s through 80s can be really out of touch just listen to some of those panels where they ask questions to tech experts
i m fine with a minimum age but i think it should be lower for all offices i really don t think you should have to be to be president i m not in support of a maximum age but i do support mental evaluations for offices
where is there a minimum age to be a politician
basically the idea that after a certain age retirement or something it s no longer your future as the argument goes i think there is such a thing in some asian country i can t remember however the older the wiser theoratically and if they do care about the newer generations and the upcoming future they won t be in then why silence such people from politics
it should be very difficult to restrict rights to run for an office in a free society age is not a reliable qualifier for ability to lead
abso fuckin lutely our current president is too senile to understand that the pope isn t an african american baseball player and makes jokes about ice cream at a press conference for a school shooting
my grandad is i think like and while he doesn t have dementia alzheimer s his brain has deteriorated a lot i wouldn t trust someone like that to run a country older people tend to only really have experience with things that mattered when they were younger i think to be a politician the age range should be or something around that maybe would work better but i m not sure
there shouldn t be an age limit but there should certainly be term limits
no it s up to the voters to decide to decide the age of a politician to represent them if some district wants to elect a year old then that s up to them
my year old great grandmother is very sharp and very cohesive however her daughter is in a worse mental state than her its all relative
after seeing the absolute state of the white house right now yes there should be a maximum age
there should be a maximum income
when you start having a senile bag of bones over there as president it sure raises a lot of questions
previously i didn t think there needed to be but seeing the deranged dementia ed goof who s currently at the top now i believe they should cap it at
should there be a maximum age absolutely but good luck getting the old politicians to agree to such a law when they have such cushy lives as politicians
totally agree i m more so curious why there isn t but askreddit wouldn t allow me to ask that lol
why obviously
my month old begs to differ
this at face value sounds like truth unfortunately lol
just an eye test are you saying blind people can t be elected
unfortunately this is probably the most relevant comment here lol
can t argue with this
experience is relative though yes the 80yo politicians are more experienced involved in what occurred during their lifetime but the younger people are more experienced involved in what is happening today that said cognitive tests should be a thing lol
but it would help wouldn t it we don t let year old run the country because they tend to make stupid decisions so why would we let 80yo s run the country knowing they have the same tendency to make stupid ass decisions i am not saying age by itself is the right qualification in fact i believe it should be more than that but with where things stand today i think it is at the very least reasonable logic i wouldn t trust my teen to run the country just as much as i wouldn t trust my grandpa is all i m getting at lol
wait what there is zero tolerance for an age minimum but not an age maximum how does that work
how is it more discriminatory to prevent older people rather than younger people from holding a political position
i m happy with leaders passing a standarized test every years if you can t score high enough you re out no exceptions one retake i m not saying heavy duty calculus just basic information on major constitutional themes like does federal beat state and what document has these truths we hold evident and what is and within what is the federal debt
i agree with this as well i ve thought before perhaps political candidates should have to take exams to see how close their beliefs are to the common belief of the population and if their deviation is too far off the mean they should be excluded from consideration or something of the sort at least
that s a good point they can be out of touch with what is going on in our country but they also can understand it so perhaps age shouldn t be a deciding factor
some also aren t though bernie is like but isn t totally out of touch ron paul who is also like can be a bit iffy since he s a libertarian but it can t be ignored that when he ran he stirred up a lot of people on both sides of the aisle and he s still mentally competent for the most part i think we d be losing out on some important voices in government
50s through 80s wow talk about out of touch with reality
and people your age can be remarkably ignorant thinking they know far more than they do i was your age once and i was a know it all too now i know better
everywhere edit in us at least
i think it should be more strict to be able to run to ensure the candidates aren t just in it for the money primarily but i agree age alone is a horrible qualifier edit age and money is a horrible qualifier
because i thought that was obvious you wouldn t let someone who is too old to build lego run a country
what the heck blind people can be president but not drive a car we are talking about age over in many states require eyesight written exam driving test and a supplemental driving exam with conditions
your brain isn t even finished developing until no one with an underdeveloped brain should be in a position of real power
i am not saying age by itself is the right qualification but you said exactly that i don t really disagree with anything you re saying my whole point was that age by itself is overly simple i don t think i see a disagreement here i think the post title probably just doesn t capture your view very well i d be in favor of cognitive testing for politicians regardless of age truth be told
no you don t understand
see you entered into the first of many quagmires
wow
i feel like they are disproportionately out of touch
bernie is like but isn t totally out of touch right the guy that was charging a ticket to his event to promote his book about hating capitalism can t afford to lose him ok then if not an age limit then maybe some kind of real cognitive test or some kind of competency exam to prove that they are at least somewhat relevant

what is my age
no there isn t only the presidency has an age minimum of people of any age can run for any other position
what s the minimum age
build legs
i m not disagreeing with that at all i m actually arguing the opposite i feel as though an 80yo brain is just as unqualified to lead as that of someone under
yeah askreddit is very picky in what you ask so it definitely doesn t convey the question properly lol just asked it how it let me i think we are definitely in agreement though my friend an age country of origin requirement is not nearly enough to qualify someone as the leader of a country there must be more to it lol
i figured
touch
not sure what the wow means lol
as equally out of touch as someone under the age limit one may say lol
relevant did you mean a different word because i have no problem with joe schmoe down the block running if he isn t crazy mental evaluations to make sure the person isn t some insane racist psychopath sure
doesn t matter i was once your age whatever it is
false last i saw you had to be at least for any political position it may vary state to state but this is a common thing around here
no they can t there are age limits which vary a little by state iirc for senate and rep positions for senate it s usually for reps it s
it s normally like for most political positions and for president
lego fucking autocorrect
there is zero evidence of that several 80yo do not have cognitive disease
probably a wow as in wow you actually want to exclude people from certain roles based only on popular opinion because that can and has been how very bad things happen
that that comment was so far out there
yea we need to find the sweet spot
mental evaluations to make sure the person isn t some insane racist psychopath we might have a lot of people removed lol
well either way we have a lot of old dumb fucks in congress
that is just flat out wrong the youngest mayor in the us is the youngest state legislator is also and there many many elected officials younger than
okay yeah and respectively i was wrong so start with local and state level politics which is what anyone should be doing anyway
one is never too old for legos
zero evidence that as you age you lose cognitive and functional abilities i d like to see that study
a comment that the people who we elect in political positions should be in the right mindset to support what we currently want as a society
agreed or just have a better vetting process for our leaders
fine by me in my opinion if you are just repeatedly trying to pass bills and advocate for laws that violate people s civil liberties locally or otherwise yeah get the fuck out of office
i bet i m twice your age and guarantee i know more about technology and history than you do making arbitrary judgements based strictly on age is frankly immature and stupid
it is not flat out wrong there are always exceptions but this is what is common also a mayor is nothing in comparison to a senator
society can and has wanted very bad things before and you can see these things on a state level if you look at polls
so what is your arbitrary judgement based on and what makes it different
well no shit there s no comparison for one thing one is legislative and the other is executive so it s not even the same division of government but your claims that you have to be for any political position is wrong you don t the huge majority of political positions in the us do not have an age requirement there are elected federal positions with age requirements there are tens of thousands of elected positions in the country it seems like you don t understand that in order to be qualified to be a us senator state representative or president that someone actually should have experience at doing that job on some level the jobs by which someone can gain this experience not to mention the education that supports it are available to all
again there are always exceptions and my statement was just a generalization so thanks for pointing out my mistakes that said i m not trying to argue about the actual minimum age tho friend i was just inquiring if there should also be a maximum so let s meet in the middle if it s not a age min but an age min then the max age should be instead of right or instead of there just had to be some kind of cutoff when people become disassociated with society right
first of all no we re not going to meet in the middle based on an arbitrary number you haven t demonstrated any reason why the upper number should be or or or any number cutoff shouldn t have anything to do with age if the reason that older people shouldn t hold elected positions is because of cognitive decline then the only gauge for whether someone should hold office should be whether they ve experienced cognitive decline beyond set parameters setting an upper limit with a specific age is discriminatory against anyone who reaches that age without suffering cognitive decline and since less than of people suffer cognitive decline due to age any upper age limit policy is therefore discriminatory
you re thinking way too much into this mate we were able to do the science to say okay our president cannot be under the age of because of reasons xyz but yet we can t do the same science to say okay our president cannot be over the age of you pick a number because of reasons xyz that in itself seems a bit discriminatory to me edit meant
coldplay i get a lot of negative comments bc of this but i don t care i had a great time thought they did great

at a house party with my boyfriend and a bunch of coworkers it was late like am and everyone was pretty wasted most of us were playing beer pong in the garage i had to go pee so i went inside i opened the bathroom door and the owner of the company s grand daughter was naked on her knees in the shower while two guys were pissing on her her boyfriend was in the garage and one of the guys lived there his pregnant wife was asleep upstairs i turned around and went back to the garage a minute later one of the guys came out into the garage laughing about how trina wanted them to piss on her so they did i felt sooooo bad for her boyfriend he was mortified
more bizarre than weird or disgusting i was invited to a bachelor party for a guy i don t know probably around arrive to a backyard party with a decent size in ground pool hibachi barbecues a couple kegs tapped there s a foot boat on blocks in the yard outboards are off in in parts on a table nearby there s probably guys there mostly college swimmers i know about half of them as the night progresses about guys are on the roof of the house passing around a bottle of scotch another or so people have arrived more are on the way the barbecue guys move the hibachis on to the boat to keep drunks from falling on the grills it s getting crowded the drunks decide to put the boat in the pool maybe guys shove this thing into the pool which sends water everywhere around the pool deck but also knocks the hibachi grills over into the boat seems like an easy fire to put out but it wasn t next thing i know the pool deck is mobbed with drunk college athletes they re all trying to splash water onto the boat beer from the keg taps ice a plastic tarp garden hose and it s just getting worse the smoke is choking the guys on the roof so they re trying to get down it s only about feet but they re drunk some ground based drunks try to do the human pyramid thing to get them down the rain gutter pulls away from the house lots of shouting some of it angry there s going to be a fight soon plus there s a boat on fire in a pool time to go i grab the two guys i came to the party with and we bolt we pass police cars and fire trucks coming the other way a couple days later there s an article in the local paper with a picture of the groom getting married in the hospital but no real details about why he fell of a roof and broke his leg two days before his wedding he could not go to the reception the honeymoon postponed to a later date no mention of a party or a fire from other friends i learn that other than the groom there were no serious injuries damage was confined to the boat the pool and the rain gutter that was probably a fascinating homeowner insurance claim
chick in a the walk in closet making herself available to any person that walked in wasn t hired wasn t paid just liked to do it
so for context there s a beach in texas we used to go to on the weekends in my former hometown basically people play loud music and drink and either walk around on the beach or drive from one end to the other back and forth thousands of people lots of craziness like flashing or people straight up fucking on the beach it was always absolutely bananas so anyway one time i saw one of my former classmates riding on the hood of a car butt naked dancing for everybody then she pulls her tampon out and starts swinging it around
girl was on something and just pulled down her pants and pooped infront of everyone party cleared out real fast after that
i ve seen a drunken army man in full uniform deepthroat a dildo in the middle of a kitchen full of people as they were chillin and snacking i mean it was weird because it wasn t that type of party he had just found one of the peoples dildos don t even ask me how and thought it would be funny to take it downstairs into the kitchen where we all were and stick it down a throat awkward
a girl none of us knew appeared inside the house began hiding beers in the fridge around the apartment started numerous arguments with the host and their friends then proudly declared she has lesions on her brain and surgery tomorrow and that we were all assholes we told her she needed to go and she took more beers flipped us off and stole the lit cigarette from a girl on the back porch as she stumbled off into the night
a buddy of mine brought a girl to a party we were having they were wasted and making out against my car when she turned to throw up all over the hood he comes over to me to apologize for his date and i told him they should clean it off and he said oh no i did already i peed on it to get it off
house party back in the s local punk band playing hard in the living room there was a strobe light lighting the band pit this will be important later a friend of mine was passed out on the floor propped up against a wall just sitting there totally out of it my brother snuck up on him and started moving his lower lip like he was singing along jostling him around upset him and he projectile vomited into the pit with a strobe light lighting the scene you could watch his puke fly through the air blink blink blink splash splash splash like a scene from a horror movie
in my s i went to a girl s night out at a friend s house after a few drinks the local high school assistant principal took off her clothes and was wearing a teddy she got on all fours on a coffee table and pretended to be having sex from behind disturbing
my college roommate used a beer bong to chug a beer with it inserted into his rectum because it gets you drunker he then stood and forcefully projected diarrhea around the room on pretty much every surface he then confiscated all of our phones and wouldn t give them back because he thought we secretly recorded it edit grammar mistake bothered me also this person now has his own medical practice insanely brilliant and wildly eccentric but i guess those two often go hand in hand
there was an old bowl of canned clam chowder someone didn t finish for dinner on the table someone poured a generous amount of rum chata cinnamon flavored cream liqueur into it and started calling it clam chata one girl was very drunk and hungry ate it knowing what it was claimed it was good then threw up a bit into the bowl she proceeded to finish the bowl and continued claiming it was tasty
a dude having violent diarrhea in a sonic 44oz styrofoam cup this was in the backyard of a friend s house with perhaps people at the party he was squatted over the cup holding his balls up with one hand and holding the cup with his other and shitting his brains out it was more than 44oz and he missed the majority of it took about 15seconds from dropping pants to pulling them up doing his belt and walking through the side gate to the front yard it was amazing and horrifying
does a foam party count definitely saw people straight up fucking on the dance floor
girl shit herself in the frat house tub and then fell in it in her party dress by herself she had to be dragged out by her feet sobbing and blackout drunk by her sisters leaving a trail of shit
i was at a house party with bathroom all night there was one guy being obnoxious and passing out every few minutes laying down for then getting up drinking more rinse and repeat eventually he passed out in the one bathroom which cause outrage as people had to relief themselves a hero tried climbing a drain pipe to get into the bathroom window on his first attempted he fell about feet and landed on a bin that broke three guys at the foot of the drain pipe helped him up and one said yo fuck that bin the four of them collectively stamped and kicked the bin like it owed them money until it was in many pieces
probably about years ago i saw this guy absolutely plastered get dared to walk on glowing charcoal from the fire pit then proceed to walk into the fire pit rather than on top of the two bits that the other guy had taken out for this purpose he luckily was wearing shorts and the fire had begun dying down so he didn t catch on fire but he suffered some serious burns crazy thing is he was smiling the entire time like lol aren t i crazy
a guy i knew would take any dare anyone handed him after he was drunk to a certain point a bong was sitting there so someone tells him to drink the bong water and this was some disgusting ass bong water that hadn t been changed in so long iirc he got a gulp or two down before both spilling the rest on the carpet and puking on himself the room reeked like vomit and mold mildew
some drunk guys opening up cans of cream of mushroom soup and using them as chasers
had a party at my place night was ending most people were out i went to use the guest bathroom before bed and a friend was passed out hugging it went to use my bathroom and my roommate is hugging it so i peed in the tub and went to bed in the morning i go to use the bathroom and there is a paint splatter style outline where someone else had tried to pee over him ends up being his brother who also peed all over all of the christmas presents because he thought he was outside peeing on a tree
i saw a guy throw up and a whole bean came out of his nose
most disgusting a dude hopped on top of a dresser and pierced his own junk with a hammer and nail weirdest a couple had gotten married in high school we were all hanging out at my cousin s house drinking and smoking the couple starts arguing they go outside a few minutes later the guy runs into the house screaming blood all over the back of his shirt she had stabbed him in the back we called an ambulance my boyfriend at the time took the wife to the hospital because she insisted on being there for him they both got detained on the way they actually stayed married for over years
i once experienced a pepper party literally stoned people throwing black pepper around on the kitchen floor and sneezing with great exuberance
mid 1980s i was at a party where cocaine was piled up on saucers and you helped yourself with little spoons little spoons you used to get at mcdonald s
i met this man on three separate occasions and i literally only ever knew him as the captain i don t do drugs but my friends certainly did we were at a party and my buddy asked some girl where he could find some molly and she says you ll have to talk to the captain and just walks away we were absolutely fucking mystified as to what that meant like an answer to our prayers the crowd splits for a second and this dude with a comically large pirate hat just appears right in front of us my friend goes are you the captain without a word he smiles and takes off his hat revealing a massive bag of gatorade blue molly that was taped to the inside then he hands my buddy a little dime bag gives a very convincing yargh and disappears into the crowd i laughed so hard i almost puked and i swear every time i saw this dude it was like he was some mysterious pirate deity that would suddenly appear with the sole purpose of giving people free drugs and then disappear again really more awesome than weird but still my favourite party story to tell
i was at a bachelor party once part of the festivities included strippers in a hotel room the groom to be started licking one of the stripper s assholes his marriage lasted less than a year
saw a guy swim naked across a counter top to eat a bar of soap he was very high
at a rugby tournament a shirtless guy was trying to break a table by jumping into it when that didn t work he whipped out his dick and started slamming it into the table screaming he was going to break the table with his cock he did not
was at a family reunion where an uncle called the cops on his own kid for trying to bang one of the cousins i don t go to family reunions anymore
at an outdoor camping party a guy in a gold speedo stumbled over to my friends and i and was talking super fast we couldn t understand a word he said except wanna see a heli cockter i was asking what that is and before i finished asking he whipped his dick out and started flinging it around in a counter clockwise motion we all took off running and now i know what a heli cockter is
definitely the time the guy i was dating for four months brought me to his best friend s house party i was like lol i liked mingling so i was chatting it up with his friends and whatnot i noticed dude had disappeared some of his friends also noticed and walked around with me to find him we proceeded to walk in on him in the middle of a threesome with his best friend s gf and a random lady fight broke out cops were called and i left and never spoke to any of them again oof
when i was a junior in hs a girl got so drunk at a pool party she shit herself in the pool with about others in the pool everyone ran screaming in horror she never showed her face in the school again
years ago a casual acquaintance shows up to a party an immigrant with limited english ability he got drunk like the rest of us and crashed on the couch the next morning he vomited all over the couch just gurgled it up all over the place i helped clean it up and we sent him on his way but the thing i can t get out of my mind was how weird that vomit was it was pitch black gooey and smelled odd it freaked me out but i just assumed it must have been something to do with the kind of food he ate he seemed fine albeit hungover but thinking about it now really makes me worry if he was really okay like could he have been suffering some kind of internal bleeding without any means to be checked out
i was somebody s weird moment at a house party back in the early 90s ended up getting really baked in the basement with by roommate and this musician dude who was like twice our age we re having a good time and the dude mentions how bad he has the munchies he says the best chips for when he has the munchies are this specific brand of kettle cooked chips i d kill for some right now so i pull a bag of them out of a coat pocket pretty awesome right little while later he says how much he likes chocolate when stoned especially this specific mint chocolate one and how hard they are to find i smile and pull one out of my pocket by the end of the night i had done it times pulling specific snacks out of different pockets plus i was so stoned i was in silent bob mode dude was like i don t know if that was awesome or scary
i watched a guy light his balls on fire at a party once
a guy at a party but like a smallish party more like a group hang smoked and drank wayy to much and maybe more stuff and couldn t make it to the bathroom so his friends brought the trash can over to him i was sitting on the other side of the living room watching in horror as he puked his guts up into the can and then stood up and pulled his pants down and emptied out the other end too in liquid form i ran out of there so fast
a guy who was so drunk that he first peed out the window and then puked all over the heating because the heating was on and he didn t clean it up right away the next morning the whole room smelled like puke and the puke had soaked into the carpet
right after college we got a big group of our friends to go on a ski trip there were about of us and we all stayed in a big log cabin one night after skiing as we were all partying we started to notice something dripping from the ceiling we go upstairs and find one of our friend s boyfriends passed out in the middle of the floor with a huge pile of vomit near his head since it was a log cabin and the floor boards weren t completely flush with each other the vomit was seeping through and dripping down into the kitchen ugh
party was full swing lots of people alcohol and weed flowing on every floor of a story house suddenly we hear a baby crying upstairs which was bizarre as nobody there had a baby moments later the mother was located on another floor and she was completely hammered she was young and vaguely known by a number there but apparently she had felt left out due to being a young parent and after failing to find a baby sitter she had decided to get drunk anyway and crash her older brothers house party whereupon after sneaking in she abandoned her baby on the top floor so that she could go socialise downstairs when the brother realised the baby was his nephew and his sister was drunk and at the party he went straight upstairs and tried to convince her to go home with the baby but his insistence just unleashed this tsunami of rage in his drunken sister and seeing red she grabbed a portable heater and started swinging it in circles by its wire trying to land a blow on her brother like it was a medieval mace her brother tried to leg it but she chased after him still swinging the portable heater around taking chunks of plaster and masonry out of the walls all the way down the spiral stairs and beyond she was only stopped after big guys restrained her whilst another who had remained sober as a designated driver took her baby to a cousins house where it could sleep safe for the night definitely the craziest thing i ve seen at a house party both she and the trail of destruction she left behind were quite mad
morning after a beach party i didn t sleep but as the sun was rising of the surfer dudes started smoking meth together and telling me it was better than coffee before a surf suddenly made sense why they didn t need wetsuits in freezing water another time a buddy and i went out on the town in a city we had never been to before we thought we could get accommodation on the night however everything was fully booked so we just partied on and towards closing time we went to a turkish bar and smoked some hookah the table next to us was crowded with large islander guys and they invited us to join we ended up going home with them as they were nice enough to offer us shelter after hearing our story woke up the next morning to breakfast and joints then they all put their gang patches on and dropped us off back at our car nicest blokes ever
this isn t disgusting but definitely weird and hilarious i was at a halloween party with my friend a few years ago this part isn t the story but was just a fun part of the night i was dressed as jesus and at the beginning of the party i found someone dressed as a priest he came up to me and handed me his bible and told me to read a verse out of it so i opened it up and it had a flask in it him and i were best friends all night now the actual story there was some guy dressed up as a mime and i never saw him say a word all night dude was dedicated my buddy and i were drinking from a handle of jack danials all night and near the end of the night we were on the dance floor with about  of the handle left the mime walks up to us points at the jack points at his mouth and makes the please hand gesture so we hand it to him and this champion points it to the sky and drinks a third of a handle of whiskey we couldn t even be mad he never spoke a word and took it like a champion minutes later he was outside puking his brains out still never said a word to this day i still respect his dedication
idk if this is weird but kinda funny was at a high school party and i saw some guys in a circle passing a pipe i m thinking stoner circle so i roll one up real quick to join in showed them and they re like let s clear the bowl they hand it to me and it looks weird and nothing is green i m like what is this one guy goes meth i say oh y all are doing real drugs i m not about that so i m just gonna light up the j pretty cool dudes in all honesty but i wasn t down for that circle
at a private function at a rugby club when one guy seemingly under no pressure whatsoever made a bet with everyone that he could kick a conversion from the halfway line or he d drink everything from the beer drip trays the mixed alcohol bits of fluff and dead flies got him absolutely wasted and he ended up stealing his boss s work van and crashed it into a train barrier the police found him curled up asleep on a grass verge cuddling a dead badger
saw a really drunk guy eat a full ashtray like a bowl of cereal
i saw a woman pull iirc pair of mardi gras beads out of her pussy while standing on a bar at a house party it was artistic
we were teens in the bush some kid disappeared for a while and was found after some effort balls deep in the mud of a creek bank you gotta be some fuckin drunk
went to a frat house party while visiting my friends at their college dude walks up not even trying to hide it and drops a pill in my friend s roommate s drink and just starts a conversation like nothing happened shit hit the fan everyone started yelling and we all got kicked out because he was in the frat and we were targeting him for no reason
friend of mine was a pizza spot late at night while drunk few bites into his slice he pukes on himself and slice and continues eating the slice people around him rightfully freaked out and he got yelled by the dudes behind the counter to leave
had a kid throw up in my kitchen sink in college to a degree where it was almost full being drunk and poor i said to the party if anyone unclogs this sink i ll give you dollars my friend walks up to me and screams you idiot that s a steal as he rolled up his sleeve and just shoved his arm in full throttle to unclog it i remember how quickly he jumped on it and did it that i genuinely thought i was being a drunk idiot by offering but looking back it s probably the best five bucks i ve ever spent
my friend was sitting next to a girl on a couch the girl had to puke she began to puke a wide wad of thick puke slid out of her mouth and down her chin she somehow managed to slurp it all back up in that moment my friend made his move and they started to make out this happened rapidly it was just a couple of seconds
some asshole brought an acoustic guitar and insisted on playing wonderwall for everyone
watched someone fill an empty pot noodle container with buckfast down it vomit the buckfast back into the container then drink it again
a girl took her tampon out while drunk on the ground and was trying to get guys that walked by her to fuck her another dude was peeping through a window of those two underage teens going at it he fell and split with face open needed some stitches someone wiped their ass on the towels in the bathroom
two guys super drunk on moonshine ended up shitting everywhere and taking turns cleaning up each other s shit then they went to bed together they identified as two straight males but i think enough moonshine makes that line blur
i ve seen loads of open sex acts stepped over people boning on the floor that kind of thing i guess or a well hung guy at this one party who kept sneaking up on seated people and whipping them across the face
some girl put flank steak in her bra and went around feeding it to people

legit saw some women at a bachelorette party groping a bouncer large black male who kept his hands raised and tried to get them to stop only for them to call him gay when he managed to escape legit were grabbing his crotch dude looked terrified
i got invited to this ratchet rave years ago in paris it was early in the morning and i am peeing in the urinal i am struggling to pee and the guy next to me tries to look at my junk and says you too i hate when it happens i burst out laughing and some random guy in his late 30s is walking like a penguin with his pants around his ankles smelling like shit it was awful he was rambling about something and jumped butt first into the sink he started cleaning himself and spraying water everywhere just disgusting i left literally minutes later never went back
was at a frat party in college and walked into the guys bathroom to this guy eating a girl out on the disgusting ass toilet with the stall door open
we all gathered around a woman putting an orange in her butt edit spelling
watched a guy eat an entire party sub one time
jungle juice in a dirty bath tub
once i walked into a room and saw a man putting a cigarette out on a baby s bare bottom we dragged him outside beat the hell out of him and dragged his face across the stucco and another time i walked into the bathroom to a guy pulling down a passed out girl s pants we beat him up put him in the shower with burning hot water than freezing cold then hot then cold and yeah welcome to winnipeg manitoba canada i guess
a friend of mine from uni halls had a real bad habit of vomiting and passing out in the shared toilet during parties so one time after i don t see him for a while i find him in the same toilet he is passed out with his head in said toilet which is full of vomit he wouldn t wake up so i decided to flush the toilet with his head still in it and by god the sight of that mostly vomit water swirling around his head was something else he woke up pretty quickly oh and before anyone calls me an asshole he had tried to set my duvet on fire that same night so i was not in the mood for patience by this stage of the night
back in high school there was this one girl who was an absolute unit and not very hygienic to boot she showed up at one party but kinda vanished halfway through and no one even noticed later that night i had to get something from the host s room and when i opened the door i was greeted by the sight smell and sound of some dude just railing this girl from behind and the guy was this skinny little dweeb you seen that pic of mogwai from jungle book with the elephant there s your visual she making a sound not unlike a bear trying to shit a pinecone but the smell oh sweet jesus the smell a mix of old tuna open ass and unwashed balls i literally vomited on the spot they noticed and just kept going i yelled at them to get the fuck of my friend s room and once they left i ran down and grabbed my friend to let him know what happened he went upstairs a cry of disgust confirmed he entered the room and he immediately came down and kicked everyone out it took days for the smell to clear my boy had to sleep on the couch during that time edit my friend sadly passed a few years back but i m sure he d love the response to the tale of the desecration of his room i don t think he touched tuna until the day he died edit i m keeping the mogwai the crossover we never knew we wanted
a friend randomly shared with me one day the time were at a house party a party goer disappeared for awhile only to stumble back into the main room going balls deep in a pumpkin
i kinda like weird things so people werstling in oil half naked in a basement it was really fun it was not sexual techno party inside an occupied university with people doing drugs in classrooms or smoking in the main amphiteater in engineering school people naked drinking beer which ran in their buttcrack and in which they put their cock a party with the entire basement dedicated to fuck people could take luminescent bracelets there were three colors and you would choose one to only watch one if you had already a sexual partner s and one if you were okay to try with people you don t know that s it except for the engineering one which was a sort of tradition so that happened multiple times i quite enjoyed the parties lmao
a probably male local drug dealer i should mention the home owner renter had a party once in high school he apparently really wanted chicken fingers so he decides to put a full tray of delectable chicken fingers in the oven the party continues on twenty minutes later the chicken fingers are finished the fingers are taken out of the oven by a party guest and the guests proceed to eat the said fingers the drug dealer is completely unaware of the chicken finger bandits and comes inside expecting his tasty treat ready to go not the case lol the drug dealer chicken finger craver notices all fingers have been eaten and reaches for a full plum sauce container from the counter and smashes it over his head plum sauce is fucking flying left right and centre i think i may have peed a little from laughing
i watched a guy punch a stop sign outside of a party edge on and split his hand between bird finger and ring finger almost to his wrist
playing a drinking game with fully grown but profoundly inexperienced drinkers i m shocked everyone is hanging in with me a vet until they all hit their limit almost simultaneously it was like that ipecac family guy episode the whole place turned into a m a s h unit with me being the only functional adult trying to manage rotating people in and out of the restrooms sinks buckets and bins
people sharing hooka not gross in the moment but when i found out every single person that smoked that night got strep throat it s pretty disgusting
i had a houseparty and my friends and i went out back to smoke a bowl with a bunch of girls they pass the pipe around a circle of people and when it got to me at the end i ripped it as i noticed my friend with a evil grin trying to stop me half assed attempt they had loaded the pipe with the contents of the shop vac hose which was percent labrador retriever hair i was more appalled that all the girls hit it and didnt notice burning hair wtf
a friend of mine drank too much at a college party i was sitting on the back porch on a cool autumn night and i heard the sound of what i could only describe as a bucket of water being poured onto concrete he comes stumbling out from around the side and i chat with him for a bit suddenly he runs over to a dark circle in the back yard and vomits right in the middle i am shocked and ask why he threw up on the small kid s trampoline he responded i thought it was a fire pit apparently the next day the kid from upstairs came down to play on the trampoline to discover the mess and went back inside crying
friend of mine told me about a car they would pass when they would stagger home from the bar or parties during college every time they would pass the car no matter what they would piss on the car they did this so much that eventually it started to become discolored in spots one night they were coming home from a toga party and as is tradition the group pissed on the car the owner just happened to come to the window that night to spot dudes standing around his ride and one girl squatting over the hood drenching it in piss
corn in the jungle juice
the girl bought a single sweet potato with her she ate half of it raw and then we played spin the sweet potato with the other half
i hate parties so if i m invited i come a couple hours late take one picture and leave everyone is already drunk high and whatever else the last party i went to was a secret location party in an abandoned looking house it was so crowded i could hardly walk so i was trying to find a friend i gave up and went to a less crowded area where people were smoking there was a girl laying on the floor naked people were walking around her the police came i stayed like an idiot the girl was a minor and she was dead she overdosed to this day i still don t drink or go to parties
i ve seen a dude suck his own dick at a party in highschool
bro this one guy whipped out his wang and just started jackin it like it was nothin edit i kinda liked it
a friend of mine hosted a party not long after his dad had passed late into the night said fiend snorted a small line of his dad s ashes he said his dad would ve found it hilarious i met the man once and i can t say i d disagree there was plenty of dad left in the urn so i guess it wasn t too egregious but i ll never forget the sight
went to a party out in the middle of nowhere we all ended up skinny dipping and my buddy swam across the river had somebody spotlight him and he did the helicopter but the water was cold so we all called it the light switch
i m late to this party so it s likely buried back in the s i grew up in the suburbs of la and went to a lot of house parties went to a friends house one night for a rager and some of his friends from hollywood showed up these guys and gals were super into the metal scene and looked the part big hair leather tattoos think gnr but dirtier so i m in the hallway waiting for the bathroom and i hear this girl saying to a metal dude no fucking way i don t believe you he then whips out his dick and on one side is tattoo of a ruler and the other side was a lightning bolt i went to some wild parties
dude smokes a pack of cigarettes and eats an entire pack of hotdogs uncooked out of the package in one sitting
i saw a guy pass out drunk on the lawn and a bunch of other guys went over and pissed all over him and left him out there this was their friend that they did this to
got invited to a part by a coworker told about it to be exact as it wasn t at that coworkers house but at someone s we both knew party started at but i had to stay a bit late at work so i didn t make it there until about most people were already plastered you could smell beer and various mixers that were spilled or emanating from all the empty containers two of the three bathrooms were already occupied by people praying to the porcelain god and those still fairly mobile were in the back yard attempting to grill and jumping into the pool one girl was already passed out sitting on the couch with a bit of vomit still on her shirt some guy i didn t know dressed in what looked like basketball shorts came stumbling in laughing like crazy lays down on the floor still laughing sounded like he was about to puke but proceeded to shit himself so bad it spilled out of his shorts i promptly left
i saw someone hold onto the window frame lean backwards and poop onto the sidewalk below over the years i ve seen a lot most of the puke drugs and sex described below but shitting out of the window stands out because i never saw it before or since
this one time somebody got jumped while walking home from the party we were at the dude who lived at the house drunk and a generally unhinged person was infuriated by this and decides to find the people responsible and retaliate he comes running into the kitchen from his garage sets a glass bottle full of liquid on the table and very loudly announces nobody fucking drink this before running back into the garage naturally a girl already very drunk accuses him of holding out on booze grabs it takes a big gulp violently pukes almost immediately dude comes back into the kitchen with a rag in his hand and sees her puking that s fucking gas not booze and this rag is for the wick not your puke
my own story and tbh compared to some others here it s a little tame but i ll share anyway when i was around i was good friends with a girl i d met in college she had a boyfriend who i got on with really well and we d hang out as a group often game and generally chatted outside of the group dude s parents are very well off multimillionaire types but he s very humble they have a bedroom mansion for just the of them and he has the equivalent of a bedroom house to himself as his area of the house plus a huge kitchen diner study his parents were cool af with us partying and let us have a person party at the house for his 21st birthday fully catered for and more alcohol than you could imagine we started drinking around 5pm and people show up music blasting party games etc and by midnight we re all quite merry birthday boy decides he wants me and him to do one shot of every different alcohol they had together to see in his birthday and when i say _everything_ i mean it wine beer cider vodka rum bourbon tequila schnapps sambuca fucking everything me and him facing each other two lines of shots and a crowd around us shot after shot til it was all done we actually got through it just fine somehow the crowd around us went wild after that he says he needs a joint and we go for a smoke together i had a decent tolerance at the time but didn t smoke too much before going back inside to pee i go upstairs to his bathroom important because the party was all over this huge house with like bathrooms sit on the toilet to piss because i m drunk and the room had a slanted ceiling which made it annoying in that moment while i m sitting there pissing i get this immediate urge to throw up and as luck would have it there s a bath less than feet in front of where i m sitting i launched forward and threw up into the bath once i d thrown up for a couple of minutes i flushed my piss and sat on the floor next to the toilet with my head over the bowl assuming i d sort my head out maybe throw up a little more and get back up i ended up falling asleep i m told it had been around minutes and several people wondering where i d gone then someone looking for me found me in his bathroom one bath full of sick pants around my ankles puke down my chin passed out hugging the toilet my mate got me up helped pull my pants up and got me onto a spare mattress in birthday boy s bedroom with a glass of water i woke up the next morning barely capable of moving and decided i d lay there until some of the haze wore off my friend and her boyfriend however decided it was a perfect opportunity for birthday hangover sex so i got to listen to that while hating my existence as a good friend i waited mins after they finished to pretend to wake up like i hadn t heard it all no big deal i thank them for a great night and promise i ll clean up the bathroom someone had taken a cab to mcdonald s to buy everyone breakfast so i ate and delayed going into the bathroom my friend was much less hungover than i and decided the bathroom couldn t wait so cleaned it for me herself there was apparently around inches deep pink goo in the bath with bits blocking the plug we laughed about it years on i told her i heard her birthday treat in the morning but pretended to be asleep she thanked me for not cock blocking her and i thanked her for looking after me cleaning up probably the worst state i ve ever been in haven t repeated since but a story i ll always remember
walked into the pantry at a house party and found a guy using a jar of peanut butter as a fleshlight
people blowing cocaine up other people s asses
buddy of mine and his now ex are making out next thing you know he s projectile vomiting in her mouth i just walked out of the room blocked what i saw from my mind and decided it was time to go for a walk
a bunch of guys got the hosts dog to have sex with the quarterback s drunk girlfriend i took my drink and left
a woman who i had infinite respect for claimed openly and matter of factly at a party that a woman could never rape a male because men and boys always want it when someone else attending the party spoke up and said that this wasn t true and that he was a victim she laughed in his face i haven t seen her since she lives kind of far away and i m honestly not sure how to deal with her now i have no idea what it s going to be like the next time we hang out with her and her husband
a woman took off her pants and panties proceeded to climb onto a table and proceeded further on to ride a 2liter mountain dew bottle the bottle fit almost exactly halfway inside her people were either cheering or just watching in awe i was confused because i only thought pornstars did that shit it was both disgusting and sexy like a trainwreck it s horrible but i couldn t look away
there was a girl on campus which was crippled and used crutches to get around she was pretty cute and also known to be quite promiscuous i got invited to a frat party and while there after a while the call of nature had me seeking a restroom now most of the frat houses were old plantation style houses converted very animal house like so i headed upstairs to find the john and there was a line of guys just standing in the hallway i figure they were there to take a pee too but i ask anyway where the restroom was to my surprise it was not the door the boys were facing i did my business and was heading down the stairs passed those boys again that is when i saw a crutch leaning against the door frame later that year i heard the entire membership of one fraternity were treated for std s
i saw a dude drink a brown beer bottle full of dip spit unknowingly immediately barfed so did i still gagging typing this and it was years ago
i was at a party with some buddies it s a smaller house with a kitchen and living room combined as you walk in it s crammed like sardines probably people at least in this one room people shuffling around bump into each other more people outside coming in and some going out minimal lighting loud music well me and one of my friends are standing next to each other surrounded by people on all all sides i accidentally knocked his drink onto the floor and it obviously spills and someone yells zamboni me and my buddy look at each other and neither of us are about to slurp that shit up within seconds a random guy comes through the crowd and says i ll do it you pussies dude gets in push up position and slurps up the drink gets up and disappears my buddy and i go about our business and enjoy the night the next day we come back to help clean up the host of the party had said someone had thrown up on the floor the night before from chugging a bottle of vodka after collecting all the bottles and cans it is time to mop the floor the mopping just ended up pushing around a muddy mixture of whatever people tracked in from outside and whatever alcohol or puke was on the floor it took a lot to finally clean the floor and i can not imagine being the dude who had zambonied
it was a small punk show and tacos were thrown in the middle of a mosh pit some dude picked up a piece of a smashed and stomped on taco and ate it
i threw a party for the new year s a girl there my best friends girlfriend took hits of strong acid and pills of extacy completely flipped out stripped naked pissed and shit on the floor tried to kill me her boyfriend my girlfriend and broke a bunch of stuff we ended up tackling her forcing some clothes on her and taking her to the hospital luckily her mom worked the psych ward there i didn t touch a hallucination for years after that
bus seats would be gross
men wouldn t have useful pockets either
people would ask horny questions in this sub less often
warm climate areas would be packed with people while cold climate places would be empty

honestly fire fighting welding any job with fire honestly would be a lot more dangerous
embarrassing boners and tampon string reveals
onlyfans would be out of business
it would be harder for businesses in the clothing industry to make money

skid marks everywhere

people will actually worry about personality
no one would have leather seats in their cars anymore
people would be way less ridiculous and stupid about body stuff more genital injuries and disgusting unhygienic stuff would happen too

sitting on santas knee at christmas
those little kids in china and the philippines would have to find a new job

indoor ambient temperatures in homes workplaces and stores would need to be higher it would be a very seasonal thing outdoors here no one is going to be out in below freezing temperatures waiting for the bus stark naked for half or more of the year realistically nudism would only be a june through mid september thing at most in my climate sunburns on sensitive bits would be a problem for winter pasty toned folk parasols wide brimmed hats and sunscreen sales would increase i suppose we d get used to ignoring random stress boners walking by guys might get less insecure about their genital size since they can see what normal really looks like tits would also get more realistic exposure personally i hate underboob sweat in summer bras are annoying but they do help with air circulation for hygiene reasons there would likely need to be a butt towel carried around for sitting in public areas or on work chairs no one wants to sit in someone else s crotch sweat
there wouldn t be so many jacked up trucks because we d be able to see their tiny penis so the truck would be pointless
well id probably buy a lot more sanitary wipes
hugging
we will have more wounds that meaning hospitals will be more crowded
you know how at a gym it s polite thing to use some spray and a cloth to wipe over the equipment you ve just used that but world wide also leather seats lounges would go out of fashion quickly especially in warmer climates could you imagine the fun of trying to peel your entire body of a leather couch that you re stuck to from sweat
here in canada lets just say there would be a lot of pointy nipples
more people would die from hypothermia frost bite exposure skin cancer
fewer people outdoors in winter
public nudity laws
my hair length super long to cover everything and keep warm t t lmao
here are my first thoughts if clothing was never necessary we would have developed thicker skin or more hair for protection mobile phones wouldn t be a thing as they are designed to be carried in pockets all other technological advancements would be developed as wearables rather than relying on clothing to carry it hygiene would be paramount in almost all aspects of life clothing no longer acts as a barrier for injury contamination cross contamination dirt etc the hygiene industry will likely replace the clothing industry body shaming would happen more often despite it being common already statements would lead to being said in passing as observations rather than judgements or it could go in the opposite direction where body positivity is more common harsher environments would be uninhabited the warmer and moister areas would be filled with people and that s about it sorry for formatting and not formulating my thoughts right am on mobile
people would ask silly questions like what would change if everybody was clothed all the time
pubic hair styles
that would be awkward at first but i think eventually people would get used to it
no pockets except the peachy pocket
the law there d be no such thing as indecent exposure if it were normalised also attached meanings to exposing oneself would virtually disappear
bicycle seat designs would have to change
chefs would be paid much better women probably wouldn t show up to work when they have their period tattoos and body piercings would be ubiquitous

sunburnt penis
work accident statistics would go through the sky imagine a welder getting drops of liquid iron on his rod at least it safes on shaving time
it will all boil down to who you are and not who you wear

less hand gun related violence
frostbite
the popularity of frying bacon in other words thinking how badly do i really want this
the sunblock industry would see a massive increase in sales

subconscious social hierarchy we d judge people less by their money class demographic and more by their health
day to day life would be a lot harder
generic nsfw sex ask reddits wont appear every second post anymore
people would get a lot of uti
hopefully obesity would decline fat shaming would be less of a stigma and more of a socially acceptable problem that needs to be fixed it s not healthy
ufc
we would all live in the tropics
i think personality would matter more
no one would be a short order cook and diner like restaurants would cease to exist
in the winter a lot more frostbite
no more deep frying
shoplifting would become a little more uncomfortable
going to church
a stripclub wouldn t really feel the same
i m literally supposed to be doing college work atm on the endocrine system but either way i m going to go lengthy on this one because i ve given it thought before i do this a lot with other topics because adhd the government would make sure that everyone was clean or sanitized before walking into and establishment cleansers that are made for tables chairs upholstery and other things of that nature would have to be a natural cleaner as to not damage the skin of the people who sit there next talking about private areas adding to this the chairs we sit on would have to be made non sticky so that people don t have red bums everywhere i think shoes would be one of the highest saught out items especially when it comes to fashion as if everyone is naked there would be no other fashion but shoes since most of this nation is covered in shit that would hurt your feet hair would also be something that i think people would just let grow more for warmth purposes unless the naked thing is only during sustainable weather even then i hate shaving if you re a woman you know what i mean i think theyd also make hair fashion shows a thing i mean with more than just the hair on your face we would all be similar to that dude from the adams family the nation in general would have a better understanding of just accepting other people because their insecurites would also be on display for the world to see porn would probably be more normalized since everyone would be seeing everyone else s business lol other than that yeah i would fucking hate it could you imagine everyone seeing where you sweat from imagine them being able to see your asshole all the time or that mole you ve been hiding from someone everyone would be equal in that sense because everyone could always see everything except the feet for the most part
pickpocketing would go down
i think there would be a lot less obese people no one would to see it or be seen as it i wouldn t
metal benches in arizona
guys with small dicks wouldn t drive giant trucks anymore
porn wouldn t have sense
the death of sexy tan lines
health and fitness would become a priority by default
upholstery fabric
the world would smell like ass
less fried food
it would be the height of sexy to cover up a little ankle
working with children would become weird going to a concert and going to an orgy would feel very similar you probably hug your dog less porn will focus on hardcore and extra hardcore or maybe really specific kinks because people would be used to watch naked people
my eyeglass prescription
a lot of self proclaimed alpha males would demonstrably not be
hairdressers scope of work would change not just eyebrows anymore
i wouldn t do jiu jitsu
there would be a lot of countries people wouldn t even want to live in there would be no fashion industry people would have more realistic ideas of body image there would be far less bacon cooked in the world
there would probably be an increase in public masturbation and public sex

thinking i ve been held down in life over girls who don t want to feel they made a bad choice with my family and their friends over me groups of big dicks duds over age who were lined up and ready to pay the kids for sex starting in when i was there was a competition between me and year olds in my family over impressing the year old girls enough for them to have sex with them by the time they re and i m things were done to make sure that i wouldn t ever be successful by the time i was and the first pedophile sexual success with my schoolmates was achieved crispr on you will make sure they don t feel regret for sure here we are a quarter century later and those child victims have gone on to groom many children for those same men

we shouldn t give leonardo dicaprio shit for dating consenting adults even if they re usually under the age of and are sometimes teenagers like i feel more confident he is fucking kids than most old powerful hollywood actors and the women are old enough to decide who they want to date they have agency too buuuut i also kind of feel like it is slightly weird like that amount of power imbalance age on top of wealth and fame and influence and like is it an age fetish is it going to continue forever so hot take we should respect dating choices and leave him alone he isn t doing anything wrong or illegal cold take it actually is kind of weird though

mosquitos bedbugs and fleas
mosquitoes are the absolute worst
bed bugs
roaches hard stop lived in phoenix for a long time and any man made water feature like a fountain or whatever in the desert is a big draw for roaches and they are big and gross on hot nights leaving a friend s house with a giant fountain outside his apartment i had to stomp my feet as i walked to get them to scatter i could be wrong but it seemed like for the longest time roaches indicated a person was filthy while that may be the case for some people with an infestation urban areas are prone to them as well without the filth element

chihuahuas in my book i m not saying all chihuahuas are demonic but a whole lot of them are it mostly comes from owners not raising the chihuahuas correctly but there s still a baseline attempt from chihuahuas to convey more noise confidence threat etc because they are small my aunt has a chihuahua that despite knowing me goes absolute crazy when i enter he even snarled at me once he would bark nonstop simply a car moving past a mailman anything owners just don t see a reason to train chihuahuas as much because they just see them is a tiny lap pet

i am a nurse i had a patient with a snow white beard and a big round belly he was a santa at those shacks around xmas my instincts did not like him he made my hair stand on end i had my back to him in the patient room i heard something fall off his bedside table so i turned around and i said to him your toothbrush fell he hard stared me and pushed his toothpaste on the floor and then continues to stares at me i left the room the toothbrush and toothbrush stayed on the floor for hours until he picked it up as a nurse i deal with creepy violent and manipulative people frequently but there was something about his staring me down and lack of words that made me highly uncomfortable the worst part is he works with kids they sit in his lap it makes me sick
the guy in line directly behind me to use the atm was so close that i felt his breath on my neck he was clearly poised to get my pin or grab whatever came out of the atm so i just left as quickly as possible
i walked in to pay for my petrol it was me a young cashier and this guy he just started talking to me and kept asking weird questions i couldn t tell you why but he made my hair stand on edge it was clear he wasn t within his right mind and he wouldn t let me leave the store after about 10minutes of talking about the most random things he just decides to leave the store minutes later he was dead shot by police very very rare in my country as he went to police station and tried to shoot them i only knew that as he made the news they showed the mugshot from previous arrest
when i was around the age of or i can t recall correctly we went to a small pet shop frequently because my mom fed the strays around the guy that owned the store was accompanied by a neighbor that kept him company as he was alone and it was a small store in a neighborhood now that guy gave me the chills there was something in his smile in his crooked teeth that made me not wanting to be near him he would try to chat with me innocently but i was very shy so i wouldn t answer and went around looking at the fish tanks and the pet bunnies but as expected he would show up and make comments about them now my mom didn t get any bad vibes from him as he would also chat with her about the animals she takes cares of etc one day we visit the store the owner approaches my mom and talks to her privately apparently he apologized to her for letting that man being near me as he was arrested for sexually harassing a slightly older girl in the neighborhood the guy was a pedophile and was found out he was trying to groom lots of kids in the neighborhood especially sometimes when they entered the store and the pedo was by himself in the store can t believe that my year old gut sense was right lol

i live in arkansas for context i had a run in with a state trooper in the early morning hours on the way to work he was driving miles an hour on the interstate in the left hand lane i might add i passed him without speeding and he immediately hit his blue lights and pulled me over i knew something was wrong when i saw him get out of his car dude was in a pure rage he came up to my window and started screaming and yelling saying that i was endangering everyone on the road by driving so fast and being so reckless spit was flying out of the dudes mouth and the more he talked the louder he got and the more incoherent he became he tried to give me a ticket for reckless driving because i was going according to him anyway miles over the speed limit thing is i wasn t he was going miles under the speed limit i figured out pretty quickly that he was high as a kite on some pretty bad shit when i told him this he became enraged again it wasn t until i raise my voice that he snapped back to reality there was a speed limit sign about feet in front of us when i asked him what it said he turned his blood shot eyes towards the sign them back at me he didn t say another word he just got back in his car and tore off throwing road side gravel towards my car as he did so i still think about it all the time i got real close to going to jail or worse for doing what i was supposed to be doing in the first place it was one of the strangest most dangerous encounters i have ever had
the first time i actually got hit on by an older man i was still pretty shy and didn t get a lot of attention from guys my age so fully did not expect an adult man to be interested i was at the bookstore in the mall and he was following me around but i thought i was imagining it then he asked me to come out to dinner with him he was like so i thought he must be confused i told him i was and in high school thinking he would be so embarrassed when he realized but he just said that s ok and ran his fingers up and down my upper arm ew i was creeped out for sure but i kind of shook it off but looking back on it now it makes my fucking blood boil that a middle aged man who definitely knew i was a minor even tried that so fucking gross i ve had many many experiences of all kinds of harassment a lot of it from older men when i was very young but that was the first time one tried to actually get with me and he also put his hands on me which is so disgusting
probably accidentally bumping into a rough looking guy while walking around san francisco and him turning around and yelling if you touch me again i m going to fucking kill you i was about
desert storm coming in to the aftermath of an armor battle there was an iraqi soldier who had effectively been blow in have nothing left of his body below the navel he was still alive and i guess the shock was enough that he didn t even realize he was already dead he saw us and started shouting at us and trying to grab his weapon to shoot at us he died less than a minute after that but it was still an insane thing to experience
posted about it before i worked in a retail store in the mid s the assistant manager left me alone in the store to run an errand manager found out and called him asking him why and they had an argument guy flipped out began trashing the store crying and screaming blurted out he had spent yrs in prison for murder and doesnt need the bullshit it was scary as hell it was a complete feral meltdown and i pondered sneaking out and never coming back but i needed the job the look on his face chilled me he didnt get fired but i left shortly after someone in a blind rage fueled meltdown can be scary enough the confession made it scarier there was no indication at all he had killed someone prior was a very chill guy until then
this was about years ago in a small coastal moroccan town i was traveling around morocco for a month with two friends let s call them mark and amy and we ended up getting a bus to this town that arrived late in the day we didn t have any accommodation arranged and as we walked from hotel to hotel it became clear that we weren t going to find a room easily eventually as it was heading towards sunset a moroccan man in a black hooded djellaba called to us from a stoop and asked us if we were looking for a place to stay we said we did so he told us to follow him we were desperate so we did he led us to a house and told us to wait outside while he spoke to his friend after a few minutes he opened the door and told us to come in and that we could stay in his friend s spare room we entered and there was a pretty bemused looking couple along with their kids sat around a kitchen table whose house we were apparently going to share for the night we were led upstairs to a bedroom with one bed and told we could have this place for the night for a pretty good price our hooded friend then asked us if we had any alcohol with us as an extra payment morocco being a dry country we said we didn t so he laughed it off and left us to our room we set our bags down and thought that while weird this had kind of worked out we went out to grab some dinner and then came back to the room by then a fog had rolled in off the ocean and everything was looking spooky and beautiful mark wanted to walk down to the harbor and take some photos while amy said she was too tired and wanted to get an early night i took my camera and went with mark down the emptying streets to the harbor we spent minutes or so photographing the boats and the harborfront in the fog and then decided we would head back and get some sleep too by now it was pitch black and the streets were mostly deserted aside from the main square by the harborfront which had a few restaurants open as we walked through the square who called out to us but our hooded friend now obviously quite drunk he saw our cameras and wanted a photo taken with us and then afterwards asked us where we were headed we told him we were on our way back to the room and he immediately declared that he knew a shortcut and that if we followed him we d get back much quicker we said we were fine thank you but he insisted and started walking we followed we had only been down these streets once and in the light now it was dark and we quickly got turned around the hooded man was leading us down a main thoroughfare at first though with each turn he made the streets seemed to be getting smaller and smaller mark and i looked at each other a few times clearly both thinking the same thing we didn t know where the hell we were now the streets were totally deserted and we started turning into tighter and tighter alleys in what was clearly a residential area i started thinking that we should turn back because i hadn t seen anything i recognised in a few minutes eventually the hooded man turned a corner down a high sided totally pitch dark alleyway that was definitely not in the direction we were meant to be headed this shortcut had already taken too long and mark and i both stopped short as we peered round this last turn it was totally black but we thought we could see more than one person down that alleyway in the gloom we looked at each other and instantly bolted in the other direction cameras swinging we hared it back over the cobbled streets not caring where we were going and not looking back we jumped over curbs and stalls took corners at random our only thought to get far away from that alleyway as fast as possible after a minute or two we both had the same horrified realisation in the same moment amy was back in the room and the hooded man knew where that was we didn t we started trying to pick out landmarks anything really that looked even vaguely familiar had we been past this column before what about that shopfront with all the bags which direction was the ocean it took us maybe or minutes of backtracking before we were back on one of the main streets and we thought we knew which way to go from there to get back to the room we thought of grabbing amy and going but where would we go we already knew there were no other rooms available and the next bus out wasn t until the morning we just resolved to get back to amy and then decide what to do as we got closer to the room we slowed down what if the hooded man was waiting for us outside what if he had other people with him we started almost creeping down the last few narrow streets listening and keeping our eyes peeled for anything suspicious then there it was the final corner with the small courtyard and the front door just beyond it we stopped and then peered around the corner in the center of the courtyard was a motorcycle with the engine off and sat astride the motorcycle was the hooded man he was motionless no he was asleep asleep with the kickstand out slumped slightly to one side probably from the alcohol i guessed we crept past him towards the door and he didn t wake up we got inside woke amy and told her what had happened with nowhere else to go we resolved to lock the door not leave the room and then at the crack of dawn we would be out of here and back to the bus station for the first bus out of town and that s what we did now this could easily have been nothing maybe our minds played tricks on us on those alleys maybe we were only a few yards away from the front door when we decided to bolt and the hooded man was just trying to help us get back still that night has stayed with me ever since and if i had to guess we narrowly avoided getting robbed of our camera gear at least
my own father normally a nice guy melts under pressure and stress he has a history of refusing help for anger issues and other mental issues after months of other problems i d exceed the character count to recount it he was incredibly stressed at work one day i worked for him in his shop with other guys he was slamming things yelling and threatening suicide one of the other guys had his brother commit suicide so he was sensitive to that stuff and really didn t like it when my dad got this way that day he quit on the spot this wasn t the first time he d dealt with my dad like this but it was one of the last the other guy left too after getting fed up with it it was just me and my dad who was now even more stressed by them leaving we sat there for a couple hours as he kept talking about the same things that were stressing him out over and over he kept threatening suicide i just wanted him to shut up pull his year old self together and realize what he s doing to others being this way nothing i said mattered he just deflected everything i d never been more dejected sad and angry all at once he wouldn t leave until some scheduled customers came and i wasn t going to leave until he did because i was planning to call the cops and needed to know where he was and didn t want him suspecting anything finally the customers came my dad told them the business wouldn t be around long because he was going to kill himself i d stopped caring hours ago i was ready to stop hearing his voice they left and he asked if i wanted to get dinner i said no because i had to work another job i immediately drove to the police station and told them he was planning to kill himself i gave them everything they needed to find him apparently he planned to take me to dinner and say everything was fine they picked him up and took him practically kicking and screaming to the hospital he was irate and was threatening everyone like a cornered animal my aunt texted me that night at work and told me how he was acting how he was mad at me and hated being there my response was good i watched my own father act like my life and his life didn t matter he acted as if nothing i did or said had meaning then he thought he could say everything was okay no one in his life had ever been able to get through his thick skull about how his actions affected others he got me to the point where i no longer cared if he hated me i gladly had him tossed in the hospital either he d learn his lesson real fast from the only one he seemed to care about me or he d get to stay miserable in a crazy house forever after a few days he got it together had an epiphany and has been doing better ever since i no longer look up to him it was also part of what made me move halfway across the country after college i was and a junior when this happened it might not be the most bone chilling or creepy experience like other comments have but its the only one that s stuck with me
in early i was working an evening shift alone in a convenience store paul hill came into the store hill was one of the clinic protestors in town he kept to himself carrying big apocalyptic signs and walking back and forth i volunteered at the clinics to keep those weasels from harassing patients and staff so i didn t really see a difference between him and the rest but i d heard chatter that the other protesters were afraid of him understandable here he is in my store at the counter quietly pleasant as he pays for his items and all the while i m freezing i ve rarely had someone scare me but this fucker set off all those little inner alarms he had that preacher look the haircut the boyish face but over feet tall about a head taller than me it was a relief when he left like i could breathe again i don t know if he was actually just a customer or if he was scoping me out i d had some of them roll past my house had my car vandalized those didn t scare me and i doubt he had anything to do with it several months passed on july paul hill ambushed and murdered my friend jim barrett and dr john britton in the driveway of one of the clinics blasted each of them with a shotgun
had an armed robbery during a party at our home when i was seven armed men came in threatened and controlled the crowd of of us i remember very clearly that my mother was calling from the other side of the house asking for me i was the youngest there by far we were all on the floor trying to communicate to my parents that i was alright but struggled to i heard a slight commotion from the kitchen followed by the most sickening crunching sound i ve ever heard in my life which i later found out was my fathers nose breaking on the hilt of a gun when he was trying to get to me this lasted for hours while they took our belongings one of the armed men allowed me to crawl to meet my mother while being shouted at with don t fucking look at my face repeatedly they asked my father to show them the safe which we didn t have but repeatedly until they threatened to start shooting second only to the crunching sound earlier that night was the gut wrenching sound of a weapon being cocked i instinctively looked up for a brief moment at the man who did there was not a single spark of empathy in his eyes thankfully our compliance led to them locking us in a room while they made off with a vehicle and all our belongings
my bar got robbed dudes told us everyone down we complied obviously i wasn t even a little scared i was down but had my head up watching everything with fascination it was sort of exciting then one of the robbers made eye contact with me and just stopped what he was doing and stared at me i took my cue and buried my head in my arms everything was so quiet then i heard his slow steps on the wood floor come right up to me and while looking down i saw his feet on each side of my head standing right over me all i could think is that this fuckers going to shoot me in the back of the head it sucked so bad i don t know how long he stood there prolly only ten seconds but it felt like mins shiver regardless of the cringe posts i make believe it or not he didn t shoot me

getting mugged in new york city on my way to a show people stopped to watch and clapped when some homeless guys ran off the mugger then a couple people asked where we were performing they might buy tickets it was very unsettling to me that the crowd immediately assumed this was a performance art piece like the dude has a knife he was threatening me the guys laying on the ground by the garbage recognized there was a problem everyone else was politely watching the show

i ve had many but the one that jumped into my mind here was when i was years old i attended my cousin s birthday party at my aunt and uncles house now i was a child who grew up abused and a sa survivor i was still in a cycle then of falling into traps with men who wanted sexual things from me because it s all i d known my abuser was a family friend even so this situation stood out as creepy to me and luckily i did what was right in the end to help protect myself my cousin has an ex he was a stranger to me but they were still friends after they split and he was at said party i was dressed up i ll admit i dressed provocatively in my teens as my abuse left me hypersexual for a long time until i addressed it in therapy i definitely would have looked older than i was my cousin s ex let s call him jake 20m approached me at the party and asked me if i wanted an alcoholic drink i was honest and said i was and wouldn t be drinking he was visibly surprised by my age and apologised and said i looked older i thought that would be the end of it the next day he messaged me on facebook asking if i was the girl at the party i let myself begin to be pulled in i replied and confirmed i was jake started to flirt with me calling me beautiful asking lots about me telling me lots about him he spoke to me every day for hours even into the night after a week he told me he was falling in love with me he knew which school i attended as he lived nearby he would drive up to the back gate i would walk home through and talk to me through his car window offering me rides home i declined he was still there everyday to talk he started messaging me asking me to wait for him when i was we could be together we would have our own home together he said he wanted to hold my hand as i had his babies how wonderful our sex would be when i was willing to let that happen between us that we didn t have to wait but he would for me that we could get married when i was but that he would love for me to carry and birth our first child when i was that he would support me through my blood tests as he knew i was afraid of needles how he couldn t wait to watch me grow our children how we could be engaged from the age we were then and then have our baby when i was and marry at and he would take care of me i was beginning to feel smothered pressured anxious i didn t want to leave the school at home time so i d walk a different way or ask my dad to pick me up i finally gained the confidence to show my cousin the messages my cousin is like a sister and is fiercely protective of me when i showed her the messages someone her age who she had been with herself was sending her underage cousin she went ape she told him never to contact me again or she would report him and she advised me to block him and tell my parents so i could get lifts home for a while in case he tried to get me from the school my parents were great after a couple of months getting lifts i started walking home again and he would still pull up sometimes and watch me i always walked with friends then who i had confided in they were great also
i was at a bar with my now ex boyfriend but this was before we dated i was in college and visiting home and we met in high school we just wanted to catch up we re trying to figure out what food we want from the kitchen and were going over drinks when this guy just comes around me like stays around me he was probably in his 50s or 60s a white male he kept trying to get closer and closer to me so eventually i went from having my body turned towards my ex to turning where i m facing the bar in my seat this guy decided he was going to go from my left side to my right side and stand right next me like i could feel his coat touching me i tried to ignore it since it was kind of normal in college town bars but i was still uneasy my ex was oblivious to what was going on but i guess the bartender noticed she went in back because she said she had to do something she comes back out and eventually i notice this other guy appeared and was talking to other people in the establishment i m trying to look over the menu when i suddenly feel a hand grabbing my inner thigh and it s this guy who was standing next to me i politely removed his hand he put it back i removed it again and when he went to put it back this guy that just randomly appeared and was talking to other people runs over and pulls the guy off the group of men pushed the guy out of the bar the guy who saved me was the owner of the place and the bartender went in back to tell him what was going on was a nerve wracking night but i got free shots out of it

does walking in on a guy who d shot himself in the head count he was a day or two dead there was no interaction so not sure definitely unsettling though
a couple of weeks ago i was walking on a park trail with my wife and it was nice cold but nice eventually we come upon an older lady with a dog on a leash no problem it s nice to see someone following the leash rules the dog gets excited so we try to get as far from it as possible to pass it s a fairly wide trail but it turns out the lady cannot control her dog to set the picture she was five nothing and the dog was seriously the biggest rottweiler i d ever seen like it was a mini tank and she could not keep it from getting closer to us she s yelling up a storm and it isn t until we re just about to get by her when she makes it clear she isn t yelling at the dog but at us damn it you assholes stop ok weird so we stop and she continues hurling invectives at us like we re the problem that is was our fault she could not keep her dog from pulling her along and she had a full right to the trail after a couple minutes of this we had to turn around because it was clear she was right and we were wrong heavy sarcasm and she wasn t going to do anything other than curse and yell to be fair to this story i was also cursing at her because she s a dumb fucking bitch who shouldn t be allowed out into the world but she had the power in the conversation all she had to do was let go and it would have been over it ruined a fairly nice morning until we could get over the fear and start making fun of her
i was almost kidnapped when i was three that was pretty unsettling
i was almost kidnapped at 12yrs old a friend and i were walking from a fast food place around 30ish am i noticed a suspicious man standing not in or around a car at the atm next door he started following us we noticed him he noticed us noticing him he started running at us we ran to the business buildings down where my mother was my friend went in first i was behind her and he almost grabbed me inches away it took all of us to hold the door so we could dead bolt it i spent years with what i now know was ptsd constantly looking over my shoulder paralyzing panic attacks for example when a man walked down the same grocery aisle my heart would race vision blurred and goosebumps that was a long time ago and think about it all the time
went a guy from a dating app who tried to take my life
i was working in a corner store and a gal i was dating and the guy she was doing behind my back i later learned both came running in out of breath and asked for a place to hide because they said someone had pretended to be a police officer pulled them over and had a rope and some kind of object in his hands and was chasing after them i told them to hide in the back behind the coolers and the guy came running in after them about seconds later basically hunting them i called the cops but they took their sweet time the guy was long gone
one time as an aesthetician i was waxing a guys back and he started asking me all these really weird questions sort of seemingly innocent like what area of town i lived in stuff like that but also could be misconstrued i started answering them being friendly and what not he started diving deeper asking about how many girls worked here what time we left work how many hours we worked etc again could be totally innocent as he was checking out i remember looking into his eyes and getting this really really unsettling feeling i couldn t shake it all day and when i left that night i made sure that i didn t walk out by myself as i walked to my car i had this creepy feeling that he was in the parking lot i still swear to this day that he was out there waiting for me and if i hadn t had someone else walk out with me that i would ve been abducted
i wasn t directly involved but learning that i had a stalker living in the same building as me and waiting in front of my door nearly every night for months wasn t nearly as scary as learning that he told the guys escorting him out yeah i wait outside her door at night to see if she ll come out sometimes we lived in studio apartments and mine was on the top floor in the back corner there weren t any cameras in the hallway he always stood in a spot where he could have easily shoved me back inside and let himself in if i had ever opened that door i never knew he was there but i knew the building was haunted so i always thought the boots i could see through the crack under the door were just ghost boots
being choked in a non sexual way
i was about and a friend and i were home alone i lived out in the country at the time anyways we were in my backyard sitting on the swingset and i saw someone riding a bike up our lane our lane was pretty long so usually only people who were visiting would come all the way down it anyways i figured it was my sister and she had gotten home from school so we just kept playing that night my dad had asked if we had gotten into his safe i thought weird question but no i didn t even know where it was few days later he s sitting in his chair by the bay window and sees someone riding their bike up our lane he leans back and evidently spooked whoever it was he followed whoever it was home turns out he had been the one riding down my lane earlier that week he had taken money out of my dad s safe then rode back home my dad followed him and he lived with his brother and his wife his brother said he was handicap dad told him the next time he came on our property he wouldn t leave alive that was a pretty freaky experience
this one girl i met on tinder on a work trip she was off like the entire time she was distracted about of what i said landed and got some kind of reciprocal response from her we ended up in my hotel room but her mind was still somewhere else right up until she left and i think that s what spooked me there was zero chemistry or banter like she got with me to get revenge on her boyfriend or something i blocked her number after that
when i way female some old man approached me in the mall when i was with my friend eating i am not ugly so i usually do get lots of compliments from boys but i just brushed it off this old man kept on going and i can tell my friends start to feel uncomfortable i asked him to go but then he proceeded to tell me that he runs a modeling agency he asked me to be one of the models for his upcoming shoot and i said i am not willing to do that he then proceeded to tell me that not to worry it s not lingerie or bikinis or anything sexual at this point me and my friend got up and started to walk away when he came up to us again he proceeded to tell my friend you look unique and different and you can also model with her my friend was so pissed i told him i was not interested again but he kept on pushing it my friend usually wears chains on her clothes he proceeded to touch them and like play with them we started to move towards the exit which did not work this man still followed me and proceeded to give me a card for his so called agency we still talk about to this day and laughed about it but it was really uncomfortable and unsettling in the moment
worked in a fast food restaurant where it was implied that we should be very friendly and open to conversation with customers on this particular day i was probably newly at the time it was my job to clean the restrooms we had a regular who came in and talked to us about his issues and life and such i should also mention that this occurred a couple of months after the covid vaccine became widely available for anyone who wanted to get it anyways he stopped to talk to me while i was standing in between the two restrooms in a tucked away part of the store yes my coworkers could see me but they didn t do anything he started a convo and we got onto the topic of the covid vaccine because i had lived in texas he was looking to move his family there and was asking about the schools i told him that my mom had just gotten her covid shot because she was flying out to texas and the conversation got dark really fast he essentially told me that all of his close friends suffered serious cardiac arrests and strokes from the vaccine and told me to be prepared for my mom to drop at any second and to make sure i knew her death intentions like a will and stuff he also asked me if she knew about the possibility of dying for the vaccine he also asked for my number and email to ask more questions about texas and schooling which i lied my way out of in hindsight i m sure he meant well but i was backed into a corner and it was somewhat dark so i was very shaken because i love my family a lot and covid was already scary enough
i met this dude at a gas station and he ended up jumping me and taking my car so probably that
spent five hours on a bus sitting next to a guy who d noped out of a suicide pact back in high school while the other kid went through with it the guy later tried to suicide by cop by threatening the school secretary with a steak knife
this wasn t my experience but a distant cousin of mine she was riding home from school on the bus after hanging out with some friends so it was later than usual and she was one of few passengers remaining there was a couple of guys a couple of rows in front of her and she happened to notice they were whispering to eachother about her they said something along the lines of what about her and one jerked their head in her direction the other smirked and nodded freaked out my cousin quickly texted her mother to meet her off the bus as she was only ten minutes from home at this point lucky for my cousin her mother by lucky coincidence was at the corner shop which was right by the bus stop my cousin got off so was already waiting when my cousin got off the bus the two guys got up to follow my cousin out but when they saw her run to her mother they quickly sat down again as the bus pulled away
when i was and my bro was we were in a park and some 18yr old kid came up on a bike and stopped us he picked us up by our necks and threatened us he let us go and rode away was traumatized
i was standing in line at the grocery store when some creep behind me started touching my thighs i yelled at him to back off but he just smiled oddly he continued to touch me until a woman asked to switch spots with me she even walked me to my car when that dude tried to follow me
i lived with my ex partner in a third floor apartment with a business on the bottom the second floor was the groundskeeper s apartment he was scary af and also mentally unwell and the landlord manipulated him because of this he took a dislike to us because we were too loud literally just walking and any loud noise tripped him off he would scream threats hit the ceiling with a broom or put his shoes in the dryer so you would hear a thunderous racket one night he went into the unfinished attic apartment above ours and stayed there for a few hours he turned on an old television or radio up there turned it loud and stalked around making sure we hear him there were no lights up there so he was sitting up there in the dark for hours the most terrifying encounter happened in the middle of the night the main stairwell to the front door had an automatic light that went on we woke up at maybe 3am and the light was on streaming under our door we could see him standing there just outside our door staring at it because his shadow was visible stretched across the floor and under the door and he just stood there we eventually broke the lease and left the scariest part for me was that he may have had keys to our apartment being the groundskeeper so when i would be home alone i never knew if he would just break in
dude sitting at a table of women that i assume were his friends was boasting about getting head from highschool girls it seemed to offend me more than the women which kind of bothered me
my most unsettling encounter would definitely be with my cousin him and i hadn t really know each other growing up as we lived far away from one another so we weren t very close i had only one prior meeting with him before the incident when i was a very young child anyway our entire family was going to my other cousins wedding she lived near us and i was going to be a bridesmaid this is relevant so wedding day comes and everything is going great we are all at the reception and it s nearing 10pm everyone is wasted i ll call my cousin e e and i had exchange hellos earlier that night and he seemed nice from our limited interactions so it s later in the night and i am wanting a bit of alone time as i m super drunk and tired in the reception area there were a couple of private rooms off down the hallway where the guests could put their stuff i had my stuff in one of the more empty room as i though these rooms were just for the guests shit i hadn t put much thought into knocking on the door into the room i walked and there in front of me was my cousin decked out in a furry suit being so drunk i couldn t really formulate a sentence i just kind of stood there he was obviously panicked and tried to remove the top part of his fur suit he couldn t get it off but instead had twisted it around in his panic he couldn t see out of the suit anymore and kind of drunkly and blindly ran out of the room in the process knocking me over while he didn t intentionally do it i went straight down whacking my head into a doorknob quite hard i blacked out and when i came to i was in the hospital the whole thing has been weighing on my mind as i can t go over the fact that my cousin a man in a furry costume made me blackout
when i was tied up at gunpoint at work a common south african past time
so i used to work on ambulance and we picked up the person with severe unmedicated schizophrenia they weren t aggressive or anything but t they just stared at the corner of the cab s ceiling the entire ride to the hospital never said a word blinked or moved also the people who knew him said he was unpredictable i don t think i have ever been that high alert my entire life
the guy who tried to get to me while i took a nap at a rest stop thank you knife in my hand and locked doors i had some family health issues and was driving over miles to visit them solo did the true thing as a woman parked under a security cam lights working slept in the middle of the back seat with a knife in my hand and mace on my immediate left i just wanted hours lone man came up and was jiggling for handles and trying to knock out my windows i sat up got in drivers seat showed my knife and mace and drive off fast and furious style stamina got me hours before i stopped shaking and crying continued to drive for another hours said fk this and just made it to the hospital never slept so hard in a chair in my life since
i m a small female human and as sad as it sounds i m so used to attacks and fights that i stay perfectly calm when threatened and skip the first step fear and jump straight to anger that being said i ve written about a few
being approached at the age of m by a local man that was a known gay inviting me into his downtown apartment loft this took place in the early s i was so frightened by the guy i peed my pants he had been charged numerous times for sexually harassing people but to my knowledge nothing ever stuck he died about years ago
most encounters are unsettling
a lady who i rung up at my register once got mad at me for not giving her a free bag and i explained to her we don t provide free bags and she would have to buy a bag she then comes the next day acting very rude towards me and started coming after my race context she asked me about where i was from then she made remarks about her husband being the same race as i and was saying he was better than me saying her family wouldn t like me and i didn t know how to react i wasn t going to lose it but it felt very personal because i was scared she would go after my family and i my thoughts would be like i would lose it but i kept my composure and ignored her she left and yea
walking in a wooded park and there was this guy dressed like dahmer and kinda looked like him too glasses and all he walked out of the thick part of the woods like not on the path i was walking a dog at the time who usually loved people and she just had this really lowww growl towards him and he kinda glanced at us and kept walking back through the thick wooded part i m used to seeing people in that park even the creepier ones and i ve never felt soooo uneasy i haven t gone back
nervous guy with a gun to my head
when i was around i used to hit the gym almost every day one day this guy comes up to me and says he bought a cool vette i pretend to be interested with oh wow that s really cool but just being polite not that i really cared i make it a point after that to ignore him but he s obviously following me around the gym we should hang out you go to the game i got tickets i could do with a beer then it gets weird with him telling me he s a nice guy got money etc i tell him dude back the f ck off he did but man that creeped me out
a guy approached my front door with a bat he said i had been sleeping with his wife and his sister and that he was going to beat me till my semen ran red i reached over and grabbed my rifled musket fully loaded with black powder but no ball what is your sister s name so that i might tell her you died trying to kill the wrong guy i yelled this made him slow down enough that i pulled the trigger the discharge made him duck and drop the bat as he backed away stunned i put on the bayonet in full view and with out looking hoping just by watching he was dealing with someone who knew how to use it he tripped on the curb and fell on his ass so i stood over him with rifle pointed at him praying he didn t realize i had fired my only shot then my vietnam vet neighbor approached from behind and pinned him until police arrived thinking back i was probably the most unsettling encounter he ever had
your mom she raised you
once me and my friend was crossing an mud way crossing that needed balance so one of uncle came there and said see me how i cross you should not cross the way like you did now and he begins to cross and he fell while crossing that moment for me and my buddy was funny but we controlled it for the honour of uncle and we hold it till uncle went from there then we were like oh shit that was some amazing accident bro we laughed like insane that day and we still do
i was about nor i had a very shit week so i got drunk it was fucking stupid now i grew up with all men my dad lil bro and my grandfather because my mom and dad got divorced at my dad at my mom so yea now my friend called me and told me that someone is trying to stalk her is outside of her house with a knife now i got fucking pissed we have guns so i took i pistol and my motorcycle and drove to her place and guess what i saw a man with a knife outside her door banging on it i yelled at him word to word this if you don t fucking stop you fucking psycho i will kill you he turned to me and smiled and said i was pretty that was it for me i took the gun out of my jacket pointed it at him and yelled him to go to hell never come back or dare to speak or come under my eye or my friends or i will kill him loaded it and shot to the sky he ran a away never seen or heard about him we never ever spoke about it to anyone well because i had a gun and i was drunk af
things i learned in a left wing college gen z would rather see humanity go extinct than see us spread to other planets throughout the galaxy because of how things are going on earth maybe my class of ish isn t a big enough sample but literally people agreed the insanely cringe american leftists posted to subs like cringetopia anarchy that people try to claim were strawman were in fact not strawman it really is that bad and i say this as a millenial
it was with a child i was ish they were hey sorrel frosting child hey how are you me okay but the grey masked man with the black hat keeps bothering me child we hadn t left the house in days
when i was about years old i was walking home from school about half a mile i was wearing my favorite jacket that had a nice thick hood on it sometimes that hood made it difficult to hear but i didn t care i rounded the corner to my street and saw a man in a blue denim jacket and denim blue jeans he had a white volkswagen beetle and he was standing behind the open passenger door he said something too quietly for me to hear but i thought i heard my car at the end of the sentence something inside me created a spark of adrenaline and i bolted as fast as my little legs could push running through the open apartment courtyard and into my unit my mum was there and i told her immediately she went out to where i told her the creep was parked but he and his car were gone she called the police and an officer came to get my description of the man and his car to this day i have no idea what caused me to know i was in danger i never learned if the man was caught but i told other kids at my school what to watch out for
any time i was in the same room as my mum when she was in one of her moods lol
i was swimmig in a creek by myself a fat man with some kfc came and started swimming with me and gave me chicken then i left
i was in brooklyn and this dude came out of the store after he had robbed it and was like what s up bro casually walking with a bag in one hand and a gun in the other
a man approached me and my friend with the opening line of you two look like you re straight out of high school and he then proceeded to ramble about god i still find that so ironic i was uncomfortable from the moment he approached us i just stared him in the eyes and said that s great but we have somewhere to be now my friend said i don t believe in god to which he replied well god believes in you then looked at me and said well you have somewhere to be so i won t keep you this was in a very public space which made it slightly more awkward but also less anxiety inducing i m just glad the encounter was over quickly
the guy who started sniffing raw coacoa powder i worked in nature s market for a few years at my old job and we sold powders by the pound stuff like spirulina matcha and coacoa apparently teenagers were sniffing raw coacoa because it made them high or at least they thought it did so this guy asks me about how to buy it i show him he puts some in a bag then as i m about to weigh price it for him pours some on the counter and starts sniffing it while i was mid sentence i was floored he starts telling me how it s like cocaine and shit i immediately get my coworker who called the store manager and we waited manager kicks him out and bans him from the store
i was like on my way back from a store i stopped by the local stadium to watch the high school band practice from outside the fence some dude probably in his 40s wearing nothing but socks and a pair of gym shorts walks up to me and tries to make conversation about how his wife left him and how he thought he might be gay i placated his conversation for a minute before i was straight up like i gotta go that was fucking weird i didn t get like any hostile vibes off him just sad vibes like the guy was really just so down in the dumps but it was just too strange for me
unsettling doesn t necessarily mean bad right just kinda left you wondering like wtf x200b cuz if so then my friend s last words to me a few hours before he died he sent me a message on aim asking what would you say if god came to you and told you that you were going to die tonight he died that night in his sleep septic shock
like a couple weeks ago i went to a mcdonald s and there were these old people sitting next to met and they tried to start a conversation with me while i was alone you can argue that they were probably just tryna be friendly but oh no they had the characteristics of a you know what if characteristics of that even exists luckily i m not kidnapped and just gonna let you know that some people are going to be kind of shady and what you will not expect do not be like me always stay with an adult
when i was in grade i had this really creepy gym teacher who would wait outside the girls change room every class and listen to our conversations and say shit like come on now girls we don t have all day let s go ladies and shit like that one day we were all sitting on the gym benches filling out a progress report and he came over and gripped both of my shoulders really tight and leaned over and started whispering in my ear is everything okay over here i ve never been so creeped out
i was running a crew that was painting this couples house i was a yo woman they had their daughter her husband and their babies living with them the owner was a retired hospital chaplin and from day one he gave me the creeps he looks like a gnome and always had this very false smile that didn t go to his eyes he would say something cutting but in a super chill voice with that creepy smile one day i was chatting with him in the driveway and their pitbull came out barking and raced over to say hi i love dogs so i always try to say hi and get some good pets in this dog almost immediately sat on my foot and put herself between me and her owner with her back facing me he laughed and said she was protecting him but she absolutely was protecting me anytime i moved she moved too sitting on my boot and staring at him what goes on in that house that this dog feels like she needs to protect a stranger from her owner
this right here is why i m not gonna take my kids to sit in these peoples laps easter bunny santa nobody

the fear i was homeless for about days when my mom kicked me out of the house at i m a 120lb woman and i was terrified of being sex trafficked
lack of stability safety and basic necessities it s a struggle to survive every day
the constant anxiety how long can i stay here before they throw me out is that person going to steal my stuff how long can i sleep here before someone makes me move where can i find something to eat just never feeling safe
how it s a vicious cycle it s hard to do things like getting a job or a bank account without an address
a lot of people who ve experienced it seem to say that it s people actively looking through them or ignoring them you know treating them like they don t exist
people bothering me while i m trying to sleep
for me it was the rain storms and having to sleep on top of the only belongings i had so nobody stole them
for one thing if you live in a shelter no privacy its sometimes people to a room same with the toilets showers you get one hot meal and that dinner breakfast lunch your on your own drug dealers often operate in the shelter and be very careful when it comes to money if someone thinks you have a dollar they will beat the shit out of you to get it if your homeless probably the best place to live is like what you see in california in a warm state in a tent at least you have privacy
most places aren t set up for homeless populations some places like here in murfreesboro tn it s even illegal to camp like anywhere so if you re not one of the very many mentally ill maybe you had a run of super bad luck or a car accident that ruined it all and you re trying to rebuild your life it s so so difficult best case scenario still super difficult and if you are one of the mentally ill or disenfranchised in some way it s nearly impossible to rebuild without organizational assistance most in this position don t know they need assistance or where to get it unless they have a friend or family member help them or they live somewhere with an outreach group to find them and initiate help here where i live we have two houses we rent cheaply cause donor that each house five guys trying to get off the streets it s been several years now and we ve seen the difference it makes having all the things needed to rebuild a life job id etc to get that job transport to job food sleep medical clean clothes some things we take for granted are very hard to attain when homeless yet very necessary in rebuilding a life so the answer i d give to op is simply everything
i m currently active duty military and going on years in so i m no longer homeless there was a month timeframe prior to me leaving for basic training where i was homeless after i graduated high school my dad whom i was living with up until i graduated high school decided he was going to move to a different state for a better job opportunity right before he moved i was able to room up in a house with two of my friends about two months into living in that house my two friends lost their jobs and there was no possible way i would have been able to pay the rent on my own as i only made an hour at the time i ended up packing up what belongings i could fit into the raggedy dodge grand caravan i paid for and had to live in my car for a little over three months the worst part about being homeless is finding a place where you feel comfortable enough to fall asleep i didn t feel comfortable sleeping in rest stops and parking lots because i feared that somebody would break into my car when i was sleeping and try to rob me or harm me eventually my boss at the time pulled me aside and asked me why i looked like s lately and i swallowed my pride and told him that i m living in my car and it s hard for me to fall asleep in public places out of fear of being robbed or harmed he felt very bad for me and added me to his gym membership plan so i had a consistent place to take a shower and workout if i wanted to and allowed me to park my car in a secure place on my jobs property he told me i wish i could do more for you but i m strapped for money and this is all i can do but words couldn t express how grateful i was at the time i could finally get a good nights rest and have a consistent place to shower eventually i sold that dodge caravan for left for basic training and never looked back after i graduated boot camp i went back home on leave and gave my old boss i know isn t a crazy amount of money but i wanted to show him how much i appreciated his help in my time of need fast forward to the present day and i m doing well i have years in the service an amazing wife amazing daughters a retirement plan a nice car and a beautiful apartment in the nice part of town some of you may question why my father didn t help me and the truth is i never told him i was living out of my car he just moved to a completely different state where he knew nobody for a new job i didn t want to put anymore stress on him so as far as he knew i was still living in that house that my friends rented out up until i left for basic training a few years later i ended up telling him about the experience and he was a little upset with me for not telling him he said he would have taken a loan out and gave me the money to pay the rent in that house up until i left but as i said i didn t want to put anymore stress on him
homelessness is often associated with social stigma and discrimination which can lead to isolation exclusion and mistreatment from others in society this can have a profound impact on a person s self esteem mental health and overall well being
i would guess people dismissing and looking down on you would be up there
i once read an article and a man said when he was homeless he didn t hear anyone say his name for months sticks with me still
probably the lack of having a home but seriously shelter is hugely taken for granted obviously worry about starving drinking but here america that is incredibly rare people don t starve to death a whole lot or die from lack of water here even if homeless but not having a permanent place to dwell has got to be absolutely terrible
not having a home and everything that comes with that
too much fresh air
prob weather
it s illegal to camp anywhere really hard to rebuild your life mental illness is rife there isn t a lot of support financial aid for insecure housing domestic violence etc it can stem from domestic violence mental illness poverty of money management r ship skills life skills etc i feel like there s a huge imbalance of power almost gatekeeping regarding people who have money life skills good r ship social skills versus people who are left completely destitute on numerous levels as a consequence of circumstances that are out of their control
getting robbed you go to sleep and wake up with all your stuff gone or they just do it in front of you there s nothing you can do about it there s gangs patroling the homeless population basically
the winter if you were homeless and had no warmth the winter wouldn t take long to beat you down and give you hypothermia and believe me nobody wants that
fear and loneliness
not knowing where you are going to sleep for the night and not knowing what you are waking up to
really how about being homeless
not being able to shower after work
the winter
loneliness the cold not being able to stay clean walking everywhere the heat not getting enough sleep privileged people
i couldn t imagine how terrifying that would be for any woman i hope you re in a better place now
so the current economical climate we re currently living in now most people are about a paycheck away from being out on the streets
even the food bank requires an address here it s hard to imagine how people can get back on their feet
they are homeless not heartless
that s because there s too many occasions when you make eye contact and the homeless guy just asks for money people are trying to avoid that not looking through them or ignoring them because they don t exist
people do that to me now and i m not even homeless so no change then
what did you do during storms is there many places to find shelter
this is similar to my experience and what i was going to say luckily it was only a couple of months and i had a truck to sleep in but finding a place to park and sleep without being harassed or run off or feeling like something bad is going to happen i can t tell you how many times i would get run off by the cops for sleeping in a parking lot
ya but people in cities just ignore each other compared to suburban or rural areas if you smile and nod at everyone in a city there s a good chance you ll get mugged at some point if you smile and nod at every homeless person there s a good chance you ll get accosted at some point i know this because i enjoy smiling and nodding at people and i ve been accosted and almost mugged thank you rollerblades
oh for sure i have to deal with that on a regular basis because i live in a big city i d imagine it s still dehumanizing though
sometimes the people working in stores or gas stations wouldn t run me off from their store fronts and some church buildings have porches that i could sit on as long as nobody damaged anything if a hurricane or tropical storm the shelter would send buses out to look for homeless that wanted to go to the shelter eta most shelters only have so many open beds and if your not on a list you dont get one but they open the building for storms
yea this was without a doubt the worst part having to sleep with one eye open will ware you the f down everything else was somewhat manageable i washed my clothes at the laundromat kept water deli meats and bread in a cooler and showered in one of the bathrooms at some random apartment complex pool area i pray everyday that i never have to live that experience again and i certainly hope you never have to do it again either

listen to tubthumping
keep on keeping on and then keep on some more
lately i ve found that reading stoic philosophy has helped my mindset a lot especially marcus aurelius meditations hearing that another man at the height of power and wealth still questioned himself and persevered makes me feel as if i m in the company of great people i listen to music that s comforting or energizing depending on the mood i eat my favorite foods especially food that reminds me of family and childhood i work out excessively when i m facing adversity it allows me to focus my stress and frustration into a positive outlet most importantly i speak about how i feel whether that be indifferent frustrated or sad to my friends and family these are the strategies i have that help me pick myself up by my bootstraps and try again
watch groundhog day and realize it took about times of failures before bill murray got the girl
i pick up my cat cuddle him and remember that little sugar baby asshole needs me to keep him in cat nip and wet food then brush my hair and get back up to make the day awesome
put the drugs down again and go to a meeting and try to treat myself like i d treat my best friend
i don t i just lay there and take it life is meaningless we all die eventually and the world and the people in it don t care about your or your outcome if you died tomorrow you may be missed but everyone will move on because they have to this may sound bleak but it s what keeps me going i share the same indifference and apathy towards life and the world that it has towards me as an individual so i don t pick myself back up like some fantasy hero i just go to bed wake up the next day and carry on as if nothing happened
i m going to mangle this saying but it goes something like the master has failed more times than you have even attempted i e failure is part of the process that leads to success
just because yesterday didn t go well doesn t mean today has to be the same i have not failed i ve just found ways that won t work thomas a edison
realize that you are on a path that is your own you are the author of your story do you want it to end in failure or do you want it to be a story of hardship that ends in success we all write our own story how it ends is completely up to you
i get knocked down but i get up again
life has its many ups and downs and will never be a smooth ride despite my recent struggles i know that i have to get up at 6am and get into a cold shower and get ready for work and get on with the day no two ways about it i can moan and complain but that doesn t change the fact that i am the sole provider for my family and if i gave up they would suffer nothing to it but to just do it
for the longest time in life i ve always thought and for some reason tried to convince myself that i m not an underdog i guess bc it s easier to give up and say i m not built for this but last few years i ve looked back at all the time i was knocked down and couldn t see a way for getting up yet i still fought for some reason and never even thought about it i didn t even have it in my mind that i m gonna fight my way back up i just did it because it felt natural to me and even in my weakest moments i still felt that last bit of strength i had in me was not only enough to get me back up but get me back up stronger so i suggest everyone to do the same and try to look back for a second at all the times you ve built yourself up don t look for motivation bc it fades quickly just look at why and how you got up in the first place and repeat the same pattern and you re guaranteed that you ll pick up the pace and get to a point higher than you ve ever been without thinking all it takes is a few thoughts to bring you down so don t even stress about it just trust the process
when things become too much i do the same every sensible person does get insanely drunk and cry a lot second thing that helps is excessive sport it really shut s up your mind
i find it helpful to stop looking at failure as a shortcoming and start looking at it as a sign of participating befriend failure unshame it expect and welcome it gonna use skateboarding here as as the metaphor for some reason but i find it encouraging af to watch skating legends teach themselves new tricks by literally repeatedly failing and falling over and over and over for days that s the point failing as growth
realize that while i can t possibly fix yesterday i can most certainly affect today and tomorrow wallowing in guilt not only hurts you but everyone you touch it s selfish really move on be better if not for you for them
i ve been looking at life as an experience collector for many many years basically gotta catch em all i ve had a collection of once in a lifetime awful things roommate robbed a bank gang rape thoracic outlet syndrome ex had a brain tumor held hostage by a traumatized client star prosecution witness against my former gynecologist ex secretly ran up 25k in joint debt in 6mo so bankruptcy to name a few as well as wildly exciting things danced in a halftime show threesomes lived on gtmo bay designed and managed the gc of my own house quadrupled my income in only years currently enjoying multiple one on one sessions with a real big name marketing consultant at the expense of my employer etc etc but i ve come to not categorize them or the next surprises as wonderful or awful they re just experiences i have a pretty long list of experiences and i d estimate my life is only half over failures are just experiences to add to the book about your life they aren t good or bad at the end of the day just experiences there will be more of them
write your failure on a piece of paper and throw it in the trash now it s gone
learn live adapt survive get a cat
think about what has happened carefully what was beyond your control what could you have done differently learn from it what you can then move on i know it s clich but i ve had a fair few moments like this and it might take a bit of time but you can come out in a better place
i just started a blog today gregfratto com greg life traveler it should post in day or two i m a yr old ex drug addic was homeless lost an eye to drug use etc etc managed to pick myself up time after time and i will have alot of encouraging things to say and some really cool stories to tell about my journey through this thing called life i just wanted to do this and show others they aren t alone and even though things are bad now it gets better spoiler alert i just sold everything i had to open a business in thailand a year ago and was just forced out of my own company no where to go but up
you just move forward debating whether to do so will just paralyze you with fear in some ways having failed is freeing you know you ve survived it before you ve acquired more resilience than people who ve never had to deal with failure depending on whether you ve reflected in the situation you might be better prepared for your next moves reflect on what went wrong did you make mistakes and or were there circumstances beyond your control carry those lessons with you it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose that is not a weakness that is life
well i don t know about these other people but i ve found it s easiest to just give up and let things happen life is just gonna get worse so let s just go with the flow ya know
i ve learnt through numerous failures that the best way to overcome it is to know what i was trying to achieve and put the failure down to learning and look at it objectively ask myself what i ve learnt out of it what s changed about me for the better because of it if i had the chance would i do it all the same or what would i correct and how i m going to approach things next time
learn from it and continue living nothing will change even if you think about it it will just stressed you out just learn from it and laugh because you overcome it
if someone out there has a actual good answer to this question please let me know i m very self deprecating i have nonexistent self esteem and i constantly feel like a complete failure in life i d love to know some real advice if any one has some for this question
i keep saying to myself that no one is coming to save me
i live in perpetual depression i fail at basically everything i put my mind and effort into
embrace them as learning opportunities and use them to overcome your next endeavor
look in the mirror and figure i m dam good looking though
greed
grab onto the hands of the people who love you so they can help pull you back up
remember that failure is a learning experience you can t get better at something if you always succeed failure is the door to improvement
make better choices
if you can t learn from your mistakes your bound to repeat them learn today to change be better tommrow
pause reassess remember you re not a total loser and keep going is there any other option
you either get up or stay down
one thing that s helped me is to try and focus on the lessons i ve learned from each failure
my inability to end my life results it proceeding to happen whether i want it or not
grey goose and strippers
find something new to fail thats the best way to learn
this is a life that makes a person push through or be subsumed by the waves of defeat it is said that in order for a person to be good at something one must persist and learn from their mistakes eventually getting to a place of competence put 10k hours in and you have achieved a level of mastery so when you fail or fall short of competence breath deep and understand it s part of the process of life failure is a lesson in success eventually you will find the path easier in its bends and twists
you keep on truckin and adapt
accept learn if possible move on
try to see your wins it at least helps to get that initial boost and remind yourself you are human we have infinite potential and we are made to fall and get up keep trying and searching for new paths that may lead to less failure or suffering find out small things you want to seek also listen to some dope songs just don t give up
meditation
remind myself that i m alive i m healthy and i m smart so i have these things going for me i m already lucky to have that and with those points i can overcome it
i think that there are people far more unlucky than me that are way happier in amy case so there s no point to feel that bad at all
you look up from the hole you re in and start climbing again it s the journey that develops character after all
i m addicted to retry until success
struggle forward there is no other way
for me i have to stop everything i have to take some time to clear my mind and take account of things failure happens and it is not always necessary to get right back up
like joe dirt says just gotta keep on keeping on
i adopted a philosophy years ago that failures are necessary for happiness if all you have is success you become used to it and the joy goes away failure makes you appreciate success while you also learn and grow
once down twice up thats the way i like think
here is a neat mental flex for you you haven t had failures in the past the past doesn t exist there is only now this precise moment in time is there anything unendurable about it are you unable to breathe is your body on fire are you by any chance being torn apart by wolves no you are not there is nothing unbearable about this exact moment right now this very second the past only has one use to you to provide some guidance on how to approach the future the future can be promising if you can extract some practical lessons from the past and that s all you extract don t worry about attaching emotion to those lessons you study your own past as though it were lived by a different person because it indeed was your former self that guy had successes and failures but that guy is dead it s only the present moment guy that actually matters because he s the only one that can actually get stuff done
watch true crime at least someone didn t murder me
i just feel suicidal until i succeed at something again
just do what interests you i ve been through three career changes i ve got no money but i self sustain get with the right team doing whatever and it will make you ambitious
i take a look at my enormous penis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy3ggkapie)
usually carry on failing
two perspectives winston churchill the secret of success is to move from one failure to the next with no loss of enthusiasm kobe bryant failure doesn t exist to summarise his explanation the only way to truly fail is to learn nothing from the experience otherwise you can figure out what you could have done differently and take that into future experiences a lot of parents set their kids up for a difficult life by praising then only for success in childhood that s the wrong approach because it makes kids feel that success and failure defines their worth when success and failure are not something within an individual s control you can t control whether you succeed you can only control how hard you try which is why a child should be paused for their efforts not their results if my kid slacks off and cruises effortlessly to an a in something they re naturally good at that s not a big deal if my kid works hard and gets a b we re celebrating
take it upon yourself to understand why you failed and plan on doing to better in the future
learn from it take a deep breath and whisper it is what it is lol
it s never a failure only a lesson to learn from
cry a little lean on my support network get it out of my system then start all over
you tell yourself that the failures were great teachers now you know what not to do and what can go wrong treating failures and success as experiences and learning helps a lot
what is failures in life define failures it s just a step shy of success would you prefer a boring mandane life with no ups and down wake up have breakfast go to work have lunch have kopi have dinner go home sleep and repeat would you prefer to play game with infinite money infinite lifes hmmm maybe this might be fun
there s something comforting about everything going to shit because that means that the only way is up unless i die
learn from them and move on most of the best things in my life are the result of me fucking up or going through something terrible and learning from those experiences learning from failure is how you get ahead in life
you just have to do it just do a little bit every day to raise yourself ever so slightly back up rinse and repeat so long as you don t completely give up on yourself you can slowly rise from the ashes of anything once you ve done it before remember it for the next time you fail it s just a learned skill like any other
knowing everything i go through makes me stronger
psychedelic mushrooms to rewire my corrupted neuron pathways
basically on autopilot at this point and i probably don t know what i m doing
just realize where you are and how you can improve even if only a little then keep doing that
always continue to grow and learn as much as you can especially from your failures its not efficient or productive to repeatedly fail and take nothing from it everybody has subjective definitions on what it means succeed find out what that means to you and take satisfaction in your growth and development while on the journey to get there do not be averse to failure and do not fear it everything you ve ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear to attain happiness success is to overcome failure and succeed
heroin
no idea i ve never failed i ve only succeeded or learned
try to take them in stride life is full of failure and it s disapointing and upsetting but at some point i realized that failure is just part of the deal
just move on and keep going
i started running and then got into going to the gym having a very defined target run x distance in y time or lift z weight helped me to break goals into realistic and manageable tasks then i knew i wasn t such a mess that i couldn t take the same principle and fix the mistakes i d been making in small manageable steps plus drinking way less than i used to
just keep going don t let yourself go auto mode forever you will encounter a moment when you can leave it and you damn should
stand up and brush yourself off keep trying to be the best version of yourself don t talk about it be about it
eat my emotions until i hate myself for being fat instead of a loser
man keep going there is ppl doing way worse than you one thing is that you tried so don t beat yourself somethings in life aren t meant to be in our paths but there s always another way to find light keep going be blessed
drugs
recomp change literally everything from what side of the bed you get out on your morning ritual your workflow or even your whole job create dedicated hobbies in the afternoon build a schedule with alotted chunks of fuck it time take back control where you had none before
i you don t fail you re probably not doing anything new the smell of failure is the smell of learning the smell of overcoming and the smell of progress fail with a smile on your face
realize that it happened and move on nothing in specific but i tend to not think of past mistakes or fails cause thinking about them does me no good the more you think something will go wrong the more likely something will go wrong
i only consider whatever it is a failure if i don t learn anything from the experience failure is natural and okay edit lol i guess this is controversial
bro the question is what if you dont rather than wasting life in some shitty way i will rather keep on pushing if i make it i make it and if i dont i will be in better place then not trying the beautiful thing is you can try different thing if you too focus on one thing and not getting success on it then try something which looks kinda same but easier so that you can build up your resume enough to crack the things you need
just grab and go what the fuck else am i gonna do
to be honest just doing nothing just feels like adding extra failure so that is a good driving force always have a small victory in your day before you go to sleep
fall down six times get back up seven failure is part of trying things never stop
cry hysterically
let it sink in completely lose your ego and learn to let go keep going step by step and when you think you cant do it anymore remember where you came from what you can withstand try to be the kind of thing you needed at your lowest the small becon of light in the darkness
decide im not going to turn into those bums that have decided to stop trying
failure is merely an opportunity to learn we all fail everyday in some aspect or another some worse than others but the choice to keep going and try to better ones self from the previous day all you can do i have made many mistakes in my life that others would deem as epic failures i had to learn some hard truths and face some harsh consequences and for a while i blamed everyone but myself then i tried something new i owned my mistakes i learned from them and adjusted my outlook and actions from there i looked into therapy for issues i ve read philosophic principals from different brilliant minds at the end of the day it is all on your outlook and how you handle the issues at hand be proactive and brave and face these issues head on to better yourself to a standard you set one day at a time the time will pass regardless might as well do something with it don t be afraid to reach out for help either it s one of the bravest things you can do i ll root for you and so should everyone else including yourself
i screamed into the void till the echo screamed back only once i threw a ball in anger at the wall only for it to bounce into my face and knock me out that s when i learned only i can fix my life especially the choices i made

the other day i ate two strong edibles by mistake i thought they were the weaker ones i had sitting around weirdly i didn t get insanely high i was fairly baked but not wigging out lmao but the next morning i got up and i was still high af i had to go to work like that and i have to present this clean image where i work lmao i was laughing my ass off at some stupid shit i tried to play it off like i have a fever and i took some medicine that made me loopy d
i thought the helicopter was a swat team coming for me and my friends
while driving across the country i was in arizona marveling the desert first time i had been in the desert and was mesmerized by the creepy vast beautiful landscape i wanted to always remember the beauty this was back when you d put your phone in a holder on the dashboard so i recorded the drive through the petrified forest fast forward a couple weeks and i go to look up that video that s when i found out i didn t flip the camera so it s a minute video of me driving high as fuck
this happened to me literally last week a friend of my brother had given him a couple pot brownies and he gave me two of them that night i decided to eat one they were relatively small and just chill in my room and wait for it to kick in so i could have a good night and relax well about two and a half hours in it hit me full force and i started to have a panic attack like full on hyperventilating and sweating i didn t want to reach out to anyone because the only other person awake was my mother and i didn t particularly want her to know i ate an edible she s sort of against us being under any influence in her home so i had to deal with it alone at one point i had heard some noises coming from my tv that was on and thought the sounds were coming from inside my head and i was freaking out basically ended up curled up on the floor by my dresser and thought i was going to die i was so high eventually ended up sleeping it off but man that was definitely a high i didn t want to reach again now i know to only take a couple bites next time lol
i only have one as i haven t smoked much driving home there was a cop like cars ahead of me i was way in the back his lights went on and i immediately pulled over he zoomed off in to the distance i waited there for a few minutes and thought i got away because i stopped moving
fun times with friends turned into a rooftop adventure learned my limits that night
ended up in the er thinking i had a seizure it was a panic attack thanks for nothing hospital
took adderalls and ran through my neighbors sliding glass door it was closed
i got sick at my friend s from too much try holding yourself up over a toilet while too high i gave up and just rested my chin on the rim i also interpreted some beautiful artwork in the sullied toilet water
i like this thread i m staying for a while
this one actually happened to my girlfriend she s inexperienced with edibles wanted to try one so i said only have half the first time and see how you like it she had a good night with the half so wanted a full one 10mg the next night that one was a mistake since she spent the night hugging a trash can fearing for her life and the other having the most solid sleep i ve seen anyone have it wasn t until days later i found out about peppercorns or lemon juice bringing someone down from an unwanted high
quick release edibles in public my friend and i could barely sit up in the brewery we went to so i ordered an uber we were crying laughing at instrumental music they were playing but i can t explain why the uber showed up and the girl said i can either take a safe way or do a really aggressive u turn to get to the street we need so i told her to drive aggressive and i d give her stars it was fun we joked around with her and it was exciting to get to look out the window instead of watching the road
made some lsa out of morning glories took way more than the recommended first dose had to spend hours counting down from and breathing at because i thought i forgot how to
reached another plane of existence but got finger caught in folding chair when i was trying to scoot forward looking at my mangled pinkie i started to convince it would probably be ok about an hour later i realized it would not and walked to hospital the next thing i know i ve got nurses screaming at me wondering what i m on but i m no rat they then cut away some meat and stitch me up and i walk home to enjoy what remained of my buzz
so my friends and i went on a road trip and we re in colorado springs and decide to drive up pikes peak we were in my car but my friends were driving because i have a fear of heights we got up above the tree line and i m just frozen in the back seat as still as possible trying to regulate my breathing it s funny we keep going and suddenly i realize you can see the curvature if the earth said so and then shut up until the sealed bag if chips popped from low atmospheric pressure eating chips actually helped me calm down from being so high up at the summit i was mostly okay because i was far from any cliffside unless there was railing we made it down safe with an appreciation for exactly how useless i am with heights the irony is of my friends i m by far the tallest like around the house i can reach most things without a ladder
i meant to get off on the floor but pushed in the elevator by mistake

bulls i work at a dairy cattle farm in my area like years ago a former employee of the dairy farm got injured by a bull and sued the farm and it went to court
pouring too much salt into your mouth saw it on dateline or something a mother was punishing her little child with it and she died very sick and
cows
a brick
not wearing a seat belt
putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger surprisingly doing that has a high mortality rate
those scooters you rent to get around on a friday night
all i m saying is do not actually blow into another person s genitals despite what the name of a certain sexual act might lead you to believe
i vote that this wins
you have to dilute your water
the joker showed me
god yes always get an x ray
that seems harmless to you does it
kinda missing the point of seemingly harmless
not to me but i thought to put it given how many people have gotten killed by texting and driving at the same time those people i thought probably thought that texting while driving seemed harmless at the time but it wasn t ultimately
that s fair
never i m tall and pretty intimidating but i m not really a big fighter even though i can hold my own in a fight
never i m not a fighter so if i m attacked i m gonna need to end the attack with eye gouges and crotch stomps
maybe against peralta or hitchcock
on a rare occasion when the actor is clearly not in good shape like i think i could take steven seagal easy or liam neeson just because he s old as fuck
i m pounds with a fairly solid martial arts background one thing years of fighting has taught me is you never know your opponent when i was in my prime 180lbs and cardio that would never quit a kid that might have weighed pounds with pounds of quarters in his pocket could kick the shit out of me with ease so i never assume i can beat anyone i just train and prepare to the best of my abilities
i thought exactly this at the zoo while watching the gorillas they have a life size 2d gorilla on a wall and i stood up next to it and thought no problem i mean it was probably all the beer i d been drinking
years ago it was a fairly regular thing nowadays not so much
as a fairly fit average size guy pretty often a lot of action stars are not very intimidating
twice weekly to be clear i could take that guy for a beer but he s paying
yea i was 13yo once too
every time i see steven seagal
spent the last year recovering from a serious injury but once i get my strength back yeah except if i m watching something with dwayne johnson
i have no fight experience outside of training lol i d be downed in a second
well i m slightly tall and my gut is big ish so never lol
i ve definitely thought that about joe pesci
not even when you see a tom cruise movie
if you re tall and ever fight a really big fighter is exactly what you are
really i d go for scully over hitchcock hitchcock definitely fights dirty
liam neeson has a special skill set
i don t like fighting
then maybe you should stop stealing boobies
never edit do you by chance have any boobies
you re clearly talking to president putin he s never even touched any
golf a waste of time and land
american football seems to maim a lot of its players but it might be more useful to change some rules instead of taking away a sport that lots of people seem to love for things other than the maiming
bull riding is quite unnessesary
bog snorkelling
i recently discovered the sport of curling the fuck is this sport where there shoot something down a bullseye or whatever and there s like guys using push brooms in front of next to and all that shit trying to get it within where what fuck it i need another drink fuck this
horse racing
american football both because these overpriced stadiums are tax payer funded and it s just kinda cruel i get it s fun but like those athletes are slowly dying they get brain damage and start to degrade so quickly
it s not the dumbest thing out there but in a practical sense getting rid of something like american rules football or rugby would mean a whole class of individuals handicapped by cte and with more money than sense wouldn t exist and so they couldn t go on to get elected to congress murder their wives daterape prostitutes or finance armed robbery fenced by exceedingly cringe inducing vanity albums and all of you can name at least one such person in each of these categories and don t pretend you can t cricket or golf may be more agony to watch but they don t do that shit in cricket
fox hunting
american football it s like watered down rugby and unbearable to watch also it doesn t deserve football in its name
soccer i live in mexico and that shit is fucking unbearable
all sportsball fans must die
seal clubbing if you consider that a sport some do
competitive fastpitch softball i think it sucks and there s no reason women can t play baseball some do
baseball it s a game where even the players both don t know the rules and fall asleep at games
none of them if i don t like them i don t have to watch or participate
can t eliminate any sport everyone has their own preference
bullfighting
golf would be my pick
yup golf
what else am i going to do when i m retired and too frail for more strenuous activities
the waste of land is one thing but the amount of pesticides that go into maintaining a golf course is astounding
bull fighting even more so really
all sports are unnecessary

what what even is that
man curling is hard af
dogs too same issues
buts it s the altar to capitalism on which we sacrifice our sons
a bunch of over paid sissy s running around in tights i don t really like any pro sports if you like to play it for fun go ahead if you play it to get paid gtfo
naw really it s the people who do t like sports that should die
impound all private golf courses and use the fairways to contain the tents of the nation s homeless
die of course
the horse track and strip clubs are better you just sacrifice your savings
waterworld i thought it was a fun adventure flick
eurotrip
wild wild west such a fun movie
the mario bros movie 90s
shawshank redemption
mario movie it was certainly a movie of all time
there are quite a few for me but off the top of my head jingle all the way batman v superman amazing spiderman
suicide squad charlie s angels
green lantern
i liked the new ant man movie i didn t love it but i thought it was pretty good
mortal kombat
the good dinosaur
blade runner and the thing both released on the same day were both widely hated at the time but i thought they were awesome
as a fellow lover of cinema i would say that the film the lone ranger starring johnny depp and armie hammer is one that got really bad reviews but i enjoyed it regardless sure it wasn t a perfect film and had its fair share of flaws but i found it to be an entertaining and fun ride with great action sequences and a charming performance from depp it may not be for everyone but i thought it was worth the watch
the super mario bros movie from the 90s i loved it as a kid
grown ups also i feel like having adam sandler as your favorite actor me is on brand with loving movies that don t get critical acclaim
white chicks can t stop laughing with it
waterworld
how on earth did eurotrip get bad reviews clearly these people don t know quality when they see it
don t tell scotty
one of my favs as a kid
that movie is such a fever dream bro
u ifonlythiswasreal403 now playing it s unreal from dansette jr
i saw critics complaining about the thin plot like bruh it s mario can t get any thinner than that lol
i actually liked the amazing spider man films
me too man i had a good time with that one
it s somewhere in the 40s on both rotten tomatoes and imdb it has almost an viewer like rating though so yes the audience does not agree with the critics
but this isn t where i parked my car
i know but it s something me and my twin share good memories with our dad
it was also a kid s movie people expecting a cinematic masterpiece from a videogame movie lmao
well there was olive oyl
same they were fun
at least there is some good news here thank you for sharing
me and my brother watched that movie so much what a classic
fr dude like as long as the kids enjoy it that s all that should matter with something like mario
unpopular opinion but i prefer andrew over the others he just happened to have bad scripting
he is my favorite spiderman you could tell how much he loved the character
columbo
monk a lot of my family really liked that show so they d be stoked if he was on the case
shawn from physic
shawn spencer and his associate bruton gaster
benoit blanc
sherlock holmes
gregory house
batman not only does the crime get solved but the murderer gets beat up
peralta from b99
leroy jethro gibbs
monk
joe kenda he isn t fictional though
sherlock holmes of course classic
l
i m dead how tf will i choose a detective for my own case if i m dead
the hot girl from castle
inspector gadget
keith and veronica mars
batman
agent mulder
as a fellow murder victim just kidding i think i would want sherlock holmes to solve my case he s a brilliant detective and his attention to detail is second to none plus he s always up for a good challenge and i d like to think my case would be no exception however i also wouldn t mind if hercule poirot or nancy drew took a crack at it basically anyone but inspector clouseau i have a feeling my case would quickly turn into a comedy of errors with him in charge
chloe decker and lucifer
well i do declare i would want none other than detective benoit blanc on the case
jimmy perez assuming i was killed in the shetland islands which is unlikely but if i were jimmy would catch the killer that s for sure
sherlock holmes
luther
perry mason
definitely not only is he going to solve it but when he shows up he tortures the killer by obfuscating stupidity and saying just one more thing
i ve not heard of him i ll have to look him up
what about dupin
by learning experiencing and growing life will give you thicker skin some more than others
nobody is really that great or special so why care anyways your purpose in life isn t to impress people
with maturity dignity decency and respect self reflect on what you can do differently
it will always get at you at first but as you grow you get stronger
assume that the way that person feels about you is how the entire planet feels about you
live and learn
as someone who s faced a fair amount of rejection in my life i think it s important to remember that rejection isn t always a reflection of your personal worth sometimes people simply don t jive with what you re putting out there whether it s in the context of a job application a romantic relationship or just general social interaction it s important to recognize that not everyone has to like or want to be around you and that s okay that being said if you consistently find yourself facing rejection and it s starting to take a toll on your mental health it might be worth exploring some ways to improve your communication or social skills but ultimately the most important thing is to practice self compassion and remind yourself that your worth is not determined by the opinions of others
sour grapes logical fallacy i can t have the thing i originally wanted so now i ll convince my self i didn t want it in the first place
that way i am fucked
great advice thanks
what is the solution then
i never said i didn t want to be loved lol what you re describing aren t mutually exclusive concepts
just be steady in your perception of yourself one persons opinion of you is not all defining if you like yourself you will run into more people who also like you
i didn t say shit about love lol if after you ask someone out aka you think they are special and great and they reject you if you say well no one s special anyways what s so great about them that s a logical fallacy
wanting to have sex with someone doesn t mean you think they re special or great you made a lot of assumptions with that first sentence
ok op didn t specify it was about sex either what s your point
just giving my opinion
feeling unwanted during my last relationship
lately it s been providing for my family i m in the midst of switching jobs and it s nerve wrecking it s all on me but if i stay at my current job i ll end up killing myself or dying of a heart attack

the thought of dying i am medicated for severe anxiety but before i was i had constant panic attacks over all sorts of things the thought of death always would take me straight to a panic attack and still occasionally makes me pause and think about it for a bit i used to be a christian and the fear that i was wrong and that there was just nothing after death always scared the absolute shit out of me now i m searching for what to believe in but i ve sort of made peace with the possibility of there being nothing after death i hope i m wrong but if i m not then at least it ll have been expected
trying to fall asleep
ai and how quickly it s advancing and how nobody seems to care most people don t seem to be aware of it and whenever i try to share what can be achieved with chat gpt or ai image generation people irl friends or family react like i just showed them a tiktok of a random gadget or a cute cat video the whole reaction is like cool and that s it they don t seem to understand that this will literally change everything forever anyone who has been following the advancement of ai for the last six months will know that it s moving at a very very very fast pace faster than many experts predicted last august stable diffusion one of ai image generators could generate pictures that barely made sense today we can make photorealistic pictures to the point we can post them and most won t even realize it s ai generated heck it s getting hard to notice them even for those who are knowledgeable on the subject chatgpt is in the process of coming out and it s freaking insane especially since we can give it access to the internet and it can create its own little gpt minions assistants to help on whatever you ask it to do this is gonna be a game changer forever i m worried about my future but at the same time i want to take advantage of the fact that i m quite early to the trend and i should probably abuse these tools while they re still open to the public and most people haven t jumped on it but i don t know how yet i ll often have a disconnect while using ai and be like wtf this is way out of our control and i ll have a bit of an existencial crisis i m wondering why aren t more people in the same boat maybe i should just disconnect for a bit
whether or not i ll ever find love and be able to start a family
any human interaction where i might have not acted perfectly or not understanding the reaction of someone even though logically their reaction is normal and my actions were nothing thanks anxiety

losing my dream job to malicious gossip i was a type of social worker and honestly i was freaking awesome but i m disabled chronic pain bad arm shoulder and hand i got injured transporting a client to a different hospital took two days off for medical leave which was totally okayed by management then came back to this giant long list of completely untrue bullshit firing me i d never had one negative review never had been written up disciplined nothing i think they didn t want the liability of having someone who already is injured possibly get injured again but since they can t legally say that they just made up a bunch of hurtful bullshit i asked them to redact the untrue parts of the letter like of it and they wouldn t do it so i took them to unemployment court and actually won even that validation from a judge that i was not in the wrong and should have just been written up or something never took that sting away backstabbing shit talking bitches i tell myself i m over it but the thoughts occasionally keep me up at night and i very unfairly have nightmares about it to this day it was about a couple years ago at this point so i tell myself i m not still salty but my brain says otherwise
leaving my wife after she became super born again i loved her still with all my heart but could not stand to be so judged by her anymore she became more concerned about saving my soul than just loving me i still miss and love her to this day and that was over years ago now

gender dysphoria
i ve lost sleep over a lot of things over the years one thing that sticks out in my mind was when i was in college and had a really tough final exam coming up i was so worried about failing the exam and not doing well in the class that i ended up staying up all night studying
worried why i can t get to sleep how tired i ll be the next day it s a vicious cycle
basically everything my depressed brain keeps telling me depression anxiety bpd and other mental health issues make you lie awake pretty often
my job i work in the health and safety industry and if i miss something it could potentially expose someone to a fatal dose of something nasty often wake up trying to remember if i checked something or other
terrible health anxiety my dad is diabetic and has heart issues and i ve been woken up by my mom many times in the middle of the night since i was a child to tell me they had to rush to the hospital for either cardiac arrest or hypoglycemia it hasn t happened many times but they ve been enough for me to be scared of the silence at night with every subtle sound my heart races thinking my dad s telling my mom he s not feeling well i wish i could convince myself it s not gonna happen all of a sudden but my dad ignores the signs every time something is wrong this has also made me scared of anything happening to me despite not having inherited any heart issues
my brother s suicide back in he told me why it was going to happen but i didn t realize he was going to actually do it he swore me to not tell anybody why he did it and it ate me up for months after his death it took me almost a year to get back to a semi normal sleep schedule

after reading your replies to the people rightly correcting your spelling not with the objective of belittling you but in an effort to help you get your original point across it s ironic that you would accuse anyone of being an adult sized child

if you live where hunting is a necessary or large facet of life i suppose hunting is a useful skill
imagine doubling down on a misspelling no one could be that stubborn surely he meant children need to learn the plural form of the word to describe a person receiving medical care what other nouns should children learn houses
nope
not really i came to the cesspool to do bad things and im accomplishing exactly that harassing people is fun if you take the internet seriously that sounds like a you problem beside ill probably be done with this account tonight anyway the fact that so many people lack the self control to not criticize my spelling really just shows that im right anyway
lol im not stubborn this is the internet actually a subset of the internet a wild place where some people much like yourself take themselves entirely too seriously when the reality of the situation is none of this actually matters this isnt real life
okay children need to learn the noun to describe a person receiving medical care in plural that s what children need to learn

don t spend more than you make
when you buy tools or applyances always go for the cheaper options if they break because due to frequent use you know it s worthwhile to invest in a more expensive and durable version and if you use them frequently and they don t break all the better that way you are less likely to spent a lot of money on things you rarely use
no kids
prenup
cashback credit cards as long as you are disciplined and can pay off all the balances on time
cook more at home cleanup sucks but not as much as forking out a night for the conveniences of something to eat asap
as long as you use credit cards appropriately they re far safer than using a debit card
pay with cash and never spend any one dollar bills save those in a jar you will think twice about breaking a larger bill for a purchase if you know you can t spend the change
git gud
investing young and rolling over the returns it means your investment grows exponentially the long term inflation adjusted average annual return of the sp500 stock market index is which means your investment will double in size every ten years on average so in years you have 2x2x2x2 times your initial investment so invested in your tenties is million dollars in your sixties and since the is inflation adjusted that means the spending power is as if you had million dollars today
make your lifestyle more expensive you will force your brain to find a way to make more money

follow r personalfinance lots of great stories what to do not to do regarding finances debt savings student loans etc they have million subscribers they must be doing something right over there
buy everything with credit card and be responsible and pay it off every month you should never pay for anything with a debit card
pay extra on your bills every month even a few dollars you get better service and then at christmas or when there s an emergency you don t have to pay bills that month
none of the best financial advice is fun don t take student loans you don t have to go out of state to get a degree you can take most of your general courses at a community college and transfer to university if you want to finish your degree buy used not new don t go out to eat prepare your own food don t rack up credit card debt if you have debt sacrifice nice to haves like digital services games streaming services etc pay down this debt quickly set aside for emergencies don t touch it unless there s an emergency and replenish it asap when used if your company offers 401k match start contributing at least enough to cover what they ll match if you can contribute and you don t have debt do it
in school when i m taking a test i pretend i have a stuffy nose so i get up and blow my nose but the teachers hate when i do it inside so they tell me to do it outside the halls then when i m outside i put my heel on the door while i m searching up the answers on my phone and if the teacher were to open the door i would know cuz the door would hit my leg
don t spend more than you earn
pay yourself first save and put in savings
take up knitting it s relatively cheep and you make high quality clothes that people want to buy at a high price it addition its time consuming so you have less time to spend buying stupid things

if you work at a company with regular k deductions and a company match get that you are automatically investing in your older self and get company help

uber eats gave me of food for free the other day so i used it it ended up costing with bullshit fees and tip but that s pretty good for a takeout lunch and dinner other than that i only use them when i have a well paying job and am busy af during the day
exactly one should do their own grocery shopping and cook at home from simple ingredients even this is too much for the spoilt populace of today smh
i ll get right on that in my rental property with no yard that i still pay of my monthly income to live in
or just make sensible decisions about what you ll use enough to justify the cost of good tools and appliances
you still spent and how much did you have to spend before that to get the of free food
you don t need a yard to grow plants get some pots or an aerogarden aerogrdens are pretty cool to have they provide everything your plant needs to grow and live and can fit on a counter top
how much did you have to spend before that to get the of free food i hadn t used them in about a year so they threw the offer at me and each for both lunch and dinner ain t bad imo

that you absolutely do not need to be polite to or play nice with someone who isn t polite to you i firmly believe more so these days that the whole turn the other cheek let go of negative energy or be the bigger person thing was made up by jerks with zero consideration or consequence to their own behaviour to be allowed to treat others like doormats on the basis of some moral or karmic satisfaction honestly i think lot of the times people convince themselves that s what they re doing because they really can t do or can t think of what to do that doesn t contravene a certain social norm of course you do need to acknowledge and accept the consequences of your behaviour including how much energy you give to a thing

i think reproducing is inherently immoral antinatalism
drag is disgusting and physically repulsive trans people are fine it is just the rupaul drag stuff while i m here and before i likely get banned by some marxist zealot i also think the focus of trans acceptance should be more about remedying their mental issues and stigma surrounding their affliction and less about you can be whatever you want to be it just isn t realistic we should accept every person as they are and where they re at but not redefining biology
im gonna get a shit storm of bad vuju for this but that vaccine was fishy i went through a lot of heartache over it a ton of conflict with family then i get it and the world gave a fuck for about months here in california then i never needed it again and i ve had covid twice both whilst vaccinated so fuck that damn thing

my farts smell good and bush did
the idea of leagues of comparable attractability determining your odds with the opposite sex is so far from being as true as believed it was come up with by companies to make you insecure enough and intensify your fomo to convince you to buy their products a lot of what can improve your chances are small things developed with commonsense attention and practice and in any case you never quite know what will work as well as it does with whom so it s worth a try barring certain results because of certain behaviours you deserve and are worthy of good things
that tally hall is a good band
people who cut in line should be assaulted by the crowd and beaten with whatever blunt object is handy
fatphobia isn t a real thing it s like saying cigarattephobia is a thing both are proven unhealthy by science many times over and the people who try and attack others for being fatphobic are literally attacking others for saying people should make better health choices
you can live and act however you want dress up however you want date anyone you like have operations on yourself or not but i m still identifying you based on your sex and not your gender because i believe that the biological natural sciences should govern society and the gender sciences humanities act as a guide not the other way around

the one beyonce song i like is her singing at last
i wouldn t be so sure bud war could be just over the horizon
people all coming together with the same opinion on things i don t think i would like to see that i believe individual choices can have a real impact though i think that what we choose to buy what we choose not to buy could be an extremely efficient tool to impact rapid change in our societies we tend to think change needs to come from top to bottom but what really makes a difference in people s lives is how everyone choose to behave how we choose to treat others and each of our buying dcisions
i think protesting has its place but honestly the real battlefield is the entertainment industry including the news conservatives have long known that their bullshit can t stand up to the light of day and that s why they use any chance they can to attack anything mainstream media or hollywood not that both don t have their massive faults but exposure is their worst enemy you start to see things you didn t normally see in your day to day life and sympathizing with concepts and or people that s trouble
i think you re right in that most marches in the us are performative it s theater for our tribe but if there were ever a match that unified both sides and threatened to oust the powerful it wouldn t just be a show it would have power
except letting a fart rip that s a big one that s fun and satisfying bonus points if you re in a place that echos
yeah really that ain t a good kinda stank

it follows that one creeped me the f out still does
the mummy it fascinated me when i was 8yo i still get that same feeling from it years later i m a sucker for just about all the classic universal horror movies from that era but karloff s mummy will always be my favorite
the witch
bride of frankenstein island of lost souls the wolf man
cannibal holocaust was an old school good one
brought back some memories
zita johann really shined in this film she had a short film career and enjoyed the theater over hollywood she loved boris karloff during the making of this film but hated the director karl freund while best known for her role in the mummy check out zita in the sin of nora moran
worse in just about every way the covid period was a huge plus personally if not for covid and the shutdowns i would still be commuting about an hour each way days a week instead of wfh as much as i do now as a result i got to spend so much more time with my oldest son starting in and i was able to help out my wife when our twins were born i did very well professionally and financially during this period as a direct result of covid and it s effects in the world
met a woman irl two months before the lockdown we lived in two different countries during the lockdown we wound up on a number of zoom calls and got to know each other better a nosy mutual friend thought he saw sparks and asked her if she was into me she was i called her that night we talked for hours and a month later she flew to visit me as an american i couldn t go to her we hit it off and six months later were married i moved to her country we just bought a new house and i start an amazing new job on monday
when covid happened i started randomly recognising myself as the opposite sex and it hasn t fully gone away since i also started slowly realising how toxic my home life actually is i graduated from high school in june of
i wouldn t have fucked up lungs and would still be able to hike
covid was the reason i made some of the best memories of my life honestly it basically brought my friends back to being kids again we d stay up to all hours of the night playing video games we d spend our days playing football or other sports because it was the only thing we really could do honestly while it wasn t all rainbows and butterflies i wouldn t give up those memories for the world if it hadn t happened i would never have experienced my first true love when i did and i wouldn t have the great summer of memories that i have now
my dad might have still been alive on the other hand i may not have progressed in my career the way i did
covid was the best thing to happen to me in a long while still haven t gotten it all circumstantial but i have a better job and have so far made more money in the last years than the years prior i also would not have found out that half my family was anti vax anti science homophobic and put one single human above all others and it wasn t jesus
funnily enough i was planning how to go out more right before lockdown hit built up my confidence and everything and then the orders and shutdowns started coming in probably not a significant change as i d eventually do it years later but that s still a long time imo
i had a very promising career prospect in a field that cannot exist virtually
it wouldn t have changed at all
totaly the same
id probably be dead if it wasnt for covid i was suicidal and i hated school quarantine was a nice time to heal a bit and not having to interact with my jackass classmates was the greatest thing
my life not too much different i feel bad for my kids though they entered their teenage years during covid and i feel like they ve been playing catch up ever since both educationally and socially
i don t think i d be married if it hadn t happened my boyfriend at the time in and i were struggling a little in our relationship at the time and i wasn t sure if i wanted to move forward with him no serious issues just are we a good fit do we want the same things boredom etc when lockdown hit we ended up deciding to quarantine together because we both got sent home to work remotely and neither of us had roommates or close friends in the area i figured even if we don t work out in the long term it ll be a fun time and i won t be as lonely during this whole thing anyway we ended up having an absolute blast living together and discovered how much we really loved each other and connected in a whole new way we got engaged in and got married about a month ago
my father would still be alive
i ve grown apart from friends that thought the whole thing was a hoax i just never understood the selfishness involved in their decision not to get vaccinated at the height of the pandemic to potentially protect others
it would have been worse my commute is about an hour and minutes and there was no option for working from home now i get to work from home days week so i save hours of driving a week extra hours to be at home and doing whatever i want to do instead of driving to and from work that a huge quality of life improvement and my union is renegotiating our contract this year and i m hoping the current work from home situation becomes permanent in the contract
not a lot i own an online retail business so it wasn t affected much and i m not big on going to restaurants or other indoor stuff so i didn t care that much about the period we were supposed to stay out of those places my idea of entertainment is going hiking or fishing so i just had more time to do that i guess i did get covid but i had all my vaccines so it wasn t very bad
i d still have my buddy
covid gave me marvellous memories that i could ever ask in my life my sister came to my hometown because of wfh and my family including me my sister dad mom spent quality time and it was all like a perfect movie script we cooked together played games watched many many movies series kept on talking till midnight shared our secrets and what not i spent each and every second being grateful and at my happiest stage not knowing there was something heartbreaking waiting for me in dec i lost my mother not because of covid but a sudden heart fail it all happened so fast that everything ended within mins if it wasn t covid probably those memories wouldn t be with me now people leave but the memories that were made with them stays by your side comforts you encourages you and definitely makes you feel miserable
it fucking sucked i work in healthcare no wfh all the additional exposures no additional pay the thanks i got were a fucking sign out front of some hospitals to make matters worse the economy got trashed and now i basically make even less money now it is very hard for me not to be enraged by the lucky folks who got a nice paid vacation and found new hobbies watched a fucking documentary about tigers slept good for you folks and all that did i m just a bitter miserable fuck who did his job to help keep the world going round
congratulations
i would had get to experience more from our clinical duties
wouldn t be going through bankruptcy
being one of the essentials i got to take on some in building responsibilities for people that were riding the edge of being able to wfh and when one of them retired last year i had learned enough of his job and proven my abilities in it that i was offered his position at just about 2x the pay i was getting lockdown ended up opening up a lane for me
company i work for was getting ready to send me out to japan for training this would ve been a three month assignment and would ve been a lot of fun aaaaand then covid hit and just completely destroyed that plan
i would most likely still be playing soccer as a goalie
would never have learned to cut off unhealthy friends nor would i have gotten my health in check
about the same i basically ignored covid while it was going on
i wouldn t have my son be able to wfh with my son and wouldn t have bought the home of our dreams everything happens for a reason
i finished a contract with a hospital in december of i was slated to move on to another hospital and had years of project work lined up covid hit and hospitals stopped spending money on technology upgrades overnight by the time covid was over i had found something else to do i got the raise i had worked so hard for doubled my salary three weeks before the world shut down that was rolled back until further notice fuck covid
i would still be in school not homeschooled my family would have a car i would have friends my bsf brothers which one of them are also my brothers bsf would still have a crush on me i d be insecure and depressed both of my friend groups would most likely have ended on good terms i would be a extrovert would hate reading would have gotten to have my middle school and freshmen year experience
not at all never missed a day of work it sucked for my hs student she was cheated out of almost years due to a bullshit lockdown
just a bit better
i would have been at a dead end job still and not a job i like i refused to take the jab they fired me and i found a job that appreciated me and paid more
my life would be completely different
wtf is this question it was a few years of extra health precautions not the fucking apocalypse if you are lamenting some missed opportunity caused by covid then there is a pretty good chance your life was going to suck anyways
pros i probably wouldn t be dealing with anxiety ptsd and occasional bouts with depression cons i probably wouldn t have reconnected with my brother when i did and i probably wouldn t ve realized that i needed to change my life which led to me getting serious about my health weight lifting
very a good change i d most likely still be stuck at my old job that underpaid me severely and required me to drive to the office every weekday i ended up getting a new job a year ago that s fully remote and paid much better in that aspect i m happier a bad change i found out one of my cousins is anti vax and i m no longer close to them anymore we re very close in age and had been close friends for a couple decades i miss that relationship
i d probably be drinking less other than that nothing
we d be significantly better off financially and probably homeowners by now i lost my job and my so lost about 40k in wages ended up burning through our entire savings to keep our livestock fed and lights on we were pretty close to being able to finally afford a house too ended up having to sell the majority of our possessions that were worth anything sell all our animals give them to friends and move into a subdivision and start over had a bunch of family members die during that period not of covid and missed out on seeing them before they died as they were in care not into phones
my life would ve been very different covid started when i was a kid i thought it would be fun to stay at home for a while but then i realised i couldn t play with my old friends and i was upset about it the thing that cheered me up was the fact that i could eat more i ate alot more than i should ve eaten and i didn t do any exercise so i just gained more and more weight by the day fast forward years i m incredibly upset with my body i weigh 75kg and i m only if i wouldn t have started binge eating in i wouldn t be crying about my body everyday i really regret what i chose to do during the off school period
my family would be a lot bigger
i d still be in my old job and the company would have never been bought out i d likely have been promoted to the lead for us based tech support by now
i probably would have been dating her we really hit it off from the start then covid swung by the whole world changed life changed priorities changed locations changed schedules changed
my mental health would be a lot better i knew when they announced lockdowns that it was going to be rough for me mentally because i d be stuck in a toxic household with my mom freely able to abuse me as she wished what i didn t expect was how the rest of my family would be complicit and even actively participate in it if i argued with one of them the rest of them would swarm me and i d be arguing with people at once this was a regular occurrence and it didn t happen if i wasn t involved in the argument it culminated in my mom physically assaulting me i was blamed for it i moved out shortly after and haven t spoken to my mom since my relationship with my dad and my sister have gotten better since i moved out sometimes i still have nightmares about that period of my life
if covid hadn t happened my mother would have gotten the funeral she deserved surrounded by the lives she impacted
probably have a job in the film industry in my city can t even get a job getting people coffee on set now
i probably wouldn t have bonded closely with my kids i have kids with disabilities and every day saw at least two or more appointments running all over the state i was never home even worse than my husband who is a 5er the healthy kids resented the time i was away covid made most of our appointments remote so i could stay home and get to know my kids better it probably sounds bad but that break in routine was something my family really needed
not much i was a introvert weeb before the pandemic and i carried on being during and after workwise being a cleaner i was deemed an essential worker so aside from a metric shittonne more sanitising on touch points and things like that it largely stayed the same
unironically i might be dead covid hitting me weakened me enough that i had a dka my readings were basically off the chart i was a almost year old undiagnosed type diabetic this attack was bad enough i was in intensive care for days if my state had slowly deteriored for another couple of years and not collapsed early due to covid i might have died
i d probably have not been able to carry on working full term with my health and the energy wasted just travelling to the office
probably wouldn t have bought my condo and would not have had my best friend and his two pitbulls live with me possibly would have more money and less stress but a whole lot less love and contentment in my life
i might have stayed in my dead end jobs a lot longer complications with scheduling drove me crazy and i went for the first new job i could get which ended up better in every way
not at all
it s improved i don t have to commute hours every day so my mental health has greatly improved as well as my physical health because i m no longer exhausted from my commute and can work out on my lunch break i also got a promotion that i don t think i would have if not for the pandemic and best of all i am able to spend way more time with my girls and my wife
my mom would probably still be alive i wouldn t have gone months without seeing her even if we spoke every couple of days i wouldn t feel the regret of not getting to hug her one last time or miss her calling every single day covid fucked me up mentally what made it worst is i lost my stepfather exactly week later from covid issues as well when it rains it pours apparently
first i have been very lucky no one in my known family has died from this awful illness though some have experienced it my heart breaks for those who have lost loved ones to this horrible thief of life and quality of life i do know one thing covid did for me i didn t have to fret about rels traveling to my wedding i wanted it microscopic and simple and i got it i guess a second thing was that covid revealed to me just how sadly one of my cousins believes all of the misinformation about the vaccine it s doubly sad because her views are putting her at risk of delaying her second kidney transplant which she desperately needs a donor has been identified but without getting vaccinated she can t get the transplant without traveling from the west coast to the east coast of the us the rest of us in the family have had to take the you do you boo attitude to cope emotionally
i d have more money in the bank that s for sure
i d be forced to drive to the office every day instead of once a week
well having time to actually think about how i felt for the first time in my life instead of being trapped at work gave me clarity on what i wanted out of my life gave me courage to leave my old life in the same old city doing the same old shit
i was just starting university when covid happened i like to think i would have overcome my social anxiety
i bought a restaurant during covid in different times there would have been a lot of competition for this sort of restaurant and so i would have either not gotten it or paid much more for it at the time you couldn t pay someone to take a restaurant but i took a leap and it has been very successful so far seems often in life you need to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy in order to get ahead not my saying but still true
i would probably have been a happier state now because for me and were the best years of my life of course not the people who got ill and passed but the aspect of the shutdown now all i can do is compare how happy i was then or how i could try and get that feeling again now i can try and let that go maturing is much better than grasping on for dear life to things that are in the past
my house would have been a third cheaper or i would have gotten a house worth more
dunno my mental health deteriorated pretty bad but considering where i was at that point i don t know if that would have not happened
well if covid never hit it i would have ended up getting a job working at a mechanic shop as a tire delivery driver i was about to get off of the job and then the world with s i ended up getting another job two months later as a custodian which was a great meditation job no one to bug me took a nice nap when it was slow and then finally had a nice chat with the security guard it was a government contract job as a custodian and came to sense with myself that i was bisexual and a demisexual and came the terms of myself that after i wanted to change my life well i did and it was for the good as of right now in i got a nice new job working at an auto parts store and i actually have a good boss who respects all the hard workers everyone even the drivers hell he appreciates when i help pick parts if the part picker is not available so yeah the virus had a positive impact on most people who turned the pandemic into an opportunity for a change in their life additional i left out a little fun thing as of this post i am currently in a nice conversation on telegram with a potential boyfriend and i m happy about it after being alone for so long i actually have somebody in my life so yeah the pandemic was something good for me i guess if not i would have still think i was straight and not be happy with my life
i really enjoyed the shutdown i enjoyed it so much that i put in my notice after the week shutdown at work and haven t worked since it s great so my life would have been much worse
probably not much different in all honesty either way i still would ve been pretty disliklusioned with my life and unwilling to try all that hard in being successful lockdowns still sucked though
my grandparents might be alive
my first divorce was finalized less than six months before covid hit i didn t realize it at the time but i was aggressively searching for a new wife i think i subconsciously wanted to prove something to my ex covid hit and everything shut down including my so called social life during that time i found my equilibrium again and realized how toxic my post divorce attitude towards relationships had become i imagine that if i had not been forced into isolation i probably would ve found someone that was just as toxic as i was and would probably be looking at a second failed marriage so for me covid was a blessing in disguise as i was able to gain perspective
i would have stayed as a tutor longer than i would have wanted but would have made some friends i had met a group of people in a chem class i was taking and we would chat regularly and even wanted to get food together once then everything went online and we never saw each other again also might have road tripped with some coworkers
well first off i would have been able to go to a billie eilish concert which would have been cool
i probably would have taken another job in a different state which would have been a massive leap
not much i worked for a billion dollar corporation that was designated essential during the pandenic i made good money and worked with good people i am still friends with several of them today of course having contracted covid a couple of times probably aged me quicker than i would ve liked or maybe i am aging normally who really knows i retired early because of health problems not related to covid without the pandemic i might still be working
probably would be much more mentally healthy spent nearly years in extreme social isolation with severe ptsd among other issues no friends no family etc worked really hard to get myself to a point i felt i could finally start interacting with the public again without severe blackout panic attacks and then covid hit forcing me to continue my isolation feels like i missed my chance something about spending all those years putting in all that mental work just to be forced to continue to isolate feels like it broke me in a way i didn t realize i could be broken and i was already pretty damn broken i want to add something positive here but i feel like i d be lying and betraying myself if i did now i m a barely functioning adult who prefers isolation with nihilistic views such as having friends and family and not wanting to be alone is selfish because it s setting a clock to hurt people by them missing you when you re gone that shitty voice says you re a selfish asshole if you want people to love you or care when you die companionship blinds you to who you really are that shitty voice says you re too weak to handle yourself and see yourself for who you are if you need companionship and society operating in such social ways reduces diversity uniqueness originality critical thinking and in general produces tribal and clique behavior that shitty voice has a ton to say about that i do recognize that some socialization is good because without it we would have a hard time continuing and advancing the work of those before us in important fields like science medicine technology and other important fields yeah i pretty much suck but i still like to be civil and polite with others when i interact with them and do still make attempts to function socially despite my beliefs because i recognize they were born in an unhealthy setting i d probably be much healthier if covid hadn t happened
i spent a lot more time writing music and practicing piano during covid happened during the second semester of my 10th grade and i m currently a piano performance major at a good music school as a result if it weren t for covid i d probably have gone into math or physics
while covid caused a lot of hurt in the world for many people it benefitted me in the long run the pandemic caused me to have to school remotely which taught me how to be myself and let my personality shine i was able to become better at public speaking gain incredible confidence and become a better person socially speaking i also learned about the values of hard work and integrity which i believe make me a better person who cares about others find light in the darkness people
wow i wish i could tell you all so different it s amazing it ruined my life nobody cared about their jobs not dr or nurse other jobs that ppl needed to see ppl in person it got to be an excuse instead of the reason i lost everything
i guess for some covid was a positive i m so happy for you
lemme guess you either work for the federal government or as a higher up in the wall street type of shit don t ya
w
agh i graduate may of this year lol only school days left for me d
i m so sorry that must be awful i have asthma and even though i didn t get a bad version of covid i noticed my lungs are definitely worse off afterwards
reminds me of the bridge of bo burnham s all eyes on me wanna hear a funny story so uh five years ago i quit performing live comedy because i was beginning to have severe panic attacks while on stage which is not a good place to have them so i quit and i didn t perform for five years and i spent that time try to improve myself mentally and you know what i did i got better i got so much better in fact that in january of i thought you know what i should start performing again i ve been hiding from the world and i need to re enter and then the funniest thing happened
congratulations
i hope you end up finding better friends you deserve good friends
i m sorry for your loss dear fellow redditor
i just realized all i did was complain and not answer the question at all i would have gotten to spend a lot more time with my kids and actually do things out in the world with them that they were robbed of i would have had a much better relationship with friends and family i would definitely not be a bitter miserable fuck as previously mentioned lol
awww

is nicholas cage a good actor or bad i know a lot of his movies are considered bad but that s just his decision making in picking films but i still like his movies i like ryan reynolds i don t know is he is a good actor or not because plays the same guy in all his films still like his movies inversely people say tom cruise is a good actor but i hate watching movies with him i don t think he is that good because he seems to play the same guy in them all but unlike ryan s character i don t like the guy cruise plays but opinions are like elbows everyone has a couple hell i actually liked leto s joker better than joaquin phonex s but maybe it s just because i didn t think the movie was written or maybe directed as a genre movie it would have been fine if it wasn t supposed to be dc s joker could have been the exact same movie called comedian and different names and nobody would know the difference if you dropped the gratuitous killing of parents in front of kid batman origin scene
keanu reeves probably good guy not a particularly great actor
the rock nick cage ryan reynolds
timothy olyphant especially when he plays a marshal like in justified or the mandalorian
nick cage
unpopular opinion selena gomez love her but i just don t think she s that great of an actress
cory feldman is an anomaly
adam sandler he always makes me laugh even though he s not technically the best actor
terry hulk hogan
john wayne was an awful actor played john wayne in every movie he was ever in growing up it was hard pressed to find an old timer that didn t love all of his movies
william shatner the orig star trek series
pretty much anyone in the adult entertainment industry actually ron jeremy is pretty good at portraying a senile elderly
i agree with almost all of this except tom cruise watch any of the mission impossible movies then watch collateral so very different characters
is nicholas cage a good actor or bad i know a lot of his movies are considered bad but that s just his decision making in picking films nic cage was in some serious debt and there was a time in his career where he literally did not have a choice on whether to turn down a film or not he essentially took any role available to him https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/nicolas-cage-movies-vod-net-worth-b2041941.html
i just watched matchstick men last night and wow he was great in that sam rockwell played his partner that screwed him and was even better in the movie but cage was still very good it in along with alison lohman
thank you a very wooden actor seems like a good dude though
really some people say he s the best and i m like what
i think ryan reynolds is so funny and good in romantic comedies love him
i feel like he s either a bad great actor or a great bad actor he acts just as good as the quality of the writing of the movie he s in and i feel like in any role he has i can t picture any other actor there s gotta be something to say for that
exactly he has grown on me i even thought for a second that he was cute
he s a good entertainer though the way he talks and moves in star trek is entertaining
he s got great timing and delivery it might be pretty much the same in almost all his movies but for what he does i think he does it well

i had to get heart surgery which i actually died a couple of times during but that s a whole other story after i had to get the drainage tubes removed and that was insane i also did a trial for a spinal stimulator and after it was done they removed the wires from my spine it felt like someone was pulling my skull out through my butt
an infected gallbladder right before removal after broken bones surgeries and all sorts of sports related injuries that was by far the worst pain
kidney stones are the worst i remember repeatedly pounding my head on the living room floor while thinking very clearly this isn t helping at all when it was really bad the doctors gave me a combination of iv valium and iv demerol the dosage was adjusted until my respirations and heart rate started to get dangerously low it still hurt but not as much for the rest of my life when something hurts i always think well this hurts but not a much as a kidney stone
that one girl that got away
childbirth beginning to end in minutes
broke my arm which shockingly wasn t that bad adrenaline high kept me numb until i got morphine just felt like a bruise afterwards then i had to get it rebroken to have a straightening rod inserted my mom tells me it hurt worse because your body doesn t pump adrenaline when the break happens while sedated which doesn t sound right to me but may have contributed nope the most pain happened because the rod they were putting in wasn t matched with the drill bit so they rebroke the arm drilled a hole and started cramming the rod in so hard it splintered the bone utter fucking hot agony upon waking up in recovery
i had a stomachache so bad i couldn t stand up straight i blame the deep dish pizza i ate earlier

i had surgery on my chest to correct my pectus carinatum while in the hospital my dad said something that made me belly laugh i felt like my whole chest and insides were on fire and that laughter quickly turned into screaming nurses had to come in to give me a morphine drip my poor dad felt so awful for making me laugh

portuguese man o war jellyfish i was visiting some friends in florida we were on the beach when we saw this blue blob in the sand that looked like an alien one of my friends pushed it into the water with her boogie board a few moments later we were walking along the beach and the girl that pushed the blue thing into the water started screaming and ran into the ocean and started splashing water all over herself i had no idea what was going on but i picked up her board and watched her confused a few moments later my arm and hand felt like it was actually on fire i felt the worst mind numbing pain i have ever felt on the arm that was holding the boogie board like flesh melting off the bone pain i immediately dropped the board and ran into the water doing the same thing splashing water all over myself our friends were dumbfounded once we explained what was happening they figured they shouldn t touch the board anymore there happened to be a guy in scrubs on the beach doctor nurse don t remember who saw us and asked if we were okay one of my friends told him what happened and he grabbed his phone looked something up showed it to us and said did it look like this he showed us a picture of the thing we saw and we said yes he told us it was a portuguese man o war jellyfish and their toxins are very painful even if you don t come in direct contact with one he said the best remedy is hot water as hot as you can stand it it opens the pores and washes the toxins out thankfully it worked that was easily the worst pain i have ever felt in my life i almost passed out
i love this story simply because of the sheer absurdity of it it sounds fake and i love it once when i was getting ready to go to get a cavity fixed i lost balance while peeing hit my head on a counter next to the toilet then hitting it on the toilet and then peeing all over my shirt and leg

the star wars prequels a sprawling epic political thriller set in the star wars universe sounds amazing execution not so much
downsizing i was so pumped for that turns out it was a wasted pump
downsizing
prometheus
lucy with scarlett johansson
a lot of the dc movies they have good concepts but the script writing is lacking
the last airbender amazing story terrible execution
after earth idiocracy
do movie adaptations of books count because the shack left a lot to be desired after i read the book
the script that became the awful russell crowe robin hood movie was based on a script called nottingham it was a procedural crime drama with the sarrif as the protagonist he would be using historical methods to investigate a murder robin was just some asshole in his hair itr was one of the most competed for scripts in history then scott threw out all of it and did something else
easy wishmaster hands down don t even have to think about it
birdemic what you don t believe killer birds due to climate change is a great concept i m shocked
death note
promising young woman brilliant concept great beginning great cast somehow just fails to come together
hudson hawk funnier and more coherent if it were animated
dillinger and capone alternate history heist movie dillinger survives police sting escapes al capone learns about it and forcibly recruits his help on a new job
magical mystery tour
it was like they just changed movies partway through
yes seriously that movie created more questions than it answered i loved the premise though
that s because they re based on incredible comics marvel have won in the film department but dc will always have the better writing in comics
that s a movie ripe for a remake leave the classics alone and redo shit like this
absolutely man i agree i like most of the dc heroes and villains better than marvel but marvel has the better movies
i think marvel puts more emphasis on their good movies then dc dc have v for vendetta watchmen the dark knight trilogy the joker the batman constantine and all the animated films that are solid s all of which are 10x better then anything marvel has made in the past years aside maybe from a few spiderman films i d say dc have better films just less popular ones
i didn t even think about their animated films i haven t watched much of them in recent years but i loved the older ones when i was younger
most of them are really great films especially the dark night returns films lmao
i mean they already do behind the scenes if you don t believe everything the goverment puts out is calculated you are silly they like the people against each other if they are against each other they won t turn on the goverment that s why it s at the point where the us is so divided and you have citizens fighting each other not paying attention to the fact the goverment doesn t do jack shit
open discussion compromise and respect for each other s perspectives politics bipartisanship
for them to realize their both just government puppets being controlled
being forced by law probably
a viable 3rd party
things that are obvious easy publicity wins for both parties at the same time it happens but wont or cant happen on many more polarizing issues
they do to maintain status quo if you re talking about the voters it would take people to stop caring about race and politicos and unfortunately most likely violence against the current leadership not advocating for that but don t see any other way to rid the incompetency from the leadership of this country
if it keeps them in power and making money they will work together
something both hate equally
choosing sides is our biggest problem
a rogue president or legislator trying to impose term limits on senators supreme court etc
you know how when a couple gets divorced they have to hire two opposing lawyers that make money off of the couple s level of disagreement generally speaking the bigger the disagreement the more money there is to be made the american people have loads of money and no shortage of stupid shit to fight about why would they work together
as a reddit user i think it would take a major shift in the political climate for democrats and republicans to work together both parties have become so entrenched in their own ideologies and interests that finding common ground seems nearly impossible perhaps if there was a significant external threat such as a major natural disaster or foreign attack it could bring both sides together additionally i think it would require a genuine effort from leaders of both parties to prioritize compromise and collaboration over petty party politics it s a long shot but i remain hopeful that one day we ll see a more functional and cooperative government
pro corporate parties like the republicans prefer non functional government as it gives more power to the wealthy and big business the democrats are also pro corporate but get punished at the polls if they weaken the government too blatantly so either the democrats have to just passively let the republicans do whatever they want or preferentially republicans have to be voted out until they embrace functional government
world war but let s hope it doesn t come to that
it s sad that such a reasonable expectation seems so impossible
i d love it if you could explain to me how i can respect the perspective that women and gay people shouldn t have rights

there s plenty of good and beauty in the world you just have to be willing to see it
perspective just because you view the world as shit doesn t mean everyone does
it s really hard and deserves work for what it s worth your life is worth the good and bad individual to you everything else can righteously fuck off
you either focus on yourself to be happy or you focus on the outside world to be depressed
focus on the good in your life no matter how small it will breed positivity
take value in what you have
it s very fulfilling to help those who need help there are many opportunities in this world deciding to be part of the solution and taking action can be very rewarding in life and give it meaning
there are some horrendous abhorrent tragic etc things going on in the world i try to learn about and appreciate those things but i don t think it s correct to say the world is bad news stories understandably usually focus on bad things but it doesn t mean everything has gone to shit
that s just a story you tell yourself if i asked you what have you personally seen this year with your own eyes that is so bad i bet you probably wouldn t be able to name bad thing or maybe the worst thing you saw was someone cut you off in traffic the bad stuff you see on the news or read on reddit is someone elses story it s not yours
the world wasn t always good it won t always be bad for as many problems as we have you re living through the absolute pinnacle of the human experience results may vary
ignorance about the outside world focus on your own life don t watch the news i get depressed every time i watch the news so i actively avoid it
compartmentalization there are lots of important things in the world to address and improve it is valuable to spend time and energy making a difference it is also crucial that you can step back from it and find peace happiness joy in other things friends loved ones nature physical activity reading art and on and on there is a ton to be grateful for and enjoy when you need a respite
realize that you perceive the world through many different lenses that put together form your opinions and preferences with some effort you can identify these lenses and remove their influence on your mind from there you see that everything done by humans no matter how harmful or difficult stems from love and with that realization you can equip yourself to identify the lenses in others which will go a long way in helping you understand their actions
you are not culpable for the bad decisions someone else makes whether that s on a local or global scale constantly measuring your happiness against whatever the plight of someone in another part of the world your realistically cannot directly impact is a trap it s great to want to help but you still have to be kind to yourself
people choose to see the ugliness in the world you don t have to
because the concept of bad only works if there is also a good yin yang there literally can t be one without the other but if you re asking how people can be happy when there s so much suffering it just depends on what you look at and understanding that you can t change the world you can only change yourself
what s got ya so down
how can you ever see with your eyes closed change what you see mate
my life is good because i am lucky i live in a small town in british columbia canada i have a decent job and a small group of close friends my parents and grandparent s are alive and loving i spend my weekends enjoying nature often at my family s river front acreage i also choose to stay ignorant of most current events and politics i have my problems health issues vices etc but i know i m in the top of the happiest people in the world and i never let myself forget it
can t have good without bad if you want the world to be better be the best person you can be and set that example yourself be the change you want to see in the world
sometimes it s the amount of either goods or bads you come across that shape your view of life on a more positive note life is full of intentional and many random good people and that genuinely makes me happy
you just gotta make it good baby it fuckin sucks i hear you but we gotta persevere dude
it is pretty precious for you to be aware of those bad things many people in the world simply don t know those bad things exist isn t that a signal for guys like you to change those bad thing
there are good things many many good things
first world question
well there s war famine ecological destruction but also chocolate and puppies and romance isekai webtoons just gotta find something
turn off the news and get off of social media and it s a normal world
this is the way
stop getting your news form reddit and mainstream news and your mental health will drastically improve
you can t have one without the other how would you know things are good if there s not something that isn t good at all
gotta stop watching the news
because you can t expect the world to hand anything over to you
surrender to moments and things that make you feel less shitty than normal from time to time and don t allow yourself to be an ass to yourself about it unless it s drugs or deliberately hurting living things if you don t know of any moments or things like that do weird and new things until you find something that makes you feel less shitty
yeah just push aside the genocide and rape and you can see beautiful things haha
you tried
what about my friend who s a rape victim and became homeless today oh right i ll just be happy about myself positivity

yeah how many positives make up for genocide i m kidding you don t need to answer

a whole podcast full of early s rich white kids saying if you re and you haven t figured out how to make enough money to buy a lamborghini then you only have your own laziness to blame for your mediocrity and then they went on a whole minute rant about how everyone has the capability for wealth and success the only difference is of people are willing to work hard enough to get it and of people are lazy pieces of shit they may as well have literally been stroking each others dicks all they were really doing was gloating about how they are so much better than the average person in society and being their own hype men by disguising the discussion as education and motivation for success like they were saying it to do the rest of the world a favour do rich kids seriously have zero comprehension of the difference between a person s ability to achieve substantial financial success when they re born into an existing system of wealth and power vs when they re born barely above the poverty line and have to get an after school job from the time they re to help their parents pay the rent and keep the lights on these kids were on a live stream passionately yelling all the men who grew up in those circumstances and have reached their mid s that they re a lazy pos who s lack of trying has made them a failure at life if they still can t afford their own lamborghini

some corporate jackass big shot with his fucking head up his ass who s never worked a day in his life came into the supermarket i worked at the one night and was mad we sold out of rotisserie chickens a half hour before close he said the case should still be full until close and asked why it wasn t when i told him that if i put too many on after a certain time of day we only end up with tons extra that we have to throw away at the end of the night this dumb useless fuck said i don t care the important thing is that we create the presentation pronounced like he was onto some genius idea i m too much of a peon to understand for our shoppers that we always have an abundance of food ready for them so now as per his command i have to throw away chickens a night close to worth of food meanwhile all of us who work ot there still don t make enough to pay rent and food shop in that every same store it took every bit of patience in my body not to punch this mutha fuckas teeth out
poor people are poor because they re lazy
i once worked for a family of four in their home nannying laundry cleaning chauffeuring the kids helping with dinner and errands etc they did whatever on their end to have me as a legitimate employee in the eyes of the irs i assume to avoid getting taxed on the money they paid me the mom told me they d help me out when tax season came bc i would owe the irs as they never did any withholdings on their end from my pay which is the only way i d ever been paid before i was in my early s and ignorant about this kind of stuff anyway tax season came and sure enough i owed the irs around which i did not have so i let her know she said if we give you around half will that be okay i responded we can talk about it another time bc the dad wasn t home and he was a little more in touch with financial realities than she was wanted to talk about it with both of them present she then goes on to tell me a story about how once they had some property they sold and they didn t know the nuances of property taxes and whatnot and they unexpectedly ended up owing the irs around they had to call her father in law his father to have him open up their access to the trust fund so they could pay it she literally compared her ability to get at the drop of a hat to my inability to pay i did not work one single second again for them after that
there was a boomer co worker who asked her group hey i m thinking of retiring and need to sell my house are any of you looking to purchase a house any time soon of course all of us are young somethings and she knows we re all looking for something because we re all younger and starting families one guys says yeah actually i m looking at houses now what price point are you thinking to sell at and she says million that seems normal for the houses in my neighborhood he just turns and walks away she looks around at the rest of us and is like did i say something wrong
not to me but near me i would pay money to see the hunger games if it was real
you know what the problem is with your generation right you re all spoiled
i asked why he needed two 50kw diesel power generators to run his house as a backup and he said it s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it for perspective 20kw is probably overkill
why yes this piece of furniture is functional but it s so aesthetically unappealing that i would simply die if i had to look at it on a daily basis in reference to a piece i owned
i was at a protest in and an older man in a cream colored suit blocked downtown traffic in his cream colored rolls royce and started asking protesters what they re going on about someone said he s gonna get towed and he went very confidently as his car blocked traffic no ones gonna tow me edit the outfit included a cowboy hat lots of rings and bullshit think a glitzy cowboy mob guy like in casino with the dumb nephew
i have a service job and when i was at a very wealthy customer s house she started telling me about how she and her husband had just bought another mansion in a millionaire neighborhood in a city next door just because keep in mind the house i was at of theirs was already a mansion and worth around million they were also building a completely separate million mansion in a different city she literally told me yeahhh i have no idea why we even bought that house in neighboring city we don t need it we re already building that other house but i think my husband just got a little carried away when he saw the for sale sign but you know we got bored and happened to be in city and i think the holy spirit they re christian led us there i mean yeah we have this house million mansion but it feels too small so i think we just needed more space and i think god was leading us in the right direction family of and they don t plan to have any more kids i guess i must not be praying right cause god hasn t led me to purchase a third mansion on a whim yet
new ceo started for a large company i used to work for and six months in she announced changes to the office schedule no more work from home days this was years before covid and no more flex schedules strict for everyone this negatively impacted parents like me who dropped their kids off at school on the way to work in a subsequent meeting where many of us expressed the difficulties with this new schedule she at one point said look i get it change is hard when our kids were little we had to have three nannies i started looking for a new job right after that
most conversations with baby boomer family members no offense to the community but you bought your houses for less than usd in most cases and can t understand why the kids don t have a new house and new cars by now lazy check the interest rates and inflation rates i always receive criticism for my used cars will never buy new again just bought a house finally and the criticism was well it s a nice starter house
this is actually in a different vein than some of these egregious stories but i think it illustrates how inconvenient it is to be poor and how rich people just don t understand that aspect of life at all i grew up poor and my parents were still poor when i got married my husband grew up wealthy at our wedding rehearsal my mom mentioned to his mom that she couldn t have another drink because she had to drive home like an hour away my future mil said like it was the most obvious thing in the world oh you should just take a cab all my mom could think was that taking a cab over an hour away would be like an expense that was just out of the question for mere convenience s sake this is when i started to piece together why my husband s family stresses me out so much they fly by the seat of their pants don t make plans are never on time because if anything goes wrong or is inconvenient they can just throw money at it i didn t grow up like that at all small things going wrong tend to be a lot more disastrous when you have zero money
a button fell off my jacket my rich friend recommended where to buy a new jacket when i took out the needle and thread he was very confused
that they must be paying me too much because i wore a designer jacket from a name his wife liked i told him to tell his wife they had sales good sales too off was organisation shutting down do so low risk
my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars
youve really never been on vacation i cant imagine not having my yearly trip some people grow up low income emily
you can t afford it why don t you just ask your parents to buy it for you
why don t you just wait until you can inherit your parents house you mean the house that is my parent s retirement fund the one they re planning on selling in order to retire because this country has been fucked and they have no other options yeah sure i ll just sit on my hands and wait for my parents to die so i the middle child of five kids can get their house cool
the owner of the pool supply company i worked for was looking at gold coins on a website on the computer i used to sell swimming pool parts online i was on my lunch break so it was no big deal he pointed to a solid gold coin that was being sold for i admired it saying it looked nice he turned his head to look at me and said as if it was perfectly reasonable there s two of them want me to put you down for the other one i was making an hour and only working part time like i could afford to throw down that sort of cabbage on a fuckin coin
i was at a table full of wealthy people in boston where they all lamented about how difficult the upkeep on their second and third houses was this is while i can barely rent place
not my story but my best friends he was at work and got a call from his boss who had been out to lunch so he answers and his boss goes so i just tried to use my card to pay for lunch and the machine said insufficient funds what does that mean this boss was about and came from a very rich family and had never had the problem of running out of money my bestie who grew up in housing commission and had worked his ass off to get to where he was had to very calmly explain that it meant there wasn t any money left on that card the reply oh whatever i ll just pay in cash to the server can you break hundreds
my sister who just bought a 2mil house with her husband and previously has told me they never need to work again was complaining about her nanny taking advantage of them and said it s not like we re rich do you not know

money has no value in life a multimillionaire owning real estates across the country
wasn t said to me but by my client in the back i was a chauffeur felt like pulling over we can get the executives another million but we d have to throw the employees under the bus

when i was a cashier at a high end grocery store we were giving out next visit coupons to people who spent or more one wealthy couple who spent close a grand refused the coupon it was a weird attitude
why don t you just move to sf and buy a condo here too lol with what money sir
i don t understand why poor people can t just work harder and become rich like me money can t buy happiness but it sure can buy a lot of things that make you happy i don t care about politics i just want to make more money and enjoy my life why should i pay more taxes i earned my money fair and square and i don t owe anything to society i don t see any problem with income inequality if someone is rich it s because they deserve it
you don t understand i had all my money in stocks and i lived off the dividends now i m going to have to get a job a lady complaining about the stock market crash while we were getting our oil changed at a jiffy lube i was so shocked with my two job working self i just stared at her with a blank expression and said nothing
why don t we get another boat for our lake house this summer it s just money
i m a university professor and years ago we had a really fancy fundraiser event to open a whole new building with a bunch of very rich people at a reception and concert faculty members were there to mingle and make connections dressed much more nicely than we do normally as staff employees mainly student workers in uniform wandered through the crowd serving drinks and finger food so there i am in a nice suit in a group conversation and this woman in a fancy gown turns to me as says would you please get me glass of champagne to which i reply with all friendliness because this is embarrassing right oh i m sorry i m not event staff i m a member of the faculty to which she replies oh i know would you get me that champagne that s the day i learned that to the truly wealthy all the rest of us are servants who have to work for a living dirty filthy work and since we re workers we do all the work all the time they don t work at all they re rich x200b i did not go get the glass of champagne
bold of you to assume rich people talk to me
ew you groom your horses and pick their hooves why doesn t your groom ma am i just shoveled stalls clean and paddocks as well as groomed and tacked horses for lessons then training i am the groom barn bitch
this isn t as serious as the other ones but it made me realize that we live in separate universes we went in a hotpot place and we had to cook the meat on the hotplate and this girl i know picks up this half cooked piece of meat and eat it she looks at the hotplate confused after a while i place my piece of meat on the hotplate wait a couple of minutes and then turn it on the other side she looked at me like i was the greatest genius on earth and exclaimed omg that s why my piece was half cooked i didn t know we had to turn it on the other side that meant that not only she never cooked but also she never watched anyone cooking we discovered later that her family has a personal cook in their mansion
back in college this freshman couldn t understand why i didn t have a favorite golf course to play like you don t like golf or like you don t like have a fave i mean my credit score can t survive this conversation

a flock of seagulls
both bangers from an otherwise non existent band
i ll give them like tops
now wait just a darn minute
they definitely had more hits to this day i hear more than different pink floyd songs on radio rotation regardless of ones opinion on music it s a hit if it s still frequently being played multiple decades later
good choice
bananarama definitely had more than two hits https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bananarama_discography#singles).
a ha def had more than two hits https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a-ha_discography#singles).
they had top hits and top songs the question is about hits not properly remembered
alright that s fair lol
but they only had two singles make the chart in the uk all their albums made the chart but how many dj s play a whole album the only one that i know who did was dixie peach on his midnight runner show and that was not every week so in one way they did have only two hits not my fault i interpreted the question differently than the poser intended
i stand corrected
i mean at that point any bands almost a two hit wonder because the whole album isn t stellar there s tons of super famous bands held in high regard that release garbage on garbage but they have or good songs everyone remembers also didn t know they only reached the charts twice in the uk they must have been more popular here across the pond

welcome to the jungle
confident by demi levado
my wife
i can drop people entirely out of my life without batting an eyelid it s a gift i m way too good at goodbyes
i m my own target audience for jokes sometimes i crack myself up when i m home alone no gods no masters just bootstrapping laughs
i ve got some interesting hobbies
i hate no one
my favorite thing about myself is my determination
i m very passionate about things i m interested in and that excitement is contagious without trying i ve gotten people to buy game consoles and games i love just by talking about them at one point talking about ferrets made a coworker adopt one who i ended up keeping when she realized it wasn t for her have inspired my husband to learn an instrument etc it d seem like i could be a great salesperson but this excitement is only with areas of interest asperger s so it is not marketable
a lot of people have told me that i am one of the nicest person they ve ever met i appreciate it i just need to know how to use this for good so that i can truly help people and not be a doormat
my eccentricity
my ass is fat and i m always right
i know self defense and i can play the bass guitar
i m pretty good at sitting
sometimes i can be kinda funny
intelligent
my penis
my realism or pessimism about the same
i can play multiple instruments
my main form of expression self healing is music i ll try to have an emotional conversation with my so but my brain shuts down and i can barely form coherent sentences it s a byproduct of my adhd my mind shuts down when it gets too overstimulated so i ll go play guitar for a bit and come back with a song that perfectly explains how i m feeling i m not sure why it s easier to translate my overwhelming jumbled emotions into lyrics easier than simple sentences but i m glad i figured out this method because it definitely saved my relationship
nothing
my empathy
my genius level intelligence massive dong and my humility
i have a great beard
i care deeply for people around me and in addition to this i m always there for people sometimes it makes me feel like i m a good friend and person
honestly everything
i know how to really enjoy a glass of water or grocery shopping or doing the laundry
that i try
my eyes probably
that i am grimm i mean what more can you want
i tried taking a picture of me it didn t work out so well it didn t work at all it sucked and now i can t fix the image and it stuck as this
i m good at getting interested in other people
my brown hair
my eyes
my hair color years ago i really wished my hair was a noticeable dark brown color but i ve accepted the fact that my hair will always be black
that i am willing to help others before myself
i have a no bs attitude
i am a really good mom wife and friend i am so proud of the relationships i have and how i take care of the people i love i am a terrible daughter though to be honest
i m like a golden retriever cause always making people happy and i m just a joy to be around as some people say and i m a kid fav at church since i can make balloon animals
uhm i was able to successfully court misses milo against all odds and the system being against it with no xp now she s my girlfriend and we re happy together
i m confident and know that i m honestly beautiful person that still makes mistakes
that no matter what i will not stop chasing my dream to become a famous guitarist
i m not a quitter
i can start a conversation with anyone easily
that i am easy to talk to
my hair it goes past my hip i ve been growing it out for over years
my hands beaten and scarred but they tell a story a tale of projects started and finished each nick and scratch illustrating a motion sliding across cold steel or brushing against a tool still warm from use
my sense of adventure
all
my ability to not cry during sad things like the end of the mugen train arc in demon slayer
she obviously has eyes on your account
same tbh made the mistake of openly admitting it once it freaked that friend out for years apparently and made em assume things about our relationship that were never actually there never again man never again we just play it close to the chest and walk away when the time comes
like what
passion is key in life its an incredible feeling to be able to get such joy and happiness out of something you re friends are lucky to have you in their lives
you are literally the best kind of person full literal on the literally
i kept thinking of myself when reading this although i have adhd and not asperger s i tend to get carried away in my excitement when talking about space music or other fixations and i enjoy learning so i have a lot of info to dump on people about those specific topics lol
we need more folks like you the universe always provides plenty of opportunity to help others just gotta keep your eyes open value yourself and others will follow
now i m just imagining self defense techniques involving bass guitars
i m sure it s a very handsome penis
i m glad you found that for yourself my friend may your gift continue to serve you well and provide healing when needed
i hope you find something soon bud we all deserve to see the best version of ourselves but chin up my friend an internet stranger loves you
that s an incredibly important life skill to have i ve always felt the world needs more empathy that would solve a lot of problems i think
that s because you are a good person people like you are the reason why people like me are still around those who can show love unabashedly and aren t ashamed to admit it are my kinda people much love
love the confidence
she does but my answer is still valid if you want a backup answer then it s my moustache
thanks i appreciate that
anytime dude
years ago or so been a hot minute life sucks
it s been a while
eating a good sandwich yesterday
before covid hit and fucked everything up
when i believed the everyone was good and that it would turn out ok lol
about mins ago
80s and 90s were alright been downhill for a long time
pre
right before i turned my vibrator off lol jk whenever i dance is probably the true answer
the summer when pokemongo came out i think that was the closest we ll ever get to world peace
dec to 10pm
probably months ago but its slowly getting better
i feel that can you pin point where it turned ive been struggling with that
must of been a good ass sandwich
what happened
elaborate
not really just the general knowledge that nothing i do will ever matter and there is no point in life wow all this stress and annoyance for what to die at the end or at any given moment yeah i m just waiting my time out
yeah it slaps bc i used to pay like for one and now i have finessed it at home
i gotta know what kinda sandwich we working with i could use some dopamine
baby boomers got the nickname obviously post war baby boom the boomers didn t know what to think of us the next generation so they called us generation x after that it was boring gen y millennials gen z and now the alphabet starts over and gets a greek upgrade gen alpha
there s an old hermit who lives at the top of a tree they go describe a generation to him and he names them you have to bring him some bullshit herb first it s a whole thing
generations are named based on shared characteristics and cultural movements it is a way to categorize and understand social phenomena
people just choose random shit like my theory is the next generation will be called generation reddit
newest are gen alpha next one will most likely beta if not gen burger
overtime a names are proposed accepted and discarded until one name gains enough cachet
most generation x people i know prefer to be called 80s kids
this is the most accurate answer i think people forget that seriously naming generations is an american based thing that s fairly new started with the baby boomers and could eventually just lose steam
welcome to gen burger can i take your order
didn t it start in the 1920s with the lost generation
they were named sometime later and no generational monickers followed them baby boomers were named while their generation was still the current one making waves and kicked off the trend of each generation having a moniker

the quirky little things we use to laugh at now bother the hell out of us
ehh for me she didn t live with me till she married me and i learned a lot of how much of a slob she was and gross things i never wanted to see or hear on a daily basis i think i enjoyed just dating her and having seperate living spaces i don t like sleeping with her in the same bed i don t like hearing her eat and up until last year she was peeing with the door open and heard her pee and that grosses me out too soo yah i m just not a fan of moving in with other adults i prefer to just date and plan things together no sleeping over no living together but it s way too late for that now been married years and no there wasn t any kind of honeymoon period i think that kind of stuff is disney fantasy crap wife and i went to mallorca island for our honeymoon and it was great but there wasn t some kind of super love period after getting married just normal adults planning out future toghether and enjoying our dates and cuddles
there s an adjustment period when it ends it can take some people longer than others to get back to normal and process feelings but it eventually gets better and you remember how amazing it is to be free
sore if it s good

to stay updated on their posts and activities
not sure it s far better to follow people in the street
i dunno but i disabled the option for people to follow me on reddit feels kinda creepy lol
none
as far as i can tell it s a way to get them to go to your of
easier to stalk
it used to make more sense before reddit exploded with new users places like ask reddit had familiar faces that you d see everywhere you d interact with them enough to recognize the others account on site and even get to know them a bit it just made it easier to spot them in thread now that there are so many users here this is far less likely to occur for other kind of novelty accounts or just content creator oriented accounts you could follow and see them in the friends tab
i follow people on pages like nosleep only to keep track of stories that i really enjoy and once that series is over i unfollow them
input
imaginary internet points for them
sometimes i follow people only because of their cool pfp usernames
to stay up to date when they post nudes
bots doing bot things
seriously if i wanted followers on reddit id make a public sub
wanting to keep track of someone s series of posts then forgetting about it the next hour
it s like a subreddit but only for that one person maybe they re entertaining but of the time it s done ironically or used by bots
to see how the world works
there are people here that are much smarter than me and much better at what they do i often use them as inspiration and following them is a nice way to do that edit following someone is also a nice way to let them know that you are interested in their work and you like what they do i am by no means trying to collect followers for clout or whatever but it s always nice to see that someone followed me
the point of following me is seeing my new pics
didn t know that was possible thank you for bringing that up
done and done thanks again

europe during the black plague
from what i hear year was pretty bad major volcanic event subsequent lack of sunlight caused a global shift in climate and created a drought
depends on the color of your skin and ethnic background this answer isn t one size fits all
the black death pandemic in europe
a jewish person during ww2 would be rough the concentration camps were horrible worse stuff probably happened that s not known
pompei when vesuvius erupted
germany
for me it ll be holocaust even tho jews always had someone or something killing them for no reason
the big bang
have you heard of vlad the impaler
jewish male born in warsaw around
pompei enough said
pompeii in october of 79ad
it was december when the imperial japanese navy air service launched a military strike on pearl harbor honolulu my father was years old in and living in new york city like everyone else he was shocked when he learned about the bombing of pearl harbor
today
five minutes ago the world cannot be unfucked at this point
nazi germany
i think it s a tie between like the ice age and wwii germany probably my issue with times such as the ice age though is that they already lived like that things had always been like that and they knew not of comfortability and what was really tragic or harmful as it all was at the time if that makes sense so yeah probably wwii germany things were hella sucky and all of a sudden it was genocide and basically a man made armageddon hell whatever you will against one race of human no matter what type of person they actually were
probably one of the atmospheric eras where life wouldn t have been possible for more than years we all would have died from sever chronic lung disease and prolonged asphyxiation that tortured us till our slow death over years
chernobyl
i can imagine barely living through the black plague would be devastating
japanese person august nagasaki
i have to say i would take any of these times rather than be in slavery specifically in american colonial slavery but i could also say roman antiquity slavery or jewish egyptian slavery which are the other commonly known timeframes for widespread slavery the exception would be jewish in the holocaust as even though they were subject to slave labor in support of the war there is an overall elevated chance of systematic death i definitely understand some of the other answers and i think anytime in the 19th century or later gave you a better chance of decent life not marked by constant hardship food insecurity war indentured or slave labor by force low standard of living if not poverty and a number of other situations that were vastly improved with the advent of wider granting of democratic liberties the industrial revolution and closer global ties
c e seems to have kicked off a fairly shitty era a volcano caused severe global weather it snowed in the summer in europe and china crops failed starvation was rampant all over skies grew dark the late antique little ice age had begun this lasted for years into the justinian plague millions perished

europe in general did not seem like that pleasant of a place until like 1950s feels like every decade or so there would be something a disease or wars that would raze or wipe a good chunk of the continent
that s a good one didn t even think of that
came here just to write this
good answer
i think if you were a regular nazi supporting german who hadn t been conscripted life would ve been pretty good at this point
why would that matter
i don t think you got the question
they were shadows of themselves after that
pretty much i mean life would have been pretty shit for you post ww2 unless you grew tired of nazism
i m actually pretty sure they did answer correctly tho
december in pearl harbor was the worst time and place in human history to be alive
not wanting kids
i m broke
they re expensive i worry my mental illness and temper would fuck them up
as of this morning a vasectomy
since i first gained comprehension of my existence there has been only horror
career
finishing education first get a stable life financially and mentally and most important finding the right person i could see myself with so it ll probably take some years before i ever will consider becoming a father
no confidence and i don t like most people
the cost of ivf
birth control
not ready yet still figuring out my goals
no titties

my own internal struggles i need as much attention on myself to get a handle on those before all of my attention on me is taken away and redirected on not only a relationship but a child if not i wouldn t be very effective for either
money back in the day when most people would have kids and it wasn t ever a priority for me or my wife now money isn t that big of an issue thanks to selecting the non breeder option
i don t like children and i can t afford it
a complete lack of interest
i work with children hours a week with parents that let them run wild and give no discipline
age will never want them anyways edit forgot to mention i m also single
i m disabled and would pass it to my kid i can t afford to care for a disabled kid i have very little patience for children i value my time freedom and possessions medical care is too expensive both for having a baby and getting treatment for said baby or me the school system in the us is crap and my child wouldn t get the necessary accommodations without me fighting for it my partner has a family history of diabetes and colon cancer pregnancy absolutely destroys a woman s body too much responsibility and i just don t want to
im
after my mistress tore my dick off for being a disobedient motherfucker
common sense
common sense
my kids died
i don t want to do the work be stuck with someone i might break up with it s my money thinking you have a legacy is laughable i don t care about what happens to the planet now forget when i m not using it
planning
birth control
how being pregnant and giving birth can be life or death for woman another reason i don t want to be pregnant or have kids is because of how it can affect your body and mental health
generational trauma lol also i just value my sleep
i tutor k12 kids don t get me wrong i love my job but kids are gross they spread all sorts of diseases they re expensive and they have the annoying habit of reflecting their parents the last thing i want is a gross mini me making my life worse
lack of financial stability inability to find a partner
i d have to let someone in my life first
never yearned for it in my spirit would have impregnated some of my harum just to secure the bond with them moreso than for the spawn the one i married didn t want critters either the soul mates either weren t fertile enough to take or my boys couldn t swim never bothered with protection much maybe i m lucky i didn t get stuck on a family scene now i wonder how old i can get before firing blanks or mis matching with them child bearing age wamen
quality of life is consistantly decreasing with newer generations and climate change is about to kick the human race in the dick i don t want to have a kid if i can t reasonably garuntee that they ll have as good or better of a life then i did
there s too much i want to do
i m just not ready me and my bf have spoken about it but we re broke as and just couldn t handle it rn
too expensive too much work and i don t even like kids so it d be a hard sell even if they were cheap and easy
infertility
seeing other people deal with parenting
can t wrap my head around the ethical implications of making a human being
i ve never wanted to have kids
latex
life is already stressful enlugh as it is having kids would certainly double that
i have very similar reasons nice to know i m not the only one
congrats

so early s i got in a lot of arguments with the people who would grow to be todays trump supporting anti vaxxers once you get them backed in a corner in an argument they turn to insults and inevitably the phrase you are literally hitler would be thrown out in response to being pro choice after a while i took it as a badge of honor because it was practically their death cry so i decided to wear it like one and it still works to this day every time i post something that is logically sound and cannot be argued against i get user name checks out i have received this over times and everyone thinks they are being original about it and hurting my feelings but it just makes me smile
my mum s scottish and my baby has the nickname bean

i m now so it s been sooooo long but back in high school i was writing a story as many do one of the characters was going to be the master of the claymorb a claymore sized sword with orbs attacked to the hilt which the wielder would be able to manipulate psychically to be able to attack and defend between slashes in my mind it was a way to compensate for the delay between slow slashes of a big sword and while thinking of that story i made an account and bam it just stuck claymorb or claymorbmaster have been my name ever since
literally just a nickname someone gave me in public school without the vowels super low effort on my part
i came up with it today favourite plant and one of the name recommendations mixed and i m already regretting it

a quiz i took a while back the wording was very funny that it just became a username
i like owls and my nickname in high school was happy meal for non dirty reasons in case you were wondering
loosely based on song lyrics and i d change it i was too hasty
leetspeek for elite cause i was a tween
first book i ever completely read at a young age was the road i was and my parents weren t very pleased i found it at a school library but the term carry ing the fire really resonated with me for those who have seen the movie knows it takes place in a very awful post apocalyptic world but the father tells his son to carry the fire as in make moral decisions and maintain hope for the future and it s something i tell myself a lot on bad days when i ask myself why am i doing this or why is it happening i just try and remember i m carrying the fire tw if you do decide to read the book be warned their is the death of children and cannibalism and the book sometimes does not hold back
i don t come to reddit to sext men years younger than me i just like to talk about sex my username has been pretty effective
i made this account years ago i wouldn t mind changing the name to reflect who i am now

your numbers are my birthday
but how do u remember what username u created
that website said u need to be very good at reading to read my comments
how about chicken titties
you mean making a new account
can i buy some
yes
same i am very quiet so my username doesn t suit me at all hahah
he remembers the way his hand was shaped at the time of the smashing
eh
what s the success rate on your user name curious as i ve seen many versions of this
i don t even know what tap reasonable is supposed to mean
chicken thighs are better in my opinion
i didnt actually expect results but occasionally i do get some
good for suckers
if your goal is to never pay off a house i guess
housing boom
you ll be paying off a lot of interest before you get any equity
one hell of a commitment
stupid
not a good idea
depends on the intrest rate and other terms if its better than a year id take it you can still pay off your mortage early regardless of the lenght if theres a fee for paying it ofd early then yeah thats a scam
you will never have a dip in your credit score at least not even bad if your kids inherit the house as the debt is still cheaper then buying a new house especially if you have the liquidity to pay it off just choose not too
it s interesting how different societies react to things like this years is the most common in the uk but in places like germany it s not uncommon to have year mortgages that s what i was taught anyway germans feel free to correct me if i m wrong
i think it would be nice if we had reasonably priced homes so people don t need year loans simply afford a basic house to live just like auto loans when you extend them out all the sudden every new car is 45k because you can pay it off over years
either stupid or genius you re either planning to not retire until you re in your 60s 70s 80s or you are lowering your tax liability with the interest payments edit the latter is something my dad did but with a year mortgage he was able to pay it off at any time but his annual income was right on that threshold for a higher tax bracket back in the 1990s
if people could buy houses they would keep forever in their 20s then by the time they are ready to retire the house would be paid off
why meaning why years
that s a lot of interest
unless you got locked into a really good fixed interest rate it s a very bad idea to get a year term mortgage additionally year term will not be a qualified loan under cfbp rules so you re probably going to get fucked on fees and interest rates just go and ask people who got a year mortgage how much they re overpaying to get it down to an effective year term because they realized just how badly they fucked up in my view lenders who offer year terms are predatory by nature more than likely if you apply for a year term they re not going to want proof of income because they know they re going to milk you dry and eventually probably walk away with your house in short the only people who should get year term mortgages are those are savvy in their repayments and always overpay in order to give themselves a bit of a lifeline in case something happens if you pay just what you owe monthly you will pay so much more than you have to in interest
i mean it ll get paid off but you ll have paid almost double the value of the initial loan amount if you make only the minimum payments for years
almost double at current interest rates it s already more than double on a year
it ll be like jazz always practiced by those who love it but it ll never again be the megaforce that it was
rock music is alive well it has evolved but still a powerful force rockliveson
no any quick searching will show you how alive and well its doing there are a million different subgenres and a million bands in each plus some of the biggest groups touring are rock or rock adjacent bands
i think a lot of the people who think it s dead just think it s dead because they think alive rock would sound like at least a slightly updated version of 70s 80s arena rock unless they were an emo kid then they make an exception for that subgenre but either way if it s not something hardcore you can work out or mosh to into the pop label it goes
i think it s making a comeback metallica being featured on stranger things ghost going viral on tik tok
it s not at its strongest but it will always exist as a genre like jazz or country music it s lost most if not all of the rebellion edginess and ability to scare your parents but something that ubiquitous will live forever as far as any of us are concerned it isn t doing much of anything to shape culture anymore
i feel that maneskin proves that rock is alive and well
no now country music that s a different story
absolutely there s increasingly less financial incentive to learn to play an instrument since great instrument players don t become rich and famous a kid choosing to become a great guitarist in hopes of standing behind a lead singer in a rock band is such a rarity these days it s hard to imagine why a kid would ever do it what s the motivation multiply that by a few generations and nobody under is gonna care about rock music in a decade or two
yes it costs too much money too much risk it doesn t play well on social media tiktok
you think polka is dead music always lives long
not even remotely close to dead bands will always be playing rock music somewhere in the world
it s just taking a really long nap
no i don t think it s dead you d be surprised how many good bands there are that not many people know about
i mean rock bands all over europe so we good always tons of new in the uk
hip hop is on life support too it s hanging on because these mega corporations in hollywood only need one moron the rapper to make money you only need one plane ticket no musical instruments etc it s works on social media it s all marketed to children there s a similar boom in comedy right now
well metallica is putting out a new album so no
hell no i m years old and listen to the beatles elvis buddy holly led zeppelin queen chuck berry etc
this is why i love cradle of filths jesus is a cunt it still ruffles feathers
pretty sure half the reason that band is famous is because the bassist shows her breasts
still not dead either plenty of great artists like colter wall are keeping it alive
if you need financial motivation to learn to play an instrument you re not much of an artist money is hard to make in every genre of music but certain people will always find their voice through musical instruments whatever people might think playing and instrument especially keys is a super useful skill in just about every genre music that isn t a five piece rock band doesn t just materialize in a macbook human expressiveness through instruments is present in everything on billboard guitars aren t as cool as they once were but musical skill with an instrument will still get you laid and rich as fuck
how is it dead when there s rock shows going on every single night all around the world new bands starting every day people putting records out etc it s not all about being famous
a kid choosing to become a great guitarist in hopes of standing behind a lead singer in a rock band is such a rarity these days it s hard to imagine why a kid would ever do it what s the motivation multiply that by a few generations and nobody under is gonna care about rock music in a decade or two this is such a laughable take i can easily name a dozen rock bands from who premiered in the last decade and are still very popular
i mean you could just walk up to an old lady and say that and ruffle her feathers if shock value is your thing but i think your average year old parent right now is not going to be that fazed by metal from the early s no matter how edgy the subject matter
i think they re awesome and i m a straight female who doesn t care that vic isn t hung up about showing skin they re loved worldwide and it s only americans that would make that a big deal
once willie nelson decides to fade out country music should change its genre to pop alternative the legends will all be gone by that point
sure but you cold say the same thing about all sorts of art forms photography is struggling even though there are still people making money from it but it s absurd not to acknowledge it s dead compared to the life magazine days
it s being pushed into a more niche category everyday are purist still going to put that much effort into becoming a cult band maybe but that number is getting smaller everyday
name me the lead guitarists from those bands who are mainstream celebrities household name type figures
i find their music to be very middle of the road and sold mostly on their image going topless on stage isn t some random choice it s a very intentional and attention grabbing move regardless of cultural attitudes towards nudity
you haven t heard of tyler childers colter wall zach bryan whiskey myers cody jinks koe wetzel flatland cavalry sturgill simpson uncle lucious the dirty river boys and many more i m missing these guys are all active and recent just because the pop guys get played on the radio doesn t mean country is dead
why do you say that do the legends have to still be around for it to still exist
is it young kids are getting into rock every day it s not becoming smaller if anything it s rising again and yea of course people are still going to put effort into being in bands i m going to a show tonight of bands of people wouldn t care about the fact that new bands are starting all the time proves that it s not dying
you act like the lead guitarist from every popular 70s 80s 90s rock band are household names lmao rock is still just as popular as ever despite what you might think old man
when country started going pop i quit listening too many songs about love in this newer country music anyways
the original sound won t be there anymore other musicians can try to duplicate it but it never sounds the same
no it really doesn t if you want to say dead like there will never be a new rock band ever again then no it s not dead but as far as cultural relevance yeah it s dead there are basically no mainstream rock bands making hit records rock tours are all old bands virtually nobody under could name a great guitarist that s the lead man in a band kids with laptops are having infinitely more mainstream music success than kids with guitars i love magazines i love newspapers and yes they re still around people still write for them and new ones pop up once in a while but they re dead too just like rock music
oh really rock is just tearing up the billboard charts huh can t escape seeing all those rock bands all over the place damn rock and rollers taking over tik tok every twelve year old has a rock poster on their wall wtf are you talking about are you too young to know what it looked like when people actually cared about rock music
music changes and evolves the people before willie were doing something different too
ever heard of a band called turnstile young guys that are blowing up and catching a lot of attention even morons like mgk are making younger people pay attention rock tours are all old bands if all you pay attention to is the mainstream shit it s gone back underground and is thriving why does something have to be culturally relevant for it to be alive not everything has to be about being successful for it to matter
the existence of other popular music does not negate the fact that rock is still a very popular genre of music groups like greta van fleet black keys artic monkeys larkin poe white reaper and many others are keeping the genre alive
why does something have to be culturally relevant for it to be alive not everything has to be about being successful for it to matter because without cultural relevance and financial success each generation that passes does something less horse racing was nearly the biggest sport in america in the 1920s it s still around but it s safe to say it s never coming close to that level of success and that with each generation that passes it matters less rock music is headed down the same path it s not an indictment of people who still like it it s just a fact
i ll believe you when i stop seeing younger rock bands get successful not going to happen any time soon i can assure you that much
but how are you defining success surely you d acknowledge what was deemed success for a rock band in the s or s isn t attainable for a rock band now right or at least hasn t happened for a rock band in a decade
look up the band turnstile literally spent most of last year on the road playing at giant festivals like glastonbury and on tv multiple times they ve even got a song on a taco bell commercial and got nominated for a grammy or two last year is that successful enough for you
by isolating myself even more so i m never hurt or overshadowed by the rest of the group ever again it would only be effective if i lived alone
alcohol and weed yes it s effective in the moment and then it s not
mostly i try to keep music or a podcast going so i never have to be alone with my own thoughts it s moderately effective
a small pile of plushies to just sink into it helps sometimes or a body pillow
i talk to my refection in the mirror i d say it s pretty affective and helps me gather my thoughts better and more clearly
i cope it with actions toward my desire
got a cat we are good friends very effective
it s been my companion and constant guide i ve kept to myself for so long growing up that it s all i know am i lonely i don t know would i even know i just take life day by day honestly unfortunately i have no tips on how i ve been able to cope with it i just deal
hobbies it also helps being mentally fucked up because i hate people and can go weeks without human contact no problem
confidence
with how expensive owning our own place is living alone seems almost impossible these days
i m trying to stop smoking so much because of this after a while i was just making myself feel worse because i knew i was only doing it to cope and not because i enjoyed it
finally a justification to spend an ungodly amount on pillow and blankets
no i do this too dialogue in the car too
i always have three blankets on my bed i am always so cold
same i got slippers to help with the cold and i do highly recommend
i ll have to try that i normally have socks on

nicholas f n cage

ive had so many i grew up with abuse and running away is my preferred option it would just be when things got really intense physically or potentially so
when the war started
me and my brother and his family were visiting new york for a weekend about years ago went to the world trade center and all the other touristy stuff on our last night we went to a nightclub outside the city to see an old rock band it was packed like sardines in there we squeezed our way up to the front right side of the stage and was enjoying it then i looked to my side and saw something fall off the stage reached down and picked it up and it was some kind of big fireworks i put it back on the stage and then saw the black backdrop all over the back wall then looked up and the same material was all over the ceiling and other walls i showed my brother and he just said shit we both said lets get the hell out of here so we started squeezing our way back out when we got to the door we told the door people that they had fireworks onstage and it was unsafe he said it was safe and that they had already practiced the routine with the fireworks earlier that afternoon so we got in the cars and left my sister n law was bitching and pissed because that was one of her favorite bands as we were driving back to the hotel we heard the news report on the radio that the entire place had went up in flames with unknown number of fatalities me and my brother just looked at each other and didn t say a word my sister n law started doing her evangelical praise jesus routine in the back seat for saving all of us most of the time i would have had some kind of smart ass response to her but i just sat quiet and drove that was the last crowded area i went into for many years wont even go to football games anymore it did something to my brain

probably the sims it s like a virtual experiment on human behavior and social dynamics
any game made by ea is a test of how long people are willing to be fucked over
i am starting to wonder if our reality is some kind of simulation because it seems like we are in sandbox mode and someone s kid brother is screwing with the save file
