obviously there s another you on other side of mirror doing same thing
fuckin mirrors how do _they_ work
eli5 for anyone who is actually baffled light bounces off objects at the same angles objects bounce off each other the light isnt just bounced straight back out at degrees some of it is and that light is blocked by the paper as the camera person moves their head along the side of the mirror they can see the light that reflected off the side of the object and bounced off the mirror at the correct angle to hit their eyeballs tldr the broader angle lets them see the reflection of the object behind the paper edit i doodled https://imgur.com/a/vxax2wx
it s all fun and games untill you realize this brainlessly manufactured ragebait actually works and brings so much engagement everyone is gonna do it for the next days and variations of it will all end up on r facepalm
in a mirror a person can only kiss themselves on the lips neil degrasse tyson probably
the light originally travels from the mirror directly into your eyes but when you look from the side the light curves and you have been reading a bunch of nonsense and i don t know what i am talking about
it is impossible to purchase an unused mirror
i love how everybody is laughing at them like this is common knowledge and here i am with no idea how the fuck this works
for everyone asking how this works because i read it in some comments it s the perspective the part of the mirror that is covered doesn t project the image obviously because it s covered but the mirror continues to the right side and there is more mirror and there the reflection happens just from another angle i m not a physician so idk how to explain it properly edit i got corrected and didn t mean physician the other word words complicated
why is it that every time a video like this comes around i always question my intelligence every single time for a split second i think i m stupid then i remember that it s just everyone else finally realizing that stuff does things
she may be uneducated but she is not stupid just curious
there s nothing wrong with asking questions don t shame people for that
to be fair i know how it works but it still boggles my mind
mirrorologist here the mirror just knows it s how they are made the ones that don t know are identified during qa
i don t see how this is a facepalm i know i cannot actually explain how this works lol edit it s been answered extensively chill out
imma be honest i couldn t explain why but i know that is simple and not some dumb shit like this don t yell at me
i am a physics teacher all i see here is natural human curiosity and wonder cool that s exactly the kind of hmm i hope everybody gets to experience now and then
mirrorsarentreal
i m convinced this has something to do with computer screens people are imagining projection instead of reflection
guarantee you at least half of the idiots laughing in here couldn t actually explain how this works
im not saying its aliens but it is aliens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1kclhlg91y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1kclhlg91y) encourage people who ask questions about the world don t belittle them
i love how everyone s piling on them for being stupid and not knowing how it works when they wouldn t be able to explain the science behind it themselves whatsoever
just in case the mirror doesn t know anything so far a science has been able to determine mirrors or their constituent parts haven t yet achieved sapience while we can t rule it out completely that mirrors aren t just ignoring everyone there is no hard evidence that they are rumours that a sapient mirror is in the possession and in conversation with a medieval queen with magic apples waging war against the little people likely refers to someone suffering psychotic break as for how it works light from a source bounces off the object changing in colour and luminance this reflects off an unobstructed part of the mirror with little discernable change and enters through your creepy eye holes or camera lens to be absorbed by a sensor that records said colour and luminance values which is why it looks like it s in the evil dimension but you know it s not because the egg doesn t have a beard
the trick is to try it in the dark that way the mirror will have no idea what object you re holding s
people laugh at this but i went to school for physics and it honestly has me thinking obviously it s not shocking that mirrors work this way but actually understanding it forces you to consider exactly how a mirror works where you probably never thought much about it before i think this videos asks a super legitimate question and this would be an awesome classroom demonstration when studying the physics of light and the nature of reflection refraction i feel like if you graphed how scientifically minded people are on one axis and how cool you think this is on the other you d end up with a reverse bell curve very dumb and very knowledgeable people would find this interesting and everyone in the middle would be like ya obviously it works like that ur dumb
it s magic
i hope of the people who are following this trend are just going along with the joke but there s at least who don t know and think it s a conspiracy

i m not going to lie everyone i don t instinctively know what the fuck is going on here but i like it
this is the result of years of cutting public school funds
lol wtf is going on here
my brain cells
the magic of light waves
k i know this is logic and nothing magical and i m prob just a dumbass but i am actually having issues processing this
haha yeah what an idiot haha
i find this fascinating and no reason to make fun of these people
people calling them dumb but there s more to it than just reflection this is actually pretty hard to understand if you don t know
obviously it knows because i told it i wasn t going to be rude
no child left behind did this
ok so they don t understand but that s ok i m enjoying the fact that they re happy to have discovered something and are asking the questions that s what a curious mind is supposed to do
gif giphy dkbxo121ouie
the same magic that lets a thermos know if it is to keep the drink hot or cold
well now i feel stupid too
witchcraft
i m high af and i admit i was like wtf for about minutes
like i know this isn t magical or whatever it doesn t feel uncanny or anything but my brain is so tired that it can t figure out the detailed why it works damnit
the mirror is clever misdirection it s actually done with magnets
teacher did experiment in class nobody paid attention they put it on tiktok everyone looses their mind
i m not ashamed to admit i did have to think for a few seconds
it s because of the reflection of light bending at the angle of the fuck it magic it s magic
i m not a very smart man but i have come to realize that a lot of people are just dumb and in comparison i feel like a damn genius
it s simple quantum mechanics they don t teach it in high school but i learned about it in advanced quantum physics in college the mirror actually generates a worm hole in the 4th dimension that lets it see around 3d objects i d draw a diagram but it s hard to draw 4d diagrams as a 2d image
it is actually nature s own real time ray tracing and it does it for free unlike some greedy hardware companies
this is shit a toddler would be confused by
this is how we get flat earthers and 5g conspiracy theorists
i m dumb because i kept swiping for
mamma says the mirror is the devil
obviously it s because mirrors are made out of painting glass with mercury and mercury was used as a miracle drug that gives immortality sometimes even called the philosopher s stone or elixir
just did this to my year old he explained that it s because you are holding your head close to the mirror he didn t use those words but basically said that bottom line he s not a fucking idiot
okay but can someone actually explain it scientifically
this is why i lost any hope for humanity
as education gets worse we will start seeing these kind of shocking discoveries more and more soon people will start saying the earth is flat and the sun is a flashlight oh wait
how does the mirror know has me in stitches
light how does it work it s a wave and a particle
light doesn t always bounce of mirrors perpendicularly
i do understand why it happens but being high this made zone out for a second
i will admit to feeling confounded for about seconds on the egg
aliens
yeah mirror are not a screen with a camera light will reflect from a tight angle going to your eyes camera making the paper not blocking it like let s say side view mirrors in the car that you see everyday
non artificial intelligence nai that s how
how did we become dumber i don t understand
down vote this for stupidity
sigh
it also flips things vertically but not horizontally
me haha idiots also me has no idea how simple physics works
i m embaressed with the time it took for me to realize what s going on but tryin to explain the mirror reflects light so it s bounces from the object to the mirror in the side then to your eyes without needing to pass for the mirror behind or to explain with the same words in the video the mirror behind the paper don t know the object is there but the mirror on the sides know
it only works with big mirrors because they have more superpowers than say paper sized mirrors
it s magnets obviously i don t understand magnets and i don t understand this this is magnets
this should be on r woahdude because if you were stoned it would be funny terrifying mind blowing
just idiots doing idiot things because they re idiots archer
if you read this far down try using a box lit or even take the paper and fold all edges inch or so then fold them up to make what appears to be a box try it again you will find that the edges that are folded up block the view of the mirror a mirror is like our eyes a mirror has peripheral vision hope that helps
geometry it s taught i schools still right
isn t it all about light and how it bends from your eyes to the mirror or something i m not a scientist so i can t explain it properly lol
i m confused as to how they re confused
these people voted for the most popular president of all time i guarantee it
uhh i just woke up and ok i m done with reddit now goodbye
women
it s an optical illusion the light of the egg bounces roughly at half the distance to the egg off the mirror into your eye there is no light coming of inside the mirror
not gonna lie this shit blew my mind for about seconds then thought kicked back in lol
ah the idiocy is strong with these ones
yes keep skipping school frustrating to watch
its easier to explain how your mom dropped you on your head as a baby multiple times

the i can always tell group showing that in fact they never can
gif giphy r51a8oah7kwbs my response to anyone who believes this lie about this woman she s currently pregnant you fucking morons
it s a bad picture and the blonde hair doesn t help her any but she s not bad looking in other pictures
i mean if they want to try to body shame and say that she looks like a guy then what on earth do they think about marjorie taylor greene
that s a very unflattering and purposefully chosen picture she s actually quite pretty imo https://i.imgur.com/yr4bcf9.jpg
if this photo proves anything it s that anyone can have a bad picture taken of them she normally looks very pretty to me
this is extra stupid because erin darke is a famous actress who met radcliffe when they did the movie kill your darlings together
these hate filled scared people just can t exist without shitting on others just trying to live their lives i don t know how people exist in an echo chamber of angry fear
now i am confused isn t their one joke about how a man can t get pregnant now they are trying to say that the alleged man is pregnant which is it oh wait there is a group of people who know they are hypocrites and all they want is power those people must be from that group
he s if being taller than daniel radcliffe makes you trans then half of america is married to a dude
she is very pretty it is was just not great picture if you sort though pictures taken a night you are going to find one that is not the best this is just mean spirited bullshit
i ll be you could show the same people a hot trans woman and they ll bet money on it being a cis woman
that is fucked up she because she isn t their idea of pretty they imply she is trans edit looking this woman up shit is hot they picked a terrible pic
tell me again why it should matter to anyone but daniel radcliffe who daniel radcliffe is dating
the we can always tell crowd proving once again that they have no fucking clue
imagine being mad at someone else s relationship when it has no impact at all on you
this is one of the many things i hate about terfs they accuse any masculine looking woman as being trans which is harmful for multiple reasons i saw a tiktok of a woman with short hair being harassed and being accused of being a man because she went into a woman s bathroom
and this is anyone s business how
transphobia hurts everyone not just trans women and men
counterpoint who the fuck cares daniel and erin are happy and they re having a baby these people need to grow up
how would a trans woman manage to get pregnant
the real facepalm here is why anyone even gives a shit who daniel radcliffe is dating man woman trans gelatinous blob of effervescent ouze it s literally got nothing to do with anyone who he decides to fuck people simply need to get a fucking life
there s a maggot that likes to post michelle obama has a penis on random community groups on fb for the last years without fail the last few years he has been obsessively posting anti trans shite and wonders why he is bombarded with pics and news about trans folks despite multiple people explaining to him how algorithms work
i thought the joke was because she s taller than him
hey guys let s remember that it s not helpful to say how she s so beautiful and could never be trans it s okay to be trans being trans is not an insult the issue is that they are trying to weaponize transness and therefore making it a bad thing by saying it s insulting to her looks you re just calling trans people unattractive or to say other ugly disgusting women mtg is prob trans then you re again equating trans to being bad which is exactly what these conservative losers are doing
even if she was trans who gives a shit
why people so mean why rain on someone s parade every time they enjoy happiness geez
if she was trans but wasn t shouting it from the rooftops this would be incredibly hurtful outing her like that as it is it s just super rude
are they really austin powersing harry potter s girlfriend bigots it s a man baby hp she s pregnant bigots doubling down well i mean she does look rather mannish if this is a computer simulation can the players please load an earlier save game and try again
everyone here is all like this is just a bad picture she s actually very pretty as if she looks ugly in this photo lmao
that is just a very unfortunate picture of her plus she does not look good as a blonde i don t get why anyone cares if she s trans or not
this is just becoming misogyny
that sort of horrible talk is only done to hurt people the damage you can do to someone self esteem is terrifying beautiful young lady really hope they get some privacy for birth
another example of transphobia being misogyny with extra steps oh you don t look how i think a woman should look well you re not a woman then
it always makes me sad that gorgeous women horrid men consider ugly get called trans as an insult i would literally do anything to look like her lol
seems calling someone trans who isn t trans is like saying their ugly ain t first time i heard something like this
mf i ve been called a guy in public while wearing a skirt and fishnets all because i had a shaved head spoiler alert i was months pregnant definitely not a guy people are just weird transphobic
i see two people that i don t personally know and whose lives i have no business in
the poor dear social media has everyone seeing trans people in their cereal each morning it s an epidemic
weird ain t it the people who most whine about how transgender people shouldn t exist are quick to call people the opposite gender just because they don t fit their preconcieved notion of a gender they gotta pick a lane already
and this is exatly why daniel radcliff is always flying way under the radar leave him and the poor girl tf alone
what do you see well uh daniel radcliffe s girlfriend imagine a world where every girl or woman who doesn t fit the perfect beauty standards of someone gets labeled as trans it s like short haired pixies being called lesbian just from her short hair the homo sapiens truly is a homo ignorans
now what do i see i see absolutely nothing wrong
austin well she does look rather mannish basel good heavens thats my mother you re talking about
people and none of my fucking business a lesson almost everyone has forgotten
it s always funny when transphobic people say they can tell who is trans and who isn t just based on how they look then fall flat on their dumb faces
the funny thing is daniel radcliffe totally gives off a trans man vibe too
as a masculine looking woman i understand this all too well i ve been accused of being trans by older people in my community and told i ll never be a woman then they re shocked when they learn i always have been
this is so fucking disgusting in so many ways saying his girlfriend looks trans and implying that matters either way take it at face value she s his girlfriend it doesn t need to go any further than that because it doesn t matter what her birth gender was she s a woman
transphobia hurts cis people too
fuck all of you for judging and grading her looks fuck all of you for not minding your business about who other people choose to get romantically involved with fuck all of you for even giving this hate air time
you can tell most people in this thread have never known or seen a trans woman oh she looks pretty in most pics this is just a bad pic so its obvious she s not trans bitch a lot of trans women pass in most of their pics besides one or two angles i understand that it s not coming from a bad place but god damn it feels bad to read it over and over again as a trans woman trans women can be beautiful and cis women can be ugly and vice versa
a huge amount of cis women are being harassed and even physically attacked every day because some people are convinced they can spot trans people clearly this trans panic that is currently going on isn t helping anyone and it s not even based in reality since they get it wrong more often than not telling or convincing people they can fish out trans people is basically inviting them to harass women in general it empowers awful people to a crazy degree
transvestigators prove the point that gender is a social construct they be out here calling women men because they had a sharp looking chin in one photo
a reminder that anti trans ideology is wildly misogynistic and will come after cis woman who do not conform to insane standards of feminine beauty
is jkr paying for slander articles to harass a former child actor who grew up and has a voice to speak out against her actions now holy shit weaponizing the media to target a pregnant person let alone attempted to out them is incredibly fucked up what the hell bbc
they want her to be trans so they can be transphobic
terfs are unironically doing misogyny lol
the amount of transphobes in this thread trying to explain or side step for this person is disgusting also all the idiot bigots posting but she is manly are disgusting idiots
that s an awful picture of her and she still looks very female what the fuck is wrong with these dickheads when can we start culling the herd
why is everyone in each others bedrooms
she looks so different as a blonde i didn t even recognize her but this is stupid even if she was trans so what that literally doesn t affect anyone s life no one has the right to talk about other people s bodies her and dan are living their best life and are having a kids and enjoying their millions
ffs she s got strong attractive features and she s built these are stupid hate filled fools who are looking for anything at all they can work themselves up about apart from the fact that who gives a shit if she s trans she s pregnant they like to rant about biology but they sure don t understand it also it s just fucking rude to comment on someone s appearance as though you have somehow discovered something about them from a picture i wish them both well i don t know if this pic is from when her pregnancy was public but he looks so proud and happy to be with her and i just realised i myself thought i d discovered something about them from just a picture oh well at least i put a positive spin on it
this is ridiculous i am tall and manly looking but am still a woman am not insulting trans people either but you don t need to be tiny with giant tits to be a woman
why are people in this thread judging her attractiveness and looking at her other pictures you re all missing the point she doesn t need to look like your ideal attractive woman to be a woman you re not defending her like you think you are by finding her other pictures like me posting this makes a difference anyway
she is beautiful and tall er but this is what ultra conseratives do they attack if one does not perfectly conform to their own ideals it starts with trans gender and lgbtq but as you see here it won t stop there the lens will tighten and the scope of what is worthy of attack will grow and grow
even if she was trans who cares that s between the two of them
i mean she s just kinda eastern european looking and that s an unflattering shot any other picture she looks fine in
so now not being feminine enough is a problem cool
what do you see i see a fantastic bloke who doesn t feel emasculated by his girlfriend s height or other supposedly masculine features she might have i m not entirely sure what they were aiming for
the we can always tell crowd is at it again
these snowflakes need to fucking chill to the people who are upset about daniel s girlfriend possibly being trans why the actual fuck do you care what harry potter s irl girlfriend s chromosomes look like do you not have enough to do or worry about in your sad miserable pathetic lives
even if she was a trans woman it s not any of our fucking business jesus fking christ
i literally thought this was a super weird joke about how she looks a little like a female draco malfoy and was like wow bro move on that s so weird until i read the caption
bruh you just described my entire
snoggin get it right
imagine a life so boring you stay up at night worrying about who harry potter is smoochin average daily prophet reader
i mean i do i worry who all my crushes are smooching i m a little worried who you re smooching now
bro that s like half the harry potter fanfic community
i happen to know several people who back in the day would have stayed up all night thinking about who harry potter was smooching i think they re mostly over it by now but you never know
if she s pregnant probably not trans
they can always tell but pass laws to check children s privates
even better they show their racism by constantly accusing black cis women of being trans
they have true positive rate because they accuse everyone of being trans just ignore the false positive rate and they can totally always tell
lol very true people all have different body shapes and no one fits perfectly into a box it s honestly cool to see how diverse bodies are
it was always about looks
these are the same people who tried to claim michelle obama was a man
removing her pregnancy from the question entirely so what if she was trans in the first place edit this was my original comment but it seemed to be causing confusion with some people and on top of that so what if she was trans
agree the blonde hair and style of it isn t flattering here i looked her up and she s much more attractive with her natural hair color
even if she was ugly af that still doesn t make her a man lol
for a second i was like hmm ok potter we have different taste in women but i looked her up and you are right that maybe the worst picture she has ever taken
also so what if she s not conventionally attractive masculine looking cis women exist who tf cares
i can t tell is she really tall or is daniel just short
more straight people than gay people have anal sex
i m curious how she s missed the fact that anal sex is not just for gay people that being gay is not just about sex nor a choice and that some gay couples don t choose to have anal sex i could write a book on the wrongness here but i ll spare you all lol
dudes who have never had their anus penetrated are missing out the prostate is the male g spot
a male penis so they agree there s a female one cool lol
idk sometimes my shits are as big ass my dong
this woman hasn t experienced cunnilingus and it shows
says that whacky girl who s never had a dick in her ass
til there are no gay women
i love how morons like this think that anal is the only way gay men have sex
she s obviously been doing it wrong
welp that s a pretty dumb argument she s making considering where the g spot is
she has almost 2k likes too smfh so many stupid people
the male penis not to be confused with the female penis
if t be true male anus wast nev r ment to beest fucked then wherefore is male pleasure spoteth in the anus william shakespeare
so the human sex organs obviously have two functions procreation and pleasure and both work either together or separately it has no inherent meaning that takes precedence to the point you have to supress the other and it also happens that plenty of people enjoy stuff including penisis being inserted into their anus and that s perfect since plenty of people enjoy inserting stuff including their penis up there the idea that anything in nature has a special meaning is absurd there are functions but it doesn t get meaning until you apply religion
there s famously no pain related to vaginal sex
why are some people always so concerned with what other people do with their own bodies
in the words of my grandfather you re so full of shit your eyes are brown
why give people that crave attention what they are after
lesbians are okay though
i guarantee if her husband brother told her he wanted to put it in her ass she d say the bible says to submit to your husband so it s okay
shall we count the fallacies strawman anecdote through pain and torture just because some people don t like anal sex or have done it poorly sounds like the poster maybe in the past does not mean it is torture or should be painful appealing to nature thinking that vaginal sex is the most legitimate it caused this fuckwad so it clearly can t be any better and you can still climax through anal sex false cause as being gay and or having anal sex does not cause health issues as all other types of intercourse can transmit diseases please grow a brain and try again next time
significant bodily pain worst case scenario somebody needs to clip their nails it s a dick not a shovel
i mean a person can be both gay and asexual
women can be gay too
why are you reduce homosexuality in just sex relation it s about love like for heterosexual how many times you have sex in your life honeymoon and one more for having kid
i m pretty sure you can have anal sex with women as well idiots
r rareinsults
this post solos r rareinsults
i mean despite the other shit she s right anal sex without protection is a riskier form of sex that has higher probability of contracting hiv and leading to other issues the cdc recommends sexually active homosexuals to be tested yearly for hiv speficially but does not extend the same recommendation for heterosexual those who receive anal sex are up to times more likely to develop hiv none of the other shit she said makes the statement that anal sex is more risky untrue
and the obligatory https://youtu.be/ttw5a6xrj6c
we have thousands of nerve endings around the anus the prostate a few inches in and it is the perfect size and position for penetrating so i say it was definitely made for it
the male prostate would disagree
if god isn t for the gays why d he stick the male g spot up the ass
also the male g spot is the prostate so it s not only fucking stupid but wholly inaccurate
incase anyone needs to hear this anal sex is safe listen to your body if anything hurts ever stop immediately and speak with a doctor use protection plenty of lube spit will not get the job done

yet another thing i love that s bad for me geez s
wow in my 8th grade heath teacher said the same thing almost word for word she didn t say don t be gay but she said all the other stuff it didn t sound totally crazy to me at the time sadly but i ve remembered it several time over the years and i wish i could do back in time and tell her to stfu
so it s ok for her to have anal and not gay gays so anal sex is bad period you know she does anal with her rocket pocket i bet
heh this was a good one
this whole gay and trans thing is all about the baphomet and the duality of man
damn she got her ass lol
but i can still bang the mrs up the dirtbox so that s ok
laughable ignorance these crusaders talk and think about gay sex and the lurid details ten times more often and intensely than most of the people on the rainbow
my wife just said she needs to try it she needs it
what s with the wink emoji
how about eating ass

i m straight and i love anal sex she s def not wife material
i m not into butt stuff myself but i am a big fan of face holes

sounds like she has personal experience with these health issues

someone crosspost this to r murderedbywords
i think i just witnessed a murder
isn t male penis a bit redundant have you ever heard of oral sex why am i asking you are clearly not going to change your putrid pathetic mind anyway
anal sex actually does cause more issues although you don t have to be gay to have anal sex lol
i guarantee she also believes that losing your virginity is a legitimate thing and that people with vaginas are supposed to experience tearing and bleeding when it happens
yeah that s why god hid the male cum button deep inside the rectum
shit my body my choice if i wanna stick my male penis i wasn t aware of female penises i ll have to check those out in a toaster if i get the urge lmao
i hope that she knows that plenty of heterosexual couples do the back door
i mean by sheer volume of straight people vs gay because one is like exclusive to but sex
that s a reach bud
the others are lost on her but there are some hardcore religious types who do believe anal sex is wrong in general even between a man and a woman
sounds to me like her boyfriend stuck it in her butt without lube
what is crazy is there are homosexual women while they can and i am sure do utilize strap ons for anal sex i am guessing a whole lot of them don t and still find love with each other lol
this is so fucking true my first time is what turned me into a bottom there s nothing quite like it
a pgasm is the most intense thing i have ever experienced sexually
good catch in reality i think they just added male to somehow sound what they imagine is more scientific and therefore intelligent and authoritative
technically the clitoris is an undeveloped penis so yes but more technically the penis is an overdeveloped clitoris because we start as females in the womb and develop into males so to speak
exactly what i was thinking
as a female i in fact have a female penis
sometimes
so big shit or small dong
and if she has it was garbage
yeah vaggies are eweys pp all da way s
don t you know being gay means you re constantly having anal sex with every man in sight it s actually really annoying i have things i need to do today but i can t stop having gay sex
patience lube lube lube lube when in doubt more lube
i feel sorry for any dude who has never had a prostate orgasm it is transcendent
little do they know the beans are having the most butt sex
sex repulsed asexuality has nothing to do with action and everything to do with attraction
exactly
sexually active homosexuals but does not extend the same recommendation for heterosexual it s been a rather large misdirect from the cdc and right leaning politicians to pump up their anti gay propaganda heterosexual couples are still at risk of contracting hiv and should also get tested at regular intervals just because there is a vagina on one of the partners doesn t mean there isn t a possibility for anal sex for either person involved
spit can work but only if it s your only choice and you go back a lot to add more i wish when i was active i had more stuff to work with now lube is not the only thing that can be a problem
horns ouch
they are great makes me envious
the statement is probably true given that straight people outnumber gay people gay people would need to have anal sex at a rate times the straight population in order to have equal amount of people having anal sex
i don t disagree with her right to not be pro anal sex but she s not saying she s using religion to back up her statement there so i assume she s just against anal sex and being gay in general she might not have listed all of her reasons though there s not really any context to go by
they believe sex itself is wrong even between men and women it is a distasteful duty you perform to have kids that is all and they also believe it is their sacred duty to shove their beliefs down your throat if they can
yeah while they rabidly participate in anal sex because they re still virgins afterwards forgive me daddy for i have sinned or something like that
sodomy is anything not missionary position a lot of hardcore religious types have impacted our legal system
yep and i m journeying to get back what i had

as an american this seems shocking but i think this is from denmark many places outside of the us can look at the human body without sexualizing it we have a weird purity culture this kind of stuff seems inappropriate because we ve been raised to view the human body as a sexual object when it s just a natural thing we all have genitals we all have butts we all have nipples including children there s nothing gross or inappropriate about that children who are more educated about the the human body are less likely to have body image issues and are also less likely to fall victim to molestation
ohh noooo every summer on every nude beach in europe
see the thing is these busybody parents aren t obligated to let their children watch the show or participate in the show problem solved i mean for fucks sake there s already enough naked people online anyway there s a good chance that their children already know what naked adults look like anyway
the u s omg don t let our kids see a naked body also the u s totally fine with kids seeing violence on t v
stop in the name of american squeamishness
for anyone freaking out over this if you took all the mystery away and did stuff like this kids would probably grow up having a lot healthier attitude towards people
it s the human body we all have one
nudity is not really an issue you can exploit someone sexually fully clothed
daily mail nah
everybody on the planet can view a naked body anytime if they have access to a mirror we have normalised nakedness as taboo ands as a result have a massive number of societal issues including anxiety and depression eating disorders suicides low self esteem and exploitation as a result
a sex education program the children were
if you lived in a place with a functioning school system you ve seen this all in health and sex ed classes
everyone has tits and ass op
fuck all the way off mate if you think nudity is inherently sexual you have puritan brainworms
there was this great doco series when i was a kid called the human body the intro sequence was naked humans from age it was really moving
op is the facepalm there s nothing wrong with this it s just a naked body calm down
the daily heil which has a sidebar full of upskirt pictures
who the fuck actually cares everybody has a dick everybody has a vagina nobody gives a shit most of europe has no qualms with nudity maybe the united states should try this out for a little while
i m weirded out even more on why the kids are looking so damn unamused
i grew up in the netherlands in the and there were topless naked people on beaches and on tv everywhere no big deal
there s nothing wrong or harmful about nudity in fact comprehensive education about your own body is beneficial for health and wellness there is something fucked up about sexualizing all nudity
different cultures have different viewpoints on nudity it s perfectly common for children and adults of both genders to be fully nude in the same sauna here though usually not with strangers usually
the real clowns are the people who think a naked body is inherently sexual
the real facepalm here is people not realizing that other cultures are a thing
why is this a facepalm not everything is sexual sometimes bodies are just bodies and this appears to be educational americans can really be a bunch of prudish pervs
there s nothing wrong with nudity a couple of hundred years ago it was common practice to bathe in public naked and was considered suspicious if you were not
european make an educational program for teenagers who probably already seen some terrible unrealistic example on internet and now they can ask honest questions and learn about normal human body american oh the humanities think about the children proceed to ignore many states allow child marriage rapist gain custody of victims child who is very likely forced to gave birth to church leaders abuse children and good old american school shootings
nudity isn t sexual this is weird but it s not sexual fuck off with puritan cultural nonsense
there s absolutely nothing sexual about this you regarded fucking puritans
meanwhile americans are busy passing laws requiring children to be molested
the daily mail is trash can publication
i love that the comments were not what op was expecting and are instead people calling out americans being puritanical and stupid for thinking nudity is inherently sexual and not normal
it s just like in the books but in hd and with more variety
for me due to my cultural backdrop this is off putting but there are plenty of cultures places in which families bathe fully nude together so this isn t shocking elsewhere except for maybe putting it on tv
oh sure a tv show can do this but when i do i m no longer allowed within yards of a school and put on a list double standards
nudity isn t sexual context makes nudity sexual stop freaking out when you see a naked human like seriously imagine demonizing the human body
only americans are hung up on nudity we are a puritan society at heart
my uncle did the same thing at a park a few years back not for a tv show though
well given that me and my friends at would sneak out to the shed to look through his dads playboys and other pornos it wouldn t have done much to me this is strange though for sure
just as god intended really isn t that what they always argue when it comes to groups they don t like that it goes against god god didn t make adam and eve fully clothed you know they realized their nakedness after eating the apple
now imagine if one of the guys there getting a hard on
daily mail is tabloid garbage this is most likely not true
i can just talk to my children i don t need to show them naked strangers
hmm so exposing yourself to minors with extra steps and this really isn t a great look for trans people
wild that this will shock us in the usa but we can watch a dude get blown up on cable tv uncensored
gif giphy 3o6mbudzjtl8nnebae downsized
sure on tv it s okay but when i do it suddenly i m not allowed back to the nursing home funeral home farmer s market fishmonger s haberdasher wedding rehearsal dinner wedding chapel applebee s walmart kroger s dollar tree dollar general police station detective s house crosswalk gym other sexier gym dispensary candle shop edible arrangements wendy s other much sexier police station southwest flight to tahoe the vatican the hague or every diner in oklahoma and italy it s not fair
nudity is nothing to be ashamed of we came into this world that way
if you believe the daily mail you deserve what you get
why those kids look boring btw that boy be like here we go again
our country is fucked
the guy in the middle seems like he s proud of something lol
the eventual direction is to normalize pederastery
nah it s weird
it s so weird how everything is fine as long as it s being filmed
but they re not after the children
quite strange
i don t actually have an issue with this concept the kids look to be teenagers the body isn t inherently sexual they could just have the naked form in a textbook but i d be interested to see this show to understand how they are actually presenting this
wait til they find out about nudist colonies
kids shouldn t be seeing this filth on television they should be seeing it in a ymca locker room instead
it s cultural associating nudity with sexuality is cultural normalized nudity around family at the beach or for educational purposes is cultural neither is inherently evil grow up people
not full nude there are necklaces
op hasn t realized that not everyone around the world has the same view about what is explicit most european television stations show occasional nudity only in america can you watch someone get gutted by jason voorhees but you can t see the a nipple or a buttcheek when the camp counselors start bumping uglies
puritanical americans baffled and confused about education
nudity in of itself should not be sexualized it s just a human body we all have one sure this is weird but so long as nothing sexual is going on whatever
apparently one of the most effective treatments for body dysmorphia is spending time at a nudist camp seeing what real people look like and seeing them comfortable in their bodies is supposed to work quite well
wish i d gotten some sort of education like this as a kid i grew up with an unbelievable amount of shame and fear about whether or not my vulva was normal because i d only ever seen drawings it didn t help once i grew old enough and started watching porn because most of those vulvas only look a certain way we need nudity education
it s just nudity
isn t this a felony lol
what the actual fuck
wtf
reddit approved
weird to see so many people in the comments love this
the amount of people defending this on reddit is alarming to say the least
gif giphy lko1vbjlzilei
there s nothing wrong with naked people children have bodies and arent intrinsically harmed just because they saw that people have genitals grow up
body positivity is for burn victims and amputees not p dos
once upon a time literally every single person walk around butt ass nakeys
how can some of y all justify this shit it s weird
idiocracy is here and now
there is nothing inherently sexual about the naked body it s has been sexualized over the ages by christo fascists and other religious nut bars you re all fucking crazy imho who have zero self control and cloak themselves in piety while they are the ones raping children
honestly i m ok with this i wish people were more open and understanding about nudity there s a massive difference between nudity and sexuality the more you keep it hidden the more taboo it is i don t think children need to see the bits right away but seeing bodies is fine i do think that children should know what private parts are and know they aren t embarrassing but they need to be taught it s not ok for others not to touch until maturity and consent as they get older why not show them a normal human body they aren t perfect they aren t always flattering but they are human human bodies
so many comments in here thinking it s okay for adults to expose themselves to kids just seems pedo
is this kansas public access television
doesn t it all depend on the approach to the show s narrative
i dont know what is worse this or beans and toast
so these are parentless kids right
deleted
nudity isn t inherently sexual gif giphy 83qtfwkwdmseo
y all weird af
my eyes
is this on gop channel
i m ok with it as long it s your kids and not mine go for it
euros will say that americans are weird for not wanting strangers to get naked in front of their kids and then air it on tv nudity shouldn t be sexualized but the suit still odd as fuck
and yet drag queens are still the issue
it s ok because they re gender neutral

wonder what she thinks a democrat is
twenty years later i realized he was correct for once
what a shitty posts using your kids to get views smh
good idea to teach your kids to hate half the population
tbh her dad probably made jokes about disowning her if she ever turns into a democrat or some shit she s a child she shouldn t even know jack shit about politics my dad used to threaten me like that all the time if you re a liberal i ll disown you if you move to california all disown you only stopped when my mother actually disowned me for my sexuality but that s another story i feel for this little girl i don t want her to grow up like i did even this close to i still believe i m disposable that love is conditional to cry like she is i can only imagine what her parents are teaching her i hope she gets the love and respect she deserves i hope her parents aren t making her feel worthless i hate this video
just shows how the parents talk about the dems in the house haha
dad is probably your average r conservative mod
which group was supposed to be doing the brain washing
anyone gonna answer why this kid starts crying so the recorder immediately whips out the camera and start recording
i was rotating through pediatrics a while ago child had some kind of infection and was crying on and off every time he d start crying the dad would call him joe biden i was like really dude
that s so sad who let s their political views affect their lives like that their kids lives she really thinks democrat is some kind of slur gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm
because it is only grooming when the left does it
i have a feeling the daughter didn t know what democrat meant so she thought he was calling her names
this country is fucking doomed christ
political tribalists can t be good parents
these comments are weird
r kidsarefuckingstupid
definitely not a cult
am i the only one who thinks this is just r kidsarefuckingstupid
are you ok op
who the fuck just films their kid having a meltdown and thinks it s a good idea to put on social media
i don t know whether to laugh or cry
while i m sure there is a very strong political influence in the house there s also the possibility the kid doesn t know what democrat means when i was in 7th grade i called a fellow class mate a hypocrite and he told on me to the teacher the point being that although there is a definite possibility of political influence there is also a possibility that the kid just doesn t know what the word means and it s offended based on pure ignorance
so op as a kid you never used a word that you understood but others didn t as a joke your epidermis is showing without any further context you can t say that the dad did so with any malice do you know the political views of the video creator and the dad who said it have you never seen a kid getting irrationally upset by something they didn t understand do you know what conversation was had immediately following the ending of this video being filmed the real facepalm here is your comment where you feel entitled to deem these people to have their choice of childbirth dictated by someone else sounds a lot like the other side of the abortion coin to me
which overreaction is more ridiculous the little girl or op
i fucking hate it here
i hope she grows up to be a democrat just to piss off her idiot father
haha get triggered
bad parenting let s scar the child because of your political views trash people smh
i don t even wanna know how they depicted dems to her to cause such a meltdown jfc smfh
but this isn t grooming of course thats only when you teach your kids to respect gay people s
am i the only one incredibly impressed by the olympic length leaps to conclusions being made in the comments my kid once cried after asking me dad what s a human and i said you are and he started bawling his eyes out because he doesn t want to be a human suddenly these people don t deserve to be parents maybe this dad is nefariously conditioning his children to hate democrats or it was a joke gone awry either way people need to get more context before judging so harshly
r redditmoment
this is hilarious almost as funny as op
i called my sister a suburb i really thought i owned her in that mcdonalds that still allowed smoking
at this point just change the sub name to r shittingonourpoliticalenimies its been weeks since a non political post showed up from this sub on my home page smh
that s fuckin hilarious that d be hilarious if she said republican its the kid crying about being called a word not just that but the irony of the post
the partisanship in the us is just breathtaking in our country we absolutely don t give a fuck who you vote for it makes up of how we self identify we don t cry hysterically if our team doesn t win and we allow for and support minor parties and independents to be fair i just vote for who sucks the least as i dont generally trust any politician so i also find it amazing that even with this partisanship the voter turnout in the us is so low
lmao the rage in this title stay crazy reddit
christ i didn t even sort by controversial and it s already a dumpster fire
i thought reddit couldn t get any lower until i read some of the smug sanctimonious piece of shit comments on this post
such a good dad he gives compliments often
lmao coming from the side that gives agency to kids that age or younger to make gender affirming decisions right
my daughter had this exact reaction once when i called her a dirty goober she didnt know what it meant she just thought it was bad this here is innocent wholesome and hilarious
lol ok this video made me laugh
okay dad that s too far
being called republican or democrat is an insult both are useless corrupt and a living joke
that house needs drag queens stat
there s no context to this video in this post as far as i can see yet everyone assumes that this is some maga household and that democrat was used as an insult kids cry over stupid shit all the time you could make a kid cry from just saying they got two feet
lmfaooo
love how the mom just went along with it
looking at the comments right now and damn reddit really knows how to paint someone s entire life story from a second video down to some very specific details
they are literally grooming their child
liberals are groomers
indoctrination is only effective when they re young and have no means to think for themselves good job actually making your child cry by making her brainwashed by your ideals and not letting her have her own parenting
she ll grow up and never talk to dad again
i m so glad i m a democrat and so are my kids
i grew up in a house like this we d call each other liberal like it was the hardest slur known to man
people liberals taking that to seriously as if democrats don t do the sane about republicans op is an idiot
or maybe she was simply throwing a fit like kids do and he made a joke seems pretty plausible
op dramatic as fuck
so you re saying they shouldn t have kids because they re probably a political party you don t agree with what kind of logic is that
don t bother to hate we all see how she grows up after she gets an education hatred of parents and lots of therapy
if i said it the right way i m sure my kids would be upset if i called them a plarteric my point is she probably doesn t even know what a democrat is and everyone here is just assuming the worst welcome to reddit i guess
sweet child the difference between the two parties is just an illusion created by the american aristocracy to maintain a divided voting body and retain control of our society we should be waging a class war not a political war want some tator tots with ketchup to make you feel better
this whole comment section is over analyzing and over reacting this is what kids do they look at the parents facial expression when they don t understand the word and infere ideas kids also break down like this put your conservative liberal ideologies away folks the kid is going to be fine
if it was the other way around everyone would think this is hilarious
yall are way to sensitive
why shouldn t they be allowed to have kids some kids have a meltdown over just about anything you could probably replace democrat with snufflufugus and the reaction would have been the same
this shouldn t even be a post this kid is crying over something she doesn t even understand but let s overreact for political reason jfc
lmao
bruh this is funny af
dad just needs to abuse her a little more i m sure she ll eventually be emotionally scarred and mentally warped enough to become a republican
you know whats crazy if she came crying saying daddy called me a republican you all would be laughing don t join a gang be an independent voter
hell i wouldn t be surprised at the reaction if he had called her a republican
at this point anyone voting for either main party in the us is a fucking moron so i don t know why you re in here fighting each other over it
i would also be upset if someone called me a democrat
i don t know if it s just me but i want to see the before and after everyone here is automatically assuming that it s some democrat hating conservative household when it could very well be that the kid is just being dumb and doesn t understand even the mom s reaction could just be her playing along since the girl s already bawling
lighten up op you drama queen
jesus christ this comment section is embarrassing kids cry over literally everything this says nothing about the parents y all need to calm tf down
in an interview henry rollins talked about trying to ask his dad about his job he asked his dad if he was an economist but his dad thought he asked if was a communist and smacked the shit out of him
that s awesome
she must have showed compassion for someone or something
cmon it s funny live a little
thats just mean
it s not the democrats it s everyone who isn t a libertarian
i don t care what anyone says that shit is funny
i d be upset too
yeah that s clear child abuse he shouldn t have called her that
they shouldn t be allowed to have kids because kids cry over dumb shit it s not that deep why are you so upset about this

found the q house
why are people putting their children out there like this it s cruel
pfhahahah no way you re mad over this enough to post it on reddit guess what you get to raise your child however you want because you created them getcha head outta the gutter and have fun raising your non gender child im sure they will be thrilled when daddy calls them straight oh the horror
this is terrible but convincing your kids there is a santa or god is okay sure
oh shut up it s a joke there are far worse parents out there
by the time i was i knew i was a republican while we were doing a mock presidential election in class of the kids voted democratic while me and the other voted republican
lol ops comment sounds like something a democrat would say
am i the only one who thinks that this is on an ungodly level of hilarious

well that s a bit misleading they spent 50mil on an ad campaign 50mil they would have spent anyway they just themed it around their donations
domino s has raised over millon for st jude x200b plenty of companies to shit on but domino s is probably one of the worst to target
yeah just like all the youtubers
i honestly don t know what hes talking about but it makes me want pizza not from domino s though
corporate america is the public face of the that buys the laws that steals our money and strips us of our rights as human beings wearing a shirt with a brand name on it is a sign of submission to the ruling class
this shit is honestly so fucking stupid to me like who cares if they did it out of the goodness of their hearts it had a real impact on real people a hundred thousand dollars a hundred fucking thousand dollars that saved lives i mean i sure haven t given 100k to charities and neither have you its the thought that counts is a nice sentiment but in reality it s about the way your choices impact others and this had a massive positive impact
more than i gave
avoid the noid
my first thought well put
not only that the ads probably brought them in revenue anyways so really they spent less if you get my logic
right in the sea of corporate greed they choose dominoes not zillow for driving housing prices out of reach of middle class families not every grocery chain in the usa for increasing prices claiming inflation while making record profits not countless corporations for using slave labor for clothes batteries metal chocolate on and on domino s
the founder of domino s bankrolled a university whose sole purpose was to train lawyers to overturn roe v wade he s a piece of shit
all hail our generous corporate overlords the issue is they spent million dollars to flex that they gave away of that
dude must really love pizzahut

i am nearly positive this is a joke
it s clearly someone taking the absolute piss even has the everybody clapped
i had a dream i took a massive shit that looked like trump when i told my cat about it he asked me is that man jesus i said yes son a tear rolled down my eye
and everyone was clapping
this is a joke it occurred to me then that my son had never actually seen trump before that motherfucker has been on tv every goddamned day of that kid s life
i haven t been to church since i was a kid so i don t remember but are standing ovations a normal part of the sermon
the sad thing is i have customers who talk like this grown ass men i m a bartender in a firm trump county and it gets harder to go into every shift knowing i m going to be subjected to multiple come to trump jesus meetings the deifying the justifying the absolute worship is indeed alive and well in real life
the thing i never understood about these evangelist christians who keep talking about how trump is jesus is the simple fact there are millions of white christian men who do the right thing on a daily basis but idiots keep blowing smoke up trump s ass my mother knew a man who ran his church drove the church bus to pick up the elderly members of his church used tithes to keep the church up and helped those who needed it and was the very definition of a man of god who believed the word and put the needs of other above himself but no one not even himself calls him jesus trump is up to his 1000th scandal yet people honestly think he s the next coming of christ
yes son jesus cheats on his wife with a porn star jesus mocks disabled people jesus incites riots jesus has a strong dislike for people of color the big question will they mail this new jesus to a cross and let him slowly die a horrible death
putting the meth in methodist
reading things like this makes me want to vomit first off your son didn t say that second if you said this during a sermon you deserve to be excommunicated for heresy immediately this is absolutely abominable
i might have missed the part in bible about jesus paying hush money to a prostitute and being fat af
is it sad that we have gotten to the point to where this could be real and not a massive joke

oh no anyway
and there s pictures ok daily mirror
why did they take this picture
seems like a case of a friends and family discount
did he get the family discount
why tf is this on the news
and they were so embarrassed that they went to the national news sounds more like an advertisement

family discount whoop whoop

who took the picture
why is there a camera crew already there
okay but why did they put the name of the site in the title
wait 23andme is not a dating site
hey i m from next door you won t believe this i need you to take a picture
and then he immediately called mirror to see if they had a camera man and journalist in the area to take their statement s

gif giphy pn0gcv1obkr3ounc21 discount

i m taking this out of your allowance
what in the name of mississippi is this shit
did she at least offer the friends and family discount maybe he could ask for an early father s day present
i guess it just depends on wether or not she is hot
who took the photo though
so what
sounds like bs
but who took this picture
who the hell took the photo
if you like pia coladas
well did they

turns out nobody wants to practice maternal healthcare where they can be criminalized for doing so loved that
but republicans are passing laws to allow them to do genital inspections on kids for sports eligibility
no way i d be a doctor in a red state these days at least not in obgyn related fields
maternity related deaths are on the rise as well for all those pro lifers who wanted this please explain how this is pro life
between the teacher shortages and doctor exoduses red states are going to start having a hard time of course they ll probably blame the left for their problems and push even further right good stuff
idaho s plan is working less educated voters winning
my friend was asking me if i thought the usa was becoming like the handmaids tale i read the books and watched the series and she did not and at the time i thought no not possible i stand corrected i live in qubec canada and the whole country has a doctor shortage in qubec you would have to learn french i know there are million french speaking americans maybe some of them are doctors we are fiercely protective of women s rights to bodily autonomy i you don t mind snow it s worth a thought
i still can t figure out why the dems aren t screaming about this from every corner make it known the gop is the cause of doctors and nurses leaving call them out make them answer for what they re doing x200b crickets
so mothers and babies in idaho will die that s perfectly consistent with the christian right to lifers disregard for anything other than the unborn fetus because that s what jesus would do
i m more worried about the doctors who do thrive in these anti abortion states the true believers who will risk their patients health lie to cover up related deaths and force women to carry risky pregnancies all for the glory of buddy christ
from the outside it seems like republicans are deliberately trying to drive doctors and teachers away from their states places like idaho will end up like taliban afghanistan uneducated unhealthy and obsessed with enforced religious purity
wow america really being a beacon of progress and development
why does the freedom party keep passing bills that limit your freedom
sounds like the red states are gonna get what s coming to them and that s gonna be that it s a damn shame that the sane people living there have to suffer the consequences as well
you don t have to worry about having competent doctors in red states here in texas they are driving the education system into the ground so no student will get into med school just so they ll grow up and vote republican gotta love being alive
time for doctors to claim sovereign citizenship so they can t be arrested for performing abortions s
children cant die in school shooting if they aren t born america
i m pregnant in texas i found out right when i missed my cycle and called my pcm at the va the va covers maternal health care and gave me a list of providers i could choose from in the entire dfw area provider fortunately we are moving to colorado for work and school in a few months but still it s insane
as someone who looking from the outside in it s some situation like this that makes me question how america is this great place everyone should look up to and this just one many reasons at that i m very neutral when it comes to certain situations that comes out of america abortion is one of those that makes me lean very far liberal then their are other things that make me lean very far republican why do republican female cares what someone else does with their bodies if a person isn t ready for kids why are they being punished for that
i had the same reaction as most people here but somebody pointed out that this has been happening for a while now here is a study on this from titled why are obstetric units in rural hospitals closing their doors https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4946037/
i wonder what s going to happen when all the doctors stop practicing medicine in red states like what happens then when people can t get treated cause doctors are afraid of going to jail
i think it would be a total leopardsatemyface moment to watch as doctors abandon states that enact draconian bullshit over abortion why stay in a place and help people that want you to go to prison for helping someone going through pregnancy that doesn t want to be pregnant and i believe in reasonable restrictions though i don t think i m on board with weeks to me it seems like weeks would be like at least a sound decision based off of what i ve read medically and when things can be detected
they can always hire fed ex drivers to deliver them i mean they re gonna be a bit dented and a week late but i mean it got delivered didn t it
why on earth are that country so damn selfdestructive
this comment will probably get deleted but why are we not at this point just killing off these evil assholes who are making these laws quality of life in general is not getting better and the system in place isn t working either all i can think of is taking these people who are regressing our nation out of the picture forever they clearly don t care about anyone but their ideological lifestyle it seems to be the only option at this point protesting and voting isn t doing shit but a solid piece of led in their head would i am just fed up with seeing this shit and the effect it is having on everyone now especially women i don t see why these politicians should live
well that s what the voted for so ohhhh well
gop anti abortion politicians and the wealthy send their family out of state for medical care including abortions the other don t have access to healthcare and suffer yet many of these are gop trump supporters this is what happens when you get your news from fox and other alternative facts sources christian taliban don t care if the public suffers
fuck republican politicians
and the birth rates have dropped
from canada trust me a health care crisis is no joke
i m sure all those red states will be fine they have faith healers and horse medicine so they don t really need all those pesky medical professionals
lol good let the idiots who voted for that shit go without doctors and let it also be a lesson to every person in opposition who didn t go vote
idahostan
idiots voting for idiotic legislation that everybody s suffering from
very interesting thank god we have free healthcare here in new zealand and abortion is very well supported the older i get the more i realise how lucky i am to live here any american who feels they no longer relate to their country are more than welcome to come and live here we love you guys over here well as long as you re not a bigoted piece of shit but my little community has had an influx of yanks over the last months and they ve become a very well loved part of our community come on over guys no guns no where near the amount of bullshit politics free healthcare very little religion beautiful weather lovely people
the us is so fucking broken you guys need to look at the french and start doing something about it
good if they can t birth their red state babies and or mom has serious complications trying to deliver it just means fewer of these whacked out christian republicans in the future
a i will deliver all the babies now don t worry
fafo
jesus christ this country is seriously beyond fucked
it s really not so much politics don t affect me it s that i don t affect politics
if only there was a party focused on individual freedom instead of consolidating more power
this is really going to suck for people who are stuck in these backwater places and i hope they find a way out however isn t this what needs to happen radical right politicians and the people who vote for them cannot be reasoned or compromised with because their god told them so thus isn t the only way to get them to understand the consequences of their actions is to let those consequences happen play stupid games win stupid prizes it feels like the only thing we can do is fix the already existing housing and resource shortages in places that don t suck like colorado and welcome in as many refugees and they are refugees as possible that s how we win
women can just go back to giving birth in the fields like the good old days give birth wrap the baby in your skirt and keep on working if the baby or mother dies well that god s will
call me stupid but i m lost why do they stop practicing completely could they just not do abortions is delivering babies illegal too or is it now too risky
i told my wife after roe got destroyed that we are living in a real time experiment red states are the experimental group and blue states are the control group we get to watch as reproductive healthcare in republican controlled states goes down the toilet and all the repercussions on society
jfc miles imagine taking that trip while your wife is in labor or god forbid you have an actual prenatal emergency i have anxiety just thinking about it
sounds like we are gonna have states for people who don t want kids what a happy side effect for those people
aaand there goes the last little bit of healthcare for these places they really believed t rump was gonna make their lives better still waiting for that trumpcare to get rid of that commie obamacare hold your breath for it
what happens when religious chauvinistic bigot are elected to public office
when did republicans go from less taxes and less government spending to christian fundamentalists i hope a third party wins or at least prevents either side from getting to votes you pretty much gotta chose between restricting and removing different rights at this point unless you vote for the libertarian party but theyre made up of some interesting people
consequences of extreme conservative politics what could go wrong enjoy
is there any chance this will be the factor that leads to the rest of the world finally admiting that the us is a failed state didn t think so
sounds like it s only gonna affect the people who voted for this shit i used to care a lot about those people and wanted to help but since they sort of shit all over america not just on jan but trump president and supreme court shit like the news about judge thomas right now it s really hard to still care i hate that some people who didn t want this will be affected and i wish they could flee these areas like the doctors can but it s so hard to find sympathy when these people are gleeful out voting their health away here in kentucky we saw it with bevin the man ran on a single issue platform which was gutting obamacare then when he wins the gop is shocked when they lose health care given kentucky changed it s obamacare to kyconnect so they had no idea they where voting their health care away
maybe this is a new form of natural selection less red babies born successfully in red states to grow up and be part of a party that is anti humanity at every turn
good these people need to live with the consequences of their choice
maybe they ll actually think about who and what they are voting for and choose differently who am i kidding that would require self reflection and critical thought two things conservatives are incapable of doing
it is unfortunate what is happened to doctors
definition of faafo
people deserve the government they elect
so you re saying in this video that there are a lot of doctors who had been performing abortions
republican voters don t care they could lose their homes jobs health from policies enacted from the people they voted for and will still blame everyone else like democrats and minorities
abortion is murder every state should ban murder
would she be upset if the script were flipped and doctors left states for forcing them to abort on demand i know this is currently not the case but i doubt she would have any issues at all with doctors leaving who refused to provide abortions should a state mandate
i don t understand the connection delivering a baby is literally the opposite of an abortion i m not a fan of banning it but i ve never been a proponent of abortions either preferring to encourage alternatives like adoption if you can t provide for a child but on point i don t see how their connected and why they re shutting down maternal and prenatal postpartum care if the laws say you just can t abort fetuses why close down maternity wards
in case anyone doesn t know this women are perfectly capable of having babies without a doctor being involved it s not a requirement no matter how much people might believe it
going to say that the delivery doctors are not in the right iget it that you don t feel like your doing your job but there are still people who need your help in delivering a baby not just aborting one
that is a horrifying face floating over text no way am i turning on sound
i don t understand the connection how does a ban on abortion lead to doctors being sued for delivering babies or other obgyn work
don t let the door hit they them on the way out
good fuck em
citing one article that is most likely exaggerated in nature yeah awesome proof
i don t get it why would those doctors be thrown in jail i thought baby delivery and abortion were two completely different specialties
goodv fuck you killer goodbye
no it s not
brother i knew you were a loonie right when you said general healthcare was forcing someone to jab something into their skin that they did not want in them you must be great at rape arguments
op is a scrub have you met your palm
is it so hard not to do an abortion that doctors have to flee states are doctors doing abortions unconsciously
its not illegal for l d doctors to deliver babies what a stupid analysis
let s be serious here it s mostly abortion clinics
did you cry about the doctors when they fired them for not getting the covid vaccination shot or does politics not affect that
are we facepalming the fact that it s now illegal to practice obstetrics or that this women is so self centered that she has to bounce her face around all over everything so that we can t read the actual article
because liberals and sluts cannot be responsible enough to use birth control why should the tax payer fund welfare recipients abortions abuse the system and it fails
imagine leaving the health field because you can t kill babies lol
if a doctor gets butthurt cuz they shan t kill fetuses they can phuck off to somewhere else maybe they can go practice in hell and serve their master
clearly she thinks killing babies is part of maternal health
at least the babies will live
dude i live in near sandpont that s fucked
maybi no bihor
phh afford basic health care what are you rich or something
i don t support this legislation but where did people give birth before hospitals and what did they do with all the money they saved
well spoken
miles in idaho isn t that crazy
bruh the universe needs to stop shitting on us
murica
same with teachers
no way miss incredible
red states will literally become failed states the domino effect that will happen will be horrible
joke s on you i never could afford basic health care anyways

tip our slave so she can eat tonight
reminder we don t pay them so we expect you to pay them and for your food
what they re trying to do is messed up but technically the wording of that is correct wages and salary are not the same thing wait staff work for a set amount per hour not per year
another reason to eat elsewhere
remember to kick our owner in the crotch on the way out
remember we abolished slavery but not really
as an american im fed up with this fuck you you need to tip me bullshit makes me want to either tip less or not at all
remember you as the employer have the power to change that
damn eating out just gets worst and worst
this has to be the us
pay service workers a living wage
i detest the us tipping culture just pay them a living wage
maybe just maybe you pay them what their worth have the manager come over and ask for the owners number so you can call and ask the idiot what he was thinking not the staffs problem and treat them how you d want to be treated
photoshop
leave the job wtf
wait until you hear what the busser makes bussers on average make tip share a percentage of each servers tips combined so the whole day might have been good for each server getting each but the busser is taking home for a hour shift worked at olive garden and management miss managed that place hard hired too many for backup and dish pit so i got moved from those to bussing days a week you ever have to go homeless because management insists we re family here even when people quit those positions they just kept me bussing and wondered why i didn t go fast doesn t pay my bills i quit that place to go work at a dollar general but that s a different kind of shit show story needless to say fuck restaurant chains
do these owners think it s in customers power to give their employees a living wage
salary is only good with peanut butter and raisins anyway
free labor how did they pull that one off
remember that we don t pay our employees a living wage
remember our establishment is a leech on society
give us more money they told us slaves need to eat american bullshit just pay your damn employees don t expect me to do it for you i went out to eat once with my friends not your employee i don t have the extra for your theft to them
likely they wouldn t as it s an hourly position salary would be hell on a waitress salary positions like to squeeze every hour they can out of you
the business owner is a sack of dog shit for not paying his staff to work for him screw working food places and come learn a trade where you can make real money and not have to beg for it
the solution could be boycott any restaurant that refuse to pay a minimum wage to their waitress no i m french so maybe naive
they don t have a salary they have a small hourly wage this is standard in the u s i worked in restaurants throughout my teens and into my 20s i made like hr tip your servers folks they work hard for not enough
easiest way to farm karma on reddit whine about tipping
um then pay her a living wage what
that restaurant should be reported to the bbb
lets just say that tipping was made illegal now the owner has to pay the server that extra where does that money come from it comes from the patron which means you will pay more for your meal but you don t have to tip your server is going to be paid one way or another what happens if you do not tip your server in many cases and places are required to tip out the rest of the support staff the amount they have to tip out is based on their daily sales guess what happens if you stiff your server they have to pay out regardless which can mean that if you do not tip or under tip a server can work an entire shift and go home with less money than they arrived with you can be as outraged as you want fight the power you go dude you are going to end up paying one way or another that is of course you decide to stand on your righteousness and end up taking food out of your server s mouth
top tip is to not tip
next time i go to a restaurant i will not give a tip they didn t pay their cooks why they didn t pay the waitress when you go to subway or macdonald you don t add any tips things need to change
that s cool and all but it s not my responsibility to tip you money for doing your job of serving the food i already had to pay money for
they re using heartland as their pos system probably bleeding the restaurant dry with fees so they can t pay salary to the servers
there s a lot of people that never waited tables in this thread gimme tip or gimme dearh
tips are dumb fuck tip culture
i never tip ever eeeeevvvveeeerr neeeeevvveeerr
dont shop eat there if this bothers you
usa greatest country on the planet
the face palm is op not knowing what a salary is lol
facepalm is posting this clearly a really bad photoshop
it s funny that the lowest suggestion is percent
waiters don t get salaries because waiters are easily replaceable by let me think literally anyone if you want good money get a good job that s how the system works just ask yourself could a monkey replace you at your job if the answer is yes then you probably also do not get a salary or very good pay either
perfect they don t have a salary which means they are hourly and entitled to making time and a half on overtime i m salary which means i work up to hours a week with a fixed income please tip your salary employees
it needs an american flag waving in the background
these place should never be frequented by anyone they probably pool the tips including the owners
is this what they mean by humble bragging
remember that we re using your empathy and compassion to line our own pockets
i ve said it before and i ll say it again it s easier to destroy the system than to change it
who the fuck pays the waitress name the damn places so people avoid that shit
same people who will complain about their food order taking too long or not getting ketchup as soon as they asked for it
i have always tipped ok but i think it s something that shouldn t happen it s your job and they should be paying you for it
remember we have a business model that includes free labor so don t forget to tip your waitress
wow
i thought slavery was illegal
r trashy
sounds like a you problem
i d write remember your waiters work for the establishment not the establishment patrons
they should have a liveable hourly wage even if it s hour plus tips isn t grand but definitely can help them float if they had a bad tip night anyone who works for tips has had those super crappy nights
i don t have a salary either but i get reimbursed fairly for the hours i work pay the employees just cipher it into the cost of doing business and price your wares and services accordingly that s how most of the rest of the world does it
since when do you have to give a tip
is that even legal
and that s our fault
remember your customers don t have any money thanks for feeding us
she should remember that and service the hell out of the customers
we really need to get rid of that and just pay the same waiters and waitresses no one can live off of just tips
gif giphy d3odaktglptbc
glad i have plenty of great food trucks in the area this bullshit isn t part of the deal
im seeing this more and more on receipts now it used to be and but now its more like and
i m from australia we don t tip you should be revolting instead for wage theft take a good hard look what the french are doing organise and refuse to pick up rubbish outside washington stop the entire fucking country till they realise you re not interested in working for free
when i do go out to eat i tip well but i barely go out to eat anymore because the prices are absurd i went to dinner last night by myself and had two glasses of wine and a salad the bill was bucks and i tipped dollars for that is absurd where i live so i mostly eat at home
then give them some why do we need to know this
maybe pay one then how is this even legal you should still receive a base pay cheque and tips are additional
so what are they working for definitely not you if you re not giving them a salary sounds like slavery do they know you re not supposed to say the quiet part out loud
remember this establishment employs slave labor to serve your meal instead of the company actually paying their employees fairly
jesus christ europeans losing there shit lol you do it one way us another why do you care most americans are perfectly fine with tipping culture relax just be happy you don t have to deal with it if you hate it so much
how about you give them a salary
you understand that pretty much no waiters waitresses have salaries right tips or not they are hourly
deleted
most waitresses would prefer tips guaranteed gives the opportunity to make far more money while if you increase their pay prices for everything go up staffing goes down
tip culture needs to end but you also have to realize you are paying their wage either way either through tips or they just bake the wage into the menu price restaurants have tried to go no tip in the past an pay living wages they failed because the dumb customer did not like the new menu prices never mind at the end of the day they were paying about the same amount so you can t completely blame restaurant owners for not wanting to take the risk of change tip culture will not end without force of law
wrong you should look up what a salary is before you make yourself look stupid again
maybe just go to the kitchen yourself like at home kinda like gas stations used to be self or full service
the best kind of correct
if an employer could pay you in a few ounces of salary in the roman empire sense they would
laughs in british just don t tip ever if enough people stop tipping their whole pay as little as we can get away with approach becomes unsustainable and they ll have to pay a liveable wage or close down
iv stopped tipping in protest american tipping culture never made sense and now that it s obligatory it s even worse i do tip if a waiter has gone above and beyond which is when i will show my gratitude for the extra labor such as if i made the mistake of not telling them no nuts and seeds and the dish has to go back because i m allergic sorry not sorry iv been a waitress and a bussperson one got tip the other bumpkiss don t accept the job if you don t like the wages offered and don t count on the charity of others to match up your wages to an actual viable level then get mad when it doesn t it s a form of gambling some waiters are addicted to the high everynight of counting the take because on the rare instance you get a good day it s generally really good but most the time it doesn t make up the difference of lost wages sure there were ways to get more tips wear red low tight blouses blond hair wigs more makeup vassaline smiles til your cheeks hurt allowing your ass to be pinched and smacked without reaction being pulled onto laps but none of those were ever worth it to me those just enforced the patriarchal misogyny that said women were to be happy happy servants edit for rare sp and look i m sorry this is unpopular but iv been in those trenches and the only way the finacial abuse of waitstaff stops is if everyone stops tipping so the management no longer has that excuse to pay us like indentured servants
if you stay at home and cook your own damn food you never have to tip at all
why don t you try working as a waiter you grown man child
a lot of restaurants don t even allow that any more the tip is literally part of the bill usually a fairly generous tip at that
tip no matter the service
most servers i know make much more than a living wage let s not pretend they don t benefit majorly from the tipping system here they re not innocent bystanders at the mercy of a cruel business practice it s mutually beneficial to both them and business owners
he has to pay federal and state minimums
so every restaurant also most servers don t want tips to go away they make more with tips than without
real wages mean happy workers guilt topping makes unhappy customers imagine walking into a restaurant having a nice meal and not have to worry how much extra money you need to pay to get out of the door without scorn that s what happens in most countries and the customers usually round up the bill anyway so it s a win win win
subway asks for tips now if you pay by credit card you get the prompt on how much you want to tip gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm
there are many people from outside the usa in this thread apparently who think that this extremely strange inhumane tip culture is complete shit me for example
i don t think it is the letters change angle very slightly with the folds in the receipt and the texture of the font matches the rest maybe i m missing something though
directed at whoever designed this receipt

op doesn t understand scientific theory or religion
op is the facepalm here
where facepalm
where s the facepalm
is this in the wrong sub message seems legit to me
just fyi religious people and scientists are not mutually exclusive
i mean
redditor when religion
some religions encourage their followers to keep seeking wisdom and knowledge not to just rely on whatever a holy book states and let that be the end all of their knowledge of reality religions also sometimes consider reality to be the handiwork of a creator god or permeated by the divine in some other sense and those forms of religion usually appreciate science and the study of nature even a holy book if read with a certain mindset could encourage the reader s curiosity instead of leading toward blind faith and closed mindedness it s also possible for a scientist to be closed minded toward certain hypotheses or theories or too attached to a certain paradigm too conservative etc
redditors when religion
ironically some of the earlier scientific breakthroughs actually came from the clergy because they were the most educated at the time and could read and write
how is this a facepalm it s completely accurate
ya except the religion book should be way smaller and the science way bigger
religion thinks it knows everything but is allegorical hearsay science realises it knows fuck loads but will never know everything isn t a facepalm but common sense
tell me you don t know anything about religion without telling me you don t know anything about religion
i m not even sure what you re mocking here religion science thinking both are exclusive someone thinking the debate can be simplified to this degree the fact it s still even a debate this is in fact not self explanatory dude
science is why you re looking at this on your phone religion is not
but doesn t that representation imply that science is greedy s
is the facepalm regarding religious scholars and science fanatics
i mean it ain t wrong science is about constantly expanding our understanding of the universe theories are constantly being disproved and updated that s what makes it great there s always more to understand and that means it ll always grow religion is here s one book that explains the beginning of everything and if you disagree you ll burn for eternity the belief that everyone who doesn t agree with you burns in hell forever makes religion kinda toxic you can disagree with someone but still respect their opinion enough to yk not say they ll burn for eternity x200b but the real reason i hate this post is because of how stupidly unaware it is you are proving why religion sucks ass despite the fact that it provides people a moral compass and a rich culture due to most likely having fairly religious parents you ve been brought up since birth and essentially gaslit into believing this stuff ya don t even know why you believe in it which is shown by the title of this post what runs through your brain is this opinion contradicts mine therefore it s stupid it s not self explanatory it s that you can t explain it prove me wrong op and explain to me why this is face palm worthy x200b tldr op is kinda really stupid
the stack on the right is much much higher
science is the new mainstream religion
people misunderstand the purpose of religion it is not to deny science or what not it is to create a moral base for the society when there was none to begin with to shape a strong community and give people something very important hope
you have never met an actual normal religious person raaaaaaaaah science is an ever changing thing and the things which happen in religion are also ever changing here s an example after the invention of gay people or the representation jesus still does mean love everyone they really don t need to explicitly state that right science is an ever changing thing where once the earth was at the centre to us being tiny and small this is a large and expansive universe where we then learned about atoms splitting and hopefully one day reproducing it all of this is thanks to the cooperation of the great minds of humanity and posts like this undermines those beliefs i do not believe in any religion but i do believe there is a higher being because you can t tell me that this was always here
the biggest problem facing science is the same problem religion itself has faced
put a plus sign in the middle
why not both
the facepalm is that op doesn t really understand religion
this is just stupid
anyone who says they know everything about religion has never opened a bible those who want to learn more about science if it is real i can respect them and encourage them but if they only learn the lies that claim to be real they could learn more truth reading comics
are you kidding me scientists are so freaking arrogant covid taught us that
except about covid questioning fauci was questioning science oh and climate science that is settled no more questioning that either anything else feel free to seek more knowledge and answers
semantics matter i believe this will be simple for some hard for some and confusing to many
it s true for some people to be a true know it all learn both
dunning kruger effect
i once met somebody that was so religious he thought thought whales ate people because of that one bible story jonah i think it was
do you know all religions that have existed and currently exist only then would this be accurate
objectively you can t know stuff using science either but you can come up with pretty good guesses
dunning kruger
what s the facepalm this meme sums it up quite nicely
replace religion with society and you ve got a dank lil meme
or efficiently
huh me confused
why is this a facepalm
this kinda leads to an interesting divergence of ideas religion really runs off faith and is driven by it while science should be purely fact based trying to compare faith to facts can be done but truly it seems facts are generally rejected in the presence of extremely strong faith even if at times they shouldn t be
or facepalm
anyone claiming they re incompatible understands neither
well you re not wrong
i know a bunch of religious nuts that only read out of the king james bible and claim they re smarter than people with advanced degrees in science and they don t have even have a basic understanding of the original languages the kjv was translated from
deleted
op is
except in islam
possibly
religious and intellectually honest scientists are another story all together though
that s not the issue the bible basically says you don t need to care about science at all if you just follow the bible you get into heaven the bible doesn t forbid science and it does contradict it in some ways the origin of man for example but that doesn t matter religion is antithesis to education in general
i know i am one
this is wisdom here
they really think that scientists can t be religious lmao
recent ones too the originator of the big bang theory was a catholic priest he was a contemporary of einstein
it s a facepalm for the people who have to deal with the religious who think they have all the answers
i have a year bible degree
i mean to be fair if you say that to a religious person they ll probably say that god is the reason you re in this earth on the first place
lol no it s the other way
no science is a method for explaining and predicting reality religion is a con to maintain control of the masses
then why do so many religious people spend all of their time only denying science
well hell is paved of good intentions like they say
you know that community and morality exist in spite of religion not because of it yeah
human decency is not derived from religion it precedes it
the invention of gay people pray tell what year did that happen of course all of this wasn t always here you can t get something out of nothing hell you weren t always here until you were conceived and squeezed out or so months later to take your first breaths indeed faith begins where knowledge and wisdom leave off as my pastor emeritus father dave l used to say back in catholic grade school but to that i add carry the lantern of your faith whatever it is at your feet and not in front of your face so you can see whatever may lay in front of you now go read something i d suggest the big bang theory concerning the birth of the known universe not the transcripts for the tv show and follow that up with the formation of the solar system
i have met religious people who are very normal but the number of fanatical nut jobs i know far exceeds the handful of sensible ones
why is this in facepalm
religion isn t compatible with science there is no evidence to support a dude who made us in his image created everything there s many more plausible theories that science has provided dude in the sky comes dead last imo
most self aware redditor
down voted for understand your mistake reddit sure is a wild place
so you re agreeing with the post then why is it here
ah i see from my perspective it seems like you re posting this here like the idea itself is a facepalm when really it makes a pretty good point
religious guy here jewish people like that are dumbasses and i think itd be wrong to say that about all religious people
religion thinks they know everything from one book science needs multiple books to know a lot we know who is the winner the difference is ignorance religion is delusion
yeah i think you meant it as the image being correct but idk where that would go not as many subs for good things
so you think
do you believe the universe was created in the big bang then
mate i m not christian i don t care what the bible does and doesn t say you made your conclusion on all religions stance on education based on one myopic viewpoint
religion is antithesis to education in general no education is often born from religion
psst the big bang theory isn t considered the best theory we all still just say big bang to not upset the smoothbrains they wouldn t understand the reality of it anyways so we sell the child s book version of cosmology to the masses so we can fund real science with dumb money
i fall in this category my family is from the fundamental baptist church
faith is different from knowing all the answers i think you re just very bigotted
oh yeah what s jesus s birthday
tell me you wasted years of your existence without telling me you wasted years of your existence
it didn t do you any good if that s the conclusion you came to about religion surely you know religion is a spectrum of beliefs
listen man you mentioned in another comment your family is ifb you say here you have a bible degree i m probably familiar with whichever ifb house of programming you went to and i m familiar with how stupid ifb thinking can be i still go to my ifb lite church basically only because my family is there but listen that s one really extreme and outside of the norm tradition the ifb are not representative of the best of christian or other religious thought i m not sure of faith not positive where my journey is going to go but a lot of important scientists have been and still are religious and a lot of really important philosophy has been explored by religious people i m not telling you to go back to the crazies i am saying though that there are religious people who aren t crazy who believe in science who care about others and who aren t poisoned by extremism that doesn t mean you need to become religious but recognize that there s a spectrum of people in religious communities and many of them have valid reasons for their faith
because christianity is the only religion in existance
that s because they are stupid fundamentally
then where s the face palm
until science government and mass media merge and you re not allowed to question anything in the name of science then it s a religion
gonna need less edge on thar
actually they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions no one has taken a position yet on the status of roads in hell
gay people were invented accidentally by thomas gay in when he was horny but couldn t find his glasses
the fact you come from a fundamental baptist family explains this the ifb is not the norm people i grew up hearing called liberal like jerry falwell and john mcarthur are extremely conservative to fundamentalist from the broader perspective
yeah dude you think there aren t fantatical nut job scientists wtf you think the nazis were or the dude who gave lsd to dolphins for years while trying to talk to them scientists have literally tortured millions of animals in pursuit to prove their theories also what an incredibly bigotted thing to say fanatics are in the vast minority of the broad propulation of religious people as they are in the broader scientific community this hatred of the faithful is extremely prejudice

why did he hang around after getting caught i think the prank is stupid but the prankster seems like a moron for chilling and continuing to film
if hes a teenager im an elderly couple waiting to be cremated
adult pretending to behave like a dumbass teenager for views there the title is fixed
i m gonna sue you old man thinking i ll show you a prank dumbass
views on the internet ain t everything man cop not at all that s not even what we were after tik tok idiot yeah sure that s not what you were after if not views what were you after then huh
he looks way too old for just a prank bro more like will do any stupid shit to someone for likes they don t see the people they prank _as_ people just internet likes
fuckin with people in a public space nowadays even a simple touch on the shoulder like that you just don t know what s coming next if you re bold enough to prank a stranger in public what s next
teenager that s a grown ass man acting like a child
actually bro that was exactly what u were after i m so sick of this tic toc culture it s gross
chasing views did not end well for this man here in va a couple days ago get your views other way folks https://www.fox29.com/news/youtube-certified-goons-creator-shot-filming-prank-virginia-mall-food-court
this is one of the rare times i get to side with seniors i m so tired of idiots doing stupid sh t like this they waste people s time and energy sometimes they need to be taught a valuable lesson
i m not a fan of pranks from people that i know i can t fully express how much i would hate these idiots bothering me i m cynical enough to doubt this video but if it were true it would make me so happy
hey yea maybe don t touch strangers y know as a general rule for life try to not touch people you don t know
no one wants to be part of your shitty prank videos find another hobby
good cant stand them play jokes on your friends not strangers
tell the judge is so good
get a job and stop wasting time trying to humiliate other people loser
yah social media outlets need to ban this type of content unless the other party involved signs off on it
imma be honest i ve seen way worse pranks just tapping a dude on the shoulder and hiding isn t nearly that bad still stop bothering people
dude you live in a world where increasingly people are carrying guns permitless carry is legal in most states now keep up your 5th grade bullshit and sooner or later you ll run into one of those paranoid armed americans
stop fucking with people
is he trying to capture a reaction from this old man and post it for internet points because he got that and then some anyone saying it was harmless were hoping for an outcome to allow this behavior to be normalized it s not taking a joke you re actually trying to saying to the old man in the video clip he s not taking your joke also if the kid was trying to eventually capitalize off this interaction why does the old man have to contribute to it if i m in public on my laptop i don t want anyone to approach me unless it has to do with the context of where we are don t invade someone s bubble because you don t know how to carry on in yours
judging by these comments i m gonna get downvoted to hell for this but both people the teenager and the older guy suck here like yeah obviously don t touch random strangers and prank culture sucks and all that jazz but apparently i stand alone in thinking the old dudes reaction was way overblown like i could never imagine getting police or freaking court involved over a stupid tap on the shoulder and hide prank if this guy is really bothering you then tell him to piss off and be done with it
who gives a fuck i hope he was prosecuted for whatever this prank shit needs to go
dude shouldn t be doing pranks trolling in a public business every right to be kicked off the property and trespassed but the elderly mam overreacted to saying he d sue him for bodily harm since he is moving around just fine after a very light shoulder tap maybe harassment if the guy did it multiple times but if it was just once there s not enough to say that it is harassment since us law says it needs to be repeated and it seems only once i doubt either claims will get far if the dude in the wrong for doing this absolutely deserves the trespass order but the lawsuit if it were going to happen wouldn t go very far
hey son it s all good no worries twelve seconds later you re going down son
news flash people don t want you messing with them this might come as a shocker to you but if you stay out of peoples personal space and leave them alone you won t get lawsuits or shot as that one person did
wow good on this old man he was like how do i teach this absolute imbecile a lesson oh i got it i ll invest my own money into making sure he knows the error of his ways by taking him to small claims court that s the real mvp more people doing these prank content channels need to get spotted by actual personal injury scammers that s a content type id actually enjoy
leave people the fuck alone
what s the prank the man doesn t know who tapped his shoulder this is fucking bizarre behavior
i ll stand high on my soapbox and say fuck every clout chaser
yeah i can t wait until yt tik tok insta pranks are seen as rolling the dice legally i hate that this clowns are just out there harassing everyone they are the most annoying people this was wasn t even bad but still it falls under the same umbrella as other more egregious examples
kids have no respect for the elderly or the personal space of others i m not old but if i m sitting in a coffee shop minding my own business i wouldn t appreciate being harassed just for your internet points and youtube views
lmao tell the judge
chasing views being a fool
people have had enough of the tik toktards and prank videos tanner cook was recent shot and nearly killed over a prank video and another idiot at a airport got someone arrested pretending to steal their luggage
good
my bad sir he s way too comfortable after disrespecting an old man
if you are pranking random people in the united states you could be shot dead i would not recommend
tik tok generation going to learn the hard way morons
i wonder what happened between cuts
other people are not your content
you gotta know your audience your audience is no one stop fucking with strangers period stop touching people without their consent and stop harassing people
gotta know your audience man also in many states its illegal to record others without their knowledge so that second where the dude didn t know he was being filmed is illegally recorded
leave people alone
pranks for views on unwilling participants need to stop it s the lowest form of view seeking
some basic shit keep your fucking hands to yourself
i wish more people would take this kind of action don t mess with people who aren t messing with you
that stupid grin needs to be wiped off his face
it is the sense of entitlement that really bothers me that you exploit other people solely for your own benefit it is a breaking of the social contract we all have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness not just you mf well played by the elder gent
fuck these kids doing shit for a laugh yea ok bullshit it was just a prank when you got caught what would it have turned into if the lady wasn t there be honest how far would he have taken his prank fuck them fuck the online i need views bullshit it needs to stop all the younger kids doing stupid videos getting in people s way for content fuck off
this is why mfrs get shot
that s a grown ass man acting like a five year old
oh the old shoulder tap prank comic gold fuckin this guy needs to grow the f up
hahahahahahhahaha good
deserves it
every cell in my body is screaming punch that human being in the face as hard as you possibly can
i can t stand people who don t respect another person s space let the man flow why mess with him literally just for views
well deserved
i hope more of these idiots get dealt with
chasing views man it s going to get you in trouble as a civilization we need to heed this cop s advice i would be curious about the aftermath of this
this is what happens when society decides that some people and certain actions don t deserve to be punched say what you want but occasionally physical retribution is absolutely deserved and these people who prank do it because they don t fear the retaliation and would be the first to sue if they got their asses beat edited for grammar and to add that i don t think this specifically deserves physical retribution but touching pranking invading personal space with the general public is not ok save that shit for your group of friends
the more this happens the less we see idiots chasing views im fine with this kid getting sued mind your own damn business
i love that the employee ratted him out right away and that his shirt says i m a naughty boy
good good this dipshit culture needs eradicated
these youtube prank people are the fucking worst
who needs common decency when internet clout is forever man fuck this kid leave folks alone
old people that hang around in fast food places have nothing to lose and all the time in the world dont mess with them lmfao source used to work at mcdunks
fucked around and found out don t mess around with old people for one you re a scumbag if you think it s funny to give them a hard time second they ve been around so long they know everybody in town so like snoop said he ain t got people with him but he s got people with him
i am glad the cop said the views part thats literally all he was looking for what a dumbass
smart fuck with someone that has a cup of degree liquid in their hand
chasing views man it s gon get you in trouble fu k and find out moment it s not worth it to harass vulnerable people just for a laugh
other people are not your content be interesting not an ass dickhead
more of these unfunny morons need to get sued
i just read about some other internet troll personality just got shot after harassing someone
good fuck that dumbass kid
more of this these people are the worst
what a brat a grown ass man acting like a yo kudos to the old guy for teaching him what the real world looks like
i think he s lucky that old man took it as well as he did you don t know how someone will react when you fuck with them he could have lost his shit and fucked them up he doesn t look too old not to give a dumb teenager a good whack round the head
share a little laugh at the expense of others in which you have no idea what he may be going through one thing i do know though props to the cop pretty legit in trying to be relatively rational about the whole situation but still had a job to do
why can t people just leave people they don t know the hell alone
mother fuckers need to learn to mind their own fucking business at all times
if that s a teenager then i m again dude looks
maybe this is super meta and the lawsuit threat is just a prank
serves em right i dunno about the personal injury but he certainly bothered him i sick of this tictok trolling for views shit and anything like it
all of this is stupid and maybe some court appearances will finally put an end to this nonsense don t folks know people carry firearms can t teach stupid it wasn t about views my ass
this needs to happen more these little shits need to be sued more often so they stop doing stupid shit like this
fuck every person doing these lame as prank videos leave me alone
hope that old guy followed through and took them to court
really tired of people thinking harassing other people is a prank it s not don t touch people you don t know they don t know you and they certainly don t want you touching them it s not funny find something else to contribute to society
this needs to happen to every youtube prankster
not taking the kids side but any lawyers know if what he did is enough to be sued for to call that harassment seems like a stretch
the way his face drops when the cop says cool give me your id but but tell it to the judge he knows he s wrong and going to face consequences
more of this please
probably set up a gofundme to support his legal defense
i was hoping prank culture would die with millennial humor i m so over it there s too many mass sh tings going on there s absolute chaos in the world and i m on high alert all the time i don t have time for someone pulling a prank like this on me
it s just a prank bro
the boomer comes off as both cooler and more hardcore at the same time
normalize this sue these assholes

racists are the dumbest people on the planet this is very true saw a video a couple months ago from a black amazon driver that was cornered in the lobby of an apartment building by white tenants demanding to know why she was there and called the cops on her like they didn t see the amazon van her wearing an amazon uniform wearing an amazon hot and clearly didn t see the scanner and the package in her hand they just saw black and lost all sense and comprehension
the first clue should have been the fact that he s playing tennis that money isn t struggling single mother money
didn t know kenneth ellen parcell played tennis
he said that only to find out that his mummy fucked the tennis coach
this is ancient they suspended the player and his coach https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/college-tennis-player-suspended). plot twist the racists were from appalachian state university no shit
if i was the iv my sons nickname would be i plead the
pointing out that racists are dumb is like pointing out that water is wet ignorance breeds hate this phenomenon also highlights the fact that intelligence isn t binary it s faceted the same person who can earn post graduate degrees at ivy league universities can also not understand the simple concepts of context and perspective they have a gift for being able to regurgitate information taught to them when tested but are unable to apply that gift outside the classroom a classic way to put this is book smart versus street smart
i think i d reply with well the whole team the coach and the mascot know your mom
he looks mentally ill he also looks like the brock turner type
didn t this happen like years ago
i ain t never meet a single mafucka that plays tennis that doesn t know their dad
this shit happened years ago
sounds like he s been playing cod too much didn t realize people could see him this time
it really makes me laugh when racists and other idiots make baseless claims in an attempt to offend someone we ve never met before there s nothing that you could say that would be accurate or have any effect on my life
and he taught you to be a little twat just like him
i m not from usa i saw twice people saying that black fathers does not take care of their son like in this thread could someone explain me the origin of this idea beucase it is not common to say in my country
entitled racist shit aside at first glance i thought they had used a picture of kenneth parcell from rock
he looks like an entitled little punk ass bitch just waiting for his interview on fox decrying anti white oppression
i wonder who john wilson iv s father is
ladies and gentlemen i give you the future of the republican party
what a racist dumb fuck
actually racists probably run the planet given ws is the dominant system around here you just don t see smart racists making comments like this they are running the planet very much out the way you never see or hear them we will never know about the smart racists honestly
i d argue dumb and or ignorant i grew up in an almost all white area private school that literally had two black students and maybe half a dozen people of color total i had a lot to learn in college thankfully the hall i was in freshman year had almost all people of color and varying faiths learned so much either way pos deserves to be publicly shamed difference between dumb and ignorant is willingness to open your heart i d think
imagine what he ll say to girls he s raping in his college frat
what if the iv stands for in vitro
i d rather have a deadbeat dad than this narcissistic dickhead i m stuck with
with eyes like that it is most likely because the white kids mother calls his dad cousin
this is exactly why trump became president
i am always amazed that people actually exist who are this cartoonishly asinine the kind of completely out of control asshole you have to be to do something like this just boggles the mind racism isn t even close to this guy s biggest flaw it s probably more a convenient way for him to be an asshole than it is anything like an actual belief dude s like the 80s guy from futurama for two bucks he d beat you with a pool cue until your retinas detach
that s not racist he s just being an asshole
ok i m lost why is he racist because he said at least i know my dad how is that racist it implies that the kids mom slept around and doesn t know who the father is i know a lot of white women loke that
man this man is one with his dad and his dads dad and his dads dads dad
next on mutual of omaha watch as the thin skinned white guy starts losing in sports or an argument
a tennis player named wilson must have a lot of pressure to do well because every tennis ball reminds them you were born for this
not only does he know his dad his dad knows his dad and his dad knows his dad and his dad knows his dad
i m sorry but this is not true racist don t say the things they say because they are stupid they say the things they say because they are mean and cruel the racist guy doesn t care whether the black guy really knows his father or not all the the racist guy cares about is it what he s saying is mean and cruel this ongoing narrative that the racists are just stupid is literally helping their cause they want you to believe that they are just idiots so you won t realize how dangerous they really fucking are they want you to think you can educate them out of their racism and assholery so you will waste your time trying to educate them while they are being mean and cruel to even more people
dumb come back and yes very racist but you can have a name your dad gave you or be named after your dad and never have met them still a dumb thing to say but yea a name does not mean he stuck around
i never would have guessed kenneth was a racist
he is lucky he didn t get his face smashed in for that comment that was a massive dick move and he deserves getting the boot
does anyone really know their dad
so he s not only a poor sport he s a racist too got it
now that s a quality dollar general grade hair cut
suspension for that seriously a suspension for saying that
at least my dad is creative would be a better trash talk
props to the other player for keeping his cool i d have been like i know your dad too he likes to watch while i fuck your mom in the ass
it s funny cause most black children grow up in single mom households
john wilson iii could have gone for cigarettes and never returned when john wilson iv was very young or before he was born
so these two were playing tennis against one another the one on the left starting talking shit to the one on the right the one on the right complained to the officials and got the one on the left disqualified they both seem like privileged little bitches who wouldn t survive minutes on a cod lobby let alone a real sport i got called all kinds of racist shit when i played football in highschool i told my coach about it once and he just said that people will say whatever they can to get into your head when they know they re about to lose
as someone who has watched a cousin named marcus jr find out marcus sr wasn t his real father names don t mean shit
what did the black guy say if it s racist too then it s an equal transaction
why is this racist i don t get it kids in the uk joked about this at school when parents had separated but it wasn t intended as racist everyone at school was white albeit it was cruel
i have a feeling this was not as malicious as people think
current societal trends seen on tv internet and social media confirms that observation even unconsciously
racism is not being generally mean it is being specifically mean about one thing
racism is a fucking cancer a glioblastoma literally fucks their brain up useless jackasses
ok just hear me out just cuz his name has the iv in it doesn t necessarily mean he knows his dad dad could ve been out of the picture years after he got the name
that kid was out of line but how does the name prove that he knows his father because he is the fourth john wilson
i m not getting it how does a yo mama insult translate to racism it s kind of a teenager universal isn t it the kid may or may not be a racist but i fail to see how the insult itself is racist
well in his defense he had a chance of being correct
it would be weird to expect another boy to know your dad
racism doesn t come from intelligence anyway all racists are dumb as hell
and apparently his dad is a piece of shit if he taught him to think and behave in such an ugly way
yeah he knows his dad but his dad is a wife beater dead beat who just sits around drinking beer all day
if you name a kid something the fourth that s not gonna be an absent father lmao
not all single mothers struggle
so what did john say to him since he replied with at least probably talked mad shit then went crying to oppression police when he got hit back
sorry but that s actually pretty hilarious
just cause hes the 4th still doesnt mean he knows his dad just making a point
just because he s named after his dad doesn t mean he knows his dad and just because he s back doesn t mean he doesn t know his dad does he know his dad
but how often you ask name of a person you wanna insult
just stating a fact having a numeral after your name does not provide evidence that your dad is active in your life
please explain the racist part he insulted him that s clear but where is the racist part
lol yo mamma
racist sure but since we weren t there it could also be trash talking to mess with opponents head and game but it s easier to jump conclusions and get offended and blah blah blah also i m latin so f off and when you start calling me racist
how is every single f post in every single f so always political and always about interracial tension or always about men versus women this website is such a s now
that dude i the left smiles like a 40yeat old vergin seeing a slightly misaligned bra strap just barely sticking out from under a teenagers tank top
okay but knowing your father and knowing their name are different things he was racist and a dick absolutely but the response tweet ain t exactly gold
not racist just an asshole which is fine sportsmanship is overrated boxing as a kid in brooklyn shit talk was not only tolerated it was expected us the puerto ricans mexicans and italians said the most abhorrent racist shit to each other in the ring and was cool as fuck after its sports
this is racism but not against the black player
first time for everything i guess xd
i hope you re talking about ken possible s comment having a last name is pretty much a requirement for everyone regardless if you know your biological father or not the only facepalm is the fact that he was a racist but not for the comment
how is this racist
the phrasing of that sounds like a response not an initiation i wonder what he was responding to
science has proven that racists have lower iqs
dude s response should have been at least i know your mom
happened in not now https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/college-tennis-player-suspended
well it is making assumptions too that john wilson iii didn t die or run out while his son was still a baby that can happen that said yeah the white guy is still a racist idiot
people throw ad hominems all the time the insult doesn t have to be precise is about the spirit of it he s not insulting the guy he s insulting the race and the cultural implications of it
i believe everything i read on reddit
now this sub is so autistic and left wing i can t tell if you people are actually serious but are you talking about the racist being an idiot or the person in the second tweet
explain why this is racist
god damnit white people get it together
but what if its true
he could ve been named iv because he was the fourth baby daddy
no defense to the racist dude but what the fuck is the implication here any dude who stuck around long enough to make a junior stayed to be a father just because the father is a iii and fathered a iv doesn t mean he stuck around lol it s a racist hateful comment that i wouldn t defend even as a joke but the caption feels like reeeeee racist r stupid
redditors applauding worst decisions ever made
hold up is it possible that this wasn t actually racism and the kid was just being a dick off of what he knew about the other player
made me laugh though probably true
congrats on knowing your dad who may or may not be your biological father since white women are the biggest whores and white males are the heaviest drug users
its just easier for reading computer logs if im already fluent in counting past
am and pm is such a dumb concept like what comes after 11pm 12pm noooo 12am and after that 1am and after 11am comes pm and than pm like who cares about consistency right
i guess i m a fuckin war criminal then my phone is set to hour clock my computer is set to hour clock and so is my truck the only clocks in my house that aren t set to hour clocks are my analog clocks edit i also write dates in yyyy mm dd format so take that
my wife works in healthcare and they use hour time avoids any confusion as the time is always the time no extra letter notation required
i started using military time because i missed 8am classes the first week of college i set the alarm to 00pm instead of 00am never missed another class to that mistake again
or subtract it that is
i literally know one person who struggles with a hour clock
ah yes the old reddit standby americans dumb just repeat often and watch the upvotes come rollin in
most places overseas are on hour time as well
don t know why they are so twisted on hour clocks more than half of em can t read an analog clock anyway because a they don t own a watch and b their phone s homescreen is digital
i have to write offical reports that can be used in court i have to use 24hr clock notations where do i turn my criminal butt in
a day has hours i want to call the hours by what they actually are
no military connections in the family at all use 24hr time and analogue it s no hard
why do yanks call it military time it s just a hour clock the rest of the world has no problem with this in hospitals airports etc
laughs in european
yea but y all don t say i ll meet you at the club at twenty o clock
any american that has ever had a job with three shifts can tell military time it s not just people in the military
don t worry no one would want to recruit a fuckin idiot like you
undocumented war criminal here it really isn t that hard but if you ve never been taught how to read a clock
imagine thinking you re superior in some way because you do something differently astonishing
for me it s not about knowing what translates to in normal people time units pm it s the fact that i have to think about it at all that makes it an issue for example if you call a store and ask what time they close and they say when any normal person even outside of the u s would just say it s utterly pointless for anyone else but computers to write out time like that but people still do because this nation isn t dumb yanki doodle land but yall be quirky for the sake of it that s fine with me
i m not originally from the usa but this shit right here it s 11pm we all call it 11pm get your shit together nobody s says i went to bet at o clock
i m dutch hours is a standard format i put everything to hours format because i keep forgetting isn t 10pm it s just easier not having to do math
unless you were in the military or you re a programmer of sorts you re only doing it for attention and to be different and no one likes u
pilot here aviation world runs on hour time and zulu time to boot
look at the time if it s past then subtract from it example subtract and it s five o clock if it s past it s pm so it s pm it s actually really simple
people that can t read 24hr time are just projecting because they re too damn stupid to read it it s a far better way of reading time
til that there are adult voting people who not only don t understand analog clocks but there are even specimens who are too stupid to understand the hour concept on digital clocks i am speechless
american this is our best mathematician he can only count up to but he nails it every time
buhahahaha look an idiot who can t add or subtract
my phone actually came that way so there s no sense in changing that
when i grew up both my parents worked at an army depot as civilians where they only used military time so some of the clocks at home were military time is not hard
no the real divide between normal people and maniacs is how you indicate and minutes in an hour german speaker
i have everything that i can set to 24h time i guess in a purely technical sense military time wouldn t include the colon i seem to remember it being called european time because i spent so much time working midnight shifts it was easier for me to keep track of things especially in the winter up here when it s dark at 6am and 6pm my kids have adjusted to my phone much more quickly than my wife which always cracks me up we ve been married for more than years and she still can t get it without really thinking hard
healthcare field uses hour clock to avoid mistakes
military time is pretty easy but i was in the military and also have the amazing ability to correctly spell words with more than one syllable do what you will with that information
everyday i m astounded by what people allow to piss them off just live your life judgy and if this is an attempt at a seinfeld observation it s so weak
i hate this country sometimes
i m surrounded by a bunch of analogue clocks so i m just used to regular time hour time is understandable but my internal clock lets me know what time it is even if i can t see the sun or moon i always know if it s morning or night comes from working the night shift with errands during the day
zulu time kicks in the door and demands to be heard
i changed it by accident to h and decided to adapt and evolve instead of changing it back
butt load of karma bots here today
as a year old high school freshman i learned military time since our rudimentary internet hookup was to a naval atomic research center that was in
sounds like this person needs to get laid and loosen up it s just a time format it s not going to kill you gif giphy u2ljwiernu3wdrduuo downsized
i bet i know this persons entire ideology opinion on every topic
i worked in american broadcast for the pandemic and it turns out they are super into 24hr time too for scheduling mostly cause we were sharing time info across coasts so we needed to be able to pick one and run with it east coast wins but that was nice to get into after while so much less confusing
i set mine to hour when working nights at a hospital i had to log certain things and am pm is generally frowned upon i got so used to it that it just stuck it s handy to know anyway just like the metric system
raised in a military family and lived on base for much of my youth hour clock is my default way of telling time
in the work i do we use military time it was kind of nice when my fil wanted to test me by asking what the time was after passing a digital clock while in salford i just answered and my husband told him we use military time at work fil really dislikes most americans always trying to make me feel sort of dumb over the years he has definitely warmed up to me a grandson helped
see i can i just don t wanna and that s american
entertainment time cards are all in military times
it s world time btw
love the people in the comments flexing about their devices set to military time like it s gonna get them laid
yeah most the rest of the world runs on military time
the stupid shit people argue over
not the army no navy submarine vet
no military affiliation but use it
sometimes i look at this shit and realize why we have a bad rep amongst other nations how can you not hate some stupid shit like this
i hope no one shows them one of these clocks roman numerals analog hours https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_analog_dial#/media/file%3atorre_dell'orologio_(ingrandimento).jpg
how is it bootlicking to use military time it makes more sence to me
well i m in the military so it s pretty easy to get used to it
i m pretty sure the original poster was joking but everyone s taking them like they re being serious
us military time rest of the world the time i m american and am ashamed quite often
is 05pm and i have never been in the military but i do know basic math if the time is or more subtract to know the pm time
you guys are using clocks i m using an astrolabe get cultured
if i fall asleep at 8pm and it s grey outside when i wake up how else am i supposed to tell if i woke up at 9pm or i slept until am
rune factory taught me to do the math quickly
if its good enough for the military then its good enough for me
i like it because instead of counting the hours up to twice it s once and i think it s cool
it s a preference on one hand ante meridiem and post meridium time keeping is ancient and refers to the split of the day night cycle based on a sun dial its users consider it to be very simplistic yet people who use military time will say it s confusing on the other hand military time is modern and uses the hours of the day in sequence while a m p m users find this methid of counting past twelve to be confusing neither is wrong neither is right it s all on the user to be staunch in superiority for either side is a mindset that easily displays why humans will never reach a common ground they both work perfectly as tools to tell time
people who complain about this annoy me we all can tell military time it s easy everybody can do it you aren t special for using it the only reason americans don t use it is cultural reasons that s it it s not harder to use either we simply do it different it does not reflect our intelligence for using a different system btw think of it like this if we are too stupid for military time then why do we use so many different conversions between measurements miles to feet inches to cm etc we can do math shut up about military time already
a lot of careers and businesses use military time medical government agencies and businesses that deal with international companies
nah screw dates use seconds since
most linux system logs that i know of use hour time formats
what comes after 11pm midnight easy people can use whatever clock they want though use a sundial for all i care
what comes after
yeah this chud not know its not actually military time just because that is the only place its used in the us internationally at airports and railway stations they constantly use it because its a lot easier for travel scheduling not needing am pm what am i saying this dip never left kansas
same same and same a 24h clock is best esp for those of us in med professions makes charting simple and clear
its better than mm dd yyyy
this
iso is indeed the superior date format
same been doing this for decades makes sorting data simple
only proper date format is dd mm yyyy sorry
yyyy mm dd let me guess you use file explorer a lot
you sick fuck
mostly based but wtf is with that dating format why
apr is my neutral format for work emails i do dd mm yyyy for indexing i do dd mm yyyy because no dashes allowed then i use military format but then having to convert to am pm when i m not at work same applying to when i talk to foreign friends and they want meters celcius talking to my local friends or family and using feet fahrenheit basically i hate everyone equally
i have my clock in my room set to military time i guess i am with you too
u can just subtract and forget the first number well till u get to plus
i know a few but they re all small children
yeah it s all the same
ok but we are dumb and thats coming from one
or just outside the us
i m not gonna lie i never saw a mechanical phone homescreen
that s because you don t say twenty o clock you say twenty hundred or twenty hundred hours
no the problem is i have been taught how to read a clock and no clock has on it or o1200
whaddya mean it s obvious just say west or east etc
only the most readable format

what does she means by working
walls work and i thought they just stand around
she s right until they fall
does does she think we built the wall to keep communism out
if the berlin wall worked so well then why did it require armed quards constantly watching almost every foot of it to keep the people from going over it
as a german i wanna punch her so bad the wall ripped family s apart and killed many it was a cage for a dying country if country s build walls they fail
jerry seinfeld voice did you ever notice the iron curtain is made out of cement and curtain it s pretty thick for a curtain don t you think why would anyone want a cement curtain and what s the deal with mine fields
the berlin wall kept families apart by military gunpoint how many died trying to cross the wall just to be with family seperated by a war held decades past punishing future generations for the sins of the past pathetic
the berlin wall was built to keep people in maybe the same will be needed for texas soon
she thinking we d be the west berlin side or the east berlin side
they work as long as the armed guys on top are willing to shoot people who are trying to cross the wall but i m not sure why a country claiming to be a democracy would want this
yea they are great for separating friends and family over government disputes awesome
so every country south of the u s is an oppressive regime who kills its own people to keep them from escaping to a better place the berlin wall was to keep people in not out dumbass it also did a damn good job of doing just that until it came down the simplistic mindset in this hive minded venue is mind numbing
also a good example to keep books in school wether you like them or not if this woman had been educated at least the slightest bit she wouldn t have said this
mr gorbachev tear down this wall republicans favorite republican ronald reagan
i really hope she was being sarcastic
a mile wall on flat ground with an army or two guarding either side at all times a huge number of clandestine crossings are in the history book countless more stayed secret
they work as long as no mongolian hordes or david hasselhoff tapes are nearby
she probably never even heard of the great wall or thinks it was built to keep mexican field workers out of china and therefore a huge success
the only people who think walls work are people who can t figure out how to get over under or around a wall
ah yes the berlin wall famous for being a good thing that worked
gif giphy 4z9fsefauxpnlbvwqx downsized
i mean the berlin wall and the trump wall work in complete opposite principals the trump one is meant to keep immigrants out of the us while the berlin one is meant to keep people from leaving the country one keeps people out one keeps people in it s not the same
does the wall have a 401k dental healthcare
it s like the decades of hair bleaching soaks into their skull like imperial romans and the lead water pipes
inhale exhale put my phone away
conservatives are so brain broken and anti intellectual they are unable to understand what examples support their points or maybe they just got tired of checking the haystack for the needle
i mean the wall did work thats why it was taken down no like if it didnt work then thered be no reason to spend the time and resources to make it stop working
ok so walls work what s the pay and benefits
does she even know that wall was to keep people in not out
that s what happens when morons don t learn from history or learn history or learn in general
just as a comment that will be hated the wall worked pretty well while it was on foot escaping from the communist berlin was pretty hard only when it was tear down that it stop working
the berlin wall was very successful at what it did and its an example of how terrifying walls can be between and the wall physically separated east and west germany people were shot and killed trying to cross the wall to say this wall didn t work is some scary thinking that provides a notion if walls don t work let people build them this is a time after wwii when the soviet union was in control of eastern side of berlin and the conditions were so bad people risked their lives to get to the other side as the soviet union began to collapse and along with outside pressures from allies and the usa the wall finally came down in i m not sure who monica crowely is and the point she is trying to make by saying walls work she is clearly right this wall was successful for nearly years at separating east west the terrible history of this wall isn t something to be celebrated instead it should be a reminder at how terrible this wall truly was on one side everything was fine and on the soviet union side conditions were terrible i m sure i ll get downvoted for this for saying walls work but in this case it was successful and people died trying to cross it not sure on exactly how many successful crossings there were and records of those might be hard to find as i m sure many were kept secret op i upvoted your post even though i greatly disagree with your title but the fact is walls can work and this needs to be taken seriously i m not sure if you are pro or con wall with this post but it s backwards thinking to promote this wall as being unsuccessful in what in did
we need to address the whole conservatives are media illiterate thing because it s not limited to media anymore and it s dangerous how fucking stupid they ve gleefully become
tell me you re historically illiterate without telling me
yeah and east germany actually did pay for it
the great wall of china has entered the chat
her wall exists therefore it works
what an idiot
there is a new invention called a ladder
i went to roast her but it seems she deleted it
i think there s no way this person is that stupid but then i remember yeah they probably are
i remember monica crowley commenting on a radio show in the 1990s that the fall of the berlin wall is proof that even a wall can t resist a people s longing for freedom and now she does this none of these people believe anything they say it s all bullshit
not the smartest blonde if i may say so
i don t know the berlin wall worked pretty well for a long time
don t tell her that communists built it
how do you so brazenly come to the exact worst conclusion like damn lol
i just wish the gop would stop making themselves look so fucking stupid
berlin wall was meant to keep people in not keep people out
saying walls work to this monument of oppression is like saying trains as public transport can work look at jew deportation wtf but yeah that wall worked very well sadly only few people were able to come over it the ones trying were shot by a totalitarian regime nothing you should compare yourself with
https://www.berlin.de/mauer/en/history/victims-of-the-wall/](https://www.berlin.de/mauer/en/history/victims-of-the-wall/) attempted escapes successes and deaths over years
it s less of a wall but rather a separation unit measuring 6m x 2m x walter ulbricht
stop proving the blonde stereotype correct
no thousands of vicious guards who shoot to kill with towers searchlights land mines machine guns killer dobermans trenches barbed wire dead zone etc work but thousands still tried to escape walls by themselves not so much
lol funny that this segment of the wall called east side gallery is now considered an art installation i was in berlin a month before the wall came down by that time thousands of east berliners were making the trek through east germany into czechoslovakia then hungary and into west germany where they were immediately granted citizenship and then they took the journey through east germany to get to west berlin that s how good that wall worked
my god the irony the stupidity
never heard of her next
who tf genuinely thinks the berlin wall is a good things
i was when the berlin wall fell and even i knew more then than this idiot does now
before i built a wall i d ask to know what i was walling in or walling out and to whom i was like to give offense robert frost mending wall and i never noticed the offense fence pun before
when you don t say anything people might think your stupid but when you open your mouth you can confirm it my dad but probably someone else
the soldiers with guns stationed along the wall probably helped a little bit roughly soldiers at over watchtowers let s not leave out that important detail
christ these fucking morons
sometimes i wonder why americans like this travel they go places but they refuse to learn customs the language any type of history
well if you include death valley on the other side with guard towers and soldiers shooting to kill
um the berlin wall worked fantastically soviet communism lost to us capitalism but that wall did it s damn job
i voted numerous times when i was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in clinton told an audience at a campaign stop nov and i do think you have to control your borders clinton voted for the secure fence act of which president george w bush signed after the measure cleared the republican held congress it authorized about miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the united states and mexico the act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles then sen clinton voted in favor of the act when it passed in the senate by a vote of to notably then sen barack obama and new york sen chuck schumer voted for it too i mean walls definitely work but using the berlin wall as a example isn t the best one currently
the berlin wall worked it was the system that didn t work the wall was made to keep people in and it did reduce number of people who could flee x200b the big difference is that this was a wall to keep people in while wall from wester countries are to keep people out
i lived in germany in when people finally had enough and tore that wall down pieces of it were sold as souvenirs
it wasn t the wall that worked it was the army stationed behind it and the death zone between the wall and the army filled with spring guns when the army went away the wall stopped working
yeah if you are willing to shoot anyone trying to go over it
our education system has failed us in innumerable ways and this is the outcome
for what i know the wall worked pretty well so idon t get ops point of course it needed guards to work but the guards without wall wouldn t work either
nobody broke into the ussr all the time the wall was up and of course all those people in gated communities who are against border walls also prove walls work
s a r c a s m a r c a s m
is she really there trying to justify building a border wall is she an idiot
amerika
the same morons complaining about illegals and immigration in general are the ones moaning about inflation you either allow immigration or live with high inflation you can t have both they are mutually exclusive
do you know whatbthe berlin wall was separating
that s wrong this wall worked for years very well there are 1000s of sad family s who could vouch for it many people died by getting over these walls op is extremely uninformed and should be very ashamed to write these comments in hope for some karma
actually it did for years
but the wall did work for years
machine guns and walls work damn good
it did work the people traversing the area went down significantly upon it s erection it just didn t last
i mean last time i checked walls do work otherwise my carpet would be wet every time it rains
that wall worked quite well until it was torn down
it worked well until it came down i was there at the wall before and after
it actually did work pretty well though
tbh the wall fucking worked the system that built it tho
i mean china has a big ass wall and no illegal mexican immigrants so
wait germany splitted again
it did work it kept fascism out and brought peace to europe after it fell fascism went east and europe fell into several wars
just take her to the wall in china and tell her she s needed to protect from the mongolian empire just leave her ass there
is she even at berlin though that hopscotch graffiti behind her is clearly written in portuguese with the words for heaven topmost love and peace
ironically it was america that wanted that wall down
that s not the berlin wall
yeah because the reasons for the berlin wall and a border wall on the south of the us are the same op should facepalm himself
but it did work for years from until it was largely dismantled back in after that yeah ut didn t work that well anymore

the professor has worked out a great technique for avoiding the need to respond to stupid questions
impact
the school system as america has it has a bad effect on americas people i as german feel not affected except for the blue forehead because of the facepalms x200b effect what something causes directly affect does it touch something i hope this explanation i am able to give with my school english from is enough
affect fuck around effect find out
the effects affect
affect verb effect noun
him being affected by his lack of knowledge seems to have had an effect on his texting ability
if you affect something you had an effect on it that s how i remember
effect is the explosion affect is your hand pulling the pin to make it explode you affect an object into having an effect
kiss but never kiss
it looks like the effect it had in him really affected him
something can be affected or it can affect something but if it s the subject it s the effect it had on something the effect it had on people was affected by the sun the sun affected the effect it had but the moon can also affect it the affection your cat deserves is a lot heheh i m dutch i suck at dutch grammar much better at english that s the effect that occurs when you force shit dutch books on us we re affected by that mr dutch teacher
effect is the noun when speaking about the outcome of what you affected affect if the verb when speaking about your actions that had an effect there is a lot more nuance but its honestly a slog it should just be one word
i facepalmed myself reading that post forgetting what sub i was reading it on
what an effective stragegy
the only to way to know for certain is to earn a doctorate degree in english
__affect__ used to describe when something does something to something my sleep schedule has been greatly __affected__ by this game __effect__ describes what that thing did to something else the __effects__ of drugs can be deadly
this isn t a facepalm it s just a funny tweet i swear half the people who post here don t know what sub they re on
affect have an effect on make a difference to effect a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause when something affects something else the first something changes the second something the effect is how the second something is changed affected by the first it is similar to newton s third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction the action affects the object being acted upon and the reaction is the effect that the action had on the object or how it was affected for example if a person were to cut a piece of paper with scissors the scissors affected the paper whereas the effect the effect being how the paper is affected by the scissors is that there is now a hole in the paper
an effect is the result of an affect
affect action effect end result
the side effects of sleeping pills affect me badly
impacts
verb vs noun
affect is a verb effect is a noun
effect i ll tell you what the effect is its pissing me off
an effect is something that something does eg an effect of climate change is more extreme weather patterns if something affects something it has an effect on it eg climate change negatively affects weather patterns
you can affect an effect
raven remember a is for verbs and e is for nouns affect is the fucking around and effect is the finding out
affect action effect end result
amazing how people can t figure these things out
effect is a noun affect is a verb
effect is a noun affect is a verb
affect is a verb effect is a noun the professor s confusion affected how they wrote their dissertation the effect of that confusion was not using either word
fuck half the redditors don t know then vs than and even more fuct up than that don t know woman vs women some sad shit
here s a wrench affect can also be used as a noun when referring to a display of emotion even after he was sentenced to life in prison the mass murder s face was devoid of affect
raven remember affect verb effect noun
when you affect something it causes an effect
generally speaking affect is a verb and effect is a noun the only exception is when referring to facial expression then affect is a noun her face had a flat affect in which case the stress is on the first syllable of affect instead of the second syllable
that s a frightening response
affect to influence verb think a for action effect the result noun think e for end result these are mostly true for instance to effect change is a verb phrase that is correct even though effect itself is a noun to affect change is incorrect surprisingly
an unstable person tried to effect change in the political system with a series of domestic attacks he was later arrested only to be sent to a mental asylum as the psychiatrist diagnosed them with severe mental illness characterized by a flat affect amongst other symptom you re correct but english is funny that way some more fun the clinical trial found the drug to be ineffective as although efficient at inducing side effects it was not efficacious in inhibiting the renal transporter one side effect was a severe hampering of previously established psychological affections
what i was taught effect something that causes direct and physical consequences to something else you hear the two area of effect a lot in video games usually they re talking about how the damage was dealt upon something affect the emotional version of effect how did that affect you
some exceptions affect the use of effect you may have effected peoples understanding of both but i honestly don t know how
direct and indirect
as an american i did not know this thank you for teaching what i have failed to learn
the affects effect
correct of the time but effect can also be used as a verb meaning to bring about like in to effect change
affect is a verb effect is a noun not sure why people need acronyms or reminders
i think you can affect change like the way the change is happening but it probably would have the there i m polish i have no problem understanding the difference between affect and effect but articles to this day are completely lost on me i usually just go through the text i wrote and add some here and there as long as it sounds about right
wow
yeah to affect change is never correct as it s just a phrase on its own that is an exception to the typical use of affect and effect as verb and noun think of effect change as one word you could affect the change of something which is different grammatical usage

that s a man that doesn t have kids or he would have already be diving for the item it s odd that kids is especially fast and knowledgeable
not the baby s first time as you can see the baby didn t even hesitate or think twice
someone s getting a hand cut off
baby face finster strikes again
ngl it was just a toddler i would ve just let it go
honestly i d let the kid get away with the snack but i d still run after them to make sure there was an adult nearby x x make sure it isn t just some year old by themself
stickin it to the man
i swear man my neighbours have kids and of them has the power of vanishing stuff she touches like moment you see it in her hand next moment it s on the road
omg that was the cutest i mean yeah stealing is wrong but those little tiny legs moving like that cracked me up i m more concerned about that kid s wellbeing though didn t look like they even had shoes on just socks to me it looks like one of the parents told the kid to do this they are too young to know what they should and shouldn t do by the way they walked i would guess or years old i hope this kid gets help i think the odds are stacked against them though even if parents eventually lose custody for whatever reason life in the system won t be any easier
let s hit this joint i got a plan they ll never see coming
this should be on r memes or something
in my country they would have shot the thief
damn she s fast
fast legs gif emote free_emotes_pack joy
gif giphy hmsfpsqkaorcpscq2g babyface finster
not sure how this is facepalm
future politician right there
that place looks like my redneck cousins garage
poor impulse control
lol i am imagining this kid waking up still thinking about that snack their dad said no to earlier that day and leaving the house to go get it themself
bad ass still impressed
that kid sure can run_
that s because his dad is about to run in and raid the cash register
like stealing the candy from the baby just the other way around
it is taught sadly when i worked loss prevention i was taught to watch kids as well as adults like toddlers parents teach them to walk out with stuff like that as most people would immediately just think it is a kid being silly or naughty saw it happen a lot unfortunately
i mma be real babies will snatch anything off a shelf and try to leave with it if their parents aren t looking hell sometimes with them looking they don t know it s bad until they re taught
i would chase the kid to make sure his parents are around seriously if a kid that small can get five feet into a store without a parent chasing them down some needs a yelling
i wouldn t go after the kid but i would bet money some shitty parent had them do this
you didn t see the five o clock shadow that s no toddler that s a midget with the munchies s
op is the facepalm here
usa
you look like the type to defend some armed robbers because thy was black shut yo ass up
the op is the facepalm i guess this video was kinda funny
exactly my thoughts here comes the adults
i once stole a laser pointer by accident can confirm
one of my earliest memories is being at the grocery store with my mom she was in the process of checking out and i guess the york peppermint patty wrapper looked appealing so i just picked it up opened it and started eating i don t think either noticed until i was a few bites in
happy cake day
problematic nature of the name aside midget with the munchies is a good band name
yep
who else
by this comment i can tell you most likely live in the usa is very proud of it and doesn t have a huge sense of humor
hid a giant candy cane in my coat after my mother said no didn t understand the whole money thing back when i was but i didn t enter a store without my mother and just take stuff either my mother realized what had happened in the car and she walked me right back in and made me return it and apologize wrapping was intact i m so glad she did that instilled a lifelong sense of morals or at least what you re not supposed to do

how the fuck are there so many people in this thread missing the joke
i once had a kidney stone lodged in my urethra but i don t need no dumbass doctor i punched myself in the dick for fours straight until that little fucker popped out i m an alfalfa male bro
y all ever heard of sarcasm
he is playing a caricature of andrew tate followers
guys he is joking
he is clearly joking ffs
this is a comedy post by the almost friday dudes
this isn t real it s a parody of people like jocko willink
op he did make it up for sarcasm
my goodness how is this going over your head op how
what a dumb stance to take speaking as someone who s had their appendix removed he s a fucking idiot and liar once that sucker gets inflamed it s excruciating pain until it s removed if it s apendicitis it most likely would have ruptured within hours and he would have died
this is clearly a bit
how about we don t fucking post comedy stuff to facepalm please so ppl don t think it s real when it s not or have it at least be obvious there are ppl that would say this kind of shit without it being true because of voldemorts nonsense p s that s what i ve just decided to call andrew tate
im high so i might be wrong but is this guy asking to be raped by another man
if your appendix is in your stomach you may have more problems than you think
fuck you sepsis i m an alpha
please tell me this is sarcasm
i was getting a bit heated until the last line that was gold
how can you guys not tell this is making fun of podcast alpha bros
ooo big tough guy
no freaking way this isn t a parody
i hope no medical facilities take him in when he s in critical condition
so he likes the feeling of a piece of poop clogging his appendix now that s a kink
be this serious or sarcasm those transitions hurt to look at
the dude that sang informer is fuckin pissed
it s going to so sad when he dies
i know it s supposed to be funny but there are people who really think like this almost as if they forgot that weapons exists or that people do mma
is this the canadian tate
natural selection at play here
his appendix is in his stomach i wonder where his brain is
the hyper confidence of mediocre men bro
i feel like this is comedy but lately shit has been so crazy in the world that it is entirely plausible that this isn t comedy i don t know what that says about humanity in this century
i had a knife stuck in my lower torso the doctor said i needed it removed to live ok doc take it from me and i ll kill you i died hours later
so his appendix burst and he s dead now
alpha level dumb and loves himself so much he pays his ass rent
gd i seriously hope his appendix bursts while he s out on a mile hike with no cell reception then when another hiker comes along and says hey bud come with me let s get you to a hospital this guy will reply screw you helpful honda hiker i m bigger than you
stuff like this kind of almost makes me wish that doctors could refuse to treat people like dude comes back begging for the surgery and the doc is like sorry can t i m not strong enough to i know why they can t but shit dude
the little boy is full of shit my appendix burst in i was on my own no idea what s going on colour drained from me stomach swollen beyond anything i ve seen prior in absolute agony rushed to hospital cat scan revealed all in theatre within minutes needed to be completely cleaned out due to peritonitis on two months of antibiotics an absolute physical wreck for months i don t know who this charlatan is talking to but i hope the dude slapped him silly it s still rotting in my body shut up you tart
but intelligent people get other people to overpower you while we drink a beer and carry on with our lives
just give him a math problem to stun him and sweep the legs you win he must obey
no cuz this is so stupid if i was that doctor i m letting him die
that doctor was like you came to a doctor for your problem so i m giving you a doctor answer what you do with that info is entirely up to you off the doc goes to the next dying man who wants help
first he s a liar you aren t living with appendicitis for a year and why are we giving stupid platform just call him stupid move on
i ruptured my achilles tendon and do you think i let them operate no i m in a wheelchair and i ll still beat the shit out of you from down here
adaptation is how a species survives this guy is vestigial from the top down
wtf
he s not even muscular bro
how sure are we this is not sarcasm appendicitis is a medical emergency
well that s fucking stupid
this guy still has his foreskin
what an absolute tool he probably has a brain tumour but the doctor who found it was too weak
my doctor said goggins you can t keep running all the time your hearts gonna give out i said doc your a fat motherfucker
there once was a man from peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe he woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that he ate his appendix too
he would be dead lol its a jake
i think the rot has infected your brain
i ll bet someone ten bucks he s dead by now
moron
s
now that s funny
lmao i just saw i am the danger after he said a doctor said my life was in danger oh my god i am dying
s
based
real facepalm is op not realizing this being a skit lol
this is hilarious
this is an alpha male alpha men let bad organs rot inside them while their alpha organs destroy the weakling rotten organ
that s because he boy friend name was apen and he swallowed the dix
gif giphy l0iypekl9njhpfmrk
this guy lol
this has to be ironic
dies next day from appendicitis still top g
haha that s hilarious
someone bit the onion
this is funny lol
if anyone actually believes this is serious please get off the internet and do not reproduce
no you re wrong you can make that up and he probably did
the face palm is you not understanding sarcasm like when the cut at the end said trust me i m right you took that very seriously lol
i hope that appendicitis bursts
op is very dense
sigma rule s
i like this guys attitude
this so so interesting i know it s a joke but it shows that when you dress it up with authority and purpose it can hold weight the art of manipulation
this is funny af
dudes being physically overpowered by an organ we out evolved a need for but i do like the idea of doctors having to force examinations makes colonoscopy s way more interesting
last tuesday my gynecologist told me i had gonorrhea i said cash me ousside how bow dah so she can t do shit i m untouchable
so if i beat this guy i get his appendix deal
we need to remove that bullet in you sure thing doc why don t you come and get it from me if you can
and sometimes hanging onto things that are diseased can kill you but i m sure you know best
it d be comedic gold if the next shot was just him dead on the table lmao
i ve been on the internet long enough to learn two things not everyone gets the joke b not everyone was joking
andrew tate syndrome sounds like something he d say and actually mean it
this is a joke right like i don t know who this is but i know it can t be real
because there is a handful of podcasters who would un ironically say that
even though it s a joke don t fuck around with appendicitis my appendix ruptured i thought it was a bad stomach flu and ended up going to the emergency room days later when it only kept getting worse had an emergency appendectomy nearly died from sepsis and my kidneys had already shut down you have been warned go to the hospital before i did
missing the joke is what this sub should be renamed to
redditors have no social skills
i did can you explain
um op started it by taking this seriously it s clearly either a joke or the guy did make this up
most people are not trolls
alfalfa got me good i m going to use that

so it s fun for a while until the batteries run out
ok bowser lmfao
this is one of those that critics hate and audiences love
i seen it i loved it
the ratio is crazy
deleted
aw hell nah not my country s top news station
they were referring to gba
gay bowser sad face
we looked at the reviews before going to this movie we almost cancelled but it was fun and had a few laughs definitely mostly eye candy but any reasonable person shouldn t expect a mario movie to be a masterpiece of cinema
me and a few friends just seen it it s actually pretty good i d personally give it a
i have a game boy it takes half a year to run out
as of right now for critics for audience in rt i had hope on the movie but i may give it a chance now
we know what they mean but the analogy falls flat this movie is basically spectacle and fan service it s almost specifically not for people that don t know how a game boy fucking works
bout to say weren t game boys from the time that you could finish most pokmon games on a single charge
those things were hearty
hey guys it s ya boi and today i m gonna show you how to mod your gameboy with a new molten salt battery
don t give a shit about movie critics it s just a small group of snobs that likes to nitpick stuff for some cash and does not represent what the average person thinks
i m not excited for some of the voice acting but other than that it looks really fun a kids movie no doubt but still fun

churches are just book clubs they all meet do discuss a book most have not read
i heard a story from my church when i was a child a man was in the ocean drowning and a boat came up to him to save him but he yelled back that he didn t need saving because he had faith in god and god would save him another boat came and same thing the man drowned and went to heaven where he asked god why didn t you save me god what do you mean i sent two boats to save you
how many weeks in a year how long is a quarter hour what two countries border the us questions she can t answer as well
jesus also died in his early 30s so
spoiler alert millions of deaths from preventable diseases is not catholicism
i wonder what magats thought about vaccines prior to covid
you ever just look at something like this and wonder how did we get here all of this anti vax stuff would have been laughed out of the room for almost my entire adult life because we used to know better we are literally getting dumber as a country
he didn t need to be he s jesus christ dummy lol
spoiler alert this girl is a moron
the original zombie didn t need no vaxx
jesus didn t have internet either your move bitch
jesus nor the easter bunny ever actually existed
neither was lucifer
what does this even mean jesus didn t even fucking talk about medication if anything jesus gave his fully human disciples the ability to cure diseases and injuries miraculously so couldn t you just believe in your own mind jesus bestowed upon the world the ability to fucking think and figure out how to help people
i find it so funny when people make points like this the black plague went away without a vaccine yeah and killed like of europe before leaving there arent vaccines in the bible there also isnt modern air conditioning and hygiene like today are you also willing to give those up
nope jesus wasn t vaccinated just penetrated by three long hard dick shaped objects
it s great that this is a true statement but still inaccurate in so many ways education is important
when you re raised by the village idiots
well while we at it he wasn t real either
jesus never posted a pic on the internet drove a car or used a cellphone
first off reposted for like the 100th time secondly why are we still posting corona memes
spoiler alert jesus isn t real
counter argument jesus wasn t and isn t real
spoiler alert jesus is just an imaginary friend for grown ups
spoil alert jesus never rose from the dead
why does she have some hispanic guys name on her shirt
while true he wasn t vaccinated he didn t die via disease unless hate counts also bros magic if he can beat the devil turn water into wine yadah yadah being sick means nothing
if she thinks she can tank like the fucking son of god good luck lol
everybody who is arguing with religion immediately loses their credibility
god could have made vaccines available during jesus time because he is omnipotent and all knowing but he decided to withhold that information for years and let countless people suffer and die from preventable diseases
jesus didn t own a gun either
i hope she wears that shirt when she s covered in chicken pox
i heard about a new movie coming out in theaters near you soon it stars jesus in the movie easter
he also probably would have died in his 30s anyway
biblical jesus never existed
he also didn t have cell phones to take pics you sinner
i agree that redditor is big brain
she probably wants to lessen the carbon footprint of humans
that would be amazing if jesus was vaccinated against nails the carpenters who had to nail him down jesus was a carpenter do you think he was like hey hold that nail straight
lost napoleon wasn t vaccinated constantine ben franklin
spoiler alert you re not jesus
really hate the way people throw around the phrase spoiler alert
great comment
jesus wasn t stupid either
neither did jesus
well neither is micky mouse i wonder why that is
and he s dead now s
jesus also didn t use guns
spoiler alert it s just a story of the sun of god the sun that gives us life every morning and sets at night not a man named jesus
fictional characters can survive anything
that s hilarious
spoiler alert there is no contemporary evidence for historical jesus
of course they won t silly jesus was crucified then he came back if we wanted them to come back on easter too we need to crusi oh wait
spoiler alert the average life span at the time was perhaps years with most people dying of diseases that are now easily prevented thanks to vaccines so good luck with your theory
serious question what is the point of using spoiler alert here
checkmate guys we re done they owned us
don t forget the weekly payment very important
churches are just book clubs they all meet do discuss a book most have not read and gossip about the one person who didn t show up
exactly definitely not a believer in whatever god but if you are it s like why tf did you assume that s not what god sent to save you
related question because the answer surprised me do you know how many countries are in north america
over money issues
are you sure maybe it s just natures way of saying we have overpopulated and need to adjust the balance
magats thought
not getting dumber necessarily as a country the dumbest people are just super loud and proud about it these days

you forgot to say spoiler alert
i like to think jesus was a real person and one of the worlds first historically recorded confidence men said your soul needed saving so they sent you off to bible school you learned a little more than they had heard was in the golden rule be good to everybody be a strength to the weak be a joy to the joyful be the laughter in the grief and give your love freely to whoever that you please don t let nobody tell you bout who you oughta be and when you get damned in the popular opinion it s just another damn of the damns you re not giving josh ritter getting ready to get down
could have used a tetanus shot i guess
now that s love
not even a nail gun what wasn t he a carpenter
ten percent of your gross income not net
the ones i go to just require you to bring a bottle if you are not driving
in continental north america maybe more if you count the many caribbean islands
yep there are youtubes about the stunning ignorance of too many
also status issues
well then that would be nature not religion
oops sorry those two words do not go together
i hope you are right i know quite a few people and am related to most of them who never had a problem with vaccines before and now regard them as some sort of left wing conspiracy
ba dum ch
of course god needs a lot of money
that sounds a whole lot like a tax
only mexico america and canada count the rest can go do whatever ig s
people were pretty cross with him
before covid there was a measles outbreak that was particularly strong in new york if i remember correctly idiots were even throwing measles parties so their kids could get infected
i guess i would just say that they aren t any dumber than they were before you just maybe didn t know what catastrophic miscues they already subscribed to
sexual predator coverups are not cheap
god hasn t return because we ain t donating enough so empty that wallet to let your pastor buy a private jet and mansions because it s all for god right
nailed it
that was in primarily orthodox jewish neighborhoods which historically have low vaccination rates

if most western countries did not have asian nurses our medical system would suck even more
something i never realized until i started seeing it in asian populations that speak english australia is like surrounded by asia or pan asian to some africa is an ocean away i think being in the states we think of them as being kind of alone but really they are in the thick of asia relatively
most likely a little sheltered suburban gremlin to me kid is in for a harsh life lesson when he inevitably fucks with the wrong one
racism is learned these assholes are top students

so why do you need a loan from our bank i need to pay the medical bill of the kid i punched in the face ps i would regret nothing
anyone with that accent should abstain from racism

he needs a smack around the ears
we really need to get back to a time where dumb ass people get punched in the fucking face
i almost passed out to much gayness
who could have guessed that descendents of people who literally took from everything traditional might create their own view of a parasite hopefully this dumb kid and parents are identified and held up as paragons of stupidity
lol white folks
my sister lived in oz for a couple years said the racism was just as bad as in the states that s a fn shame

gay
i get the anger but these are fkin literal kids if i was labeled for life for the mistakes i made when i was what granted i never did that but i sure did tons of stuff that woulda gotten me in big trouble
i feel bad for the kid so often this isn t necessarily the kids point of view they are just forced into these views by parents with said views such a hard trait to un learn going through life with blind opinions because you parent s told you that s what your opinions should be just sad not defending the kids actions but generally speaking the actions of a child are a reflection of the parent
but aren t asians a virus i mean they multiply and are the not restricted on the amount of offspring they have and n their native land
any follow up with this story either way she would just say something like she had a bad year and she is not racist
welcome to the world where social media has made everyone the star in their own movie
scum she ll be pregnant with a mystery kid and living in a square foot social housing apartment by the time she s twenty meanwhile all of the wong families kids will be out of uni earning figures and living in beachfront homes

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/doordash-glitch-70k/
ok but how s he not fatter because if i ate 70k of thai food butter chicken and so on
his real mistake was adding a credit card or bank account with enough room for doordash to do this lol
play stupid games win stupid prizes
those are some i m fucked deep breaths
sad spiff noises
my mom
we went ahead and fixed the glitch
you had to of known it would come back around
couldn t you just add a gift card on it and charge it all on that during the glitch
doordebt
was that bald man about to say his mom is gonna kill him surely not
the my mom is gonna made it much more hilarious
i can t believe people actually believe this is real lmfao
lies
waagh
oh no it s the consequences of my actions whatever shall i doooooooooo

doordash truly did once experience a payment glitch that allowed users to place orders for free for a brief period of time however the man who made this claim in the viral clip is a content creator who makes comedic videos the company confirmed to us by email that the video had been fabricated thanks for the link
i mean thinking about it logically how could anyone order 70k worth of food and have it reasonably be delivered x200b that is literal metric tons of food

thank you
the hero we all need
68k were delivery fees
buying alcohol and reselling it thinking he got some free supply to profit off of would be my guess
is that an officespace reference
you smart
yeah
with delivery fees and tips i d say that s about two days of meals
i assumed it was repeatedly used over a period of weeks but can t say i m surprised it s all bullshit
door dash also delivers groceries alcohol and household items in some areas
facts they charge extra on all the food prices ans thats before the delivery charge and they still only give to the driver
ah right you can t get fat with 2k worth of food
gif giphy dfu7j1d1aqbae
no i m genuinely curious because i don t use these types of apps myself so is that a no
i can t imagine a glitch like this surviving more than a day or two before the service just paused itself till it was fixed
unless it s salt bae
i didn t experience the door dash glitch myself but your plan sounds like it would work

real i was the schedule this guy got in major trouble
i mean some college cities have schools maybe otherwise i have no idea
why would you be dead you are at the right school
thing might have changed but i got my time tables for school and university when i was in the building on the first day
i used to have a recurring dream where i spent a whole semester inadvertently going to the wrong class and then it s time to take the exam for my real class i always seemed to make it to the right school at least
my city got or so i can only name however and i m pretty sure one is wrong xavier university and leceo university
wait like just colleges or schools in general cause we got tons
assuming colleges makes it even dumber motherfucker you don t know what school accepted you
my college had multiple schools within the school all on a city campus there was a building that had your general classes like english foreign languages math etc but anything that was for your major was usually in its own building there was engineering nursing theater law and a think a few others that i just can t remember i got lost as a freshman at that college it s really easy to do you can be in the completely wrong building wrong school if you are new and don t know any better or are just not paying attention
i mean i m assuming college
nah universities have dozens of big poorly labeled buildings spread out across huge campuses i could see someone confusing one giant building with another especially if they had to commute
i have seen a collage that had two campuses where one was in the middle of the city and i heard the campus was super far away from the main one
then i got it right thank you for the confirmation lad
over in georgia georgia state university has a bunch of satellite campuses as a result of expansions mergers over the years

hey as long as it s a priest doing the inspection it s okay right
no you people don t understand conservative want to look at and fondle little kids junk so the groomers don t molest them
drag queens are trying to read to our children that s it we ve had enough of those sickos and their books kids show us your genitals
it s not ok
because that s their ultimate goal they are obsessed with little children and want an excuse to get their hands on them i wasn t molesting that child i was inspecting them only pedophile libs molest children as a parent there s no way in hell
not that i approve because i don t but who s going to be doing these inspections anyway are they going to be doctors or is it going to be the fucking coach or principal
why am i convinced this guy didn t read the bill or whatever motion they voted on is this like the don t say gay bill from florida or the supposedly racist voting bill from georgia
aren t physical exams done by physicians
i really don t get how people actual believe that it s rage bait to get people riled up the bull says no such thing about genital inspections jumping to this conclusion is idiotic they haven t decided on how they determine if a person is trans maybe a logical person who reads the bill would think hey a birth certificates are required to enroll in kansas schools so if the person is trying out for a female sports team you check the gender on the birth certificate
was this not already standard practice i had to do this
shit like this twitter exchange is why people don t believe the media and shouldn t believe social media posts your comments on this just show how quick you are to jump at headlines like this no where in this bill it s only two pages read it does it say anything about inspection at all http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023\_24/measures/hb2238/
any organized sport requires a physical be hysterical someplace else
when transgender activists started bringing children s activities into their activism they knew it might get pushback and in some places it has backfired spectacularly sports physicals are very common when i was in school we had to have one every year to be able to play sports in school i don t see how a doctor visually verifying if someone has male or female genitalia is particularly harmful or intrusive there s also the option of providing a birth certificate to prove gender
gif giphy d8loynwatmxblqjczo
wont a birth certificate serve whatever purpose they need this for
what the actual fuck is going on down there guys i like to think the majority of you are reasonable people but this shit keeps popping up and becoming law are there really that many homophobic cultist people that this all really flies i get sports need gender protected divisions but fuck off with this
in what exactly would the criteria be for these inspections is it going to be a standard practice amongst all or they going to cherry pick who they are going to inspect this is fucked either way anybody with a conscious this boycott playing sports all together in kansas
ahh the classic rules for thee but not for me scenario gotta hate em

its an exam wouldnt it be done by a physician
probably proud republican volunteers
physicians like that olympic doctor that was molesting the little girls
if there s a valid medical reason yes there s no valid medical reason here just pedophilia
i m not sure how else they would know as you can now change your gender marker on your government id and birth certificate
when asked how it would be enforced lawmakers clarified that it would be by physical exam so yeah not an inspection an exam completely different
i never had a sports physical as a child that required them to examine my genitals
there is no valid medical reason for these examinations it s just plain straight up child molestation you should have expected pushback when you chose to defend pedophilia
it s the worst case scenario your kid is doing well in your sport she actually has some skill to show but here comes nosy as fuck mrs carson she s the one who attends the pta meetings every week to call for morning prayer at school so we dont stray further from god also she wanted the muslim kid expelled because school isn t a place for some religions she has more than once called the cops because someone took her parking space when picking up her kid which brings us to the heart of the matter her kid was top spot but this yeah she s really more focused on becoming an influencer than she is on track and field so she got second whatever who cares not her that s for sure but you can bet your ass that mrs carson and she d die before she d accept that maybe her kid just wasn t the best so she ll insist that your daughter is a man and try to turn her whole church against your family now because she won first place your kid has to be inspected by the coach s assistant in the first aid room just to shut everyone up because rumours are going around and half the town thinks that your kid is trans and they re mad as hell because it affects them somehow the worst part is that even after this invasion none of the people who are angry about it are even going to care that your kid didn t do anything isn t who they say she is etc etc they ll never admit they were wrong and they will continue to bully and harass that kid until she s afraid to ever leave the house not even for being trans like that s a crime somehow it will simply be because for a brief moment your kid was better than the crazy ladies kid that s the goal here enabling fascism making about sports integrity is a smokescreen and a joke they just want to have pretext to fuck people over
haha are you going to start with jeffrey epstein the same guy that hung out with trump for decades good job

donald trump indicted for human trafficking and forcing a minors to engage in sexual activity i can copy paste stuff from the other side of the aisle too
now do republicans
how many items on that list mitigate the new law your post is the equivalent of saying dems can get to kids genitals so we want to too
do you have a notepad file on your desktop ready to copy paste this lol guess what whataboutism is still a shitty argument you proved nothing
not according to what it says i think it said officials
top donors get first dibs
no like the of physicians that are not like that
you know that theres shit people in literally every profession right like even if he said electrician theres prolly an electrician out there that did that not really a gotya
if it isn t in the bill then there isn t much hope for it i looked for a reference for that but could only find vague ones i did see a few references that state that anyone in kansas participating in school sports has to have a physical examination from a physician if i see a reliable quote that there will be genital examinations specifically for this i will join you in condemning it
common response truth is that epstein had insanely more ties to dems like clinton than he ever did to trump fyi i don t like trump
it is almost like people are awful no matter who they prefer to vote for
they did a longer list above if you want to see it all sides have awful people but i am glad that someone listed theirs too n this case pedos suck no matter the party but r s certainly win the let s force our coaches to look at kids genitals contest r s think they won here so tell me now who are the groomers in this case maybe those who are so afraid of maybe one kid at a school if that who might play a sport they all need psych evals all of this for the of americans who are trans saw the statistic in an article i cannot verify full accuracy but it sounds right so for the maybe one kid at each school these poor kids all have to show you sickos i am pissed i do not like kids as in not going to have them yes kids can be cute do not have kids but as a yo who suffered sexual abuse this horrifies tf outta me
read the law that the post is about there is not one single thing in there about inspections of kids it is only two pages read it don t do a knee jerk on a title x200b http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023\_24/measures/hb2238/](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2238/)
insanely more ties i don t really see the value of this distinction whatever it is supposed to mean it s like saying yeah the guy is a pedophile and raped kids but this other pedophile raped more kids why even bother making this distinction
yeah a bunch of democrats have been seen with epstein multiple times spanning decades it s just the deep state hiding it not to mention wishing maxwell convicted international trafficker of under age girls well they re all doing it gtfo of here
the difference kind of is the guy calling out democrats got downvoted the guy calling out republicans got upvoted people don t care about who the pedophile is they only care what political party they re associated with a generation has been brainwashed into thinking one side is more evil than the other as opposed to just seeing shit people on both sides kind of scary how easily people are manipulated
house bill has zero language to address gender dysphoria just as your post had nothing to with op s post sentences knee jerk item list rational post stop clutching your pearls
it was in response to his attempt to tie epstein to trump as some sort of gotcha trump banned epstein from mar a lago because of his proclivities for underage girls
oh damn i didn t notice that people are evil and stupid
bingo
part of that is the guy that posted demos was trying to have a gotchya moment the guy posting repubs was a ya people suck moment granted no thats not all the upvotes just saying i would be more likely to upvote the second one to counter the gotchya
yeah guys trump prefers his daughter
very evil and stupid indeed trying times we are in

or his safest option to get out of the gang life i don t know shit about gangs but i just think there might be a reason why he would walk out like that
play stupid games win stupid prizes
kids think they are so invincible it s actually cringe
should have given him a free tune up
when keeping it real goes wrong
what a stupid bitch
stupid is as stupid does
can anyone clue me into to what the officer is doing with that key lock type thing in his chest pocket after cuffing i ve never seen that tia
that was avoidable
why does he just toss the gun like that they can be hardy but you never know especially if they re coming from a gangbanger and that he s a kid too
honestly this is the one thing i would be happy to hand out instant life sentences for have a criminal record or membership of a gang and found carrying a firearm goodbye
how on earth does he have a fully automatic pistol those are illegal
ahh dumb criminal vs dumb gp criminal
that s a pretty shade pretext tho
cop didn t move while someone was exiting the store
he could have gone about his but had to be the tough guy one less dipshit in the street
so smart lol
that is one possibility other reason could be that he is testing other people and picking a fight
exactly carrying a stolen weapon and then you deliberately bump into a cop
it s a pin that engages a double lock
it stops the cuffs from getting any tighter
because he doesn t care if it goes off
do you realize how many people we would have to house and pay for until they die taxes would skyrocket to pay for it
that seems overly harsh
he was holding the door for the stupid little bitch who purposely bumped into him and then laid down like a stupid little bitch
just tax the massively wealthy
there are many crimes now which locking up people for is completely counterproductive in terms of reducing recidivism and enabling them to live after release there are much better ways to deal with these things in communities gun violence is the exception not only for the carnage it creates but for the general terror it spreads in communities and the ways it forces ordinary people to live and limit their lives the only way to end it is to increase the risk for criminals of carrying a weapon to the point that it no longer becomes worth it sure they might shift to something else but nowhere nearly as deadly and indiscriminate as guns
well besides taxing the wealthy who some has billions and millions to spare behind this set of words is serious talk everything past this is sarcasm or s could just reintroduce the death penalty and ppv that shit not only will you save money you ll make money s
and jail or execute the corporate criminals
could we not tax the wealthy and use the money for mental health facilities and rehabilitation
the ways to end gun violence are mental health care income equality rehabilitation for all convicted persons and prohibiting the media from making mass shooters famous life in prison serves no purpose other than hiking our taxes and flooding our facilities with people
lmao sounds like a solid plan
the roots of mass shootings which make up a tiny percentage of total gun fatalities and shootings linked to drugs and other criminal gang activities are very different as are their solutions the efficacy of mental health care is rather dependent on the willingness of the person needing it to engage with the process i don t see this happening with many gang members for whom any suggestion that they might be mentally ill would probably not have a great reaction income equality is never going to happen in this or any other society i d be interested in solutions which are actually going to have a chance of being implemented or indeed work how would you also propose limiting media coverage of mass shooters who are again responsible for a tiny percentage of total gun deaths could they voluntarily do it maybe but you re not going to be able to enforce anything
income equality with whom criminals

i live close to yellowstone the questions some tourists ask or how they think wildlife live are hilarious at times just because it says park doesn t mean we feed them so you can see them by the road also i d like to add deer crossings are picked by the deer not the park
i met a fully grown adult who used raid fly and wasp killer like midge mosquito repellent and then sprayed it on their kids the bear thing does not surprise me luckily we don t have bears in the uk
lol did they spray the tent at bed time
my wife s uncle was a park ranger in montana and he once sent us a guide regarding bear encounters it mostly outlined precautions one should take while enjoying the parks where he worked for instance bears for the most part do not like encountering humans and will avoid us if possible the guide advised making noises while hiking perhaps tying small jingle bells to your clothes and carrying pepper spray was also suggested knowing what kind of bear was in the vicinity was also a good idea and can be identified by examining their scat black bear scat is small hard piles and contains mostly vegetative matter and maybe the bones of small animals brown bear scat is larger and has the bones of larger animals grizzly bear scat is larger still and often is full of small jingle bells and smells like pepper
people spray it on themselves like it s bug spray but really it s pepper spray for bears
embarrassing story time one of my earliest memories is me taking my mom s pepper spray from her keys and spraying it straight into my underwear boy was that a fun day evening night and early morning
okwildlifedept always put out humorous post like this we bearly even have bears in oklahoma
the backstory seems pretty obvious
https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/11y0wlt/aita_for_reminding_my_relatives_not_to_touch_my/
so you let the bear get close enough and spray it in their face and they leave is that how it works is it painful for them or a smell that they don t like we don t have bears here so i m curious
be cool if it did though
when i worked at yellowstone i watched a man lineup himself wife and kids and sprayed like it was sunscreen
the backstory for this was so good it got adapted to film and leonardo dicaprio won an oscar for it
here s a backstory https://www.backpacker.com/survival/bears/pro-tip-bear-spray-goes-on-the-bear-not-on-you/
i live in an area surrounding by parks camp grounds and so on every year we get city people who come to see the squirrels nature in general i get that you from new york or chicago may have never seen a dear and are to used to rats with wings but the least you could do is a little research to create reasonable expectations
ok but how high is the spf
the backstory is that people are using bear spray like bug spray
weird to start a tweet with listen
i thought it was beer spray i need sleep
yep it works like a menthol spray
well the backstory must be wild
the sole fact that they had to officially state this it s actually disturbing
the ok dep of wildlife twitter person has a killer good sense of humor back in november december they had a whole thread about not bringing mountain lions inside just because its cold out it was funny af
you need a stick and a circle
only in ok
holy shit the bot army ramped up last week it in this sub was harmful scambots reposting this week it is over
this was actually not prompted by a specific incident although i kinda wish it had been from the oklahomes wildlife department website that particular post wasn t prompted by any specific bear related incident adams told nexstar rather it was designed as a means to spread awareness for conservation efforts and the wildlife of oklahoma s great outdoors they ve been having fun with their social media
shit you want the story i want the video lol
that s what he said
most likely sprayed it around the campsite hilarity ensued
that twitter account is pure chaos and i love them for it
oh jesus i really hope someone didn t spray themselves with bear spray when i was a park ranger i carried it and we had to have special training so we were ready when you use it some will blow back and get you as well the stuff is classified as a pesticide and it s supposedly like a stronger version of pepper spray for anyone thinking of carrying it instead of a gun you have to know what you are getting into it s extremely short range and only distracts the bear for a little bit if you are lucky they will decide to eat the spray instead of you if you aren t you will only distract the bear for a minute or two hopefully you can use that time to get away and aren t writhing in pain yourself
someone probably sprayed bear mace on themselves or others
make common sense common again remove warning labels
the damn deer are not using the designated crossing points
please move the deer crossing sign https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfcrjleggri)
oh that just move the deer crossing skit
gif giphy xt5lmqe4tf6zbtnjgq downsized
aw so paddington isn t real
oh my fucking god
i don t understand pepper spray why are you so afraid of being attacked by a plant
why
haha bearly even have bears i get it
tell that to norman animal control
their tiktok is pretty amusing too
that was my first thought does ok even have bears so had to look it up about of them in the eastern mts so now i know ok has bears and mts in the east
well sure but i like op wonder if there is a back story like was someone was truly unlucky enough to have literally done this see below my post link to reddit post where someone did this exact thing and if they did i wanna know the fun deets where was it applied how long did the pain last severity of pain why did they do it do they normally not read labels vs did someone tell them it worked that way etc i would love how many times have they run into this if true and was an ambulance called for any of these i used to work in ems so am honestly curious on this point so yep it is obvious but am so hoping it was a joke and no one did this ir can you imagine the burning yikes working in ems i responded to the aftermath of people doing dumb shit like this all the time and i love the stories behind how these things happen the stories i have
so uhhh cool post ig
yes you spray the bear approaching you it s the same sht as mace and self defense sprays one tip watch the wind and do not breath when spaying
it s pepper capsicum spray but stronger yeah it s not nice for the bear and blinds them so either they flee or you can run away while it s blind
i think they have a pretty far spraying distance i think in the feet kind of distance unlike people animals won t risk getting hurt for a meal a small injury can be life or death to them in the wild so not being able to see or smell just for a bit can get them kill so they rather not risk it of course if their desperate l no much is going to stop them tho
well bugs spray suck anyways
wasn t it animals have fur you don t they re fine outside
lets fine them
they re jaywalking uh oh
i was waiting to see this pop up
the funniest part of that video to me is how close she comes to a point someone could actually argue but she just can t understand something incredibly basic cause like you could maybe argue in places with lots of traffic or lots of car accidents involving deer to add things to the side of the road to discourage deer from crossing there it probably wouldn t work but maybe but no if you think that deer are crossing the road because of the signs it would never occur to you that the local or state government should spend money to reduce the number of deer crossings and if someone point that out it s just cheaper to move the signs and it would probably be a good idea to move them to school crossings because mixing deer and children wouldn t cause any issues
mf make my tounge go hafhaufhahaha
makes the eyes and lungs feel a bit hot
i put it on food it s when you get it in your eyes and peehole
why would year old kids do anything
probably thought the underwear had handled noxious chemicals in the past and only slight signs of wear so safe to spray teens do the same thing with something called axe
oh right ouachita range could have some bears i always manage to forget that part of my state exists and is not just flat n windy
thnx i was wondering
i m not sure about black bears but for the grizzlys up here you re noy supposed to spray to bear directly as it ll only get them mad spray a barrier in between you and the bear to discourage an attack
you re not the boss of me
i love that in the end he s just like well i guess we ll try to get the word out for you after he confirms that she has indeed talked to a lot of people about this no doubt they have tried to explain it to her so he just knows it isn t worth it to try
teens will drown themselves in axe but if you tell them to just take a shower bitch and moan bitch and moan

they added parents remember that outside food is not allowed please refrain from sending or bringing fast food to your child to the weekly newsletter for my son s middle school the second week of school and have yet to remove it i m guessing parents aren t remembering
my kids always comes back hungry from the school dinners she insisted she wanted to try cause most of her friends were on it i m beginning to think it s not worth me paying for them if she s still hungry at the end of the day especially if she s being fed crap when i can just make her a packed lunch that i know she ll like and will ensure she s not hungry
i m old but i think back to the days of lunchtime if a lunch from one of my favorite places was delivered to me would have been super happy school lunches were not all that bad back in the day but this would be a special treat from the parents dad would never have tolerated it
given the pictures i ve seen of school lunches on here i don t blame them maybe serve shit that isn t on par with prison food
we stopped allowing it at our school as well the previous year we would get countless orders being brought in labeled by the name of a parent grandparent or aunt uncle the deliverer wouldn t know which student it was for only the person who ordered it often times the name of the orderer wasn t on any of our lists making it near impossible to figure out who s it was we would then spend a bit of time interrupting every classroom to see who doesn t have a lunch and trying to deduce who it is for eventually it just got tiresome because it was an every day thing we have no problem parents or whichever family member dropping off a student s lunch in the office since they ll know who they are bringing it for but random deliverers from grub hub nope
when i was in high school a friend s dad opened a burger joint walk up only seating was in your car near the school many students went there for lunch after a couple of weeks an announcement was made threatening suspension for anyone eating lunch there the reasoning was that a burger and coke was an unhealthy meal the cellophane wrapped hotdogs and burgers in the snack bar were perfectly acceptable the reason simple the profits from the snack bar supported the football team my parents required me to eat in the school cafeteria they remembered how good and plentiful the school food was when they were in school my mom worked in the cafeteria one year when times got tough when she saw the current state of school food i never had to eat school food again if outside food is prohibited the parents should start asking the tough questions
tell me your school food sucks without telling me your school food sucks
i don t understand why this is a facepalm letting a lot of delivery drivers onto the elementary school campus is letting a large number of non parent strange adults onto an elementary school and potentially in contact with children most schools have a system for checking in legitimate adult visitors but having a large number of deliverypeople show up you re bound to get some who don t understand the system and create a security risk
i d like to think this is less about the school lunch and more about trying to mitigate random people coming and going out of the school bc of this little thing called school shootings and yes i know it could happen anyway but just another random person on reddit shouting their opinion into the void
there will always be rules and there will always be those that break them at my high school they had software on every school computer that blocked the majority of sites that weren t regularly used for academics you couldn t even use wikipedia or other websites that while not being strictly required were highly useful or at least not really objectionable a genius in the school figured out how to get around their software and they released it to the students the ingenious part was it ran off of a usb flash drive no actual install required you plug in the drive run the program and you were all set what ensued was a fun game of cat and mouse the school caught on and had their techies patch the software then the student developed a new version that would work again and on and on it went it was something everyone knew was going on staff included but it wasn t ever openly addressed good times
maybe enable parents to work a sane amount of hours to be able to put food on the table probably working doubles just to pay for mcdoubles
my music theory teacher senior year of high school would order chinese and pizza since our class was before lunch and have it delivered to the band room s side door i loved that class got caught with a pizza box once by the principal going outside to the senior seating area and told them it was a different teacher everyone hated who ordered it
why isn t school lunch just free for real just stop messing and let kids eat their fill the us already fucks the entire adult population sans a few old white assholes no need to diddle the kids like this
my school has a cafeteria with sub par overpriced food but we are given the option to leave the building to get food as well as bring a packed lunch they did also mention that they won t allow any delivery driver into the building so anyone who orders food must be outside the school to pick it up otherwise the delivery person will be asked to leave more schools should have this
school food is like prison food
i live in an area that is somehow rich and poor when i was in high school parents would bring their kids lunch like pizza for their friends or mcdonald s or some times i d pick up breakfast for my friend group eventually a kid complained because it wasn t fair that these other kids could afford fast food which led to no outside food whatsoever
fuck em let the kids eat whatever
i remember in elementary when i had to stop going for what tasted the best and instead go for what filled me up the most just cause i wasn t getting enough from the tasty food
these are the same parents that block the road at a bust stop because there little angels can t stand and wait for the bus
as a former doordasher i wish more schools would ban this i hated school deliveries most schools don t allow it and the students order it anyway and then want you to meet them in the back somewhere at a certain time it doesn t work that way we get the order when we get the order and i m not wasting my time sitting there for mins waiting for you to get out of class to hand you the food you didn t pay me for minutes of my time and we don t see those instructions before hand and you knew that was against the rules i will deliver straight to the office and let you get in trouble you know the rules you knew better many times the office won t accept it and i get to call doordash and tell them deliveries here are prohibited and thanks for the free meal and then the parents students who send hand it to me orders but the students are in class once my time is up and the office doesn t allow us to leave the orders after sitting in the office waiting the allotted amount of time thanks for the free food much appreciated not to mention half the time the office doesn t even know who it is for because it s some grandparent or aunts name on it if you are a school that allows deliveries by all means go ahead and order but please do not pick hand it to me many times that child can t even get out of class at the time we arrive and again as stated before nobody knows who it s for let us drop it off on the rack in the office and put their name on it the way the office has it set up and they will get their food and everyone will be happy
it s less about the meal and more of security yes they should feed the kids better food but from a school legal security perspective having so many different people come through is just not feasible for todays situation now with all the school shooting and shit if every parent is ok with the school not being libel with the kid s safety then go for it in fact just have them stop at the roads and the kids can go grab their lunch that way
my kids high school won t allow any food drop offs at all from parents or food delivery apps
confused european here wtf are you doing over there
i was very malnourished from a young age because my mother preferred her drugs over my siblings and i living not living comfortably hell not even living meagerly to the point that the school lunches which are free in my state for underprivileged families parent just needs apply and there is very little investigation weren t even able to be given to me because of the debt i d already accrued from her inaction regardless of whether or not i believe schools should charge for lunch is irrelevant here because it was available either way just by filling out a part question they d send home every year my girlfriend had graduated a year before me and had noticed i was getting lethargic and there was a lot more sleeping and exposed ribs lately and started bringing me taco bell from her job and we d share lunch i was a senior and we were allowed to drive and leave for the exact same meal we even had an outdoor courtyard to eat in with access to the parking lot for that exact reason my school decided to be healthy and inflicted that on everyone else too meaning that while they still didn t particularly care an alumni was eating with me they banned the taco bell i didn t fight or argue by that point in my life i felt like a kicked dog enough as it is just accepted that the food would stop and that either i d get by or i wouldn t my girlfriend now wife partner was still very well loved by a few of the staff my english teacher in particular and they made a back room deal where she d leave it by the teachers fire door and the teacher using her fire alarm resistant key could sneak it to me right before class started the girlfriend just traded the taco bell bag for a bunch of plain brown paper ones from costco so that the deans were none the wiser my reason for saying all this fuck if i know this debate just brings up memories of how my school would rather me starve to death than get fat
everyone who is saying make your kid a lunch every day you lazy fuck evidently doesnt know what its like to slave your life away some people simply dont have the time to do that dont get me wrong i agree i wouldnt want dozens of deliveries to the cafeteria every shift either but just because someone cant pack their kid a lunch doesnt mean theyre lazy
don t they know that schools hold exclusive contracts with certain fast food companies to sell lunch that prohibit this
my kids schools have signs up saying they won t deliver the food to the kids if you order food sent the fact that parents will order food for their kids like that instead of just providing lunch or money for school lunch it s ridiculous
wtf happened to lunch boxes
i m a teacher and we have a huge banner that says no deliveries will be allowed during school time students can t get to the gate so that means that someone from school had to do the whole thing for them and they got tired it s not their job also morning students have lunch at the same time that the afternoon students arrive so is a whole mess
i wish that was out when i was in high school
same but with our highschool
i m just guessing here but i don t think the issue isn t the food itself but the fact that a bunch of random strangers are coming onto the school property i remember when i was in high school they were so paranoid that they had a deputy present on campus just to watch and meet anyone who came onto the property outside expected hours like the beginning and end of school
and when i was in school i couldn t even afford to eat lunch everyday from the cafeteria
good i m sure it was incredible hurtful to the poor students to constantly see privileged students get another advantage they don t have
i am tired of pretending that people aren t addicted to the room service appeal of delivery services like doordash of course you also send up paying hotel premiums for the food and extra fees for the delivery so it s not a bad analogy oh and most of the stuff you get is basically steamed by the time you get it
wtf they were allowed to do that in the first place
parents please stop trying to give your children real good tasting some what nutritious food
at least they feed their kids schools need to be worried about other things i don t need to mention
i m guessing this all started cause one dude s wife went out of town and he was too lazy to pack a lunch and then all the kids went home and told their parents how some kid got a personal uber delivery
the high school i work at has banned all food deliveries by outside organizations only parents may drop off food for their students it s absolutely out of control
if school meals weren t a joke this wouldn t be an issue
maybe if the food didn t suck ass
good i don t want some random fuckin stranger roaming around my kid s school who probably hocked a loogy in my kids lunch because i didn t tip fuck that and all y all saying well have you seen school lunches yeah and have you seen the cost of doordash deliveries if you can afford doordash you can afford to have groceries delivered to your house and make your damn kids lunch lazy fucks
umm maybe because they don t allow unknown adults into the school dumb af gregg and yes the extra g is fucking stupid
maybe they could serve up some half decent food so people don t need to send their kids food from outside maybe employ a couple of people who know how to cook
why d they have to stop them
i mean to be fair kids are forced to eat the garbage served by the crusty old lunch lady why should they have to settle for sodexo
when i was in hs from to i wouldnt have called what they served us food
rich kids
that s how most parents cook now
i remember in elementary when i had to stop going for what tasted the best and instead go for what filled me up the most just cause i wasn t getting enough from the tasty food
i was a picky eater when i was young my mom would bring me a burger sometimes and the staff would make me eat it in the back office lol they didn t want the less fortunate to feel some kind of way
ha ha if your parents weren t so poor you would have chick fil a too
and this is how i learned that living with divorced parents is not the same as living in a broken home
school shootings are also super disruptive but here we are so i ll ask my kids their friends what they d like delivered for lunch today
how can they afford grub hub and door dash but not a school lunch or a packed lunch to be clear i disagree with the rule i m just curious about the budgeting the only scenario i m coming up with is that the parents are buying this food on credit which is far more concerning
no they have to buy our food in the building they are legally required to be in or starve
when s the last time you ate a school lunch
that s sad as fuck having a school so shit that kids are being fed by locals stop bitching at the parents it s a perfect solution for them fix your broken shit school
say kids gather round while i tell you the time when mothers and father use to make lunch for their offspring better food and saved a couple o nickels too guess those days are gone i figure
i think the facepalm here is the schools offering such shit food that busy likely full time working parents feel the need to deliver stuff to their children bc they don t have the time to make food lunches parents shouldn t be so busy they can t make their kids lunches schools shouldn t offer such shit food that nobody feels full from them or wants to eat them nobody should have to worry about who enters schools because all adults should be good and safe people however this is not the case a lot of this are issues perpetuated by america s shit ass society and lousy government with the last little bit just being the disgusting and vile nature of humans
meals obviously get dropped at the front office nobody is roaming your kids school many schools have garbage lunch and it s not free nobody said parents are buying delivery every single day if a school has kids then multiple kids may be getting a single delivery per day a birthday or other special occasion y all keep making it out to be lazy parents for no reason some people are way more busy than you or have incredibly shitty situations that don t always equate to being as broke as you are other kids being jealous is not a good reason kids shouldn t have treats that s reflective of real life
i could see this happening when kids forget their lunch money or run out in their account schools love stealing lunches back from the kids and leaving them with nothing or a piece of bread can t blame parents for having food sent when the other option is so bad
make your kids a lunch box you lazy fucks
maybe make the lunches healthier and fresher i dunno just a thought
i feel like they need to allow foods delivered from a delivery service in schools because the crap they serve is expired and disgusting
parent be like but my son only eats chick fila chicken nuggets
my school district provide food to all the kids some things to consider random strangers coming on campus is a risk disrupt classroom time lunch is and drivers were showing up at etc delivery creates a class conflict where more affluent get lunches while the poor kids get district food for high school i would prefer they allow open campus but they don t
sure as soon as you stop taking it in your offices
good delivering to schools sucks
this would imply packed lunches are also a problem this is only an issue because some people are whiners and can t let shit go
maybe provide food that isn t garbage so this doesn t have to happen
so they can force kids to buy food from them right
maybe serve better food so students and staff don t need to order out
where s the facepalm
so they won t give kids free lunches in schools and parents can t send food to their kids sigh good to know the adults in the room are looking out for the kids s
same parents are complaining that school lunches are too expensive like wtf
probably want to minimize strangers on campus
oh no the children are getting food how are we supposed to let them starve and fill their skull with unnecessary shite
grub hub being used by parents for their kids at school is one of the greatest things i ever heard kids get to eat things that the parents know they ll approve of while not having to spew money into a cafeteria that you are far more likely to get sick from win win
i d rather have the delivery driver deliver me food in school then eat whatever fucking sludge i see on wendsday afternoon
why didn t i think of that here i ve been making packed lunches for my kids for years i feel like a chump
i fail to see a single reason why a child getting food delivered to them would be disruptive maybe if school food didn t fucking suck
wait that s actually brilliant shouldn t the school encourage this and maybe create a system for doordash guys
i mean that happens at offices what is the facepalm that people are trying to eat food that they want just throw up some rules on how to order and get it facilitate it
first of all nobody needs to come in the school but most of all they can eat what s being served i spent years getting up making lunches and got my boys to their 650am bus pickup cause they had food allergies i worked until 6pm and picked them up from aftercare it s possible people your little pookie won t die if ya say no every once in awhile by highschool they can pack their own lunch
what s the face palm there s many facets to this oi honestly don t know which one is the obvious one
then serve better food to the kids damn it
they would rather there kids have like mcdonald s then school lunch s
how dare they feed their children instead of paying us for nasty slop that barely resembles a meal
this is a direct result of a serious problem in our culture that problem being our collective disdain distrust and disgust with cheap communal food options school lunches famously shat on cafeteria style eateries i e golden corral famous for being diarrhea fuel soup kitchens only for dirty poor people all of the above are also held as having intrinsically bad food poor cleanliness and poor nutritional value this is a major problem urban societies simply can not function properly with working class making all of their own meals there s simply not enough time in the day even if capitalism was not forcing many people to work several jobs in the first place cooking and the subsequent cleaning can take up to hours of your day and if you re working hours hours minute lunch minutes on either end for commute getting dressed etc then that time spent cooking adds up fast now to consult the triangle cost time quality you may only pick the only feasible solution to this problem is cafeterias and dining halls for you should be able to sit down with a portion of say calories and a cup of water fast food was a solution to this for a long time but now a big mac meal is and the drive through averages minutes all this to say sorry for the rant but the kids at school should just be eating from the cafeteria please do not come into my comments with oh well i got a dirty sock in my lunch one time because you know who didn t the other kids that they served that day part of the issue here is individualism main character syndrome if you will where american s will individually have bad experiences with large systems and assume that those problems are pervasive school lunches are enough for the vast majority of kids and this nonsense of kids being sent grub hub at elementary school is literally insane
y all literally judge ppl for everything so what if the parent doesn t make their child some home made school lunch they re still feeding their child regardless ppl will find an issue with anything these days
this is dumb who cares what parents are buying their kids
so guilty
gif giphy 30wgcjb7wu8jw
i remember my high school in the early s bringing in food from both taco bell and pizza hut in an effort to keep students on campus during lunch time it kinda worked
got to high school as they fazed out the vendors and non fat reduced food the only good thing at lunch was the pizza the chicken sandwiches and the carrots that s it i don t blame them
im a massive fucking hypocrite because i use these services from time to time when i m lazy but i really wish they didn t exist
maybe serve something healthy and decent in the cafeteria

the abusive perverts are bad enough but the fact that the church continues to protect these assholes by covering up their crimes de facto enabling them to continue abusing nobody should give money to that fucked up organization
over years is actually way less than i expected
nah i think we need to investigate all the church pedos around
they gotta have some way to control the plebes
gif giphy 2w5nzaijqbbif9gi2y
good now charge them accordingly and tax the churches fuck these scumbags
if they read their bible like they were supposed to they would know that eventually all sin will find you out or whatever numbers says
sure that sounds bad but just remember that churchers would drag their screaming kids to the same priest that molested them and their father just saying
why tf nobody invite me to drag brunch
no facepalm ban everything until every last abuser is successfully prosecuted
too many gays becoming priests back in the day we would just burn them
both parties are child predators
they re both wrong and gross
honestly i am surprised the numbers are so low only and only years that s only per year and only counting since the 1960s
the problem is that people post about everything and these guys did it for years without posting on the gram about all their exploits apparently if you keep preferences behind closed doors nobody cares
if you want to read more about it here s an ap link https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-archdiocese-sex-abuse-report-7d5d3af098da59a1c9313a246566638c).
note also that priests wear frocks
i think that s sarcasm
ye difference is parents aren t dragging kids to be abused by a priest in the name of wokeness
it s a problem no matter where it is it isn t either or
it s not even de facto they transfer them to another parish wait until the accusations there become too much and do it again forever sometimes people die https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryan_erickson
victims a year probably abused multiple times i think it s safe to say that this is covering thousands of individual incidents and that s just the ones we ve found out about in this one area around baltimore
that a single diocese was withholding evidence on who know how many within the church never got reported to the church that the church knew about not like the priest are all walking up to their bishop to tell them how many kids they fucked that week so there is likely many more that were not caught
it s not a massive number but anything over is still too many
probably just one church
it indeed seems off by a factor of if we compare it to other areas countries like france have only 20x the population of this archdiocese but hundreds of thousands of cases
that link got me started down a rabbit hole the ap article says more than catholic priests are accused for things that happened over the last years so i was wondering how many priests they have in that particular diocese and as i was looking for the answer to that question i instead found their own web page that names all of the priests and brothers from their diocese that have been accused of sexually abusing one or more children it s really jarring to scroll through and see how long it goes https://www.archbalt.org/child-and-youth-protection/priests-and-brothers-accused-of-abuse/
jesus was pretty woke he hated moneylenders liked to hang out with outcasts and offered free healthcare
sometimes they just skip that and move the priest to a country with lax law enforcement usually in afriica

we need to quit calling these folks pro life they re pro birth they quit giving af about the time you hit school
wow
so since they re happy about the outcome now everyone is forced to keep their rapist s baby
what s next they re going to justify school shootings because they are going to die anyways
i wonder how many children he s raped
holup i read it as she married the rapist and had more kids and that s his dad
maga
one of the most tone deaf justifications for america s current work on women
sounds to me like he s pro rape but with extra steps
you people are wild just because you disagree with him you go straight to assuming the worst of him i wonder how many children he s raped i interpret that as my mom got r ped at so it s okay if others do too like come on that s really not at all what he is saying what he is saying is that a person he cares about maybe even him wouldn t have been born at all if they got aborted demonizing him just because he has a different opinion than you doesn t seem like a healthy or productive approach
she hated him her entire life you can bet money on that continue to fool yourself
they breed them young down south
my mom got raped but society said that s nice pleas keep getting raped how blessed is our family
liberals we better abort some babies so our sex grooming pipeline is more manageable
the most important thing i ve leaned about these issues is arguing with others on the internet definitely changes peoples minds to your views s
deleted
what does blessed memory mean
ummm what now
i m not sure what to think about this
what
i had to read this aloud to myself because my brain refused to process it
your mother shield you and her other kids and dealt with the trauma and the hardship of life the unimaginable you didn t have a blessed life you had a mother that made sure her children have a normal life considering the circumstances she did not drag you into what happened to her your blessing had nothing to do with her rape and everything to do with how she decided to deal with it at the tender age of unbelievable
wait did his dad rape his mom when she was
that s enough internet for today
you know the five more children with my dad part is a tiny tiny bit questionable since it s easy to read it as five more children with the same father who was also my mom s rapist but they were very happy together
sounds like what i expected the home life of a pro lifer to be
plot twist his parents are bother and sister i think that is the only way to resolve this dudes logic
he s gotta be trolling
his mom could have focused on being a kid and following her passions but of course that doesn t matter because pro lifers don t think women are people
gay and the family diosowned him
great teacher really seems to care about what i have no idea
oh i think you think you think you now what your talking about
yes that s what it means
according to this clown one little girl s life should be destroyed based on the actions of grown ass criminal
his oldest sister was something good that came from a horrible crime if she d been aborted he never would have known her or had fond memories of her
the message is that a child even of rape is still a person with worth and dignity just because they came into this world for a terrible reason
but only until it was born after birth you re on your own no school lunches no healthcare figure it out
he didn t say when she got together with his dad or imply that he was the father of the first child
the party of choice doesn t believe it should be
well reading comprehension isn t for everyone apparently try again
that s a random thing to wonder about someone
how the fuck did you get his dad was a pedo from this she had kids with his dad including him his dad wasn t the rapist just the dude she had kids with
thanks
thanks for the clarification i have never heard that one before it sounds like something an alien would say
gender of the sibling wasn t disclosed the mother gave birth at years old the sibling in question is likely dead but we can t be certain
yes exactly then you have another year old to abuse
more children
that doesn t even make any sense
and now i m wondering how many children you ve raped because you ve got pedo vibes
no it isn t not when they re loudly advocating for child rape
i read it as she was raped at and then married the rapist and had more kids i ll take the hit for not being able to read but it could have been worded better
it is an archaic expression largely irish catholic in origin i think
yes she had more children
sure it does how loud did they scream they should have a choice to wear a mask then they cheered when women s rights were stripped from them yet they claim to be the party of freedom and choice and family values
the republicans act like they re all about freedom and choosing how to live your life but their policies are all about ensuring you make the correct choices so the comment is mocking their self perception that they re the party of choice of course they re not that s the snark
randomly accusing people of raping children because they point out that you don t understand the point of sentences you re a bright one
lol oh jeez don t you have school tomorrow children really shouldn t be on reddit loudly advocating for child rape you literally have the reading comprehension of a 2nd grader
choice is pro abortion you re thinking of anti choice
what rights weee stripped from women
oh honey you re an anti choice misogynist and you re stupid as fuck with the literacy of a recently brain damaged turnip wait that s a bit redundant isn t it
i m old enough to be your mom you stupid ignorant little piece of shit pity your mom didn t exercise her right to choose humanity would be better off
that s not what i meant by choice of course pro choice is pro abortion but the right claims to favor the right to choose in all other circumstances but then vote to strip choices from others that s my point
body autonomy where you been
reported
i m against abortion but pro choice i m a man it s not my call
i wouldn t get an abortion myself but i m not gonna tell someone else they should or shouldn t that s their choice and i m pro choice
yup not sure why the other commenters are missing it but you make sense to me
he s going down the thread replying to everyone guess he s triggered
you two agree the comment is mocking how republicans claim to be all about choice but they re not if you make a different choice than they would
yep you re right amending my comment

once again i will point out that there are safety measures in place here while it looks ridiculous he s actually quite safe
have a feeling that he knows it wont start without someone holding it to disable the safety features in the handle
there is a clutch mechanism that totally stops the chains from turning even if the motor is still on pretty sure that guy knows it because he spent less time on reddit than you
done for clicks
people in here really defending putting the chainsaw blade side facing you between your fucking legs
the gender changer
why are you filming him trying to start the chainsaw like that don t worry i made sure there s no gas in it i just want to see how long it takes him to figure out
chainsaws were originally designed go help with child birth
my initial thought was well at least he won t breed i know i know there are safeguards on chainsaws but that is putting a lot of faith in them
maybe this guy was doing everything in a safe way but after having worked in forestry and seeing chainsaw injuries there is no way i would even try it i almost cut a leg off but the faller s pants saved me chainsaws are no joke
that frustration when trying to off oneself in the most painful way possible and foiled by the safety break
op has never held a chainsaw in his hands
wow what a great way to slice your balls off
i don t care how safe everyone says this is that s an awful lot of trust to put into something that s already got problems for my part i always put the saw on the ground to crank it
please start and do the gene pool a favor
self correcting problems are for the best
this can t be real
o o
hey getting a sex change at the hospital is expensive
that s how you cut down the family tree
diy vasectomy
people here having a war about the probability impossibility of the chain spinning out but no one talking about him not wearing any safety equipment no ear or face protection and no chainsaw chap
usually that just starts the engine unless you got the trigger pulled the blade won t turn
god have him too many chances
this feels waaay to stupid to watch
diy vasectomy brought to you by 5minutecrafts
gif giphy 26n6gx9mocgs1puuk downsized
and this is why everything has warning labels that shouldn t have to be said in languages imagine being sued for not warning someone against this scenario
that s a painful way to take yourself out of the gene pool
when your saw takes this kind of effort to start and you still trust the safeties
lmao what fool
thank the maker he isn t bent forward and holding the trigger
i remember the first time i heard about chain brakes
find this guy and handcuff him until he has a months in a inpatient treatment center on how things like chainsaws for example work
you still can t fix stupid
please dont give me any ideas
i wonder why the handle is so flat
incoming darwin award
i did row clearing for a few years new row for power lines and the company was less than safe we had a saw that not only was the chain brake broken on it but the dead man s switch was too as well as the pos would die if you didn t rev it so it constantly spun now i m sure this saw is much safer than mine was but there really isn t a reason to start a saw like this i find it easier to drop start it anyway
the gun safety is on so if you point it at someone and pull the trigger it won t fire says the guy not holding the gun
people that don t know how a chainsaw works love this shit
fuck no you re relying on the friction brake at this point a small piece of nylon that you have no idea if it has been previously melted away because someone has revved it whilst it is on there are multiples ways to start a chainsaw this is not one of them
that s like pointing a loaded gun at your head and pulling the trigger and saying you re safe because the safety is on hahahahaha no
i wouldn t chance it though
it feels like the next final destination death scene you know when safety features tend to fail
actually no most saws have a cold start so the throttle is engaged regardless of having the trigger pulled
i know enough not to put full faith in machinery as things like clutches have wearable parts and snag and safety features fail
if it s as sharp as it should be then all he has to do is stumble or twist and he s doing himself a mischief either way if he is familiar with a saw them he should fucking know better than to put nonsense like this out there
ok so you go ahead and give it a shot the way he s doing it make sure you get video and lay down some plastic just in case you want to save the rug
i still wouldn t put a chainsaw on my cock not really something im willing to take a chance on
not a blade it s a chain and realistically there s a switch plus the chain brake stopping it from spinning i still wouldn t as drop starting it is easier but it s not as dangerous as it seems
it s literally in the guide when you buy a stihl chainsaw approved ways to start a saw on the ground or between your legs look it up
that s like saying there s a chance your car is gunna spin the tires when you start it in neutral as a manual litteraly the same mechanics at play
by immediately reproducing because this won t hurt him at all not sure you re going the direction you think you are
more like castration
i never treat company tools like they re brand new out of the box unless i literally opened the box even then manufacturer defects happen i don t trust cutting implements like this at all so there is a chance i would stick this between my legs
ok forgiving broken equipment he s still safe not the way i recommend starting but if everything works still safe
and the actual trigger which his hand is no where near but what do i know i only use a chainsaw months out of the year
not really sounds like you don t know anything about saws
no i would say that its just like standing in front of a started car that is on neutral
gonna guess you ve never handled a chainsaw first there is a safety throttle which unless engaged will prevent the chain from turning think deadman switch if it s not being actively pressed nothing will happen even when the motor is running second the clutch will be disengaged when the motor is only idling in order for it to engage the chain the throttle has to be squeezed which will only work if as above the safety throttle is disengaged x200b long story short the only way this chain will move is if the operator puts his hands on the handle and squeezes the throttle
i would like to know in which part of the world you can buy a chainsaw that can start without disengaging the lock in the handle just so i never buy one thats made there
you probably dont know how clutch works clutch is not safety mechanism but very important part of every engine and if it would fail there would be literally no way how to set the chain in motion edit not every engine for instance very old lawnmowers didnt have clutch and many aircrafts still dont have clutch but pretty much every chainsaw has one
never heard of tiktok do you
nothing will happen have you ever used a chainsaw
exactly but sometime you have to do proper way so you can give it some gas so it does not die from my small experience
yeah but cars have way more safety features than a chainsaw it s all about safety like never point a blade towards you or walk underneath a load being carried on a crane
safe is still a stretch he s got sharpened blades by several major blood paths the saw could never start up and still cut an artery or his genitalia
especially saws with chains
na in park just trying to turn the key
much better analogy
exactly there s no motor idle like on a car
truth however since he wants to get out started he may accidentally throttle it
when my chain saws are cold they definitely spin they rev up to about full throttle then you hit the gas to get it slow to an idle and the chain will stop spinning i have two a little husqvarna and a ms391 stihl
stihl saws in the cold you engage the trigger and press the switch to the bottom for full choke i m not sure what you are talking about as far as a safety in the handle you mean the kickback prevention part on the front the clicks on or off
i still think you shouldn t trust it enough to do what the kid in the video is doing
the clutch can still get stuck which would make this unsafe
come on of course they haven t they teach kids art not chainsaw art mind you
you sound like the kind of person who thinks it s fine to make a tiktok pointing a loaded gun at someone just because the safety is on
i ve had to hold one hand on the gas and the other on the pull cord so once it started it was spinning as for whatever reason it didn t work as well when the chain brake was on was it safe absolutely not did it work really well sometimes it was the only damn way to get it to work xd
the physical mechanics of it don t allow it to fail in the way you think
uhhh no a chainsaw clutch is a normally open held closed mechanism its base state of rest is open and therefore incapable of applying power to the chain when you hold it closed power is applied to the chain if the clutch mechanism fails it becomes incapable of applying power to the chain this only looks dangerous to people that have never used a chainsaw i personally wouldn t do it because it s much easier to start when it s on the ground but this guy is really only in danger of looking like an idiot to people who don t know what they re talking about

i once saw a chain
uh no you can t accidentally throttle it you need to depress the safety and squeeze the trigger something very hard to do in that position
you sound like someone who doesent understand how any of those things work at all
you sound like someone who should never get a driving licence due to your lack of knowledge about how gasoline powered engines work have you even ever crossed a street while driver stopped his car to let you cross it if yes then you know that even tho the engine was running the car was static and thats because clutch was dissconected simillar clutch is also in chainsaws so starting chainsaw like this is just like crossing street
pulling choke works if its cold
i know what a clutch is and why do you feel the need to reply twice never point the blade towards you is more about safety then it is about the chainsaw going off the blade is still in between his thighs
you re taking the piss right so you don t think you need throttle to get a chainsaw started maybe when it s hot but this one sounds like a cold start it sounds like he has the choke out the only safety that is in place here is a friction brake as a fun exercise have a look in your manual and find how many recommended this as the correct way to start a saw
i do enough to know you don t take unnecessary risks like that because those safetiest are not iron clad guarantees and no safety instructor will say that s ok
yes and you ll also acknowledge that people have died when clutches slipped or a malfunction knocked a gear in drive unexpectedly
i didn t feel the need to reply twice i m a filthy mobile user and sometimes it tells you that the post didn t go through so you click it again and end up posting twice
you apparantly dont there is chance anything is going to happen there my guess is that you have never used that type of chainsaw might as well have it between your legs without pulling the string
i m using a phone as well but i don t have your excuses if you re going to make a point make sure it s presentable
more like a chance of anything happening but given the enormous price of failure against the miniscule rewards for success those are not odds i d particularly like to rely on
oh fuck off lmao it s a pretty well known mobile bug
if he is able to move his arm to the backside of that handle turn his hand degrees around engage the clutch and then pull the string he is built another way than most people well there are hypermobility but seems a stretch not to even talk about being able to pull the string in that position
man you sound like a third grader as well hahaha you sure i m frustrated or is it just you

so it s good then my gameboy was always unplugged and i loved it
tell me that you are too out of touch to enjoy this movie without telling me that you are too out of touch to enjoy this movie
in case anyone want to read the article https://archive.ph/76vdb) don t worry it s an archived link so you won t be giving them any views
the original gameboy can be plugged into the wall instead of running on batteries that s what i did when my parents decided i was burning through batteries too quickly
it has all the charm of a gameboy with no batteries doesn t translate
i mean even without battery a gameboy is pretty charming i love looking at my gameboy on my shelf
critics seem to hate this movie viewers love it whose opinion are you going by critics who s literal job is to rip movies apart or the general public
same but this guy doesn t know that
yes but it was designed to be played unplugged lol having a corded option was a nice bonus playing unplugged was never a bad thing as this title implies
i can t remember the last time a critics review swayed me from seeing a movie their views almost never line up with mine about a movie or tv show
you mean the same critics who rated cuties on rotten tomatoes
the exact same the general audience consensus do you like the mario games if so you ll enjoy the movie

the damn lion barked
reminds me of the side mission for miss margaret in red dead redemption
what somebody is bored and making stuff up lol
the only liar here is op although the knoxville zoo is mourning the recent death of a lion cub so perhaps that s the inspiration
it s so cute tho i d rather see that in a zoo rather than the actual lion oh man million dollar idea dress pit bulls up as other animals in outfits just like this how cute would a whole zoo filled with pitties dressed up as wild animals don t steal my idea
lion king with down syndrome
no it s a pitbull identifying as a lion you have to respect his choice
that s not a pit bull and it isn t in a zoo though
those are microlions
it is tennessee this is probably the first person out of thousands to notice
at least it s not a shih tzu
everyone thought it was a lion until it ate a toddler
it s not even a pitbull
no he s just bilingual no need to be alarmed
ikr k town can be trashy be we ain t that trashy
i feel like a zoo with a bunch of imposter animals mixed with real ones would be cute and funny and for as much as i d like to see it i feel it d be dangerous
lol i d lose it too i don t wanna hear you talk about last night just cut my damn hair
r whyweretheyfilming
uncle phil in the next chair approves of this man s message
a good barber can hold conversation with the client and still cut hair while doing so none of this let me stand around with the clippers and talk bs i wasn t even there and i was getting frustrated
this here is the reason why i am choosy on deciding who cuts my hair
intrusive thoughts won
my in law is a barber and isn t a fan of chit chat idk how he goes to work everyday
do you people really not know a skit when you see one
is this ment for there was an attempt
happened to me when to this new barber dumbass was talking if it was illegal to walk naked in the street
he makes a good point he showed up paid his money and wants a haircut good for him expecting common decency
he s out of line but he s right edit guys this is a joke give me a break
in the original video the convi goes a whole lot longer
yo head big as shit though it s like the delay people have when they about to go on a mission they don t want to but know they have to procrastinating at it s finest
cut his hauurr
perfectly cut screams
dude s head shaped like the alien from alien lol
this gives mom talking to her friend at walmart vibes
this was an episode of undercover boss
seems staged but if it s not
a good barber can read the room and the needs of the patron carry on pleasant conversation and give a great haircut in a timely manner all at the same time similar to a bartender or a waiter i don t mind pleasantries but eventually i want my goddamn drink this is probably staged but i completely agree with the idea
this is very much real life go to flatbush nyc pick a barber shop any one you ll experience this bullshit past 7pm the liquor and reggae blasting begins
please his attempt of a jamaican accent is so funny
a hero emerges
that was an attempt to post in the right subreddit
legit this is why you don t go to barber shops those men talk and gossip more then high school kids and it takes forever
literally no tip
my reaction depends on how busy i am
this was so funny but yeah he was giving facts this even happens at work you got nothing to do go take a walk go home or ask the boss for extra work till your shift is up don t distract others whos already working
i yell like this in my dreams when my inhibitions are nonexistent i could never yell like this awake not even drunk i m just too afraid to speak up
i guarantee that guy walked out of that parlor with the exact opposite of the cut he wanted that s the reason to always respect your barber he can ruin the hair you ve been growing out for ages with one motion
basically the versions of the eddie murphy coming to america movie with all the barber shop scenes
i don t think i d say that to someone who was about to cut my hair i recently did something similar and it did not turn out well
facepalm to get a haircut op needs better wordings let s collect some letters for him a
this is me hours a day

this dude doesn t even need a haircut why is he even there
you forgot you didn t post this on therewasanattempt
my man be looking like beverly hills cop
there is nothing wrong with what does dude said just cut my fucking hair so i can leave it is not fun for me to sit here while you talk for hours talk when you get off that s what a bar is for shit it s the 21st century text his ass you have this conversation somewhere else right now however you have a job to do do that these barbers are inconveniencing two people by not even focusing on their job
mike tyson tried not to shit himself when he was mimicking their voice lmao
love that guy
a little too soon to go off on the guy holding the clippers next to your hair
i stopped going to a barbershop for this exact reason this dude would literally be talking the entire time on his phone and cutting my kids hair while doing so with one hand and wasn t even good so unprofessional do that in a salon and they d be fired
i got places to be
i had to hear about my barbers child s cancer the last time i went to great clips i will no longer be getting my hair cut by strangers
obv the guy wants to know what happened last night
you can see the guy in the chair get more annoyed maybe the guy filming knows when the guy in the seat is going to blow up and fired up his cam i m glad he did i ve watched this 3x and laughed laughed
aaaaannd action
looks nothing like uncle phil
i m a customer and i hate chit chat where s your in law i just need a trim
i ve had it both ways and don t mind either my current guy is a chatterbox but he s the best haircut i ve gotten knows products routine advice etc even if i didn t like chit chat i d put up with it tbh for someone just rolling into great clips or whatever you re there because it s cheap most places list their people s hours go a few times till you find someone you like and then just schedule with them
you sure i mean come on we all have cameras recording our mundane lives and make fun of people cutting our hair
i think it fits better there too
how he is out of the line he is paying for a service and the guy is just not doing it
legs or arms
that was the first thing i thought too
i know killed me
me too i would have gotten up and left people kill for less girl is dead cause she told some guy who was trying to rap to her that she was engaged he took her future just like that barbers are typically mission driven and wouldn t do something like this these wack jobs are a breed apart brave young man
damn sorry that happened to you bro that sucks almost as bad as your kid having cancer
bill burr has a great bit about that i just wanna drink a beer and watch football and not fell bad about cancer sometimes i feel like larry david
find yourself a good barber and stay with him i ve had the same barber for years he s never let me down and if he bullshits with anybody it s me while his hands are working
bruh this complaint is like going to a motel and being annoyed the faucet leaks it s great clips you re not there for their amazing service
i m like sure it s a skit very funny though i agree
i know it s clearly geoffrey
ehh bald black guy with a beard
cause he still hasn t gotten his line up
shoulda seen the haircut
savaged
lol right how dare this person share their feelings with me while they are going through something tough don t they know how hard it is for me to sit here while they drone on about their stupid kid this is not why i come to great clips that person probably
boom gottem
i d rather the person cutting my hair pay attention to cutting my hair especially while they cut my hair who in their right mind enjoys hearing about sick and dying children while they try to relax
hey stranger when i was i was raped by my uncle in the shed behind my house oh you didn t ask to hear about that i hope you enjoyed hearing unsolicited tragedies of my personal life it s literally one of the first things you learn in customer service don t tell sob stories

at least he admitted he was wrong
there is no society or people that haven t had slaves at all
it s not really his fault he s human after all some things just can t be helped
ive talked to a lot of americans and many not all tend to think slavery is one race enslaving another and cannot comprehend that people can be enslaved by their own kind also in many cases they think slavery is only a european thing and don t even know about arab and north african slave trade then there s shit like casteism in south asia and indentured labor aka slavery with extra steps
ohh bobby sad to say that even today korea still has slaves half of the country is still enslaved by a corrupt family with a god complex
i don t think this is a face palm this is a guy being incorrect then both accepting they were wrong and seeing the humour in it that s pretty much the ideal response to something ultimately inevitable in the human experience we are all idiots at something
tmw you realize your nationality is possibly the worst in the world
yeah i believe most places with slavery had it longer than america
does no one comprehend these guys are comedians doing a bit
this is the same reaction that my math teacher had when i told her that the land speed record of a manned craft is above km h
less of a facepalm because he admitted he was wrong
op is a dumbass this is a comedy podcast why are you expecting factual information from them people watch this to laugh and hear wild shit
bro some people take getting wrong like actual champs
bobby lee this guy is a comedian and really funny used to be on madtv years back and is currently on magnum pi he s been through a lot and still maintained humor through his life have had the opportunity to rub shoulders with him a couple of times and he is a genuine nice human being i ll leave this here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sbafwemrrj4
there are still slaves in korea of course there are those who come to korea to work usually from less wealthy countries like india and pakistan who are tricked into slave like conditions but there are still places in the southwest islands that have modern korean born slaves most of these are people with mental disabilities
yes and the americans massacred civilians in several wars and promoted military coups in several countries including where i live
was op legitimately upset by this so much that they had to put it on facepalm it s a comedy podcast lighten up a bit they do shit like this all the time
even australia has a big history of slavery
hahaha he s such a troll
good on bobby lee realizing he was dead wrong and not being a bitch about it good on the host for fact checking that immediately
you know i get that this is a facepalm here that he was so certain about it but at least he admitted he was wrong instead of doubling down i saw a video on this sub today where this woman defended slavery
it s truly a testament to how hard modern cultures work to erase culpability this and saying oh they liked being slaves downplaying it by calling it employment whtaboutisms they participated in the slave trade his ignorance is funny but it s also a barometer
he s another one like bert kreischer whose success baffles me
every time i see him i can t stop thinking about bobby s mom lmao
hypocrisy
american slavery was different from slavery in other countries in the world in most countries slaves were people who had been captured in war in america however slaves were people who had been kidnapped from their homes in africa and shipped across the ocean to be sold into slavery there are a few reasons why americans did not enslave native americans one reason is that native americans were familiar with the land and could easily escape another reason is that native americans were often willing to fight back against their enslavers finally native americans were not seen as being as valuable as african slaves americans enslaved africans because they wanted a labor force that was cheap and easy to control they also wanted to make sure that the slaves would not be able to escape or fight back by shipping slaves from africa americans could ensure that the slaves would be isolated from their families and communities and would have no one to help them
how bobby lee is still relevant baffles me
is this the same guy who got molested every day in summer by a kid with down syndrome
they re comedians and bobby trolls constantly for content on the podcast this is such a nothing burger
bet they don t teach you that i korean school
those guys are smarter than most considering they have supercomputers in their hands and can in a few seconds fact check any statement
these two are bad friends
don t believe it man consider the source
the facepalm is thinking the slept king wasn t asleep during history class
love you tito bobby
ok but at least clearly everyone did learn something and they came out as wiser men still hilarious
should also be in r confidentlyincorrect lol
practically everywhere has had a history of oppression at some point be it as the oppressed or oppressors it was what a lot of civilizations used to control their enemies or their people
watch this lis you can actually pinpoint the second his heart rips in half
bobby lee is a self admitted pedo just to let all of you know
bobby is hilarious
yea about that
sounds like the black guy laughing in robocop
i love when people expose their ignorance especially when they re on a soapbox
gif giphy hp7mtfna1e4ceqnbnl downsized
he didn t watch korean dramas enough
zoom in my eyes are blurry it s in your genetics you probably saw san francisco when they were talking about slavery in school also my ass burns from this toilet paper
pretty sure every society had some form of slavery
yeah he seems like a nice guy laughing it off still a facepalm moment though we just don t usually see the person in the video facepalm themselves
and laughed over his own misknowledge cool dude would be awesome having a chat with this guy respectable personality
right i literally see someone say something like this about black people every week if not more and when you point out they are wrong they start trying to put themselves into a smaller and smaller box well it was wasn t based on race it wasn t chattel slavery we didn t ahhhh shut up we are all the offspring of evil ancestors at some point in history
he probably meant that there wasn t a colonial slave trade import of slaves along racial lines which i dunno much about korean history but i don t think they ever had that they mostly enslaved their own people of lower caste i think
slavery was the social safety net in a lot of places back in ancient times most of society was low iq from malnutrition and uneducated and nobody had the ability to travel more than 10s of miles on a whim let alone with their belongings there wasn t really an alternative for people who couldn t manage their own lives or a better way to deal with them it s fucked up but the further back you go in society the more sense it makes
what about aboriginal australians
inuit
cherokee
maybe eskimo
have had or have been
if running your mouth about something you know nothing about was a crime reddit would cease to exist the internet itself would disappear it s our god given right
dont put the blame on him
happy cake day
at least he accepted the l at the end
it s mainly because bad historical education and also cultural built around racism even if you are not racist per say lot of american only see skin colors and not ethic groups and categorizes people like that to them a a white births colonizer is the same as a white easter european potato farmer even though they have very different background same with asians and africans and etc i once had a black american guest while i was working at the hostel before him i checked in a group of japanese guest after that when i was checking him in he referred the previews group as chines people and i had to correct him that they are japanese and that would be really rude to call them chines i remember the surprise on his face that was like a totally new thing to him he was respectful and said sorry and hopefully learned from that but i see many times how asian people get constantly washed together and i find it quiet disrespectful just as much when ever other ethnic group got a same treatment skin color is depends on melatonin which depends on the climate people still using obsolete racial classification like caucasian ethiopian mongolian instead ethnic groups which currently used by science
no it s just black americans that think that
i mean it s because we did that we think we invented slavery
that s crazy because i learned in history class that a majority of the slaves during the transatlantic slave trade were people who were africans who were already enslaved by other africans not many slaves were captured by europeans they were bought from african slave traders surprising that people don t realize that
now this i want to hear
it s a facepalm because he was so spectacularly wrong in the first place him owning up to it doesn t change that but it does make the video much more enjoyable
they have japan to defer to and get revenge on
hmm you should follow that rabbit hole i think you d find some others that put korea to shame
existed longer
right america didn t invent slavery they just jumped on board
the downvotes your getting don t make sense this is a comedy bit lighten up people
sad your getting downvoted as it s quite true america has committed some of the worst war crimes the road of death was never russia it was america
in most countries slaves were people who had been captured in war that and debt debt was the other big way to find yourself being property with punishment for crime being another
also the same guy that admitted raping a child
yep
its common knowledge that korea has slaves
what
there are two ways countries can deal with shit they did in the past option is owning up to it and making sure every citicen knows their ancestors fucked up and making sure they don t want to fuck up too like germany option would be never speaking of it again and hopping you can stay on the good side long enough so people forget you did fuck up looks like korea chose the second option and dude just found out that there is an important pice of his nations history no one told him about
he s not a nice guy he s a pedo rapist who once paid to have sex with an underage girl and upon noticing she was crying instead of stopping proceeded to power fuck her so he could finish faster
bobby lee is not a nice guy he s a prick
lol yeah a real nice guy who admitted to raping an underage prostitute in mexico fuck this clown
more slaves were more in indentured servitude which isn t good but not as bad as slavery
probably in their prime
maybe although far back it might have been different
i dont see a reason why not
citation needed
they outlawed slavery in
it was common to use those captured in war as slaves among the natives
based on my experience god and his followers are much more concerned with taking rights away rather than giving them and as long as there is porn the internet will be safe
nah there would still be games we just would lose oh this is just my alt come fight my main in wilderness
don t know if you re joking or not but north korea
just look into how the japanese used to play lawn darts with their bayonets during their colonizational periods
most countries have committed terrible atrocities some more large scale and recent than others current ones are saudi arabia usa to yemen israel to palestine china to muslims etc
and jumped off faster than anyone
bobby lee was born and raised in america lol
he s american he doesn t even speak korean and i m guessing he never went to school here lmao everyone knows about the servants in old korea maybe they aren t aware of the full brutality but we sure as hell haven t erased it and ran in shame from that history
they don t speak of it i m pretty sure most koreans know what a  muhseum or slave is the thing is they don t really portray it as a negative part of their history more like something that was just a thing i think to the eyes of americans it ll seem like this was a widespread thing and korea is evil blah blah but as dehumanizing as it was the caste system inevitably made some humans worth less than others yet muhseums weren t quite as tortured or kidnapped as african slaves it was more like whenever the bottom of the barrel manual tasks were dripped down the caste stairs the muhseums would take the burden of all of it of course they were killed for incompetence but that was not exclusive to muhseums but peasants and even nobles who might offend the king or noble s servants who might offend the nobles etc historical dramas are some of the most popular ever in korea and just east asia as a whole who watch korean historical dramas en masse almost every single one of them depicts slaves it s not a huge secret and to question it would be to question the caste system which was hardly exclusive to korea

am i high or isn t trump getting a trial
i love how kevin uses a picture from his hercules days instead of the dried up vomit he looks like now
i refer you to the central park five
ah kevin for an actor you don t seem to recognize when you have no lines you re just an extra these days so shhh
it never has been that s a lie we tell ourselves to feel like it s all ok and justice will prevail the justice system in america is so defunct it s a joke
gif giphy 3oat21fnr4i54uk8vk
is he really crying over trump s indictment
gif giphy kzsun7fkbzrm2whddx downsized
is this the title to your next hallmark movie
man is a fucking idiot but hey hercules was fun
it s not longer ok
it s sorbin time
now i hate what the guy say but of all the wing nuts i am more likely to give this one a pass he literally got brain damage and did not go off the deep end until after that happened he had both an aneurysm and multiple strokes
this is so frustrating i loved seeing hercules and andromeda as a kid it s just fucking up some really nice memories
it never was in the court of public opinion kev where have you been certainly not on set
oh kevin it never was
that s what trials are tor
i m not a native english speaker and my skills are certainly lacking here let s just say i m not quite sure that only his fictional father liked to fuck animals
gif giphy rtsbpvilhvcvfwchjf
hey stupid even for an actor you are horrendously dense so we ll go really slow here just for you trump commits an act that may be against the law legal authorities investigate the act and find evidence of what may well be a crime just to be safe all the evidence is presented to a group of citizens called a grand jury the grand jury looks over the evidence and agrees that a crime has been committed an indictment is handed down and the suspect is arrested and arraigned trial dates are set and then delayed and delayed and delayed while the now defendant tries every conceivable legal strategy to wiggle out of it a trial finally takes place after probably years of technical legal bullshit and millions in legal fees the jury makes a decision based on the evidence or the balance in a few secret bank accounts if found guilty of the crimes the defendant is sentenced the sentence is carried out it s a long process in fact the more money the defendant has the longer the process takes we are only at step you seem to think we ve arrived at at step the system appears to be working about as well as it ever does for wealthy people so you would be wrong but that isn t surprising
it was not innocent until proven guilty when members of trump his own party had to decide guilty or not this time idk havent been paying attention
didn t this guy come 2nd to xena warrior princess
yes innocent until proven guilty was and remains the standard in the american legal system that s why very few criminals are dumb enough arrogant enough or have enough levels of both combined to be tape recorded attempting election fraud video recorded moving top secret documents they claimed not to have or sign the hush money check that broke campaign laws nor will most criminals admit to the crimes during media interviews double down on them during speeches and use them to fundraise
kevin thorbo is an imbethile
oh is it not longer that is that what it not longer is
who the fuck is this guy it s never been that way you re always guilty unless you re white have money
waaa waaa fkg cry baby victim mentality
when i think back to andromeda and hercules and see what kevin sorbo has become it makes me sad
goddammit these mfers are starting to sound like darrell brooks ffs
blm was saying the same thing trump and his supporters booed blm for saying that
this non entity has managed to carve out a second career would have said act but he wasn t the first time
yet the endorse the actions of murderous police officers who kill those who haven t even been convicted of anything they should have complied you know
come on hercules trump will get his day in court as long as he is actually innocent he should be fine now if he s a lying piece of shit he is used to useing his money to get away with stuff money that came from his pimp grandfather well then he might be in trouble
it s never been that except as a promise or claim study prosecutorial misconduct helped secure wrongful death penalty convictions wonkette magazine online a study by the death penalty information center dpic found more than death penalty reversals and exonerations were the result of extensive prosecutorial misconduct dpic reviewed and identified cases since the u s supreme court overturned existing death penalty laws in that amounted to over of all death sentences imposed in the u s in the last years robert dunham dpic s executive director said the study reveals that this epidemic of misconduct is even more pervasive than we had imagined the study showed a widespread problem in more than counties states and in federal capital prosecutions throughout the u s the dpic study revealed of misconduct involved withholding evidence involved improper arguments involved more than one category of misconduct and of the exonerations involved prosecutor misconduct study prosecutorial misconduct helped secure wrongful death penalty convictions https://www.wonkette.com/study-prosecutorial-misconduct-helped-secure-550-wrongful-death-penalty-convictions) prosecutorial misconduct cause of more than death penalty reversals and exonerations https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2022/nov/15/prosecutorial-misconduct-cause-more-550-death-penalty-reversals-and-exonerations/)
hercules was so cool when i was younger this is a shame
it is not longer required to know what words mean
he really is a bell end isn t he
it s buy sc justices
it never has been
deep thoughts
trump is the least innocent person in history he dooms himself with his own words
that only ever applied during trial before you get to the judge you re guilty as hell
i agree kevin trump should not have chanted lock her up without a proper investigation and trial keep up the good work
wtf is he even talking about trump did they imprison him without trial and i missed it
to be fair trump lied then owned up to it then moved on to the next lie
maga stuff aside i m still amazed at how many people have no idea how our legal system works but also this guy needs a therapist
oh but mrs clinton is definitely guilty for negligence
why the fuck we keep giving these morons attention just block them ignore them and move along
been that way for a while remember metoo
hilarious if trump wins dems will blame it in this trial and the unfortunate timing if he doesn t win dems will claim this trial had impact i ll be here chips and beer ready
everyone here is just proving him right
if they can do it to me they can do it to him
watch what you say about the star of poolboy drowning out the fury
hes right at this point he has done things wrong so yes he is guilty until they can prove he didnt pay off a pornstar lol
is this about trump being sentenced because i think i missed that part
for non americans what does it mean to be indicted
late to the game mr sorbo so many people that were young in the s and s have often believed it s guilty until proven innocent
i guess its shorter innocent until proven guilty in america then
gonna guess he isn t talking about civil asset forfeiture
which is more likely he is getting a trial or you don t know what you re talking about hence my comment about not being able to take you seriously
i do assume everyone is guilty if they are ever getting accused of anything
i m assuming he s talking about trump did i miss the automatic sentence that was handed down without a trial does sorbo not know how our legal system works you are charged with a crime you are still presumed to be innocent it s up to the prosecution to prove guilt
weird how he starts with a stormy d quote tho
it s clearly no longer think before you speak
i m not going to put too much thought into the disingenuous words of a man who probably milked it to the chants of lock her up
rich white guy has epiphany
so the same should go for the biden family correct
if he was guilty until proven innocent he d be behind bars waiting on a verdict instead he s kicking his feet on his desk waiting for this to blow over
yes what we did in gitmo is shameful oh that s not what he s talking about
there are clearly several examples of tier justice systems in america
except that all of them usually during protests have repeatedly said that no one is above the law except they didn t mean it these continued convenient exceptions are exactly why i can t take their opinions seriously one on one and i don t mind telling them that i e didn t you just say two years ago during the boston blm protests that no one is above the law in light of this new take pardon me while i don t take any of your political commentary seriously because apparently you don t either
no one is above the law and everyone has the right to a trial to prove their innocence nancy pelosi
they you just spoke for millions of people stop generalizing people we all only see the worst from either shitty side i want to see the evidence
he was indicted by a grand jury of ordinary citizens who heard the evidence and decided that they had enough evidence to charge him there will be a very public trial guilt or innocence will be determined at the end or on appeal this is how the system is supposed to work
nope definitely sorbs who is high trump is literally getting due process
both
i m almost positive he s referencing what nancy pelosi said x200b no one is above the law and everyone has the right to a trial to prove their innocence
a trial and he continues to live in his fl resort pending his next court appearance in december sounds pretty fair so far
oh god i just googled what he looks like now what animal attacked his face to make him look like that oh the humanity
hes old you guys are disgusting
typically not for wealthy republicans though that s why sorby is so butt hurt
xena hercules
no you didn t he s just projecting our hopes and dreams
i think he just thinks everyone outside of the court also should act like mr t is innocent
yeah i m for that too if there s crime go after it
like isn t that exactly what innocent until proven guilty means otherwise he d go right to jail without a trial right
more accurately guilt will be determined or innocence confirmed but yeah
kevin is commenting on pelosi saying he has a chance to prove his innocence it doesn t work that way it s innocent until proven guilty in the usa that s all it s about
damn it why did you make me google
wow you guys never seen an old man can t wait for your asses to get to s so you can look in the mirror and ask why there is a mummy around the house
flip the script and have someone say this about a transgender lmao accepting people my ass
his outside finally looks like his insides
say something like this about a transgender and these people would lose their minds
i won t disagree
i agree but all the talk about arrest hunter and arrest sleepy joe i thought it was innocent until proven guilty they re ready to sentence them already if they re criminals by all means lock them up it s all fine and dandy if it s someone they don t like but when it s trump they flip sides fast
too many people in the u s don t know the difference between due process and the court of public opinion
of course that s right sorbo is an idiot
no if someone looked like that we would still make fun of them doesn t matter if they are trans or not what does matter is if you are making fun of them just because they are trans or because they look bad also side note he really doesn t look that bad he looks like a normal old white guy if not somewhat better than most or maybe i m looking at the wrong guy

i am just asking if you dont have it is ok
look i know what i said was more than controversial and this situation is fucked but to rip a child away from their parent for a drawing is the most inhumane thing all i gave were suggestions on how this situation could ve kept all parties safe since this corrupt school decided doing nothing wasn t an option even though it easily could have been
so delusional
he was arrested for real though because his mother filed a lawsuit against desantis last week

a normal decent person would have been so embarrassed that he d wish the earth would swallow him there and then the emphasis is however on the words normal and decent he s a politician this doesn t faze them one bit he s probably just annoyed that he wasn t successful in the same way a scammer only feels annoyed when their target roasts them over the phone not guilt not shame not remorse just annoyed

the founders would say the fuck is an ohio lol
washington was obviously woke
was that rep jim jordan the pedophile enabler asking what the founders would say well jim i think they d say you are a lilly livered sorry excuse for a human being and should have been prosecuted and jailed for failing to protect the students in your charge
he also required a process they used before even the original vaccine of infecting people with cowpox to protect them from smallpox called variolation for the continental army basically they d get puss from a smallpox wound on a knife and then cut your arm with it because they somehow found out that getting infected that way usually results in a far less severe illness then breathing it in and getting infected normally but it still came with up to a fatality rate with month of recovery time for surivivors variolization still had a case fatality rate of to percent and even if all went well inoculated patients still needed a month to recover how crude smallpox inoculations helped george washington win the war https://www.history.com/news/smallpox-george-washington-revolutionary-war)
i m sure he d kick an ass or two that s what brian boitano d do
and rewrite
that s incredible true but history makes me ucomfortable
what books were banned
so much so that someone should come up with a catchy phrase about learning from history
i m brian dennehy
honestly you can probably do a quick google search for it i can t remember them off the top of my head but i do remember there were multiple books that i used to be able to check out and read from my old high school library are now being completely taken out of schools i want to say to kill a mockingbird might be one of them possibly also something by maya angelou they re trying to suppress history critical thinking diversity
ok baahhyeee
i did google it and everything that was popping up had to do with books about sex and gender studies in middle schools i didn t see to kill a mockingbird or anything having to do with history and diversity could you get me a link i d love to look deeper into this
i could be mistaken on those books and yeah they initially banned those books in elementary schools but then desantis went even further with it and banned all the books all the way up through high school it s a subtle way of trying to not acknowledge and erase people of the lgbt community because he s a hateful bigot but it s getting so bad now that lots of other conservative politicians are going out of their way to try and ban all these books they don t like from government funded public libraries they don t want anyone to be able to read these books ever
a lot of the books i m coming across seem like they had a lot of pornographic images and instructions on masturbation and stuff i don t think stuff like that should really be in a kids library but i don t know what do you think
i could maybe see people not wanting elementary school children to read them but high schoolers are aware what sec is by that point they ve had sex ed in health class and i think it s even worse to try and remove all these books from public libraries there s no real excuse for that
hmm interesting take thanks for the conversation
do you recall when the harry potter books were more current and churches and crazy christians were holding boom burnings all over the place just because they didn t approve of the books if people like that get their way where does it end they ll be banning and or burning every single book they find the tiniest issue with it s a very fine line anyway thanks for the convo too

people that get so worked up over sports must really get upset about stuff that actually matters
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/feyenoord-ajax-klaassen-lighter-head-injury-arrest-b1072625.html
that s nasty just shows how sick some people are
gif giphy j8fzim9vobu6q
what an idiot fan will have been arrested and banned for life but crap like this will force them to put up nets or some other counter measures that will ruin the viewing experience but rightly so if we need to protect the players from this bs
why didn t he fall to the ground and roll around in pain
heard about that in the derby apparently it was a rocket of some sort and that they had fireworks not good
alright that s it man i officially hate soccer soccer fans soccer players and their bullshit flops dude took a shot to the head and stays on his feet i d bet he d hit the ground and roll if he thought it d draw a fowl
worlds worst sport and sports fans
i grew up in a city where everytime the two teams from my city played it was dangerous to go outside i hate football and the fans that come with it
same well that and it s boring as fuck
has a football fan who goes regularly in the uk to the matches usually these type of incidents is from or dickheads who have been on the piss all day and think they are funny most fans aren t like this and generally just go out for a few drinks enjoy the match have some banter with the opposition with some chants then simply go home but there is always that one group what is a total twat don t put us all in the same bag
it s ajax v feyenoord what do you expect
the players aren t much better they re supposed to be world class athletes but it seems like they re each trying to get the award for best drama
my dad would drag me and my brothers to london for tottenham hotspur matches god i hate that team so much never even wanted to go either
playing behind closed doors is a brutal penalty but in this case totally justified
nut job fans and endless flopping good ole football
agreed i am the worst
yes they did he is arrested and not released as of yet
looks like a cigarette lighter usual ammunition for football morons worldwide since they re not usually confiscated on arrival to the stadium that and coins
well he had to run over to the referee first to make sure someone was watching
you think these guys are crazy wait until you watch american basketball
end the game for unsafe environment and force the home team to forfeit
as soon as i saw the jerseys it was please god let that not be ajax feyenoord please let it be some second division team somewhere with lookalike jerseys and then i saw the score in the corner and damnit
indeed all that boring play getting in the way of entertaining beer commercials
the only reason this doesn t happen in the us is that people would get the ever living shit beaten out of them for ruining the game i m not suggesting violence i m simply suggesting that violence has an impact on some things sometimes
no nba player ever flopped like a little bitch eh no nfl wide receiver ever tried to draw a pi
ideally they would identify the dickhead that threw whatever hit the player in the head and ban him for life that behaviour have no place in sports
fans are worse outside the stadium before they even get in
good to know thanks
not that i don t believe you but do you have a source i wouldn t mind reading it
yeah looks like a lighter or a disposable vape kind of wide like an elfbar or something
this is the correct answer it doesn t really even matter which team the thrower roots for the home team is responsible for providing a safe environment for everyone on the field if they cannot ensure the safety of the people on the field the home team must forfeit end of game then they can review the incident and determine what to do about it before they host the next match if they opt to do nothing but make some public statement asking fans to behave and it happens again another forfeit and a fine to reward them for their negligence
i don t watch soccer but this is how sports should handle this imo no matter which side causes the mess cancel the game and call it a draw until people conduct themselves better also whoever threw that should be charged
well yes of course they did just not to the extreme level of soccer players it ruined the game for me the fans ruined it even further
you sound like someone who watched a highlight reel and decided you knew enough about a sport
oh i ve been to games supposedly you re not supposed to cheer a great play by the opposite team lol i m not really a sports guy lol i d rather build hot rods and play video games
plenty of tough sobs in football look into the likes of patrick viera roy keane nemanja vidic and plenty of others
woah dude must ve pressed a button

i can tell by his ramen noodle haircut he s a jackass
you wonder how many times he had do e this stunt before and what nefarious behaviour he used it for it could be telling that he pulled over a lone woman i really hope they thoroughly search his property because you never know what he was doing many people who have had bad things happen to them by alleged undercover police might have not reported the incident
i wouldn t mess with him his hair looks like barbed wire
a broccoli head driving his bmw to his home in the trailer park after impersonating a cop genius

that s the twisted part the thought process is that their hero is just like them not like those smarties if they don t have to get smarter or try work any harder and they can still succeed like trump did that s winning because if you can be dumb but rich fuck facts right
we can thank social media echo chambers for a large part of that
i know i m about to break godwin s law in pointing this out but here i am recalling another historical figure who gained a real strong following after having been arrested for an unruly uprising attempt this guy better not write a bestseller in prison either otherwise it s time for me to nope right on out of here
i ve engaged in conversation with antivaxxers and other conspiracy theorists who know i am medically trained they explained to me how my knowledge of science and physiology was all a con i have been tricked by people who control what i m taught the research studies we carry out are therefore pre planned and we are there as pawns to promote the deception and not one of us even knows it thats a lot of us to fool completely
still waiting on that asteroid to reset the whole damn thing
who is this reality tv star they speak of
a sucker is born every minute
the reason for all of this isn t difficult to grasp it s racism and the fascist who they believe will allow them to act as unashamedly racist is the one who gets their support doesn t get any deeper and has no greater meaning than that
republican right wing moment
pretty soon he ll be telling his cultists that putin is a good and honest man ukraine really is overrun by nazis and russia is on a peace mission to liberate ukraine
this is the problem liberals want to believe even something a ridiculous as this it is better to believe this nonsense than face the truth that some people just hate so much they are willing to let the world burn just to hurt people they have never met
there s something called bribes
with the exception of some mentally ill people i don t think most of them actually believe that it s voluntary ignorance and they have made a choice to disregard fact and truth because it doesn t always support the version of reality that they want to be true they want to live in a fantasy world and they will desperately say and do anything to ensure that actual reality doesn t set in it s an act of childish defiance they know they are full of shit but they just don t care
everyone who is not american watching this sub turn into a us political tit for tat
why not both
here we go again the i am smarter than you crowd
bad faith argument and willful ignorance truth isn t the point for them
to be fair everyone on that list has lied and committed massive amounts of fraud so trust no one
so i should trust the human scientists and journalists without question
both can be true i recommend intellectuals and society by thomas sowell
remember low sugar fat
it s not sad at this point these folks have chosen to be stupid fuck them they made their choice
there is a cult of ignorance in the united states and there has always been the strain of anti intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge isaac asimov
making your own success story is easier than people think all it takes is grit determination and your father giving you millions of dollars oh and lying to avoid the draft and also about everything else
the five filters of media https://youtu.be/34lgpixvu5m)
here i am recalling another historical figure who gained a real strong following after having been arrested for an unruly uprising attempt is that even one of the charges he s currently facing he definitely needs to held accountable for that but i thought this was more related to stormy daniels and the payment this guy better not write a bestseller in prison either let s be real if anything it would ghostwritten
wait wait wait wait no no no no no
godwin rescinded his law when referring to the modern day american fascist party because they really are fascists in any way you care to measure them
i ve read some of them don t even believe viruses are real lol but we can prove that because we can see viruses under the microscope and can recreate them in a lab
i saw that nasa moon creation simulation the other day and started to wonder if earth maybe needed another moon
tony danza
that sucker was born today happy cake day
their thought process we had that n r in the white house fer two terms now it s time to put somebody like us in which is to say a dumb as dog shit racist clown
he s been calling ukraine a corrupt country run by corrupt people since before he got impeached for bribing them with congressionally mandated aid money that s nothing new
pretty soon he ll be telling his cultists that putin is a good and honest man the previous us republican presidential nominee immediately before trump romney russia is our number one geopolitical foe https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/26/romney-russia-is-our-number-one-geopolitical-foe/) one trump term later why does putin have superfans among the us right wing https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/01/why-does-putin-have-superfans-among-the-us-right-wing)

so you are saying they bribed literally everyone everywhere all the people in different fields of research for a at least a few decades except for the tv guy riiiiight
so all republicans are mentally ill
everyone who is not american is facepalming everyday with us politic in this sub or everywhere else
it is affecting other countries why is qanon spreading outside the us https://www.aljazeera.com/program/inside-story/2020/10/12/why-is-qanon-spreading-outside-the-us/) the extraordinary rise of qanon in germany https://www.dw.com/en/as-donald-trump-exits-qanon-takes-hold-in-germany/a-56277928) czech and slovak qanon groups have incorporated ukraine into conspiratorial worldview https://vsquare.org/czech-and-slovak-qanon-groups-have-incorporated-ukraine-into-conspiratorial-worldview/) propped up by russia and china china and russia weaponized qanon conspiracy around time of us capitol attack report says https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/politics/qanon-russia-china-amplification/index.html)
right there s too many people who so strongly dedicated to one side of the political spectrum they dont feel a need to think for themselves or do research outside of their preferred media outlets the bipartisan system is makes everything polar so people need to choose one side which is why out last few presidential elections only give us choices between two evils if you take a step back and analyze both sides regardless of where you stand on any political point each has pros cons and is corrupted by power and influenced by corporate lobbyists the parties flip idealogies too before democrats wanted more freedom privacy and less war now those are the main points republicans stand on checkout this video the statistics will blow your mind this organization representus helped pass the first federal anti curruption act in the early 2000s they aren t pushing any political ideology just ending obvious corruption in all parties ive never met a person who doesnt agree with this organization link https://youtu.be/5tu32cca_ig
what do you mean if you support trump are definitely a brainwashed fucking idiot
no but you should trust their opinions more than the tv personailty its all or nothing with you guys every time isnt it
it s better to trust the consensus of science there are always quack jobs like trump approved dr demon semen like trust the consensus but don t go to dr nick
he could have just been honest and said he suffers from several mental illnesses to get out of the draft
our last two presidents both dodged the draft multiple times edit imagine down voting the truth out of stupidity
yeah right now it s felony records falsification with the daniels hush money but for the following that he seems to have already and how bonkers they would all let themselves get if he were to actually go to prison well a prison sentence didn t stop a certain other someone from such a political upheaval so as to make a very big mark in history
hmm no i m saying anyone can be bribed to turn a blind eye to a particular medicine or create economic turmoil for particular people to profit from or to change certain policy to benefit businesses it s not hard to see people accepting a few million what if the tv guy works the same as the scientist or economist after all they both need funding from large business and billionaires
i don t know i hate modern politics it s full of dumbasses on all sides who think they and they alone hold the ultimate truths and answer to every problem
yes
even americans are facepalming because in all honesty both sides don t care if they decieve you or not as long as they push their agenda how they d like sincerely an independent voter from the sw us
there s too many people who so strongly dedicated to one side of the political spectrum they dont feel a need to think for themselves or do research outside of their preferred media outlets so long as one side is verging on open fascism with nazi qultists being endorsed by the former president who instigated a fascist coup attempt then i will strongly be dedicated to opposing the destruction of the usa in recent weeks qanon has begun to attract heightened scrutiny many others have pressed that case one was the founder of the group genocide watch former george mason university professor of genocide studies gregory stanton who published a piece earlier this month titled qanon is a nazi cult rebranded qanon is the latest version of the conspiracy revealed in the most influential anti jewish pamphlet of all time it was called protocols of the elders of zion stanton wrote in his essay he also said qanon is a revamped take on the blood libel which was spread in modern times through the protocols qanon is an old form of anti semitism in a new package experts say https://www.jta.org/2020/09/18/politics/qanon-is-an-old-form-of-anti-semitism-in-a-new-package-experts-say) trump shares barrage of qanon content and other conspiracy theories on his social media platform https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-shares-barrage-qanon-content-conspiracy-theories-social-media-pl-rcna45465) i am strongly dedicated to democracy freedom equality and opposing fascism and naziism
i have a feeling that you are the least qualified to determine as you have just proved my point
uh not from the usa but i don t believe that obama dodged the draft didn t it end in
this is the answer if of political positions were any party this country would be an even worse train wreck also its been proven the scientists pharmaceutical and government lied like crazy during the covid pandemic so going to be hard trusting those entities for a while and i hate trump
yes that s a classic in politic but what is not is that in one of these sides the agenda is more about not going to jail the fact that so many deceived americans are missing that crucial point is also why non american are facepalming right now that s how you get populism
you re falling for fear mongering propaganda my dude on the left its qanon on the right its antifa if your dedicated to democracy then take a look at both parties wrongdoings instead of defending your opinion of which side is the lesser evil did you watch that video do you know the extent of lobbying and corporate interest have in dictating our policies
just gunna leave this here white house staffers were shocked by how stupid trump was https://youtu.be/wd_f_slbfde) former wharton professor donald trump was the dumbest goddam student i ever had https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/10/12/1705902/-former-wharton-professor-donald-trump-is-the-dumbest-goddam-student-i-ever-had)
both sides are playing not going to jail as american i d like to say this one may seem more altruistic than the other but they re two extremely toxic sides of the same coin one s mainly led by hardline lefts and the other side hardline rights and they both make policy more about party politics more than about the people or more than even justice for that matter america is supposed to be the land of the free but in the past or so years it s become a duopoly and no side is more innocent than the other both have and continue to ruin our country due to their selfishness and loyalty to party over policy that may actually help the common citizenry
exactly both sides are responsible for the trillion dollars of nation debt but they have learned by keeping the people divided they all live lavish lifestyles on the tax payers dime
when politicians realize they can vote for pay increases that would signal the end of the republic and democracy not the fully correct quote bot close enough for me

i m still confused about the colours you americans give to your parties here dark blue is for the far right blue is for the right yellow is center green are the ecologists it s a left wing party pink is for socialists and red is for communists
context
hey republicans thanks for the precedent we will be sure to use this going forward signed all parties who are not open to blatant fascism
bro looking like he s going to dave chapelle s playa hater s ball
free speech party my ass
see american politics is meant to make you pick a side and then using propaganda to make sure you hate the other side forever if we actually had choices other then the red asshole or the blue asshole then the system would fall apart immediately
there is only two though that seems doable
honest question i m just curious what country are you from describing
prior to the election the color changed every presidential election in bill clinton was red and bob dole was represented by blue x200b https://bing.com/th/id/r.5e4c57008ab6c5878917e0a5f4048e0d?rik=ney%2fgcsn9crtjg&pid=imgraw&r=0](https://bing.com/th/id/r.5e4c57008ab6c5878917e0a5f4048e0d?rik=ney%2fgcsn9crtjg&pid=imgraw&r=0) the election changed this as people became more defined as red and blue and the color scheme has remained the same ever since red and blue were used because the usa is red white and blue
more than a peaceful protestors rallied around tennessee s state capitol on march calling for more restrictive gun laws many made their way into the capitol in a demonstration top republican lawmakers have likened to an insurrection no demonstrators broke into the capitol no one was arrested or injured and no property was damaged but legislative business in the house was brought to a halt when three elected democratic representatives stood at the podium with a bullhorn to lead protestors in the galleries in calls for gun reform house republicans filed resolutions monday to expel the three members who interrupted legislative business triggering a removal process expected to take place this thursday
representative expelled for speaking out
laughs while remembering that for our last elections the left wing managed to bring different candidates from different parties
france
ah yes but only the reps of color were expelled makes perfect sense huh dear god my faith in humanity is getting weaker every day
and they compared it to jan
merci beaucoup
you still have it

beer isn t political but them being mad at beer is certainly fucking political
that is a spot on retort
those mods are full of shit
exactly one would hope that the mods of r politicalhumor would have enough political sense to understand that but alas
it s also surprising that the mods of r politicalhumor would be go on record as having banished someone for pointing out that beer has been politicized shouldn t someone in charge of a politics themed forum realize that heavy handed censorship usually makes for bad optics
it s like they don t even understand how wedge issues work
yep this is what happens when people s authority exceeds their understanding
mods sense pick one

this idiot believes girls under can t get their period unless they are having sex and stuff this moron needs to pull his head out his own ass and read a biology book
not food contaminated with growth hormones sexual imagery or sex due to checks notes obama got it
thanks obama
the last one takes a fucking piss and disgusting
very rare before obama lmfao
by using tampons they will be worn out before they give birth that s an interesting take uneducated daft and impressively stupid but interesting
using the private issue and teachers shouldn t interfere logic while also using the hashtag stand with idaho so he doesn t mind the government interfering on private issues then just another republican hypocrite got it
and it s obamas fault somehow
it s concerning how many guys don t understand that puberty for girls starts a lot earlier or at least understand that and under aren t medically unusual i ve seen some youtubers play little misfortune and get super confused when puberty is brought up around the year old protagonist like is on the later side my guys
it just baffles me how little people seem to know about the human body and just how confidently wrong they are too out school system has failed so many minds
these people make my head hurt
he seems to think a lot more about kids being violated than the rest of us i won t speak for everyone but i dont constantly think about people diddling kids i also dont constanty think about other peoples sexuality like it affects me to parrallel this to politics its always the publicans who hate gays who end up being gay i dont want to jump to conclusions but this dude constantly worrying about people grooming kids because of course thats what theyre doing makes me wonder why he thinks everyone else must be thinking about it as much as him x200b edit okay i wrote that before finishing his posts how the fuck does he know how a tampon affects the purity of young girls and how does he know the trends of it sus as hell
sex education is offered for a reason
so he s worried about the virginity that s not how it works but please somebody tell him about horsebackriding after the second parental authority cartmans voice popped in my head and that really made for a funnier read
no one tell him about menstrual cups
oh that s why it s so shameful for girls to admit they got their periods it s them admitting they look at porn or are already fucking s jesus christ these people
yikes
is the last one implying that pictures of obama are inherently sexy
the guy is either a troll or a moron either way i dgaf
how what
americans are very aware that puberty can start much much sooner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list\_of\_youngest\_birth\_mothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_youngest_birth_mothers) keep in mind to subnstract months from the birth date to get the date of you know what i mean and keep in mind this is only about girls with a very very early puberty
been posted millions of times in the last few weeks but why blur identity they posted publicly
lol he said groomers then spent this much time so concerned over women remaining tight for their future husband what a creep
just asking why aren t they offering pads as well
when your dick is so small you think a tampon is enough to take a virginity
dude probably never had a real sex ed class in his life
something tells me hard core bible thumpers wouldn t touch a biology book with a ft pole they ll be the first ones seeking medical attention though
exactly i m sure they re projecting their understanding of puberty for boys onto girls without understanding that girls start puberty earlier
people like this guy are also why there s a targeted focus on getting schools to ban sex ed specifically with a focus on puberty for girls
i d say both
you d be surprised at how many americans just didn t have good or any sex ed growing up only people who were properly educated about puberty know this now we have lawmakers trying to systematically target schools to ban sex ed with a focus on banning info about puberty for girls it s disgusting
part of the subreddit s rules no identifying info
wait until they hear how a vagina and hymen work
oh i know it s fucking disgusting in a profoundly more legitimate way than sex education
i bet he s also one of those people who thinks hymen is correlated with virginity it s not virginity is a dumb social construct anyway
yeah it heals too virginity is a scam tbh it s got an opening in the middle and as such renders virginity tests pointless also terms like popping the cherry basically tells me how uninformed a guy is but then again i ve met guys who think women only have holes we have three but fairly certain you know that

dang i saw some skin or something get ripped off that s what he gets
this needs nsfw
well his piano playing days are over seriously what the hell did he think was going to happen
that s another level of stupid right there
im not that daring with my cat
say it with me play stupid games win stupid prices
tbh he fucking deserved it
r vidsthatendtoosoon
this guy thought he was george of the jungle
is it funny now
i ll never do that again he said offhandedly
this little piggy went to
let me stop filming this travesty and turn to these two wonderful people over here that are still focused on recording the incident as it happens the one recording this video
instead of trying to help everyone s standing around with their phones to capture the missing fingers for posterity
mark mack needs to see this lol
the fact that no one helped him and focused on getting footage is priceless
dude narrowly escaped from the first bite should have taken the win and left buuut nooo he had to go to press his luck again smh
hey bro i bet you won t stick your fingers in there times wow you did it you win the bet here s
fafo
why are they still filming oh my gosh
this guy s ego
my sympathy level has never been lower
for real how did he think that was gonna go that was the only ending to putting your fingers in a lion s cage
fuck with the king and find out
that s his entire tendon bro
i m convincing myself it was just saliva so i can sleep tonight
nope that s what he looses play stupid games lose stupid fingers
where is the nsfw tag
ten fingers or one it s how you play
i d give it a out of
this caged lion is angry let me stick my fingers in its mouth there s everyday stupid and then there s this guy
bro wtf are they gonna do
honestly i think this is a learning moment for all involved except the lion
what are they supposed to do cross the line and pull him harder
so in the future when their friend talks nonsense they can play this video and remind him he s a dipshit
yep sure was
did not know that tendons could get just straight up ripped out by the fingers themselves i figured the tendon would detach from the finger faster than from the muscle i guess not
damn i had to watch it again you re right welp that s what he gets
i know there s like an chance your right but i am pretty sure it may just be saliva he doesn t really scream as you would expect him to although he might have after the video cut and the way they pull back from each other could still work if he managed to get his finger lose edit if your gonna correct me either mark it as spoiler or edit your own comment cause i do not want this crap on my mind rn
very satisfying to watch
i m a one finger player as well never thought of that fact
get a stick and poke its eyes kick the fence shout shit into your hands and yeet anything besides recording

you think the lion deserves to have it s eyes poked in this scenario or you mean poke the person s eyes
its a lion
after they just witnessed some dude do something incredibly foolish you think they are in a rush to help
im not poking a lions eyes because that guy was a moron lion dont deserve it yelling or whatever sure but that lion doesnt seem like he would even care
you don t need to defeat it just make it open its mouth
a clearly abused animal like that isnt gonna let go
poke it in the eye and it s letting go

she definitely killed him and trying to avoid murder charges
getting a lot of warrant returns on geolocation data that shows their travels and bank records and things so we ve had a ton of investigators spend really the last few days combing through every transaction every phone call every text message chief spencer said but we can specifically rule out he was not sold to a lady in a fiesta mart https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox4news.com/news/noel-rodriguez-alvarez-search-warrant-sold-april-5.amp
virginia just passed a law against selling children
she killed that little boy and fled the country with her husband and other kids
part of me thinks your correct while another part of me hopes you are wrong
just
police have already said there is no evidence he was sold and the mom claimed he had a demon in him the chances of him not being dead are slim to none i fear

am i just a confused foreigner america sacks teacher for showing children photographs of michaelangelo s david also america genital inspections for children s sports
just outsource it to the church two birds one lawsuit
so kansas is creating jobs for pedos
are republicans just trying to become the new version of pedophiles lots of kid stuff going on besides touching them they also dress them in make up and swim wear and parade them infront of a bunch of men and take pictures remember protecting the children doesn t mean locking them up in your basement
q what borders on insanity a canada and mexico
only in america
wow do americans realise what they look like to the rest of the world
pro pedo seems pretty typical conservative values
why are the bills and laws republicans are trying to pass attacking education medical science practice while also getting between doctors parents and children patients
america is the laughingstock of the world foolishiy i keep asking hoe can it possibly get worse at this point every day seems worse than the previous
enabling pedos classic republicanism says they will allow priests and school officials do the inspections
i m kind of confused about this when i was in junior high we had to get a physical checkup to be eligible to play school sports as a boy that meant a doctor had to put his hands on my nuts while i coughed that seems like a genital inspection to me
when i was a kid we had to get a physical to play sports started at middle school and was not a perverted thing
seems like republicans just needed an excuse to stare at kids genitals sick fucks
boys sport physicals have always allowed drs access to your kids genitalia you literally put your balls in a dr or nurses hand turn your head and cough i think i had my first physical before they even fully dropped i definitely hadn t hit puberty yet but we played school football in elementary throughout high school and also had to have one for wrestling and once you graduated from little league to school baseball same with the rodeo clubs is this bill any different schools didn t perform the physicals so i think she s confused you went to a dr at a contracted rate my sons last physical was bucks i believe my last one was bucks in the s
for the uninformed females don t go through any sort of genital exam during a normal sports physical we don t need the turn your head and cough type of test that is why this is creepy
ummm i had to have my genitals inspected to play sports in school as part of the physical like everyone else
man what if they just gave you a piece of paper when the kid was born and you just show that to people has anyone thought of that seems pretty easy maybe we could try it
am i confused wouldn t your birth certificate at the very least have your birthsex or whatever it s called like wouldn t that be enough seems like a piece of information schools should be able to get very easily without physically looking at anyone s genitals
it would be done at a doctor s office when they get their physical in order to be allowed to play most children s doctors would already know what gear you have if you have to be a loon or just flat out lie to try to make your point it s not a good point
having government employees do the molesting blurs the line between church and state
i was in school in the s and s and that was done then too nothing new at all and no one took issue with it play sports get a physical they wouldn t let you play jv football unless you had entered puberty and had hair on your junk
next step forbid clothes in schools
it s called a doctor
i mean that s kinda always been the rule if you play sports you have to get a physical nothing weird about that
anyone who played a sport knows this is needed to test for hernias also biological males have no place in women s sports
kind of like a physical exam like the ones i did every year to play sports
hahaha this is hilarious america is fucked in the head
this will come as terrific news to more churches
i know this person has a lot of good points but i just can t get over the hair
as a us teacher i feel like i m playing a horrendous game of bingo scratch off states of places i will never go so far florida kansas and the slew of religious exemption states for vaccines
whats tripping me off is that i dont know if this person was born a male or a female
yeah isn t this what physicals are for
it would make sure the deranged men who want to abuse women in the locker room can t
guess their teams will suffer who would play anymore
this sounds like they are legalizing pedophilia this will most undoubtedly open children up to massive amounts of sexual abuse more than they are already
republicans are the dumbest people on the planet everything they believe is backwards and reactionary to trivial things the planet would be infinitely better off if they all just disappeared tomorrow
it s just the girls that would have to have their genitals examined really the law allows girls to play boys sports so no reason to examine the boys probably why the bill passed
kansas republicans can now get rid of their incriminating child porn pics and enjoy a live show instead
the bill doesn t mention genilatia inspections or any other way to enforce itself
i mean i had to have my junk looked at to play sports like years ago so is this not just a medical check in order to play
dawg if i have kids one day and they try n inspect their genitals someone s getting the shit kicked out of them
job requirements pedophile
how much more can these republicans project their own fears and issues on to us and where is this line drawn
it s always projection they call democrats groomers then legislate permission to look in your kids underwear anyone who actually does one of these inspections needs to be arrested on the spot
republicans have a goal of pedophilia they don t hide it they literally fight to protect child marriages as long as the child is female the male is in his 30s or higher just like all cults they view children as sexual prizes people need to stop being surprised about this and start understanding the fact that for many years now you can be a good person or a republican and never both
ma am it s called a physical they ve been doing it for quite some time now it s not about taking a gander at the willy so much as it s making sure you aren t prone to hernia or other abdominal and genital injury you re gonna have to find something else to be offended at this one s been around a while
it s called a physical to check for a hernia smh
boys and girls sports
democrats are pedophiles also we re gonna start looking at your kids penises and vaginas for sports reasons
these are the same people that don t want trans folks to use certain restrooms because kids now suggested kids are forced to pull down their pants in front of a stranger unless it s an emergency there s not even a reason for a school nurse to be looking at a child s genitals
time for no more boy s sports or girl s sports just sports open to all humans everyone is equal if you re good enough you re on the team
ok so every other line with them is what about the children we have to protect the children except after a school shooting and then they do want to do this and then after will probably continue to use the we re protecting the children and call adults who want to be with other adults groomers are they smoking something new am i smoking something because i feel like i m losing it
that is total insanity
parents can stand up to this if all the parents refuse to allow this and take their kids out of sports until this changes sports teams will dissolve and that will be the end of this there is no way in hell i would allow my child to have their genitals examined to play sports
today s gop we want to see child pp how can we make it legal
republicans are disgusting creatures
well you guys started pushing all this transgender stuff what did you expect you have all turned everything upside down i m just gonna home school my kids and never deal with any of this
nice try the insanity here is the political left trying to erase gender if it were not for that there would be no need to pass legislation of this type this is not about conservatives or religious people i am neither this is about the fascist left wing political class wanting to force denial of objective reality to be replaced with state defined reality
this is misleading a birth certificate suffices inspection is a worst case scenario and it s not by a coach or anything it would be cleared by a medical professional
what s the difference between a genital exam and a physical sounds like the same thing you ve always needed a physical to play sports no genuinely curious not trying to argue just learn
it s called going to the doctor to get a physical in order to prove you re healthy enough to play sports they have been doing this for decades for fucks sake people
i m pretty sure it will be a medical doctor also boys don t belong on a girls sports team an inter mural once yes but competively separate
u mean a physical damn you can really tell some of these reddit bitches have never played a sport in their life lol fkn losers
they do this every year for kids where i live its called a sports physical
i dont really see the problem tbh like it wouldnt be some random teacher doing the checks it would be a pediatrcian inspections already happen at their doctors appointment
they can come check my genitals ill make sure i have a raging boner and give them a wink when they do
probably doctor would look at them it s really not that big of a deal it s not like your teacher will be like take your pants down i know it s fun to think that people you see are perverts and crimials but you need to touch grass
this is made up saying this is going to happen is laughable
this moron is full of it no where in the bill does it say genital inspections she s gaslighting to the fullest the bill just bans boys competing in girls sports and vice versa the lies people spread is astounding https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/documents/hb2238_00_0000.pdf
pretty sure it wouldn t be teachers inspecting school nurses probably or just results of some form of medical exam from a local hospital or something like that
so a physical
this is stupid but if y all wanna keep going into girls bathrooms because you feel like a girl then this will help that if you have a dick you are a boy end of mother fucking story quit making it a problem because your life sucks
well what did you think was gonna happen with men competing i womens leagues this is on you lgbtq this is the repercussion of your actions
biological males competing with biological females what did you think will come of it
how pedo is the usa
so when are people going to protest or raise hell about this oh right the left is fucking useless when it comes to actual issues they d rather just complain on twitter
this is an interesting situation that i have very conflicting opinions on one opinion i have that s not conflicting is that this is a direct result of the lgbtq actions it s there fault that this feels necessary to some it s just the natural consequences of there actions
i think there s gonna be some 2a mom s with real strong opinions on this
i shudder to think what they will come up with next
protecting the children
gif giphy 3o85xmxj0iqbmifdeu push it to the side too far it will return with almost the same force
not really sure i feel like i m in an episode of the twilight zone a really bad one
influencers just look off to me
wait you re telling telling that just became legal then why would my badminton couch look at my dingle dangle before practice he said it had something to do with my balance i have so many questions
the parents are not going to allow that right
i m used to sports physicals sometimes they checked your development this just sounds awful and invasive and the opposite of what we need to protect children
why are these republicans so obsessed with children genitals sounds pedo
merica fuck yeah do the americans know that we laugh at their country like out with the old jokes of an english man scotsman and an irish man its now just did you know in america inset any punch line
idk why but this reminds me of larry nassar who tf would ever think about making this in to law sicko
it s a moral panic theses poor doctors are going to be forced to look at more normal genitalia than usual it is pointless it s disgusting political theater
gif giphy rbeddeaq5xo0e
just creepy af
they are prob gonna have a doctor do it not the actual teachers why would people think the teachers are gonna do it
at this point i m so ashamed to live in this country this is horrifying it s unimaginable how warped people s minds have to be to justify this shit it s a fresh hell every day here when you turn on the news
if you think about what they are doing pedos are trying to make it a law to look at your children s junk wtf mind your fucking own business
gif giphy crmgqnpvm9xs2grcpl america is like
you godamn americans can t keep getting away with shit like this
so the gop wants to look at the genitals of children and the far left wants to mutilate them and cut them off we are so fucked

imagine caring that much about such shitty beer
bud light is getting a silly amount of free advertising lately
who can tell the difference between the liquid in the can and the liquid on the can
nothing says manly like drinking lite beer
soooooo they were drinking miller lite to make bud light
til mouth breathers believe one brand of diet beer is superior to another brand of diet beer
pissing on beer they already pissed money on dumb fucks
imagine being so depraved imagine also to being so ignorant so blatantly clueless to give this much effort for something that truly matters so very little in the scheme of things the rep voting base needs a slap up side the head and a personal reality check i know for fun get a fucking life
miller lite is open proud https://www.millerlite.com/open-proud) miller lite aims to create safer more accepting spaces at bars for members of the lgbtq community because we believe that everyone should be able to be their true self
no wonder beer tastes like piss also why is he doing that
that s literally gallons of piss to make that puddle beside his home
ah yes it is so easy to mistake water form a hose for pee
who is holding the phone
i mean let s be honest what was bud light thinking only hicks drink bud light that shits nasty
top it off with miller being lgbtq friendly and owned by anheuser busch
one lgbtq friendly beer with another lgbtq friendly beer
bud light just made a trans lady their new spokesperson or something all the big tough right wing manly men have been crying about it since yesterday
he s protesting bud light because they had a trans woman make ads for them so people are boycotting anheuser busch by drinking non budweiser beer little do they know how big their holdings are miller is owned by anheuser busch along with other brands of beer and alcohol lol
he s using a hose to pretend to pee or the worst thing is he s having someone see him piss to show how straight he is and record him lol
i remember way back in the day first seeing miller lite rainbow signs in the gay bars before any other brand was doing it i would always order a miller lite because of it these guys are just helping support a very woke beer brand
they just really aren t smart
nobody tell him about coors
miller lite is owned by molson coors not ab inbev molson coors is ab inbev s primary market rival that being said molson coors has also used pro lgbtq marketing so this whole thing is just ignorance and recency bias
who is holding the hose
looks like they combined but remain as independent company s
between the legs
no not at all what happened miller was owned by sabmiller abinbev attempted to acquire sabmiller in however the merger was determined to violate antitrust laws so the miller brand was separated from the parent sabmiller company and sold to molson coors then the parent company was bought by abinbev so as it stands miller and budweiser are owned by two direct competitors that being said coors is the only major brewery that has an actual history of supporting the lgbtq community as it eliminated discrimination based on sexual orientation back in the 70s waaaay before it made any business sense to do so
who is holding the beer

i like that he took the time to edit the pictures together and then drew the red circles my man spent at least some time and energy on this theory of his
my man just discovered that you can brush your hair in different styles
one time i got held at the border because i didn t match my passport picture wanna know why the border patrol agent couldn t comprehend why my pic had straight hair but my hair was currently curly i had to explain to a man in his 40s what a hair straightener and curling irons were for surprisingly i never had issues with changing my hair color
so you re telling me some men don t know what a part is welp you learn something new
snort that being said my daughter s mind was blown when a hairdresser asked her where she parts her hair her reply was where it parts
in my defense as a black man who has only had literally three different kinds of haircuts my entire life how does that work exactly actually
what i want to know is why does she dye her roots dark when she has such pretty blonde hair thank you for the award kind stranger love your hair by the way
bro isn t that jamie
oh good grief
it s not the real britney s for those that need it
doesn t have anything to do with him being a man and everything to do with him being an idiot
i haven t laughed this hard in awhile thank you
gif giphy 13tskkp4vdcnxq
let s be fair some of us haven t had hair on top for so long now that we forgot how it works
i think the entire world is a complete mystery to that guy he s just walking around all day completely astonished by everything he sees
i don t even know what to say but i can only assume this is the kind of person that falls for a lot of scams and believes a lot of what they read on facebook
obviously an imposter proceed with caution
you know wes is somebody s manager
i used to part my hair from ear to ear i liked it but i had to give it up i got tired of people whispering in my nose
my favorite tweet from a man like being a man has anything to do with it lol
i recently saw a ticktok where a woman thought that hair grew from the ends not the root so i don t think this is an exclusively male thing stupid knows no gender
maybe just maybe it was said as a joke
cause she s a clone
magic
why make it a gender thing
cloning is not an exact science
we really wanna talk about dumb shit each gender says
head transplant it s the only plausible explanation
hair stylists hate this simple hair hack
to be fair us guys find that one way to part our hair and only part that way for years
i don t even think this is a man thing anyone with straight hair knows this is possible my guess is this is just some dude who has curly hair
clearly he never saw the part pizazz https://youtu.be/5hrvkxsha_i) commercials
i m absolutely astonished that this picture is real
she simply holds her nose and blows until as much play doh she needs for volume of hair
plz don t put this on men
why add from a man
i m not gonna lie i just learned you could do that with you hair from this post and i ve got years in my life so uhhhh i can t believe i ve never noticed or picked up on this kind of thing
must be one of those sourhern teachers that thinks women can hold in their menstrual discharge
my ex husband couldn t understand how someone could get bangs like i think he just thought that some people grew bangs and some people didn t
he s probably the type of guy that thinks the laundry gets done magically by itself
it feels like this is just a troll but i know in my heart that this mf is this dumb
it s a liberal conspiracy
the left looks like jamie lynn spears the right is britney that s probably how s
this comment section makes me nauseous that i m constantly driving around with you idiots
back when bleached hair with dark roots were a thing a friend of mine who s a very smart guy asked me how the girls dyed the roots dark so uniformly
i have to admit as somebody with naturally curly hair that i did not know for a long time that straights can part their hair in different places
you think he knows where her poop comes from
this is definitely an american asking this question
forced hair growth selection surgery should be laws against this next thing you know it will be on a bud light can someone tell trump to rally focus against this
tbf wes probably has only a single row of hair that he combs over
the american education system hard at work
this is the first time i have seen a facepalm post that was not something to do with racism the news or politics literally just a guy asking a question and no i do not visit the sub this was on my home page
and these men want total control of women s bodies don t let them
wait im stupid how did she do that
he probably says the same thing when he s trying to locate a clitoris
i ve always wondered this
us men sure are lame
her scalp
i really don t know why i m being genuine why is it as such
did she just assume his gender
hair how do it work facepalm
maybe he thinks she s really blonde and now he just can t figure out what he s looking at
shapeshifting magic
shapeshifter confirmed
hmm a conundrum indeed
that is not just a man but an impressively stupid person
good grief
to be fare i dnt think most guys hav ever utilized a part so just like me it took a while to realise that thats just a style more or less its one of those things people dnt tell u cuz its unnecessary
tbh i m so tired to the point where i momentarily thought her natural parting moved cause the colors just blend together rn i should get sleep
she s a witch burn her
as she get older that line will eventually move under her chin the circle of hair line
sure it s not a yr old
today i learned that hair grows out of one spot of your head
yeah i remember this dumbass post from years ago too we still have men and women of all types who believe the world is flat guys just remember that
i mean not even a bald person should commit this type of mistake
i have to shamefully admit it took me a couple seconds to understand and not think the same thing
looks like a rams jersey from his profile pic if it is i m not surprised they re some of the dumbest fans i ve ever met
i knew a dude who thought women could just cut their bangs off and be good lol he was like grow them out wdym
that is a boy in the picture and the woman who made this has never had really short hair
how does he remember to breathe
matt is cool
whats funny about this for me is that just have a mole on my natural part so in middle school i started parting my hair from the other side lmao everytime i go to a barber i have to tell them not to follow the natural part and comb it the way i had it when i came in most don t listen now my wife cuts my hair haha
wtf hahaha people really are stupid
i m here looking for the answer eli5 thanks
are these even the same people left looks like jaime lynn spears but i can t tell if the right is jamie or brittany i dont know what old jamie looks like
i m a 39year old man who has had a receding hairline since high school i have no idea how hair parts work and at this point i m too afraid to ask
i m a dude with long hair and this hurts
does knowing the location of the part in my hair help me hunt moose lions and tigers better oh my checks guide book in back pack nope brushes hair straight back without any part shrugs and moves on edit s for the unaware don t actually hunt those critters with anything other than a camera
what
this is a dude who thinks all parts have to be cut in he ll be shocked when he graduates from having his mom cut his hair with a bowl to going to a barber
i m legit asking because i ve been stuck with a middle part my entire life and can never change it apparently
when i was in high school another boy called my part a bald spot not in a joking or teasing way but he seemed to seriously think that s what it is i was so confused by his understanding of hair that i couldn t even respond
like i understand when one gender doesn t know something about a different gender but this isn t a gender thing haha
this guy must have been bald from birth
it d have to be a bald man with alopecia because he s obviously never ever had hair
how the fuck do you make it to adult hood without knowing what a part is
a comb
there is the chick i can only assume a human that can not fathom hair growing from the scalp or as she says sculp and according to her she dont got no sculp at the very least this guy has a slight general idea down
duh it moves as we age

you know you re on the right side when you glorify ebeneezer scrooge
imagine taking right wing lit reading animal farm and having them explain that the pigs just pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and were very successful bosses
ah yes because we should really be focusing on the positives of war instead
i thought that the point of education and particularly reading comprehension was critical thinking oh no grab your torches and pitchforks we can t let people think
greed is literally one of the deadly sins biblical teachings are about as conservative as you can get
probably because a piece of literature about a socially irresponsible unrepentant capitalist who promotes war for the sake profit is just a biography on trump
i mean right wingers are usually the ones to hate on art that s probably why they don t make any
lol yeah we need more poems that focus on the positives of war of course smdh
this is not quite the phenomenon it seems to be the circulation of positions and ideas makes the terms not very accurate but broadly speaking arguments from the british right wing have customarily designated mass education itself including universal basic literacy as disloyal deviant and radical and a danger to the british way of life the very idea of universal compulsory free education for all was campaigned against vehemently by conservatives as an imposition of the most dangerous brand of socialist extremism from approximately the 1820s onward as soon as arguments for universal education were starting to be made arguments for the education of women non whites and the working class were regarded as particularly treacherous and vile the introduction of reforming education acts even through to the 1940s was invariably opposed by right wing campaigning that stressed the dangers of extending the privilege of literacy beyond the social elite the echoes of that campaigning still haunt our political and social and educational cultures today what is now called left wing social thought and activism actively promoted universal compulsory childhood education as a social goal it was therefore opposed by right wing positions that held all education outside the traditional leadership elite was dangerous and wrong this controversy overwhelmingly won by the left is central to our political heritage for this reason there are almost no signficant right wing literary authorships though there are of course right wing writings in their preferred genres especially history in british literature until the 20th century literature itself and the literacy which is a precondition for its existence along with the idea of teaching it to anyone but the chosen sons of the imperial elite were essentially taboo for the british right the british right did not want anyone but that elite to read books british writers naturally enough tended to think otherwise the whole new right argument i must say it just sounds like old fascism to me that literature teachers are traitors teaching treacherous literature and thus artificially propagating their treachery and who will protect the children is well i mean obviously first of all it s complete bollocks but it s also a kind of container isn t it for a deeper and more resonant argument which the british right wing is heir to that reading or writing or being able to read or to write literature of any kind whatsoever is a privilege that should be reserved for those who can pass abitrary loyalty tests to be imposed by those with the power to impose them on those who don t which doesn t sound like a very good idea at all the irony that their attempts to do this in the past resulted in the effective ownership of the literary tradition by big surprise people who believed in the power of universal literacy leading directly to the demotion of right wing argument in the domain of literature is probably not something that they have the necessary cognitive skills to grasp i suppose it must be difficult to learn the lessons of the past when all you want to do is to go and fucking live in it
another abhorrent person from the institute of economic affairs a uk based right wing think tank that is not transparent about where it s money comes from
r selfawarewolves
we live in a world where the proletariate was taught that class politics isn t a thing and that economic inequality is as natural as entropy the result is a working class that doesn t understand politics and a political class that exercises a great deal of influence to ensure that it remains that way most people think the difference between left and right is big or small government that s not even close to the truth the political left is driven by a desire for equality while the political right seeks to maintain and empower existing hierarchies suppressing that fact is actually a very important part of right wing politics because by their nature hierarchies tend to have more people on the bottom than on the top
it is almost like art helps you understand diverse opinions see the world differently and requires quite a lot of empathy the ability to see the world thru the eyes of others it is quite rare that good art comes from selfishness closed worldviews kicking down and not understanding systemic problems in society a lot of right wingers also think that art is worthless unless someone is willing to pay for it and are thus against grants and other kind of support from the society they have no idea how it works at all that if we don t support arts then arts and culture will weaken and we lose diversity we lose all the people who are researching new kind of art new forms of expression new styles methods and it will all be just commercial bullshit that is as simple as possible half of pop songs that chart are basically kids songs just dressed a bit differently specially when it comes to smaller countries at the moment we have a wonderful example of capitalism in arts livenation has almost a monopoly and unless you work with them you won t have a career playing live gigs in large arenas they absolutely have to be crushed as it is seriously limiting our choices to see live music them along with ticketmaster also makes it so that you will pay more and the artists are paid less they are a middleman that managed to wedge themselves in the chain and are now leeching without providing any real benefits
we should elevate right wing artists even if they aren t as qualified or as talented as left wing artists simply because they have certain feelings
was amazed when i saw w s paintings like where in the
because the right only deals in hate and fear those are but two of the many emotions humans can experience and they are the least pleasant why would an artist limit themselves to that
yeah when will anybody start writing songs about all the positive aspects of war i mean besides sabaton
so she s agreeing that if you find social responsibility important or think that greed is shameful or that war is negative you must be left wing perhaps she s not as stupid as she seems
i ve never understood brown skinned tories
it s almost as if conservatives don t have a soul
dont forget comedy right wing are too dumb to be funny unless to other morons
i m all for different perspectives but she wants to talk about the good aspects of war and ebenezer scrooge
i understand that mien komph was a right wing arts book written by a right wing artist that inspired djt he like it so much he plagiarized most of it as his own
some college professor did an experiment where he asked students to fill out a questionnaire to find out their political beliefs he found that conservatives tend to be less creative because their thinking is very black and white specifically things like comedy that require nuance are very difficult for conservatives it s the same reason they move the goalposts during political discourse they can t see the gray area
the only legendary right wing artists are kevin sorbo and hitler
maybe because conservatives tend to try and eliminate funding for arts just a thought
wait are they pro scrooge now
there s some pretty good right leaning sci fi at least heinlein and spinrad s the iron dream if you take it unironically
real art requires self reflection and empathy not a strong suit of those on the right
i was holding it together until she brought up my man charles
holy shit right wingers kept failing art school and now we have a literal army of hitler s it all makes sense
r selfawarewolves
because a sculpture of trump made out of empty busch cans isn t art
if right wing artists don t like the way it is then by all means prove us all wrong and produce something worth giving a shit about instead we get ted nugent
maybe i m off base here but most of the right wing folks that i grew up with spent a lot of time shaming degrading and calling me gay because of my love for the arts i m a straight male some of them can t even wrap their minds around the idea of artistic expression now i know this is a small test group but i would say it has something to do with them not being able to appreciate or accept change therefore rendering their imaginations a total void it s one of those it s not me it s you situations
social responsibility bad greed and war good got it
who or what is aqa
people are allowed to hold opinions different than your own
worst part is a christmas carol isn t even that left wing dickens is a christian man the whole point of it is basically don t be a greedy bastard and help out the poor and needy like a good christian mr fezziwig is the ideal version of scrooge a generous businessman
animal farm is actually on the uk syllabus we let the right wing think it s a right wing book because it s anti stalinist although it was written by a socialist orwell does give me a good chuckle when conservatives quote
we can make this war so big so big the more people we kill in this war the more the economy will prosper
nono you can t just take it out of context and use it for backfire
greetings this is the secretary of war at the state department of the united states we have a problem the companies want something done about this sluggish world economic situation profits have been running a little thin lately and we we need to stimulate some growth
gif giphy poql6zsxzbmce
that sounds dangerously close to affirmative action for conservatives i mean they re all about people being evaluated on their merits right
don t forget kid rock
yeah i love how helping the poor has become synonymous with liberal dystopia to christians
being a good christian is a left wing idea though
i believe it s spelt fozziewig
kind of wish i could but alas his big dumb head is always just a scroll away doing stupid kid rock stuff

this looks like rage bait right
melatonin
edgy troll is edgy just because it s baited you don t have to bite be the master of your bait
melatonin injections that s what we zzzzzzzzzzz
either a troll or a deeply stupid troubled individual imo
it s a two week old tweet with only views who cares
it s a poe don t be gullible enough to fall for it x200b https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law) poe s law is an adage of internet culture saying that without a clear indicator of the author s intent any parodic or sarcastic expression of extreme views can be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of those views
people want this to be true so bad because they have a prosecution fetish
can you imagine getting so triggered over some nonsense over the internet from some troll go touch grass or something
melatonin injections really that s where we re at
so they are telling whote people to do black face i thought people got mad about that i m confused
doesn t surprise me in the slightest
now this this is hate hate is something that effects all people all colors all genders sometimes stuff like this discourages me doesn t matter from what side it s being thrown from but it s gettin old hope y all have a good day
yea this is the opinion of a rage bot or troll no need to share this at all this person s opinion is stupid and wrong obviously
do you live under a rock racism towards white people can be seen in both schools and legislation for example or have you talked to young people if you re truly unaware their views might shock you and funny how because this post itself is racist towards whites the response here is obviously bait troll who cares but if it was directed to another race i wonder
with what we ve seen it doesn t matter if things are stupid and or wrong it will be seen and there will be a perception of it being much more popular and influential than it is and then it becomes popular and influential
could you link some examples i m especially curious about the legislation cause tbh i don t see a lot of this
if some dumb people see this tweet and are inspired to get tan and use condoms i think we ll be ok let s let them do that
totally in reality there s maybe a few hundred people that think that way those people are extremists in some way and should always be ignored
i saw this coming years ago and honestly it s such an iceberg at this point i d recommend you to first watch a short youtube video by charlie cheon labeled what are we doing to white people it s a well put together piece for someone who hasn t really noticed this trend and he also brings up a few examples there i believe
but getting a tan will be seen as cultural appropriation and the pro lifers will see using condoms as an affront to god this is world war in the making
that s a lot of words just to say i don t have one
img emote t5_2r5rp
what s more effective me giving example without context for someone who s completely new to the subject or directing them to a piece of information with multiple examples and thorough explanations
i m guessing my sarcasm wasn t picked up i thought adding the world war was a give away lol

i very very briefly worked at a bar once and watched this sad sack buy this girl and her friends a couple of rounds of tequila sunrises the girls bailed soon after and the dude was so mad and asked me where they went i just shrugged and laughed to myself like my brother in christ you willingly bought worth of drinks for a complete stranger and her friends how did you expect this to go down
that s why i don t buy drinks for women unless it s my dog marble
it s tiktok the whole thing could be scripted
don t buy drinks for women just talk to them and see how it goes save your money they ll talk without a drink
roofied himself
this is the risk you take when you buy a stranger a drink own it like a man
he shouldn t be buying drinks for anyone if he thinks that makes them owe him something
guys women don t owe you anything if you buy them a drink women don t take drinks from strange men it could go from them being creepy to much much worse
don t post your l s so publicly but honestly if you buy a woman a drink she doesn t owe you her night
i never accept offers to buy me drinks from men besides the fact that i am married they seem to think you owe them attention if you do accept it and some of them don t care that i m married either so i just say no and buy my own
dude that s not your girlfriend wtf
sure take it back not like she owed you any social obligation just because you chose to buy that for her do you think you re some badass for that
honestly if someone bought me a drink and then wanted it back i d just give it back idc enjoy your drink pissbaby
and he quickly remembers that he roofied the drink and karma has claimed another victory
he did the whole thing for clout yawn
so buying a drink means she has to give you all her attention i have bought drinks many times but never with a hidden you can t dance with other men clause
dude you bought her a drink you didn t marry her
gee i wonder why she chose to interact with someone other than the op s
if you bought her a drink its her drink
this just makes him look cheap and petty she dodged a bullet
fragile masculinity
makes perfect sense why she moved on
he fucked up should have gotten mozzarella sticks works a lot better
gifts are conditional incel in the making
just because you buy a women a drink does not obligate her to dance with you
i mean it s kinda funny
watch me show my red flags before a relationship even starts way to be an incel and be proud of it
forever single and never understanding why
what a creep the scumbag doesn t own her attention for the evening because he spent edit as this comment is getting a large amount of attention i wanted to add some information for the people wanting context i did some additional searching of publicly available sources easily available although not linkable due to concerns of it being considered doxxing and the context was apparently this he bought her the drink they then chatted she actually gave him her phone number and she left to speak to someone else after the drink arrived
i mean can you blame her he looks like a fucking dork in that outfit
i had this argument with my family not too long ago to be clear she owes him nothing and anything he does is on him even though in this case it s pretty funny but since he s a complete stranger common sense says to just say no next time don t take the drink yes he shouldn t respond to that crap but we don t live in a world of how people should be you just can t be sure how someone will respond to that say no thanks and it ll save everyone a headache
buying women drinks should stop
boy is right
human interaction is fascinating to observe
he sure is a boy and not a man
that dude is a real piece of shit
i m a nice guy i bought you presents and called you beautiful you kind of owe it to me to be mine
you buy her a drink so she owes you something women aren t objects
buying a woman a drink does not make her your property for the night get over yourself
if anything you just justified this girl dancing with someone else way to go cowboy
buying someone a drink doesn t mean they are required to interact with you people are not to be purchased this is big incel energy
its super easy to talk to women if you actually talk to them if you are acting creepy and desperate that is when they won t talk to you
hey i bought you a drink don t you know that means i own you now
don t expect anyone owes you anything just cause you bought them a drink lol
a drink is not a contract
i ve never done the bar scene but i never thought buying someone a drink meant they were committed to hanging out with you for the night furthermore is dancing with someone else considered some form of betrayal
boy was the key word
what a douche you chose to buy her that she has no obligation to you tool
she dodged a bullet there dude has issues
buying a drink is not equal to buying a woman
if you buy someone a drink it s a gift and you don t take gifts back not sure if he did this just to get some sm exposure but it s just weird as hell or even if you re a complete ass hat just think of it as a low cost education for the price of one drink you learned all you need to know about how not to meet partners
douche buys woman a drink thinks he now owns her
buying a woman a drink is not like calling dibs or seat saved for crying out loud besides who buys a woman a drink right out the starting gate you gotta be interesting enough to have a bit of conversation first you know demonstrate that you re someone worth getting to know then offer to buy a round the behavior in this video is weapons grade incel stupidity
no wonder she won t dance with you
yup you really showed her that she made the right choice
it s true that she doesn t owe him anything but she could have easily declined the drink if she wasn t interested
gif giphy qrac7thkfsoc8 downsized
there is no way he s getting any action with that shirt and cowboy hat combo and the stache no way
boy being the operative word here if you buy a woman a drink and think that obligates her to you then you re just a little boy
small pee pee detected
very petty buying a drink for someone isn t a contract she may move freely about the cabin as she pleases
small dick energy they don t owe you shit buddy you buy them a drink your shot your shot you sucked move on to the next one
lol that s some lame ass shit
she doesn t owe you anything weirdo
damn i didn t know you could reserve chicks with drinks
i don t understand why buying people drinks is a thing i m a women and i used to find it incredibly awkward when i men offered i was thinking what if they expect me to do something with them now or talk to them all night now are they trying to get me drunk has he put something in there i went on a hen do a few years back and a guy offered all the women around me my aunts friends were like just take the drink what s wrong with you i had a boyfriend who is now my husband lol
i never let men buy me drinks because they always think i then owe them my whole night i got my own money and no i don t want to talk to you
now every edgy alpha on tik tok is calling him based what a bunch of pathetic pieces of shit
what else would you expect from a dude who goes to a club in his cowboy hat
did you try and get your cum back from your ex gfs too
so what you buy a girl a drink and now you own her
lmao what a jackass i can t imagine acting like this and then recording it and uploading it to tiktok does he think he owns her because he spent on a drink
she doesn t owe you anything if you buy her a drink
imagine buying someone a drink under the guise of it being a friendly gesture then thinking that person owes you sexual attention
she dodged a bullet if you ask me but i m more surprised that he hadn t drugged it
what a petulant child got his feelings hurt because she didn t give him the time of day do you shitty men really think women owe you sex or even their time because you decided to spend a bit of money if any dudes believe this i dare y all to put yourselves below so we can all make fun of you
she doesn t owe you anything just because you bought her a drink she didn t even ask for
how could she not fall for that guy did you miss that hat too bad she is stuck with a discount paul rudd
lol his smile at the end
that entire package is so damn punchable
i haven t been single in a very long time are we still in the days where the drink was what bought the dance now that i think of it i forgot how strange that was you re literally buying minutes of a woman s time and had that smoking of time to either impress like hell with your dance moves or perform the art of the deal in minutes or less
this is the kind of thing that me and my friends would find humorous but would never share outside of that small circle good grief

i ve only ever bought drinks for friends acquaintances buying drinks for strangers is odd no
the first time i went to a bar i went with my girl friend i didn t have to buy a drink guys would buy her drinks and she d give some to me
if you expect something just because you bought a woman a drink you deserve to have her go home with some one else
i ve had a bunch of people buy me drinks when i was wearing a shrek mask and a mini skirt had no one buy me a drink in jeans and t did get a girlfriend between the two tho
she made the right decision
the most virgin move ever seen
women don t owe you shit bro
i just can t imagine why she wouldn t want to spend time talking to this absolute giga chad

my dad was fired for defending himself from a student who pulled a knife on him my dad took the knife away and while doing it he broke the students wrist
i m noticing that a lot of these kids don t understand the size difference between their year old pound bodies with middle age pound people if it s a grappling match you re going to lose that every time
my wife works in a high school fortunately in guidance so deals with little like this but she sees and hears the issues and i m shocked we do not have a larger teacher shortage in this country
poor pay no respect crappy administrators who don t defend their teachers parents who believe that their little darlings would never do anything wrong school boards that ban books and also won t support teachers and did i mention poor pay
promise you her parents are the same way
lbs and all mouth poor teacher
mainly because there s a good parent shortage
students who assault teachers should absolutely be prosecuted for it but also expelled from the school and or district their parents can either homeschool pay for private school or move to a new district we really need a strict zero tolerance policy for violence against teachers
we had a tech teacher who launched a pupil through a door for similar no one messed with mr drysdale after that
in about ten years that girl is going to be complaining she cannot get a job because she didn t get her qualifications and every low paying job fires her on the first day after she goes off on her boss
i m so glad i went to school in the s fuck whatever garbage pile it is now i used to want to be a teacher when i was younger but i m glad i didn t
because they keep adding onto the workload my wife s a teacher and has been for about years and every year they had more crap to do it s always more paperwork and bullshit for meetings with metrics it s just more of the same bullshit that managers want to collect numbers and point at graph for
kids like that regardless of background home life etc should be immediately expelled for something like that there is no excuse for that sort of behavior
and other kids sit there and laugh laugh and record that s what people do today this world sucks
all comes down to the principal if they back the teachers and listen to their issues bad students be kicked out or suspended
i hope that twat student got charged
because of the undisciplined teens who no matter what will get pushed through school failing so they don t care about learning
people need to start raising their kids right would solve alot of problems
her parents must be trash for raising a piece of shit like this sure keep complaining when no one wants to teach in your districts
teachers need to start really pushing on their union for more protective measures for there safety every classroom needs a panic button for student misconduct with an immediate response team
she doesn t act like that at home
seriously we need this thing called consequences reinstated it is insane the lack of punishment schools can enforce now teachers are supposed to just take shit
discipline starts at home
i graduated in in a class of i never saw anything remotely like that in my time in school
i blame the parent
removed
yeah was a high school teacher for nine years i absolutely love teaching but all the bullshit that was not teaching became too much got thrown into a door the following year i was put on hallway duty to break up fights i was seven months pregnant i quit the next day and haven t gone back
i remember back when i was in third grade i had a teacher who would throw a very soft foam apple at us if she saw we were doing something wrong we thought nothing of it and never got on her case about it because she wants t doing anything harmful and really we were the ones acting up we learned great lessons about being calm and not acting up or something will come our way nowadays these kids and parents thing soft discipline is wrong and hurtful this girl is a prime example of what happens when you don t discipline kids they think they are above everything and disrespect everyone but expect respect in return
i m a teacher at a houston isd rise campus we get up to 18k in stipends and our district has raised teacher salary from last year by most of us on campus are not returning next year i myself after years of teaching am done with this bullshit i ve applied to every educational company in the world hoping one will recruit me i told my fianc they can raise my salary by whatever they want next year i m not returning fuck this this is no way to live
gif giphy isockxuybvfq4 this is so sad my generation has an image of teachers as dedicated people whom many of us remember with respect and affection but hey these are different times
okay i m not usually one to advocate this kind of thing but unless she has a mental disorder or disability the second she aggressively puts her hands on the teacher some rules go out the window teacher would have been within her rights imo to do to that girl exactly what she was doing you wanna grab some hair and act like you know how to fight have fun being slammed into the floor at this point she s been taught she can get away with this behavior and she needs a lesson to learn that s not the case
a student tried to fight my geometry teacher and my teacher knocked the kid into the next week it was glorious the teacher didn t even get in trouble everybody watched their step around mr mcdonald after that
i know a guy who retired early from teaching high school english to be a cook because back of house in a restaurant was less abusive and stressful than being a teacher yeah it s that bad
this is whats wrong kids have no consequences the teacher will get fired because this brat thinks she can do whatever she wants and the school board and her parents support it when really needs to be a whole lotta ass whoopin going on
teacher should file for disability ptsd have her arrested and sue the school for unsafe conditions
who raised that bitch
so many people blaming the school system but look at the quality of the people they re trying to instruct a principal guidance counselor etc is one employee who s only there for 40ish hours a week they re not god and can t magically make students act like civilized humans put the kids who want to learn in one group and put the little beasts in another where they can learn a basic trade for simple minds
and why is there a parenting shortage these bad kids have not been prepared for the world and life is gonna kick their ass
kids be like do something do somthing provkes the teacher teacher something kids play the victim all surprised and shit claiming their innocence
the parents of these kids need to be held accountable
some children should be left behind laws that deny schools the ability to hold children back a grade for performance or expel them for behavior are what has caused this
that s a child that s never been told no
this is when another student needs to stand up and slap the shit out of the girl and then sit back down
that girl needs to go to jail
being a teacher is like working in a zoo these kids are animals
the whole class is full of clowns for allowing this to happen and not intervening
kids just sit there and laugh until it turns violent not one student willing to hold their peer accountable this is an echo of our broken society
raise your kids to be good people or abort them before its a problem
when i was in school in the 1970s that teacher would have punched that kid in the mouth problem would have been over and its likely the student would never act that way again i guess i am getting old what a bunch of nonsense
this is totally unacceptable america has a serious problem and the youth have been infected with it
i left america and taught overseas for years i was very well paid in a place where teachers were respected and honored why would anyone want to teach in the toxic environment for teachers that america has become a country where legislators interfere with education for political purposes where parents often make no effort to help their children learn where the teachers must use their own money from their already meager salaries so students can have necessary supplies where minority students who study and work hard are bullied by their peers for acting too white where a teacher with two masters degrees is offered a job with pay on a scale with fast food workers where ignorant people dictate what can and can t be taught in our classrooms whose convictions are driven by misguided and hateful religious beliefs yes i left in disgust and anger and disappointment to pursue a career doing something i loved i have no regrets it has only become worse but what of our children and their futures because their futures are the future of all of us
okay now charge the student with assault
understand why the teacher didn t just leave but that would have been better imo as soon as it turns phycial multiple adults need to be there to deal with the situation ideally in the hallway and not in front of the classmates what is the saddest part for me is the reaction of the classmates but at least they recorded it she was waiting for a sign to start fighting and realized it was not coming as soon as she tried something she was on the ground with he massive teacher on top of her you re not winning that fight girl
there s a shortage because we refuse to let kids like this fail let her fail let her reap what she sows she s begging us to leave her in poverty stop trying to save people that won t save themselves
she ratchettt
why is such behaviour common in u s education system is this mainly limited to schools in low income neighbourhoods i am trying to understand why such disruptive acts are common and from what i read online teachers are more or less forced to accept such behaviour without retaliation for the fear of their jobs how can this situation be rectified if students are never held answerable for their behaviour for some reason this disgusts me at an very core level not only is that student denying herself an opportunity to get better but that of other students as well the selfishness total disregard to learning and lack of respect is baffling to me
i was a teacher i couldn t afford to live ended up finding a job as a construction manager making over double what i was teaching teachers are criminally underpaid
p o s kids with p o s parents
in high school i had a history teacher who was a competitive lifter i think at the time he held the world record for the dead lift he was a short and stocky guy he was very soft spoken one day a kid tried this shit with him he didn t do anything to the kid but he lifted up a desk with one hand and tossed it clear across the room like it was a pound dumbbell no problems after that
people who act like this should be banned from schools
throw her in the garbage bin
teachers in trash neighborhoods have it the worst my grandmother was a teacher in los angeles and retired early literally because of the students like this
the teacher was definitely holding back she could of easily snapped her
parents guardians still won t do jack shit to teach the child how to take accountability for her actions something that you need to learn how to do asap before you re spit out into the real world they ll somehow find a way to spin it on the teacher because nobody wants to raise their fucking degenerate kids anymore and will let tiktok and social media do it instead this kid will surely grow up to be an upstanding member of society that brings a positive impact to those around her edit i work at an elementary school and signs of this are caught very early on does it piss me off that parents refuse to step up to the plate anymore yes do i wish i could do more to help the child because i m passionate about my job yes but the law is the law grow up and be a parent these kids follow in your footsteps
teachers need a panic button in their classroom which brings an immediate response from a sro put the aggressive child in handcuffs and remove her it may serve as a deterrent to other kids considering that behavior
i mean i see something in common with a lot of these videos
mom must be so proud of her daughter
talk about privilege
fucking cackling like a pack of hyenas these other children are just as fucked
it sounds exactly like a zoo
i taught for years that s all i lasted it fucked with my mental health big time there is so much entitlement and zero consequences oh and i was only getting paid grand and had to furnish and buy all the supplies for my classroom i feel so guilty for all the money i spent to earn my teaching degree to know i ll never use it again
people are afraid to talk about the real problem
this is a cultural social issue where being tough is rewarded and showing weakness is blown up online kids are afraid to be permanently labeled weak and will go to stupid lengths to prove they are not because they know being reckless at a younger age gets a pass seen this shit all day in ny act tough to get respect being kind means being weak it s such backwards brute shit
i wished there was more context to this but man teachers do not deserve this if the teacher was disrespectful prior to this video then that s on them i just cannot believe we went from teachers being an authority figure for kids to teachers being less than the kids they re teaching depressing really
such a vibrant culture
what a lovely culture i work at a school and the kids can get away with anything because they can t afford to pay teachers for after school detention kids break everything then cry when there s no more soap dispenser water is shut off etc because they broke so many of them so far
gonna be a sad day for students when the teachers just say fuck it and start treating them like the adults they pretend to be and just starting knocking motherfuckers out i m surprised it s the students that do the whole bring the guns to school and make the bad people pay thing and not the teachers
just another kid who needs their ass beat
i honestly don t blame the teachers nor the students i blame the poor parenting happening
no home training
on one hand you want to tell them if you don t want to come to school don t see what you amount to and let them discover where lack of education leaves them otoh it is not just the child that suffers from their ignorance all of society pays the price for ignorant children who become adults
troubled kids a k a goddamn brats is nothing new and is not the reason there is a teacher shortage the reason there is a teacher shortage is this country doesn t fucking support teachers education funding at a national level is goddamned shameful for every brat there is a bad parent who is bad at parenting because parents also don t get enough support in this fucking country the problem is many faceted and self perpetuating and is only getting worse because we d rather circlejerk about sports teams and gendered bathrooms than address any actual problems
and not one student with morals steps in to pull their classmate back what hope does the next generation have
i acknowledge systemic racism and the disadvantages african americans face in the u s but seriously how are people raised that results in this type of behavior my guess is the constant victim narrative is instilled in their brains so they never consider any personal responsibility whatsoever second the complete lack of understanding regarding self preservation is astounding yes i ve been abused by teachers and humiliated but all this type of behavior does is ruin your life and make things harder if you can t navigate an ego tripping teacher in hs you have zero ability to succeed as a professional in any sort of future career
it does not delight me to watch this for a second
poor parenting if my kid behaved to a teacher like this would definitely be on sick leave for days
kid deserved a solid punch to the nose
you re not gonna talk to me like that i just wanted to know what the powerhouse of the cell was
there isn t enough money or love in the world some jobs are just too shitty
where i grew up there was the regular high school and what was called the alternative school on the same campus kids who couldn t behave properly in the classroom were sent to this other school so that they could receive more attention discipline and this benefitted the classrooms in the main school because students who really were lower level could learn and work without major disruption it pains me to see that the disruptive kids and the lower level kids are always in the same environment when i moved a few years ago i started as a middle school math teacher it was not uncommon for kids to tell me to f off and be standing on the desk some people will say that i lacked the ability to instill discipline in my students but there s only so much you can do in minutes with kids from not the best background most who have no desire to be there at all with no help from parents or administration you just have to get through it as best you can i changed careers but still substitute teach in my free time only in high school and at schools i am comfortable in it is a huge county and there are hundreds and hundreds of available jobs everyday so many job openings in the county especially in poor areas and i can t imagine it is going to get better
teachers in the us are not getting the respect nor the money they deserve and let s face it the amount money paid is a sign of respect too little is disrespectful of what they bring the disrespect has been going on for a long time
because people raise asshole kids who think they can act like street urchins
because parents are complete shit heads now and decided to stop being adults it s embarrassing to watch my peers parent and see how little they all collectively do worthless parents equal shitty kids simple equation you take the time to raise a kid with morals work ethic and confidence then this shit doesn t occur like the old days when this shit would have been squashed before it got to this point that young lady would have been in the hospital and with good reason never assault someone unless you are ready for the consequences of them fighting back
who would want to be a teacher in this day and age children are not being parented at home and these are our future adults of america
clearly the spawn of disengaged shit parents
if parents cannot raise children teachers will not be able to teach them
i wonder what kind of parents raised a child like this
we can pretend it s only the students have you seen what they get paid also have you had to deal with the parents most of the problem children i ve dealt with were to parents modeling poor behavior
kids now a days have no home training

best part they can t charge for this garbage
i remember my first time walking those were the days

why is the male dress code tacky shirt or soccer jersey
people look at me everywhere i go too they even say derogatory comments like put some clothes on or take a bath you smell like ass it s all very unsettling edit also i don t live in egypt
information about the video could you tell us how the video was recorded the girl name redacted walked down the kasr el nil bridge secretly recording with an iphone she held it by her mouth with headphones plugged in and pretended to talk on the phone she pretended to be deep in conversation looking straight ahead of her whenever she felt eyes on her she turned the phone slightly towards them the clip was filmed in a single minute walk around sunset as people often gather on the bridge after the temperature cools down we made sure to record the girl beforehand in order to show her appearance because she is of arab descent she fits in with egyptian society more easily she wore a long skirt a t shirt and a cardigan to prevent any dismissals of the footage such as having worn something to provoke them as groups of men often stare together we decided to slow down the video for viewers to view all their intimidating expressions at once we also recorded catcalls while filming but because the girl was pretending to be on the phone we couldn t include them without hearing her speak in arabic instead we decided to pair the footage with the song a3akes ah at7rash la2 by sadat fifty translating to flirting yes harassment no we thought it was particularly fitting since most young men listen to popular electro sh3abi music
is there a shortage of women there or something they look like this is the first time seeing one
i ve tried to walk around downtown cairo myself to explore the city but i felt very uncomfortable bc of the staring and cat calls by men this is the reality there women walk in pairs or with male relatives etc for a reason
nothing really happened except for guys watching her in the video and as tons of people have pointed out she might ve been suspicious with her phone camera so a part of me is thinking this is an overreaction but then listening to all the stories coming from african middle eastern or asian countries about women being abused by men i d dare guess that she knows in many cases it doesn t end with looking but yeah this video sends mixed messages and possible false flag
i mean not saying women get unwanted attention all over the world but doesn t the fact that she s filming it maybe draw more attention
the guy at the beginning looking at her and taking his glasses off thinks he s a cartoon character
it almost looks like everyone is looking into the camera
sorry but the first guy taking his sun glasses off has good meme potential
i had to stop watching the thirst is insane there
was she harassed or were a lot of people wondering why they were being filmed i d stare if someone came walking towards me with a camera pointed at me
soooo i m a little confused here it looks like she s turning the camera towards them and they re making eye contact for that reason they didn t seem overly handsy or anything just slightly interested i m not saying there aren t cultures that harass women i ve seen it first hand in india i m just saying this doesn t appear anywhere near harassment from my perspective the other girl may receive more attention because she is tall and white i can tell you as a nordic man with a large beard and very pale skin as well as tattoos that i receive a great deal of attention in benin many people stop and stare at me and even touch me it s not out of any malicious intent but simply out of pure curiosity and fascination with something they don t encounter regularly and in some rural regions very likely have never have seen before
i make eye contact with damn near every person i cross paths with unless i m on my phone or looking around at where i am thought that is normal behavior
some of you are clueless as all fuck they stare her down because she s walking without a man and not covered up remember these are the same steaming piles of trash islamic fuckshits that raped a western reporter live while she was reporting on the protests read the book clash of civilizations instead ingesting tick tock trash
this is so dumb
tbh i would look too if i see a girl recording me lol
people who are saying it s probably just the camera that s making people look harrasment is an issue for women travelling alone in egypt https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-tips-for-female-travellers-visiting-egypt?
alarming amount of bros
i have a belarusian friend she has gone to egypt and qatar for server jobs a few times as it pays more than what she could earn in belarus she said egyptian men are the worst i asked her what she has against middle eastern dudes and she says nothing but egyptians specifically are the worst she told me a lot of stories and basically she said the majority of the guys are just assholes and stare and make rude comments and it s normal to them she said in the other countries like uae qatar they at least understood cultural differences and were a lot better about it she said it could still happen but no more often than in any western country so when i watched this video that s the first thing that came to mind i d be curious if this would turn out any differently in other countries she did say that egypt is still a nice place to go for eastern europeans for vacation as it s really cheap so long as you can deal with how the staff will treat you if you re a woman
were they looking at her or the camera she was holding
pointing a camera at strangers in public
of course people will stare when you clearly show that you are filming
filming strangers and catching them in the act of not talking to you and not touching you but looking at you likely because you re holding a phone with a camera on it at a degree angle in front of your face to film them while pretending you re talking on your phone isn t the gotcha many people are pretending it is this is not sexual harassment to glance at a woman as you pass her isn t harassment and many of these people looking directly into lens likely puzzled as to why they re being filmed appear to be children shaming them for sexual harassment is irresponsible and doesn t serve any cause except maybe promoting this kickstarter for their very carelessly made documentary project i hope that the women shaming these men get a chance to play this game where a man walks directly in front of you holding his phone at a degree angle as if filming while bizarrely pretending to talk to someone you glance at the person to try to figure out what they re doing then the footage of you glancing is shared describing you as a sexual harasser despite you not even speaking to the man or touching him
creepy but not like india creepy and definitely not pakistan creepy
it just reminds me of that one lady from new york with a hidden camera in a backpack in front of her folks are more or less the same no matter the culture or place
so where s the sexual harassment i see a video of pedestrians glancing at a somewhat decent looking woman walking in the opposite direction and this video has been slowed down to make their brief glances look like awkward stares oh no god forbid people observe their surroundings
or are they just wondering why this random person is videotaping them
just curious is this a typical street i didn t see any other women
i have spent time in cairo for work traffic is horrendous everyone honks donkeys on the road if your car is hit by a donkey don t expect an insurance claim literally just chaos on the roads of cairo beggars everywhere extremely unpleasant place the only place that i can think of that might be on par with egypt is india but india smells like a public toilet
being glanced at even stared at a bit while walking down the street pointing a camera at people is not in and of its self evidence of anything it s not sexism it s why are you filming me i do believe there can be misogynistic treatment of women simply for existing it happens everywhere all the time this is not that
i would look at some filming me as i walk by too
maybe they are looking why is she filming us
trying to walk as a man with women pointing cameras in egypt
i don t doubt that there were plenty of catcalls and ogling stares but honestly it doesn t come across without the sounds of the actual recording yeah if someone is walking towards me with their phone up to their face having a conversation i d be staring for a bit too literally everyone looks at her even kids
walking alone as a woman filming every man that you pass
wow men staring at a person who s pointing a camera directly at them as they walk past her how does she even survive
i am suspecting they didn t hide the camera very well
i d be wondering why you re recording too
this is very clearly not a good example at all women suffer abuse every single day but you showing how men look at you walking with a fucking phone camera pointed at them is not indicative of anything
r imthemaincharacter
where s the mummies egypt looks lame
how man were just checking out her camera i didn t see many lustful looks
why is this posted on this sub what s facepalm about it nothing
i d be looking too if some goofy ass was walking in slow motion
is it possible they are staring at the camera she is holding nothing about this video suggest it s hidden in any shape or form
so looking at someone holding a camera is sexual harassment i don t get it
everyone is staring because you re walking with a camera
i mean i d be staring at you too wondering what you re doing filming everybody as you re walking at what appears to be against traffic as literally no one is staring at the girls walking the other way
why the fuck is this chick filming us
so they looked at her the horror
i like how all of them have a look of confusion like what is she doing lol also how they re all looking into the camera
not knowing anything about that song it sounds like a banger edit also the last dude wearing a confederate flag shirt is confusing me
i didn t see any of the men do anything to her other than look at the person who is videoing them for no apparent reason
this is crazy because i just saw a post where a woman walked down the street made note of people looking at her and got flamed for it as narcissistic this isn t entirely the same but all those videos of people complaining about guys looking at them in the gym even when they don t confront the guy still get flamed none of these dudes did anything more than glance for a few secs and this response if the issue is staring i get that but legit i don t see the difference between this video and any other it s honestly very tame
when i see a woman carrying an in and out bag i can t help but behave the same way
sexual harassment is global except in the middle east where the men are desperate and deplorable so it s so much more grotesque
so the attractive girl has men take small glances at her admiring her and not in any way disturbing her or stopping her from living her life i don t see the issue
i d be looking too if someone was walking down the sidewalk with a camera in front of them not even trying to walk around people and is expecting them to move instead also a slow mo video will make every glance look like someone is staring this video doesn t really show much
walk like an egyptian
very nice how much
so everyone wears soccer shirts lol
this makes me think of that video of an egyptian actor spending a day walking the streets as a woman
wow i think that s because it s a huge sausage fest all over the streets barely any women around that is sad i d stay home if i were a lady
the women of egypt have the power to band together and solve this is it ez no but it is possible living like this is a choice
god as a short balding low vibe middle aged man this video really struck home i mean it didn t strike home as it was filmed on the other side of the world from my home though it did strike home in the sense that im a short balding low vibe middle aged man s
how did everyone miss the guy lower his shades at the beginning
you got to be pretty young to think you ve got a striking revelation there
but did she walk like an egyptian
wtf you think was going to happen you think a bunch of trannys will escort you wherever you go it s a muslim country lol
i d be like dang i m fine why are they all picking up rocks
what the fuck is a woman
apparently there s only like hair styles for men in egypt aswell also football shirts are the go to style which is grim football shirt fabric always smells nasty when it gets warm
im wondering if the camera she is using is visible she didnt really show how she looked with the recording equipment
jokes on us she s actually walking around in a giant dinosaur costume but seriously that s fucked this shows more of what s wrong with the ingrained societal ideology than anything limiting exposure of woman and sex in general on top of religion creates this issue that so many woman face today all around the world my hope for the world is that one day every man and woman can be free to do whatever they wish away from religion government and societal pressures
i think the problem is not because of her gender this video clearly shows that even males walk in a group of at least
just here to say that music is slamming
i was offered camels for my wife when in egypt i looked it up on the camel calculator and it s a lot makes me proud and we had a good laugh
sure they weren t staring at the go pro strapped to your head or chest depending on which grt up you chose
during my attendance in college there was a class called psychology human nature our professor had all the guys go to a public area the local mall and we asked female students to show up to the mall with friend each as the guys all sat on a bench against the wall then had each girl and friend walk through our location the friends had no idea on our study first girl and friend we flirted with them then the second girl and friend we totally ignored them so after we did that we got back to class the following day we asked each female student how was the mood behavior of the friends the one we flirted she was kinda upset at first then rest of her day was joyful the one we ignored she was totally in a bad mood upset and went home early
anyone notice most of the men look identical they definitely all have the same down turned shaped mouth that s for sure
they all seem to be minding their own business
i should walk across a busy bridge holding a camera at a bunch of passersby and calm sexual harassment to anyone that doesn t like being filmed and looks at me funny
to be fair you are above average looking and your city looks like one big sausage fest but all they did was look your way while you were filming ever see what americans do any time a news crew starts filming live also if a man walks down the street in a thong and t shirt he s gonna get a bunch of looks and stares too especially in america just saying predictors are not usually bias these days
plot twist she was wearing googly eyeglasses
she looks like a train is coming
went to egypt when i was younger for a holiday one particular waiter must have been early s kept giving my then year old sister gifts whenever we d eat in the restaurant one night he brought over a teddy bear a rose and a card that asked her to meet him outside the front of the hotel at 11pm so he could show her round the town
why was everybody staring was she naked
i m not really sure what she expected in a arabic muslim country
nothing like whats it like videos that are cut up more than netflix s iron fist fight scenes to really show case the narrative you wanna push i mean yeah i am not doubting thats what it may be like but with all those cuts how the hell would any of us know
sexual harassment are you fucking kidding me honestly though why are they pushing this agenda
how was that sexual harassment
they are all looking because she has a camera stuck out in front of her filming everyone
i see that walking alone as a woman in egypt is like walking alone as a man in egypt
you can tell who was just looking at the camera at a glance and who was staring at her
yes a global problem but don t act like you are going to face this amount of disgust somewhere in the free world it s mostly a problem in the religious world
totally not just people looking at someone walking opposite to the direction they are walking in while filming
if this is supposed to make me more racist it kind of doesn t work i already am

one of the funniest things to me about cultural appropriation is how it is selectively enforced by the people who accuse others of it cinco de mayo hell yes let s get margaritas and tacos st pattys day kiss me i m irish and let s get drunk off our ass greek life in college put greek letters in our houses wear togas and drink like maniacs use a native american feather and clothing for halloween racism
reducing humans to a single perceived aspect of them these types of people are incapable of any critical thinking outside of themselves it s sad
op reinforcing the meme
this was probably posted by some guy who laffed his butt off at milton berle doing drag on johnny carson
only americans give a shit about kids dressing up as indians
but think of the children if we let them dress up like other cultures they could believe that they are another culture and that s a short jump to trans cultural there s no growth or change allowed now let me check your lineage dna and genitals to ensure you are what you look like you are based on my subjective experience
i m really just curious as to who and how it harms dressing up as a indian assuming they mean native americans
what cultural appropriation https://youtu.be/xr6k6a4crg8 people of various cultures who other folk get outraged for don t give a shit
how bout everyone lighten up a bit and dress like whatever the fuck you want
so cultural appropriation is a no no but sexual appropriation is a yes yes
so when i go to the mexican restaurant that employs people of latino lineage and they put a sombrero on my head because it s my birthday am i appropriating their culture
yeah imagine having fun on halloween
cultural appropriation is worse than gender appropriation
the first is cultural appropriation the second is drag one of these things is obviously worse than the other
to be fair i don t see your kids raiding an encampment today perhaps tomorrow
gender appropriation
so it is correct yes we aren t disagreeing that the meme is inaccurate op is just using it to signal their views about transgenderism and i guess kids playing cowboys and indians which i don t think is common as it was in the s s when childrens entertainment was commonly involving those groups as opposing foes to emulate teams for play being morally wrong for a child to unknowingly wear something of a culture they didn t grow up in because i m sure op never as a knowing adult says does owns wears anything having to do with a culture they weren t born to this statement is sarcasm i m facepalming op on this there is no facepalm with the meme it s just someone whining about a percieved social injustice do better
meme is correct
i mean both should be allowed but reducing humans to single aspect out of everything is fucked up no matter what
literally no one cared about drag until kids got involved even then i don t blame the performers i blame the dumb ass parents that take their kid to a drag show instead of a park or museum or mini golf or idk go carts or you know any other shit a kid would be stoked about doing with you as a parent to bond together doing something fun spending quality time the groomers are the narcissistic parents ask me how i know
who gives a fuck about drag cultural appropriation bad people should be treated differently based on immutable characteristics racism anyone who thinks that term is valid is a racist idiot with their head so far up their ass they don t realize they ve become the very scourge of society they claim to hate
you just described american hypocrisy
time to set out candy and beat all the non white kids dressing as captain america and iron man before people say i m racist i plan to do the same with non orphans dressing as batman with black panther and of course non green kids dressing as hulk x200b s
native american feather bruh
there might be a reason for that
oh it s a long long story of how euroamericans have treated tribal members and their culture over the past years
ah yes lemme just bring your people and culture to the brink of non existence and then expect you to watch my fat faced kids cosplay as your dead grandparents and then wonder why you re upset not sure how you couldn t see the harm
and who does a drag show hurt
so a video of a guy cherry picking answers whilst dressing as a stereotype on a channel funded by oil barrons is proof
gif giphy u1an4htfj2smgb2bbk
being invited to share in a culture and deciding to mock one aren t the same
the whole misappropriating of culture was originally about taking something that had meaning and either stripping out the meaning or misrepresenting that meaning the best examples being the first nations native american war bonnet and the dream catcher each of them having individual meaning and not universal across the continent but where used as a representation of all indunas north americans while dumping the ideas behind them in more modern times people have bet the meaning to give power to poor arguments racists use it as a way to prevent cultural mixing and those looking to make or defend an identify have pushed to make things off limits to others because they see other things as off limits to them
yes unless you immediately remove the hat settle the bill and walk out of the restaurant if you don t do that then you are clearly worse than hitler
how dare you you should have stopped them apologized and then given them back texas s
that s because there is no such thing as gender appropriation
drag being the worse one obviously
there s always tomorrow
noone has exclusive rights to femininity or masculinity
they both harm nobody apart from concern trolls who it doesn t affect in the slightest who get upset on their behalf drag queens for kids your kids no fuck off cultural appropriation are you from that culture no fuck off and before someone starts yes it s different to racism and yes blackface isn t the same
didn t mention anything about it personally i think kids shouldn t be at them due to some contents in it but other than that couldn t care less about them
not really but how bout this i m indian and i don t give a fuck if your kids wear headdresses and moccasins and buckskin for halloween or any other day for that matter
nah but it s the best i got right now just seen it recently the guy went on dr phil after and spoke with a college professor about the whole thing but just by looking at your profile comments i can almost sense the outrage from here even more so now someone from a different culture has just confirmed what i said have a nice day chin wagging to your allies about the toxic cis male who justified cultural appropriation
who s mocking
you didn t really answer my question
can you elaborate on how racists use cultural appropriation to prevent cultural mixing
are you sure about that lmfao
why
cool
thank you
the white ass parents dressing their kids up like indians because native people are a fucking novelty to them are you dense
basically seeing as you are not mocking the culture or trying to remove any meaning form a sun hat no you are not doing anything wrong you are just appreciating seeming that someone has done for you
can you give me an example of it
because of the implication
i m choctaw and i do care it was literally illegal for us to practice any aspects of our culture or speak our language within living memory and that s not counting the 60s scoop and the residential schools but non indigenous people have always been allowed to play indian
nice language really helps get your point across
gotcha
gender appropriation is when i pretended to be a man
what implication that someone doesn t know what drag is or that they falsely imply drag is somehow harming kids when the only men in dresses that harm kids tend to be from the church
is it currently at some point you have to move forward in life
but could you pretend to be a cowboy
i think my point was already proven with the racist meme op shared that reduces native people to a novelty indian costume for their kids to cosplay as on halloween if my white ass kid went out on halloween with a curly black wig grass skirt bone through his nose and a tribal shield i e the racist caricature of africans people would rightfully think i m a shitty parent person the fact that this has been normalized for a long time doesn t mean it isn t wrong the same way blackface and minstrel shows were simultaneously normalized and wrong this is reddit not the fucking parthenon my colloquialisms don t detract from the validity of my statement cheers
btw there is such a thing as drag kings sometimes people make me wonder did you hate mrs doubtfire monty python mash klinger specifically https://www.cbc.ca/comedy/the-history-of-drag-on-screen-strutting-from-ancient-times-to-cbc-s-queens-1.5699542 drag isn t new even in western society then there are a seperate issue of trans people who full time live the life of the gender of their choice don t see how that s appropriation either an easy way to remember the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation is to remember that cultural appreciation is about honoring a culture whereas cultural appropriation is dishonoring or demeaning a culture https://www.housing.wisc.edu/2022/10/inclusive-language-cultural-appreciation-and-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=an%20easy%20way%20to%20remember,dishonoring%20or%20demeaning%20a%20culture. if we look at gender as a shared set of cultural norms about how a specific gender should act this definition applies

comparing being given a hat at a mexican restaurant to cosplaying as another race doesn t make you sound very smart either but here we both are if it s a matter of impressing your wit and intellect upon the masses of reddit you re not exactly hoisting the proverbial trophy here

so if you are a woman pedophile the state makes the victim pay you money hmm
dude that s fucking horrible not a facepalm
seriously fucked up
maybe he could sue in civil court for the sexual assault and recoup the money this is different than the 13yo boy impregnating the 17yo babysitter in kansas because she was a full adult i see the point of the state though they are looking out for the childs well being the child support is not a punishment even though it may be punishing not saying i agree but i see their point
found out about this story from a youtube channel called aba preach they covered this story in their video and it was demonetized https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tryuvsssey
this is disgusting edit you know what s really mad this happend a while ago not the pregnancy part but that a female teacher had sex with her underage male student and then the majority were obviously appalled but there were some men who argued that this is normal and good for him that every boy dreams of something like this and would feel lucky if they were him and i was just wtf
double standard as usual as long we let mainstream media spread the idea mens are the problem and woman victims by default we we ll be screwed

crazy how many stories recent years of female teachers having sex with children getting no time to slap on the wrists
with no jail time don t forget about that
it s a facepalm with the fucked up law
which child the state should ve been looking out for the child victim of sexual assault not the unborn child of a full grown adult predator i m not saying the baby is to blame but the wellbeing of a baby should not be put onto a child rape victim it should be put onto the predator and only the predator

dumb enough to confront someone they shouldn t but smart enough to walk away when he knew he was wrong
i mean its more polite than most people just leaving when he got the facts instead of causing a massive scene
i am sure i will run into this guy on my cruise this fall when i take my wheelchair and can walk have multiple sclorosis and need it after mins of walking sit for about an hour to two and then ok to walk again edit added more context
wow this dude is pretty awesome how often do you see someone get upset over something stupid and then actually admit it instead of keeping on acting like an ass to save face we need more people like him
dude was just like oh okay cya
he immediately admitted defeat
ah he s obviously an official disabilities detective must have forgotten to show his badge
lol at least he didn t double down he pretty much admitted he was wrong
a lot of people don t realize that not everybody who is in a wheelchair is paralyzed i have ms when i get out of my car and pull out my wheelchair to sit down or wheel to my car and stand up and put it in i occasionally do get some dirty looks but without it i wouldn t be able to live a normal life i can t walk farther than ft on my own unassisted
the vast majority of wheelchair users can walk and still need their wheelchair just like the vast majority of people who are legally blind have some level of vision people have the most absurdly narrow definitions of disability and believe that only the rights types of disabled people should be able to use medical devices or get accommodations that s like someone telling me that i shouldn t be allowed to wear my glasses because my prescription is only how about we just leave people alone and don t harass them
i mean it looks like he was just curious and asked it might be a bit direct and loud and aggressive and gottcha like but the moment he got educated he went his way again
the amount of people that don t stay in their lane is crazy
i dont see the facepalm he asked a question and left when he got his answer instead of causing a scene
better than most i d say
i can t figure out if i think he s a dick or not lol
one time i went with my sister in law to the store and she has a handicap tag so she parked in that area we paid and she realized she forgot to get something so i went ahead and took the stuff to the car as i sat in the passenger side a man walks up to me from the drivers side tells me why was i in a handicap spot if he just saw me walk to the car put the groceries in the car and then walk to put the basket shopping cart away i told him which side of the car am i sitting on he looked at the car and simply walked away
some people never learn how to mind their own fucking business this guy is clearly part of that group
people need to realize its not about if someone can or cant walk its about minding your own business
policing other people s disabilities based on what you personally consider a disability makes you a supreme asshat
got a ride from my mil the other day she has a handicap plate because of knee surgeries she walks fine short periods on our way into a store some old guy slowed down rolled his window down and scoffed yea real handicap arn t ya staring straight at me like if i was the one driving or supposed to be handicap like when are people going to learn to mknd their own business
being dumb is not a crime he is so comical i d love to help him if i found him
i m big justify yourself to me
none of your business asshole
no facepalm here
saying fair enough when you confront someone and they answer you with correct information is a sign of intelligence i thought i was right you corrected me i accept that and move on
oh are you a doctor no okay then cool story bro what are you gonna do call the cops fuck out of here there s no way in hell i d validate some assholes behavior by telling them about my disability it s just pure belligerence from start to finish
i wish he responded that it s none of his damn business
he thought he was on to something what would it change for him though let people be
honestly he s right o be skeptical with the amount of people faking this stuff nowadays having to balls to admit he was wrong and walk away is rare nowadays i agree he came on a little strong but his heart was in the right place
honestly it seems shitty but the guy had a decently warranted suspicion that someone was abusing the handicap system when he realized he was wrong he walked away an apology was probably in order but otherwise this kind of thing should happen people abuse the system this guy wasn t
repost
milhouse knows when to walk away
george constanza is that youuu
why was he yelling that lol
i have two legs and hardly can walk
fair enough lol
why is any of her business yours
i had this yesterday had to check myself outside of a small beer burger restaurant open spaces closer to the upscale wine liquor store woman walks out of said liquor store outfit like lady gaga live in los angeles par the course with cowboy boots on back to parked in handicap spot looking guilty as hell with her bottle she could have something can t walk far she could not i don t know but seeing her in a crazy outfit fancy car looking guilty and ate the only handi spot when others open did not want to give her the pass
why does it fucking matter
i do respect him for immediately backing down you don t see a lot of that these days
i know someone who is completely paralyzed on half her body from a stroke and she can stand and walk for very short distances but it puts her in so much pain and she gets very out of breath she just uses her wheelchair most of the time
what an asshole
i mean yeah it s rude to just come up to someone and ask if they are actually disabled but idk maybe the guy has seen so many stupid videos of people doing pranks and other stuff about faking disability that when he thought he witnessed it firsthand he felt he had to confront it it s like the dude is in a weird middle road of if he is rude or not especially if this was filmed today
he s just pissed he had to park further away
wow someone accepting that they re wrong and leaving the situation we can t just ignore that
i think he was just curious and have a pissed off voice naturally
mad respect to him he acknowledged he was wrong and walked away instead of continuing to be mad about the situation and looking like an idiot
know what kudos for the guy for admitting the wrongful knees and just walking away no escalation no denial just a simple got me there and kept it moving
bro really resolved the conflict in a civilized manner
gif giphy hp7mtfna1e4ceqnbnl downsized
that finger pointing
at least this guy can admit he s wrong in less than a minute
why would a person think that shit would be any of their business
fair enough was funny would have been funnier if he would have angrily said sorry but with the same face as fair enough face
hopefully he understands what he did wrong and never does it again
ge sounded so defeated
as if they just hand out those handy parking tags
it s crazy how so many people don t know that ambulatory wheelchair users exist
when a military veteran is itching to stolen valor you but you have proof
honestly i do think the second part is more important
idk i think it s important to confront those who pretend to be disabled they take resources away from those who are actually disabled
the true american
simple as that
its quite funny though that this shit always happens in america what is the average iq there god damnit
exactly accept it and move on she didn t even have to respond to him but he also could ve just mind his own business when you don t mind your business be prepared to get a answer you weren t expecting and be prepared to let it go otherwise if we fxck around we gonna find out
my condolences my grandma has ms it s really sad it s spread and she can barely even write anymore it looks like a toddler drew it and it breaks my heart to see her try so hard and get frustrated cuz it s painful and it doesn t look how she wanted it to
i dated someone with your situation and it was pretty infuriating
if you are in need of a wheelchair you should be glad there are people like him around who speak up when people are seemingly exploiting the benefits that are meant for you
happy cake day
til that pretty awesome has a new low bar this guy wasn t awesome he was rude and ableist just because he wised up sooner than most entitled jerks doesn t make him awesome
he could just also mind his business and this would ve never happened lol
there is still room for improvement like he should have just minded his own business plus that should be the norm regardless still i do agree more people should act like this just without the confrontation in the first place
fair nuff
it s a major problem that people can t conceive of a partial disability being equally as valid as a total disability of course the us would have this all or nothing mentality
why would he ask that question at all did he think the person rode around in a wheelchair just to be able to park in a handicap spot
nah he definitely caused a scene lol
he clearly cares about disabled people and have the guts to speak up when he think someone is taking advantage of the systems put in place to help them and on top of that he immediately accept it when he is proven wrong i d say he is a pretty wholesome guy
actually i m sorry for bothering you or my apologies would be that
exactly i don t understand people saying he should have minded his own buisness the guy cares enough about disabled people to ask when he think something isn t normal and imediatly back up when he was proved wron should have apologized tho
fair enough
judging by some of these comments he doesn t
you know i don t think that s fair if you re disabled you shouldn t have to explain yourself to every vigilante that shows up it might seem like a rare occurrence when you re not the one who gets questioned once by everybody else
i think it s important to mind your own business as not all diseases are apparent and nobody has to explain anything to you leave it to the police it s ignorant to think people have to prove their ableness to you
the people taking away resources from disabled people is the insurance companies stop bashing normal people when it is the corporations ransacking everyday people they want us to fight between each other as they pull the cart away with all the gold in it
i get it but it makes my life more difficult when people do this i have so much anxiety from it i have a torn labrum in both hips messed up hip flexor on one side a few herniated discs in my lower back scoliosis pins in both of my ankles and si dysfunction my sciatica is pretty awful and driving definitely irritates it it hurts so bad that sometimes i can t put weight on my left leg because it feels like someone is hitting me with a taser i work really hard to not limp bad for you and i don t use assistive devices walking long distances really sucks but other than that i m pretty normal i have a handicap placard and use it on bad pain days my car has disabled usmc veteran plates the issue here i m a small woman and i appear younger than i am and am in great shape i ve been told you aren t allowed to park here if you don t have your husband with you i did almost years in the marine corps and ended up with a lot of injuries i ve been diagnosed with hypermobile ehlers danlos syndrome which is rare but explains a lot my connective tissues are easily damaged and it even effects your skin and makes you look younger than you really are people confront me sometimes and i get dirty looks when i choose to use the handicap parking on my bad pain days i really like my car and have worked hard on fixing it up i m always terrified that some handicap justice seeker is going to do something awful to it while i m not around if that does happen and i catch them not gonna lie here i m throwing hands they re going to be real embarrassed when they get their ass whooped by a disabled woman
it s none of your business many who need wheelchairs can stand or walk i am one of them i don t need to be harassed or explain my private medical business to strangers who are you to appoint yourself arbiter of who is disabled enough this is treating disabled people as subhuman am i disabled enough for you or have you also decided what resources i need too i d much rather be able bodied thanks drives me absolutely nuts with people coming up to me with questions go about your day
no leave people the fuck alone their impairments are not your concern you are not entitled to their explanation
it absolutely isn t and i d bet money your trashy ass doesn t do a single thing for the disabled you allege deserve it
i agree my sister works for our city s human resources and she tells me how ppl claime to be disabled when they are not she says it really takes out resources that ppl realy need
you dont just walk up to someone with that white man energy in country where almost everybody has a gun a chip on their shoulder and most likely is dealing with some form of mental health issue better way is find security or cop to help sort it out
the thing is that often people who think they can tell someone s faking really fucking can t all this leads to is disabled people being harassed
it s a shame but you can t do that imagine how life would be if everyone would do that to him no this is not our role to harass people
i get accused of faking daily because i have hidden disabilities no fuck no
yea except it s not your job and you ll end up being wrong a lot now you re a problem too
must be from arizona tuh
not your pig not your farm fuck off
that s the hill you want to die on confronting would be disabled parking fraud if you actually find out someone is faking it and using parking spots what s your plan call the cops what other resources do you think they are taking away from other people this is none of your business find something else to do
i think the most infamous case or at least the one that immediately came to mind has two women speaking in a british accent i believe that wasn t the us i m pretty sure
it s less iq and more the massive amount of entitlement the older generations have

it was a graphic novel so some of the images were called into question pippin argues that in one graphic scene in the book frank asks a friend to expose themselves to one another also there s a scene with some nude statues in the background the book was pulled because some of the text did not fit the theme of holocaust education i haven t read the diary of anne frank but i know it deals a lot with her personal growth and trying to be a normal teenage girl even while confined and in fear i feel like stripping down her life to just be about the holocaust is missing a big part of what makes kids identify with her
fascists in the government
you mean like how they fired that principal of the classical school because students saw a picture of the david while the guy in charge of the board that did the firing has naked cherub statues in his yard for the world to see and the firing has lead to the hillsdale christian college ending their association with the school i mean i guess it may be a form of that someone with a username like you have would post about not wanting kids to see nudity in art maybe parents will have better luck with their kids not looking at nude pictures if you know they actually parent their kids instead of running around taking offense to books in libraries
oh no nude pictures fucking puritans
okay fuckmeuntilicecream if you say so
not michelangelo not him ahhhhhhh
y being a vowel makes a little sense but removing letters w h y fucking why
there are no sex scenes and the depictions of the statues are about as chaste as you can make roman statues there is descriptions of anne frank describing what a women s genitalia are like but that s just in text not graphic and is word for word what was in the diary which has not been banned
florida did rank 27th but took a huge hit people there will be unable to teach history in other states meatball is a stain on education
hmmm a journal of a jewish teenager hiding in an attic from nazi persecution for years does not fit the theme of holocaust education florida needs to be renamed floridumb
i don t disagree with anything you say i just kind of understand where they re coming from anne frank is not banned the graphic adaptation is this isn t from all libraries this is a school district i don t agree on banning books and censorship i just don t want my kids looking at shit they don t need to especially with the way the internet is these days nothing is safe anymore
i was wrong it s not about the nude pics it s a mature book that talks about sexuality and obviously other very mature themes children probably shouldn t have access to read the book
have you read the book genuinely asking i haven t so i don t know what nude pics are in there
deleted
i m always opposed to banning books i just don t understand why there adaptations to the diary it seems like gross profiteering off suffering but that s not really relevant to the original story i suppose
meatball stain desantis
children the story said they were banning this from high schools it isn t in elementary schools the story does have mature themes in so much as it is a teen girl expressing herself and how she feels seems very appropriate to the age group
the idea is to bring the story to an audience that might not normally read a book the message was important enough that someone felt this was a good way to get the message across
that s a keeper

i m sure that wasn t awkward in front of anyone s parents grandparents
that romantic silver tongued devil
thank fuck she thinks he s funny i find this revolting
trashy that s something you would expect from a year old getting married in a tuxedo t shirt
that was in incredibly poor taste
keeping it classy
can you imagine how her dad feels hearing him talk about her like that super disrespectful
they met at walmart
gross
he just went too far he could have gotten away with maybe of those jokes
i would say this guy is just an idiot no vows were said in his horrible speech
let me say on behalf of all men this guy is a fucking creep
oh this video s been hotly discussed on tik tok already she s come to his defense multiple times and the collective reaction is oh honey nooo eta and her vows are incredibly self deprecating in a sad way the dynamic is very clear especially when one considers they ve been together for like a decade and have two kids who these vows were in front of
they re from florida and it was a harry potter themed wedding nuff said
something tells me this guy eats a lot of strudels and twinkies
and as i perform cunnilingus on you during our honeymoon know that i am thinking of margot robbie
i need a shower gif emote free_emotes_pack dizzy_face
how embarrassing in front of his mother she says he s grounded in the other video and i m like dude ewww
trash
this was hard to watch
this is a very sad man
she s so pretty
might be the trashiest thing i ve ever seen at a wedding absolutely classless and disrespectful the woman is your wife not your slam piece it s ok if she s both with her consent of course but saying it in public in front of your friends and family and hers is just plain trashy
as usual vows they re supposed to be promises you are making to the other person seems most people who write their own just write some worthless rambling mush
she s laughing so it must be ok tell me you know nothing about toxic relationships without telling me you know nothing about toxic relationships yeah she s gonna laugh off a lot of things for the next years ignoring the knot in the pit of her stomach holding back tears smiling like everything is fine
if you have even the tiniest amount of romantic feelings for your spouse the wedding is absolutely the most important time to show it this was total garbage
lady run
so trashy she s only laughing so he isn t humiliated in front of everyone they know and live from kids to grandparents he has to be a narcissist this moment is about him and how he gets off by shocking people with his anti social behavior it has nothing to do with the moment and his wife
this guy is just disgusting
absolute trash
dude made it all about him so he could get the clout what a tool
and this is the dude you wanted to marry she knew what she signed up for i guess but ugh cringe he ruined the wedding
the sex stuff aside him telling her it s her job to keep him fed is misogynistic
if that is the type of humor this couple has then fine but if someone stood up in front of me and said those things about one of my daughters i d be fighting that asshole
he must have asked for the white nationalist that makes craft cocktails haircut from a barber that only knows how to do cop flattops
if this is actually real which i doubt he needs to be kicked in the nuts
disrespectful at best
in a wedding this is definitely fucking trashy talking about it with your spouse intimately is different
i need to hear hers
facepalm and a bouquet of red flags leave now
love the hair
he had to read that masterpiece
to each their own if they know each other well enough to get married then i m assuming since she didn t walk away that she knew this was something he d do couples have quirks and if they love each other for theirs then that s wonderful i wouldn t be caught dead saying these things at my wedding i d end up so fucking single
so this is what a collection of red flags looks like wearing a suit
i feel like this belongs on aita spoiler he s the asshole
yeah that s fuckin gross i wouldn t want my future husband talking about me emptying his balls in front of my family and friends like obviously they know sex is involved we don t need to go into graphic details about it
i dunno if you ve gone to the effort of having a wedding in front of others then be aware of your audience sure some people can be a little precious but it really wasnt necessary and or needed to be the sole focus of the speech we get it you fuck each other that s your thing you share enjoy the rest of your audience doesn t need details someone clearly thought it had gone too far objectively it wasn t funny or clever he just wanted to demonstrate that he could say whatever the hell he wanted and anyone else be damned murica n free speech n y all
divorced in years
i like her hair tho
zero class
what a waste of seconds of my life is probably what she thinks when he s done seriously though this is beyond facepalm worthy it s gross
telling you now that s a piece of s you re marrying
i think she loved it it doesn t have to make sense for everyone it s their wedding and that s probably why she loves him
he must be a tate fan
pretty gross tho
cringy af this guy is such a try hard he must get off on being the edgy guy but who knows maybe she s just as cringy as he is
why are weddings such boring and bland affairs the same platitudes regardless of what wedding you are at
he s a maga trumper just so yall know
gross
wow wtf
grooms family brides family
time funny times little less funny times fucking annoying yeah u can get away with a joke or two like that but damn brutha that could ve ended real bad if u didnt know her that well
on behalf of all men we don t claim him
she seems happy about it so my guess is they are a good match
she didn t stop smiling and that s all that matters it s their day and i m sure everyone there knows who he is and has heard cruder before if he flipped his personality on its head for the speech he is an asshole but that seems unlikey
what the actual fuck
now everyone who attended will just remember how hard they cringed
custom vows can only be effectively judged by the person they are getting married to so baring the bride getting on here we can never truly know if they were good or bad my wife who knows i am a sarcastic asshole would still have been pissed but acted like this woman for appeareances so best of luck to him on this one
break out the natty ice cheers
it sounds like a kenny powers vow i would say facepalm and nah for families that would get a kick out of this
kinda trashy
classy
they will divorce but whatever
tmi this is funny at a shower or something but not in front of aunt martha at a ceremony
embarrassing
stop giving them attention no one cares
she chose him
how tacky uncouth immature
having banter like this between yourselves is one thing but to do it in front of your friends and family is is either a trashy if everyone is in on the joke or b just god damn awful
ewwwww
love seeing this reposted daily
very classi with an i and a little dick hanging off the c that bends around and fucks the l out of the a s s
ew
this has to be a hazing ritual
like a teenager who heard these being said and thought to save them for the perfect time and this was his final chance with him being past his prime and desperately clinging to his glory days in high school where he peaked he probably jerks it to andrew tate tweets wipes his ass with ply so when he accidentally full on fingers his ass it s not gay
tell me she doesn t have any brothers without telling me she doesnt have any brothers
nope i d have walked away
fucking disgusting
there s no freaking way this is real
as a man this sounds fucked up to me
balls empty dude needs a sex ed class
not really it s really informal but it s their day he s being funny which is probably why they re getting married
going through the comments here and i see so much hate on this guy they know nothing about and judge him by their own standards stop being so prude and let them live their moment and he s obviously making most of the crowd laugh for all we know her dad might be laughing with them for her or for the jokes
if you decide to marry an asshole chanches are you are one too
she seemed to like it so cant say its really a facepalm if they both enjoying their special day
this is repulsive
they re treating this day like it s about them which is healthy so much about the wedding industrial complex is focused on ostentatious performative nonsense they look like they re having a great time and that s far more important than other people s expectations
smallest dick energy seriously what a dumb ass
gross not romantic gross i love my fianc i respect him and our families enough not to say some dumbshit like this at our wedding

i m going to assume they re asking for 5k of another country s money converted to us dollars that s the furthest i can go to logic with this one

i can t even figure out what she thinks she s asking
a pound of feather or a pound of lead
why do we bleep out the names of these people i should know at face value how stupid you are just by looking at you
he should not be allowed to procreate
why did she never answer and why hasn t any one of these hundreds of comments given an answer to his question it s all just sarcasm i m so confused about what s not clicking
this has to be someone from a country that doesn t use dollars right
while i was working at a call center i actually had someone once ask me how much time minutes was it was painful

to be fair that how they do it basically they only difference is it s a pane glass and they break the middle one and keep the around it normal
repost
perfectly demonstrates what made in china means
works but it s not uniform
wouldn t that also be pane glass since it didn t fall apart
i don t know anything about glass so i really don t know i just remember seeing a video explaining how they made it also the glass seems to break different times so maybe it s double pane glass
it would hold it place for a while so to friction but it will eventually break
there are different types of glass plate glass used to make simple things like containers out milk jugs will shatter into pieces but adding different chemicals and elements can make heat resistant glass for food use and safety glass for windows so they break in larger less sharp pieces
no if it is or pane glass they break only very first layer keeping the two other untouched and perfevtly functional

i like the blaaah when he got his jaw rocked lol
i am not saying that it was okay to react with violence to this sort of behavior but
violence is the question the answer is yes
never mess with a guy wearing such attire he has nothing to loose
violence isn t the answer is being used more and more as an excuse for people to be as shitty as possible and they try to cry victim when they get exactly what they deserved it would ve been nice if overalls hadn t resorted to violence but let s not pretend that the prankster didn t absolutely deserve a punch in the face
the facepalm is for the pranker more of this please make those idiots leave people alone
the pranker knew what he was doing
op was the one who got rocked that s why he s so against it
stalker approaches random girl on the street and tells her he s been staring at her and he loves her the guy who actually loved her happened to be standing nearby abruptchaos insues
i m on team overalls on this one this prank shit has gone far enough now people must choose violence
i mean if you don t want that smoke don t start a fire
that kid needed a good punch
dennis the menace knows what s up
only facepalm here is the is the kid trying that the noise he made when hit was funny
lol op was commenting on a diff sub where this was posted and got downvoted to oblivion only to repost it here and get the same result
op has never had a girlfriend confirmed
the fact that op is the kid that got his chin checked and posted this has me floored you re lucky he actually put his drink down and telegraphed that punch ida dumped you on your head were i him or you my age fact is your ignoring his presence was the disrespectful part youre not understanding
let someone come up to my wife like this while we re out please
you know just cause you have free speech doesn t mean there aren t free consequences either not saying violence was the best option but i also can t say i would ve rocked his shit either
he aint right but he aint wrong either
good lad disrespect should not be tolerated
never work again with this one simple trick
this is the way to return to a more polite society
well he was looking for a reaction and he got one
play stupid games win stupid prizes
violence is sometimes the answer
hope he broke his jaw
ness from ssb
people saying this is a prank but are we sure this isn t just a genuine confession
if this is what needs to happen to discourage idiotic tik tok youtube prankers then i fully support it
glad to see darwin s theory of natural selection taking place yet another day
don t have sympathy for consequences that come from blatant disrespect
deserved
most people would posture and talk i m gonna kick your ass but they never do dennis on the other hand all action no talk
lol when a man in overalls puts his drink down it s time to shut the fuck up
i hope you learned your lesson op lol
i m a peanut that enjoys pointing out when assholes are being assholes fedora wearing behavior
get this dumb ass troll shit out of here op is a troll and loving it
never mess with billy
whether or not you agree with the punch i think we can all agree that was the first time she s ever been attracted to waldo here
justice
ok i ll be the lame here and state the obvious that this is assault that guy who walked up no matter how big a douche he was did nothing threatening at all hell his hands were on his head so you can t say he was reaching for something etc i do agree with the sentiment though that this prank shit for clout needs to stop yesterday granted the guy that got hit is probably embarrassed to the point to never want to press charges because he never wants to relive this moment again his peers would also eviscerate him likening him to that of a punk ass bitch if he most likely his parents were to sue the assailant
it is the answer to these fucks so satisfying
fuck both them kids
random guy says something you don t like to your girl and you attack him must be the small syndrome normal humans don t walk up to people and say stupid shit like that but also normal people don t punch people who just randomly walk up and say the dumbest shit rejects on both ends jesus
nice left
nice jab
and that s why you don t fuck with a guy in overalls
acceptable violence
hahaha dennis the menace attempting to steal princess from luigi
it was only a prank jeez
to get beat up by somebody wearing suspenders haha
i love how the girl knew what was gonna happen and stepped back
dennis the menace hahahaha
she already knew what was about to go down that s why she turned away and looked at the ground where he would soon lay
gotta watch out for them south paws
it s a bad week for pranksters kinda feels like people are tired of their antics and just aren t going to take it any more
lesson learned
glad he took a sip first stay hydrated ladies and gents hope his knuckles are ok
valid
violence was the only applicable answer in this situation fuck i hate people that do this
sometimes violence is the only answer if it curbs the entitlement of these dickless wonders who record themselves trolling random people in public
girl knew exactly what was coming too
that s the dude from the warriors with the rollerblade gang
i would rather be a monster in your eyes than be disrespected in mine some gangster dude i saw on a youtube short once
i don t understand what he says
wanna know what s funny saw this posted on another sub where the title described the other guy in a negative way most comments were shitting on dennis the menace see it posted this way most comments are shitting on the pranker damn us redditors really do just wanna be arguing
do stupid things win stupid prizes definition reenacted in real time
idk what he thought was gonna happen once dude put his drink down shoulda had his hands up by that point
can we all just agree that anyone filming and posting every single stupid ass event in their life may need a jaw adjustment him getting popped was probably the most interesting thing to happen to him
i think he was just ordering off the menu sounded like he said oh my godzahz the moment i saw you i wanted a two piece and a biscuit with extra gravy on the side piece
violence isn t an answer it s a question and the answer is yes
some behaviour results in violence that may not be the best but i can t say i don t understand why it happened when an unstoppable idiot meets an immovable idiot the fastest fist wins
if you get your shit rocked by a dude in overalls
don t get yourself killed over a woman these hoes ain t loyal
it s the overalls for me it s where the power comes from
i think the facepalm here is the prankster harassing the couple
poetry maker meets the hay maker
call me dennis the menace then cuz i would ve done the same tbh
i m with you op this is a gross overreaction a warning would be the way to go before fists are thrown on the other hand we don t know if the prankster harrassed this chick for a longer time and dennis just flew off still if he s overage he s facing jail time now as he should be
was going to say the same thing sounds like my cat right when it projectile vomits onto my crocs
my buddy and me
messed the joke up but you have spirit ill give you that
overalls looked pretty loose to me
but i ll bet he can at least spell lose
he wasn t messing with that guy he was talking to the girl make no mistake the overall wearing knuckle dragger wasn t defending her honor either he was establishing his owenership of her
facts people just want to live a consequence free life
thank you
of course he did he also has a legal right to do it not once did he make a threatening remark or move captain caveman showed his intelligence by making the prank postable
yup you got me
yeah but he probably has a criminal record now his job and college prospects are gone if so just bc he couldn t control his temper
that blaaa when his jaw became mashed potatoes was perfect fucked around and found out
when dude is dressed like chucky all bets are off
that was his jaw becoming mashed potatoes in real time
dollars to donuts op is the kind of dude who thinks catcalling is a compliment
no shit how else do you find dumb shit like this and who cares about being downvoted my opinion is my opinion
they do seem like a lot of work
i m sorry do you actually think that s me ahahahahahahaha oh shit i m laughing so hard i m crying
agreed my wife would have blown the jaw out long before i had the chance
so majestic
why would you do this on rocks
ah this rocky beach is the perfect place to plant my face
more facefloor than facepalm
his hands were busy so the rock had to palm it for him
surprisingly satisfying on so many levels
mmm sandy pebbles

well could have been worse could have gotten plugged like that asshole in virginia
that s not even what we re after then why were you recording it honestly even if it s an overreaction i have no sympathy for youtube pranksters
kids these days can t just sit their asses down and leave people the f ck alone
why did they stay dumbasses
looks like something a year old would do he just looks pathetic
youtube and tiktok need to ban prank videos
what a waste of the police time plus the dude ended up getting more views after it was all said and done
chasing views on the internet will get you in trouble the best lesson they got
the title doesn t make any sense tapping someone on a shoulder and hiding is probably years old
it s not a prank it s just victimising people whilst acting like some childrens television presenter not even funny in the slightest who is entertained by these pricks
youtube pranksters are worse than scum hope he gets sued and loses everything
yea these youtube pranksters are annoying little bastards and i don t fuck with them or what they do but is that old man for real he wants to sue them for tapping his shoulder and hiding that s laughable the only reason i can see y all agreeing with that is for no reason other than you personally dislike these pranksters not because they actually deserve to get sued if i was that old man i d just want to get those dudes out of there i would not be so petty as to threaten to sue them what a joke
these aren t kids i d understand if they were but adults
turns out adults acting like children doesn t work and it s not funny
not defending the prankster but the old guy has no case in court where are the damages just move on with your life
whoa that was super uncalled for i hope that poor old man is ok adding him to my prayer list
not everyone wants to be an extra in your god damned movie
jesus christ personal injury i think the only thing i hate more than lame ass pranks is frivolous lawsuits
old man is just going to bury himself in legal fees if he actually tries to sue
wait so we can t bully people but we can troll random strangers isn t that bullying unwanted harassment
fuckin privileged losers
they all suck but i will point out one thing the old man shook his hand and then called the cops that s just dishonorable like breaking a pinky promise
boy a shoulder tap prank will get yo ass shot stop being stupid kids
unpopular opinion the old guy is over reacting i was with him at first till he said injury the guy touched you on that shoulder what was so hard to say ah you got me and move on but on the other hand i suppose his issue is maybe being filmed as it is edited from prankster point of view
i m annoyed by the comments feeling bad for the prankster and saying the older man is overreacting answer me this then how do you stop this from happening the answer is consequences and holding people accountable i want more people do what this guy did and call the cops this is what hopefully will stop these assholes from screwing with people in public i say hopefully because prankster was shot and still said he s going to keep messing with people
sue them weird
i thought that after he said i want you to file a report he would go nah im trolling
fuckin leech
that guy looks very injured after that tap on the back
these comments are unhinged what are yall talking about if you got tapped on the shoulder you would sue the person who tapped you and youd expect to win go outside holy shit
oh no he tapped the mans shoulder he should be sent to a gulag to work his entire miserable life and once he s too old to work he should be fed to stray dogs am i right
wow there a lot of seriously misinformed people even here in reddit my comments are getting downvoted because people don t like the truth there s no such thing as a right to not be filmed when out in public the dudes are idiots but just because you don t like something doesn t make it illegal and just because some old dude says he is going to sue doesn t mean he actually will or that it would go anywhere even if he did
fuck this kid and his gym shorts
i didn t guess my victim wouldn t like what we were doing to him my bad
people like these youtubers make me hate people
this looks like a grown man how pathetic
i mean is the youtube even wrong this time the prank was as light hearted as it could get come fucking on he was chill as fuck said sorry and moved on the dude got triggered for nothing and then wanted to sue him based on lies when everything was recorded this time he s the asshole come on
old retired men have nothing but time on their hands this is going to give him something to do messing with this kid is going to become his new hobby lol
well he find out every single one of these types of kids need to come across that one person that is just going to beat the shit out of them
theres so many ways to make people laugh on the internet no need to risk going into the public eye pulling pranks on strangers to make video content for it
stop calling it pranking it s bullying you re forcing someone else to entertain you
if i were the old man i d tell him i m just trolling you while sitting in court
this pranker is definately not a teen but still find such stupid jokes laughable af what the hell is wrong with people
good on him fuck these pranksters
the old man shook hands with him then said he was going to sue him when security police whatever showed up no honourable person would shake hands with someone then sue them that means they think nothing of a handshake
lol i hope that idiot kid guts fucked in court don t mess with people who don t wanna get fucked with welcome to the big ole dick of the law suck it nerd
i love it we should take these entitled a holes to court every time maybe that will push them to stop the shit they pull on innocent people for views
honestly i wish every single prank channel gets sued stupidest content on the internet
don t fuck with the elderly
let s be real how that old guy started going off saying he was gonna sue him is a major facepalm
these yt pranksters should really rethink what they re doing walking up to random people in public and doing this is a stupid thing to do especially where i live because you d either get your ass beaten or if you re really unlucky you d get shot
one tap is not harassment and personal injury this was a dumb but all be it harmless joke old dude can get fucked with that reaction the fact that this could result in a lawsuit at all without getting laughed out of the court is insane to me honestly only in murica
if you re the cop you tell the kids to get the hell out of there and tell the old guy to chill out and stop wasting his time the kid may have been a nitwit but he shouldn t get arrested but that s the kind of dude who would shoot you for that so at least the kid gets to live
this is what happens when pranksters who actually have morale pranks they pull of some small shit and have to take the punishment for all the previous pranksters out there how can a shouldertap start anything more than a conversation
it wasn t even like that man it was exactly fucking like that idiot
serves him right stop harassing others for your shitty videos they literally only appeal to year olds or those stuck at that age mentally edit if the guy actually sues this video online forever would work perfectly as evidence smh
it was stupid but a tad excessive to get the police involved
bring back the draft
shoot him in his toodles
douchebag
leave people alone
wish that old man broke his jaw fucking grown ass men playing year old pranks for views on the internet absolute clowns i dint care if uts a prank if a grown ass cringe man did that to me i will assault and you won t do it again grow the fuck up
fucking excuses we were just trying to get a laugh yeah with your buddy recording it hope these stupid kids start learning mess with people and you are going to face consequences sometimes harsh ones
it might be funny if your ten grown the f up
old man vs young boy
this is the way i would sue them as well
dudes a grown ass man acting like a teenager
such a clever and elaborate prank
his sweatshirt says it all
keep holding these idiots accountable and maybe they will go away
atleast they didnt choo his legs of and give him a wheelchair
fuck influencers and their stupid life choices the old guy has a reasonable expectation of not being harassed by a fucking manbaby
just shoot the boy on the face problem solve
that prankster looks way too old to be doing such immature childish bullshit mans over here looking like he s pushing sneaking around tapping people on the shoulder what a fucking loser
this is all staged
core requirement of prank is it must be fun for prankster participants and observers you can t call all these bullshits pranks where someone is getting pissed angry or sad i understand these youtubers don t care about anything so long they get the views and male money off of it but this trends needs to change for better
i miss just for laugh gags rn
it makes sense why that guy is sitting alone at a dunkin donuts late at night
as much as i think the old lad overreacted these feelings are outweighed by my distaste toward these content creators who so often just can t leave people alone to get in with their days
he s right on the money with that hoody
some people just have the kind of face you want punch
i hate these people
what next knock and run
the cop with the wisdom stop chasing views
some of these pranks go way over board that s true really going around poking someone may get more then they wanted
camera guy wait people can see me
ridiculous that the other guy wants to sue him
i really hate to believe what xi said about something happening that has not happened in a hundred years but these things scare me the standards keep getting low every day edit spelling correction
it was just a prank bro
guy wants to sue the pants off of the kid but i don t think his shorts can get any shorter
how do you go from getting tapped on the shoulder to suing someone like ok prank youtubers are annoying but that must be the mildest most calm and unhurtful prank ive seen in a long time old guy must ve had a shitty day if that was all it took to make him sue
he s got a back support brace on leave that poor guy alone and don t make him twist and move unnecessarily
at least this could actually be considered a prank most youtubers be committing crimes talking bout its just a prank bro
i don t understand why these people think they have the right to film others let alone do pranks etc on random people
dude that guy is like the only appropriate pranks is taking all your buddies to a restaurant and when it s time to pay the bill suprise i paid them all bitches
whats always bothered me about these videos is that the people doing the prank are at least years old
or he could have just left and avoided everything
i get y all have a hate boner for pranksters on youtube but this is the most harmless shit ever wtf do u mean crazier and crazier pranks it s a fucking tap on the shoulder and then hiding y all are ridiculous
great guy hyuck yuck tell the judge

restricting movement of freedom within your own country lol thats a taliban move if i ever saw one
from the party of freedom and small government
no chance that s going to stand unchallenged and the supreme court yes even this one will strike it down
there is zero chance that this bill is constitutional
isisdaho
afghanistan actually allows abortion in cases where the mother s life is in danger or the fetus is unviable will have severe disabilities that would greatly impact it s quality of life making it slightly better than idaho s abortion laws
how would they even know they can t subpoena medical records maybe only in state and if they could i highly doubt a medical institution would provide them with those especially one from out of state
idaho is going to have a lot of out of staters moving through is this their tourism program that made this decision
looks like poland
republican taliban
a couple of thoughts the law only applies to minors transported without parents consent anyone saying idaho is no different than afghanistan is showing their contempt for people living under taliban tyranny
idaho sucks it has no business bordering washington state
idaho teens in need of abortion i live right across the border and i will absolutely help you no questions asked
how about realizing the fact that your country is just shit independently without the need of comparing it to afghanistan a country you helped turn to shit fucking elitist wanker
constitutionally protected under the 5th amendment
god i love this state
idaho hospital to stop delivering babies as doctors flee over abortion ban near total ban on abortions is driving doctors away hospital says leading to lack of nearby labor and delivery care for thousands
it probably will not go to the supreme court just my opinion the bill targets minors being transported across state lines for an abortion however it is legal to do so with parent guardian consent this part seems to be left out frequently parents and guardian s pretty much have control over their kids as it in most states and this bill defines the outcome for people that are transporting minors across state lines to have an abortion without their parental guardian consent
yallqaedaho
not all republicans agree with such extreme laws so no republican does not equal taliban but idaho is more than simply republican edit looks like some people don t like hearing that not all republicans are maga like assholes
well there goes the neighborhood
but all republicans support more government control and less freedom for americans
lol wut democrats are the ones who are pro big government lol
so you don t know anything

lmao coors light is literally the main sponsor of denver pride this year https://denverpride.org/parade/) thanks for showing your support
wait till this jerk finds out coors was way ahead of bud on this movement course his access to current events is probably limited to faux hope he was the one to pay for that product
throwing away beer you already paid for that ll show em
dumbass replaces one beer with another that supports lgbtq https://lgbtqcolorado.org/coors-light-commitment-lgbtq-community/). when he said you might want to google it i knew for a fact he was still wrong
the truck says it all what a man baby
that fucking smirk he has thinking he s doing anything he already paid the money for that haha don t even get me started on that fucking truck
i guess drinking a lot of bud light makes you walk like you have a dump in your wrangler s
who is this asshole and if he is rich enough to have two huge garages full of expensive vehicles and an rv motor home why can t he afford better beer in general
guess he doesn t realize that vans and cocacola are also lgbtq friendly
he looks like a child next to his giant pickup truck and i m certain he has never loaded its bed or driven it off city streets
notice he didn t open ruin them i bet he made the video and put them all back
d3mocrats are sn0wflakes
gif giphy t7j5439wv9iq4
i hope nobody tells him that the vegas golden knights his hat supports gay rights and had a pride night earlier this year with rainbow jerseys or that coca cola also in his fridge was one of the first global brands to support the community it seems like he s having a difficult enough time already living in this big gay world
sure don t buy anymore if that s how you feel but the only person you re hurting by throwing out beer you ve already bought is you what a dumbass
well i feel owned can we start a thing about gun manufacturers being woke now too so they toss those in the trash
people like this truely are the pure personification of insecurity itself
note to dude there are lgbtqia people that make your food made your truck live near you and are related to you
i bet this guy doesn t wipe his own ass because it s gay
california just went through a drought and this guy is just throwing all that water away wasteful dick
the truck really explains the person we re dealing with here
what a small small man
exact truck an asshole would drive stupid tires sticking out with no fender flares throwing gravel at traffic like all the covid particles he shares at parties i imagine
conservatives are so fucking embarrassing dude
that s just gay
coors is a huge advocate for the lgbt community also that ford truck they re a huge supporter of the lgbt community
i ve never understood why all these big macho men think it s manly to drink light beer like of all the drinks you could choose you choose what might as well be shit tasting soft drink
imagine complaining about privilege as you flex your privilege
all his profile pictures on fb are the same selfie with glasses
wait till he see s coors light s pride campaign
why am i not surprised that he has a lifted behemoth
you know people are not comfortable with their own sexuality when they get triggered over how other people want to be seen
small dick energy written all over his vehicles
am i stupid or is coors and bud both owned by molson seems incredibly dumb to switch to the same company
awwwww he was drinking gay beer
it takes a very small man to be this triggered over rainbows and pronouns and a very small brain to not realize budweiser already has his money
of course that s the type of truck he drives
somebody tell him that ford supports them too so that he can drive his truck off a cliff without him in it of course
such snowflakes
alternate title man pours out colored water at least he didn t pour out good beer
no one gonna talk about the fact that he had more beer on hand than a frat house party dude needs aa not a garbage can
they act like that is some kind of flex aren t they the ones crying about cancel culture and calling everybody snowflakes
philosophy not withstanding the trash is probably the best place for bud light
and that truck lmao i m betting he has a tiny peepee
this guy has abusive dad energy
i have decided never to drink bud light too but that decision came years ago when i tasted it and realized it tastes like piss instead of beer
you might want to google it fails to find coors has been sponsoring gay pride for years what a fucking bow legged knuckle dragging mouth breathing dolt
this guy might have a drinking problem
as an austrian i can t drink bud light because it tastes like diluted beer juice with too much water in it sry america but since all that douchebags throw them into the bin or shoot them i m thinking of getting myself a couple of cans
everyone doing this looks exactly the same practically
a reminder that these dumbasses vote
i always find it hilarious what closeted gay men do to hide their homosexuality i m sure his wife knows
he might want to do a quick google search on those ford trucks coke cans in the fridge and jeep
you should send this link to this guy i want to see him do this again time to quit drinking buddy
coors also owns miller for anyone curious all three of the main american brewers are participating
ford is also a lgbtq supporter their new slogan is fordproud so better ditch the road queen trucks too
r accidentalally
well this guy doesn t have a problem with coke because they ve never been lgbt inclusive https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/coca-cola-fosters-inclusive-lgbtq-community). s
he s wearing a vegas golden knights hat they had their pride night on jan https://www.nhl.com/goldenknights/news/vegas-golden-knights-announce-plans-for-pride-knight-on-january-6/c-329473222)
on top of that he already paid for those cans sooooo
oh no i am a married straight male and drink coors will this now make me gay
this was posted last night to another subreddit and at the end they included coors lgbtq stance in a montage lmfaoo i think it was r therewasanattempt edit https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/12c3tej/to_go_against_the_woke_mind_virus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1
iirc coors was losing money and market share in california due to anti lgbt hiring practices and shifted way left on the matter
looks like money doesn t matter to him
and replaces it with a beer that has sponsored the denver pride parade for decades
didn t these people just spend years yelling about cancel culture
it s bud light it s not like it s real beer
logical thinking was nowhere to be found as they were making this video
maybe i ll just punch myself in the nuts see how they like that
he definitely owned the libs with this move
while giving publicity to the company companies aren t dumb they know very well that right wing snowflake are easy to trigger and won t shut up its just free advertising for them in short he accomplished less than nothing by doing the opposite of what he wanted to do
i feel like i should author a book intended to incense republicans to want to burn it then set up a booth to sell them copies just to burn i could sell enough to set up my own satanic groomer boarding house to convert white kids into being lgbtq s
saw a great duet of this pointing out that his new coors beer along with his ford truck adidas hat and the shoe brand all have pro lgbtq branding as well
and his beer is right next to coca cola in his rockstar energy fridge that he walked by his ford truck in his vans to get to this dude shows his support for tolerance and diversity more than anyone i know wait til he finds out
makes a dumbass video to show how he is so courageous and willing to stand up for what s right what are you standing up for uh well if you don t already know you should you can go to dubya dubya dubya google dot com and search indirectly for news associated with a decades old mass marketed beer maybe you ll find what i may or may not be angry about i can t say but you should google it gif giphy 3xz2blbot13x9agjea
same with coca cola https://www.coca-colacompany.com/social-impact/diversity-and-inclusion/racial-equity/external-action/taking-a-stand) his top shelf second fridge xd lol
lol love it
i can t wait for his follow up video when he replaces his coors with a different beer company that also supports lgbtq rights
ahahahaaaaaaa that s pure gold
also he seems like one of those i don t trust big tech guys why would he be mentioning google or using them as an information source
who s going to tell him about google
before he left the garage if you asked me to guess at what he drives ding ding ding
dang snowflakes and their cancel culture
the fact that he has a camera following his tantrum shows he is a man baby
yeah did you see the way he waddles
i agree about the truck
how will the ever survive him not buying their brand anymore idiot for each person that gave it up for their homaphobic issues the support has probably grown fold

pavement princess
it seems like this guy s entire life and identity is built upon the basic stereotypical image of trying to be the super badass dudebro manly man so i can at least understand why he s feeling threatened as he realizes the rest of the world is progressing away from finding that cool or an attractive attribute and now he s seeing his whole gimmick for going through life becoming irrelevant
he put his property and truck in the video as a flex but it made him look like an even bigger idiot
or his whole garage i mean it s all ridiculous

why is this guy calling himself an alpha male when he looks like a bag of mayonnaise
remember that time the republican senate subpoenaed clinton and she actually showed up and answered questions for hours and they couldn t get anything out of it not even a sound byte to play during the election imagine how long trump is going to last if they re dumb enough to put him on the stand during his trials
what about the war crimes of bush and cheney
trump had years to lock her up i wonder why he didn t even try
yo if someone comits a crime they should do the time regardless of political party wealth if obama committed massive fraud on trumps level i d say lock him up too
i m not a lawyer but i m going to guess because she has not been convicted of any crimes
hillary clinton s guilt or innocence has nothing to do with trump s guilt or innocence that is a what aboutism and is not a necessary part of the conversation as it pertains to trump
the troll account again
because the best and brightest minds in the republican party where never able to get anything to stick to her that would hold up in a court of law apparently we all know they tried they just really sucked at it just like they suck at everything else they do
because nick touches himself at night
i don t know why this is how a joke starts right
this guy is such a partisan hack total lying ahole
this is a poe don t be fooled
they ll want to put mr rogers in jail next but he s dead i dont care lock him up
if he had asked about bill clinton then i would have been forced to agree that he has a point but hillary for what its so weird the fascination with her for something insanely simple i bet he couldn t put together a single sentence describing what hillary did that was illegal
it s actually a very valid question imprisoning hillary clinton was one of trump s election promises and he had years to act upon it we can only reason that the reason she is still a free woman is that either she is innocent of any crimes or that trump is incompetent
even to this day i m not even sure if this is even a real person or kevin james trying out method acting because some of the shit is so ridiculous
r rareinsults
over under of ten minutes
and don t get me started on eisenhower that son of a bitch
i swear i thought those pipes were weapons of mass destruction gw bush as god is my witness i thought turkeys could fly arthur big guy carlson
he s finally figured out how to get hillary put in prison he s going to hire her as his attorney
i ve seen people post videos of this assclown he s australian and he s a middle aged fat fucking asshole i m tired of knowing of his existence
oooh eisenhower my workers they re demanding minimum wage and livable conditions

fucking gross look i m all for expressing yourself but nobody let alone children should have to look at kid rock
i m gonna need some context here did kid rock do something stupid again recently
bro really wrapping his lips around his bud
kid rock gives free bjs
which ones the drag queen
samples of piss and a drag queen
he s gonna say it s ai generated
apparently this is at his house at a party he threw in
thats just dennis rodman
no talent loser couldn t write a song to save his life
kid rock still looks like a crackhead junkie that s been dead for months
out of things in this picture disgust me and it s not the colorful person with the microphone
nothing like being a white trash hateful hypocrite
of coarse this red neck drinks the cheap shit
he s a washed up has been
he s the king of suck rock
see this is what i didn t understand about his recent display i always thought kid rock was an ally to the lgbtq sorry if i missed a letter community so is it because of the inclusive thing or because bud light is just a shit beer to begin with
i love americans lol
hope this is real for real lol
what a dumbshit
we all knew he was full of shit no need to prove it
now just add a sprinkle of harry potter and of americans can cry themselves to sleep
living his life in a slow hell poor fella
how many times can you post the same shit
who gives a fuck
its face isn t on the beer bottle his side eye is making fun of it
well to be fair for today s standards this would have to have multiple kids in the room watching as well
why does the drag queen look like she has no midsection
yeah but that doesn t appeal to his fan base anymore he s just adapting so stop judging s
he s another whore whatever his dumbass supporters are riled up about he ll get itn board with it in order to get more attention
ouch lol
i m guessing he s made that face before on things other than bottles hence the hysteria
i love this for him
wtf are the odds lol he needs to be confronted with thus
he sure like that bud light bottle
sums up his stupidity in one picture
so he s an ally actually to the trans community nice
look at his mouth who drinks a beer like that someone who s thinking about something else looks like he s making eye contact with someone and making a gesture with his mouth and the bottle see it
kid gold rock fish
quick show this to the bud light guy switching to coors cauze budlight endorses equality
he s very comfortable with that bottle lol
the man kid is wrapping his lips around that bottle a little too eagerly
them lips were made for suckin
sometimes a coors light is just a coors light
i bet he had some sexual adventures that he s ashamed about
let s not overlook the knitwear jumpsuit
and him giving that beer the gluk gluk
they re all sellouts bro
that s definitely the post ball face geeked
throw out all my kid rock shit how could he there is now way the kid is not queer
maga are hypocrites never s
not gonna lie you had me in the first half
i agree let s ban kid rock for the children s sake
this was hilarious
he shot up some bud cans to show how patriotic he was as any sane person does of course s should go without saying
he got upset that pisswater sponsored a trans persons and gave them a custom beer can so he decided take out his gun aka baby dick and shoot some beer cans in retaliation
short version budweiser partnered with a trans woman kid rock got mad about it
when does he not do something stupid
he calls that move suckling the crown
lookin like he about to deep throat that shit
either practicing for later or still in the zone from before
shows that queen how its really done
the one that isn t on an ounce of cocaine
he could try to even more raucous laughter that picture s fidelity is not even enough or high enough quality for it not to look laughable if attempted
pretty sure that s mike tyson in drag
it s because he s jumped on the alt right bandwagon i ve seen the sane thing happen to other previously reasonable people after too much fox and facebook
my really anti woke uncle likes kid rock i feel like he went towards the farther right when he went deeper into country music
as a gay man let me assure you we never have nor never will want kid rock to be anywhere near us
if there is a pic out there i guys will find it kudos now get the lindsey graham ones cause u know they r juicy
at least twice
the funny part is is that budweiser still got their money from his purchase lol
just wait until he finds out who tootsie and mrs doubtfire really are
well said
sounds more like the kid part was upset mommy or daddy bud light didn t give him a can but instead a trans person got one
so which one
oh come on it wasn t because of fox and facebook his customer base changed he is just pandering to them to sell concert tickets he knows where his bread is buttered with the racists and bigots they fund is lifestyle
ladybugs
maybe but the 4th is downvote hell
i heard that so now let s see miss ladybugs put this to rest cause let s face it miss lindsey is not your friend

i would never look at naughty things on my work computer but you always check every window every tab everything before you hit that share button
thats not even a tab its a bookmark
i work at the front desk of a hotel and sometimes people have trouble connecting to the wifi they really should check their open tabs before handing me their phone or tablet to help them connect
this reminds me of one of the most amusing incidents from my time at university a well liked professor arrived to his 9am psychology class at about he plugged his laptop into the projector then walked out of the lecture hall to grab a coffee by the time he returned a porn video had been playing for a few mins this was a lecture hall of about first year students
always keep a separate computer that is for work only
nothing to see here people i found the video and the entire title is busty college girl fulfills homework obligations
i even open an incognito window on my own damn phone
i m not sure what happened with this professor but having the word that started with fu not be finished might very well have saved his job
university of miami professor yeah that checks out
my dude is a college professor with college porn on his screen i m dead
now you know what the requirements for an a are
you think if porn actually taught us somebody other than unrealistic expectations maybe geography or something we could bump up the global iq
i m disturbed by the fact he s a university professor looking at college girl stuff
this gives me the creeps the professor is choosing to watch porn about college girls the demographic he is actively instructing
how does everyone feel that he might be a college professor and he s searching this up while teaching a group of college girls and boys
vpn companies be like
always have computers one for personal use and one for class
brb gonna find the video
thats to show the failures what they can do for a higher grade
in our college head of an engineering dept forwarded a whole ss college porno into students whatsapp group and acted as he got hacked
my programming teacher had a bookmark of a hardcore gore site safe to say i dropped out of the class
imagine bookmarking porn on the bookmark bar also not using private mode
ah miami
pretty sure someone in company i work for got fired for something similar to this teams meeting and background wasn t blurred out and other monitor was chock full of porn allegedly
common miami florida university l
reminds me of my elementary school music teacher who taught us to grab twist and pull if we are about to get raped same guy got fired for having child porn on his work computer
but why do people do stupid shit on their work computer
that s why you use different browsers folks
that s a goofy thing to miss it s almost like he s fishing
of course it s miami u
i had a prof in uni that full on had porn on his screen when he pulled up his laptop it was and still is a meme amongst students some news stations even wrote articles about it it felt like a monet from a sitcom or some shit he s a professor at university of toronto scarborough campus for anyone who wants to look it up
won t be the first time
similar thing happened when a friend and i went to office hours prof pulled up his computer and there were some interesting pop ups
these are the kind of faceplams i want just stupidly hilarious accidents that make me chuckle
a similar thing happened at the company i work at when i was on boarded the hr rep had their screen shared for a presentation there was target advertising on the side of the screen for a sale on dildos nothing like starting a new job and seeing dildos on day one everyone pretended they didn t see it and did their best to stay professional
yep that s definitely something you want to see from a college professor s
lads use a different browser for your quality content
my tabs are gmail youtube google translator wordreference a website with an interview of james gunn explaining why he chose do you wanna taste it by wigwam on peacemaker a website for scholarships two websites to download tv shows a facebook video of when a ladder won a wrestling championship in japan seriously and a website to download e books
i mean to be fair most collage girl porns feature women in their s
can t even blame the professor
deleted
good save
i just like the way they present the topic i feel like it resonates with me and i can completely unbeaten the subject matter
he s find the right field the kink is real
rookie mistake to not put it in an inconspicuous folder
i had a professor show a video on youtube with a whole suggestions full of drag content
that s a really specific search i usually just type naked people
wow i have the exact same bookmark
you knew it was going to be university of miami
here you go russian tv presenter live streaming a speech notices a girls cleavage in the audience zooms in and makes a copy of her image while broadcasting everything he s doing i m not sure if he was unaware his screen was being live streamed or he just didn t care https://www.reddit.com/r/russiancircus/comments/123u0yg/wha_what_are_you_doing_steppropagandist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
its all about tha u
this guys browser deserves the miami u turnover chain
one of my neighbors daughters married her professor age gap
the first few times i took a screen shot on my mac there was always one tab saying how screen shot mac i know to check now
its not an open tab it s a shortcut on the bookmarks bar
ctrl shift n if you plan to as well
at work trust me there is a trail every where also now days with remote users the applications they put on work computers they know and can just use it when they want to get rid of you
it s how are people not using dedicated porn browsers if microsoft edge isn t open i m good
im here doing work in my office where i tape the webcam and disable both mic and cam hardware as a precaution as if im doing something horribly illegal
it must be his favorite video
it s also incomplete could say busty college girl fulfills her dreams of graduating with honors jeez jumping to conclusions s
they re just thinking he s a hotel clerk he s seen way worse
i would disinfect my hands after touching someone s phone you know why
i work on peoples computer in their home i lost track of how many time i ve run across bookmarks open tabs handwritten pages of urls dvds both out on a stand desk and inside players and so on people masterbate porn makes it more enjoyable as long as there s no abuse or anything it s all cool
did he die from embarrassment upon entering the classroom my heart would give out
was it already playing or did someone run up and click the video on as a prank while he was gone
it was a pysch class he was giving tangible examples of freudian slips
what did he say what was he into so many questions
im replying just to sub to this thread while waiting you answers
oh god what happened next
back in college i had a virtual machine image specifically set up for when i needed to share my screen for class presentations no chances taken at all
even two different accounts on the same computer will do the trick
yep i work remotely most of the time and if i want to go on any non work related site i have my personal laptop to hand
a few years back on canadian television they had a news program presented by women who would strip while talking
gotta learn about them deeply before teaching them lmao
my dads owns an accounting firm and his email was hacked and they sent porn to a bunch of clients not sure why or who did it but i can not see my dad sending that shit to his clients and losing clients for a laugh

yikes teaching elementary school kids and the first thing your mind jumps to is them getting raped holy shit at least he gave advice on avoiding rape but that s barely even a silver lining
during our early pandemic semesters lots of my professors were doing lectures from their personal computers at home we had a couple oopsies like this one professor had a xhamster bookmark another left a pornhubgay tab open have a little chuckle and move on we re all adults
stupid people do stupid shit it s the nature of their condition
so why did he choose wigwam
slightly tilts camera up
oh shit you re right jesus
who are you who is so wise in the ways of science
bookmark sharing between devices and account sharing is literally the devil change my mind
when you accidentally hit control d while
first thing i noticed
it was probably one of his old students
right at the front too
i had to read up a bit on the key combo and it turns out that it s the key combo to open an incognito window in chrome
we all got one
to his credit he kept his composure he just closed the video and said well that was awkward let s get on with the lecture i don t think he got in any real trouble because he was an excellent professor well liked department head sometimes played guitar in class
it was already playing
well a couple articles were written about the incident this one even has a video https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6220165/amp/psychology-professor-accidentally-plays-porn-packed-lecture-hall.html)
i remember during the rittenhouse case the lawyers on the side panel giving the same advise as you don t want internet history popping up and causing bias in the jurors
dude a vm just for that the hell did you even have on your computer that was so important stolen government secrets
even easier different browsers
he s also a professor watching college girl porn and now all of his female college students are aware of that probably a bit uncomfy
someone with questionable bookmarks of their own i presume

holy shit
how much was the black guy paid to do this
lmfao what the hell
i love when people get shook by finding out that asians are incredibly racist it s adorably naive
hair still black not buying this product
that s what happened to micheal jackson thanks i ll show myself out
well they call it white washing for a reason
must of really needed the gig can t blame him
she gave him rights
holy shit they built a machine to turn black people asian
bro got micheal jacksoned

holy chit
if they should that in mexico a lot of mexicans would buy it we are racist with our own people
bro i burst out laughing at just how absurd that was no waaaaayyy
so other countries are more racist than america
i don t even know what to say except damn this is just not right
gif giphy 4rspakkvbua5q
she will be surprised to know that cold water causes shrinkage
i ve found that in general most asian countries are racist especially against blacks but also against other asians sometimes for good reason like the korean japanese racism certainly not all people in those countries are racist and is becoming less prevalent among younger people but there s a general racist sense in their cultures
holy fuck last time i saw something this racist it was a pears soap ad from the 19th century
or was this just a product of already bad relations
gotta say this is kinda funny though racist yes but also kinda funny
i did a spit take at that
wtf man
it s based off an italian ad where a skinny italian guy gets thrown in a washer and out comes a muscular black guy https://youtu.be/0bdqakgabli
back in korea i m a surgeon steady hands
this is a knockoff of another commercial from italy where an italian woman shoves her husband into the washer and he comes out as a muscular black man https://youtu.be/oikeuwkjcf8
honestly i find this quite funny but i m probably gonna get assblasted for even thinking that
she s happy now but she s gonna be disappointed come bedtime
it s a chinese commercial for those wondering it s banned now
it s so funny how the black guy not only gets apparently cleaned up but also gets like half a foot taller
i knew i was asian on the inside
this is fuckin hilarious
an oldie from
hooollllyyyyy shit
how naive i was i thought maybe he had bad breathe and he was also needing to get clean from what appeared to be painting dude was cute
as an asian american dude i ll say it was the asian dude really supposed to be considered the ideal the black dude looked way more masculine and well built than the asian dude is the delicate look the thing in china
excuse me while i pick my jaw off the ground
that s some white washing if i ve ever seen it
lmfao

where can i buy this product
this is a banned commercial from several years ago lol
uh i m speechless
holy fuck last time i saw something this racist it was a pears soap ad from the 19th century
i tried it works
i don t know what i expected but it wasn t fucking that
yeah the chinese be like that sometimes
asian countries really believe in whiter is better that s why you see so many white guys with asian women even in asian there s a hierarchy south east asians are seen as below east asians in south asia lighter skinned people are deemed more desirable than dark skinned people
hahahahaha i mean that s racist yo
holy fuck thats a comercial i thought it was some racist video some random made but nope

fukkin yikes
ffs
damn that s fucked up
he came out more feminine
fantastic commercial
gif emote free_emotes_pack trollface gif emote free_emotes_pack trollface gif emote free_emotes_pack trollface
that s fucking racist and i m not even black i felt offended
that s not only racist but the asian guy is objectively less hot than the black guy
where did the black guy go
hot water causes shrinkage
that s pretty damn funny
sitting on the washing machine is the only fun she will have
wow so this is where all this bts guys keep coming from
like mr sparkle but horribly racist
ah yes the astoundingly flagrant racism xenophobia in some parts of asia it doesn t excuse the anti asian discrimination present in the west but it does give some perspective as to this idea that racism is not a universally human thing
racism is just hate hate is all over the world some people hate fat people some hate skinny some hate a combination of things at the end of the day it s just hate and we need less of that just because you prefer your own kind or some other form of trait does not mean you need to put down others the world is sick and if we don t love one another we are doomed to repeat history with wars and some other shit idk i m hungry
wow that was racist
that s actually damn funny leave the racism at the door that s just humor
that wein must ve been cotton because i guarantee it shrank
yeeeesh
exposure puts racism in a different league racism has a class war function in the us and other british colonies
yoooo
img emote t5_2r5rp
holy shittake what country is this from
great to know racism exists for black people https://youtu.be/b4ebkghhff0
i thought he was just gonna come out without the schmutz on his face
i m dating an asian woman right now and she isn t racist at all but will fully admit many are
ya i wish lol
n word pass revoked
went on a tour in china in and one of our chinese guides was incredibly racist against black people and very oblivious casual about it one example was her saying police would pretty much assume a black guy in china was probably a criminal even more so if he shaves his head because they shave people s heads in prison
wtf did i just watch
that has the be the epitome of racism not only did he change colour he changed ethnicity
it is no secret that china is highly racist stuff like this is common unfortunately
yes asian people can be pretty fucking racist against other asians and especially black people
iq just jumped collage acceptance rate dropped like
repost
anyone else think she downgraded d
that machine gives you a small dick
that s some pretty racist shit mods
completely normal asian racism don t feel sorry for them when they are on the receiving end
inches of dick
what the holy subliminal racist fuck
they should put a warning may turn your clothes asian
wow well thats about as racist as you could possibly get lmfaooo what in theee fuck was that from imagine that shit playing as a youtube ad or something in the u s i would love to see what the response would be haha
damn she must not like orgasms
the second guy is ugly though

amy schumer as barbie seems really off putting to me margot is perfect for the role
there s no way schumer wss really doing that role
can t really make vagina jokes when you have nothing there that s really the one joke she could have made after that there s nothing else
maybe the studio didn t want to risk lawsuits from amy stealing other people s jokes as she usually does
does nobody understand that there are multiple barbies and a few kens in the movie she was just going to be one of the other barbies there was no way in hell they were ever casting her as the lead and this is a clickbait ass article haha just check out the imdb lol
who watches amy schumer voluntarily
amy schumer as barbie hahahahaha
amy is unfunny as fuck shit comedian
amy is also too ugly to be barbie
amy isn t funny i m glad she left the project
miss piggy from the muppets looks good in that photo
amy would make a horrible barbie hard no
crowder fan both sides guy mens right s etc etc etc imagine my shock that he gets off on mocking schumer
the only way an amy schumer barbie film works is if the story takes place years after barbie peaks is on her 2nd husband and has gained pounds because she squeezed out kids
gif giphy 8vuexza2me7vnuuvrs
is this a joke is she joking about being considered to play barbie because if it is then that s probably her best joke so far
i heard she quit because she said she didn t get paid as much as some men who did similar roles and she was told she get paid less not cos she s a woman but because she s not as good as the men she named
amy proved that being related to a crooked politician can get you far
amy schumer isn t even in the top funniest comedians
amy wanted to add vagina jokes to the script but the studio wouldn t budge because everyone knows barbie doesn t have a vagina
who was going to play schumers ken dane cook
amy schumer as barbie i don t see it but cabbage patch kid shoo in gif giphy gnk1znxci3vz1hqnjw
she definitely steals her jokes from funny people
dodged a bullet there
ahh buzzfeed digging the bottom of the cringe barrel again
funny if you say so
any schumer plays barbie the hutt in a lando calrissian spin off i can see that
while i haven t seen too many movies with margot robbie as the lead i have seen the enancipation of harley quinn im willing to bet she d be a far better lead actor than amy schumer
but am i the only one amy who
how in the absolute god given hell was amy first choice for barbie
if she was proposed as barbie who was going to be ken joe pesci
amy a schumer looks perfect to play a garbage pail kid
amy will never be off pudding
deleted
they also couldn t find anyone making good barbie jokes for her to steal so it was pointless
theres other reasons she sucks https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/ald8rt/amy\_schumer\_admits\_sexual\_assault\_on\_cab\_driver/
she is still too fat unlikeable and unfunny for it along with the stolen jokes sexual assault etc she would ve killed the movie
it literally says she was cast as barbie reread the post
copyright lawyers https://youtu.be/4edxjxvl8s0)
who is amy schumer literally
miss piggy deserves better than that
nothing get hard around amy
no one likes schumer she s up there with mencia unfunny and joke thieves
i mean its super easy to do given how awful a person schumer is
schumer the person who repeatedly stole jokes sexually assaulted a cab driver are we talking about the same amy schumer i don t like crowder but i understand why he shits on that bitch
some people deserve to be mocked
in her version barbie was short for barbecue
i didn t even know that but you re right she s even more loathsome than i thought
i know op didn t intend for this joke to land but it s funny
gif giphy bj5ilhcpm8eq8
shit i m cracking up here
amy is way too deep into the pudding
this
why
i know for a fact that she once asked a driver assigned to her for a play she was doing in ny to be replaced because she thought he wasn t young and hot enough she s a despicable person and anyone who has ever worked with or around her will tel you the same
how about actually read an article for the post or check out the imdb
do you get hard around barbies man
don t forget she raped a drunk guy while at a party
look just because she s a fat unfunny obnoxious off putting piece of trash doesn t mean she can t e a t be barbie
lol it s splashed all over the internet a million sources
lets politely say she was a bad fit for the role
as i understand it that was the plot she was going to be a barbie who gets expelled from barbiedom for her lack of fitting the mold both physically and mentally
she s a bad fit for a doorway

i guess i don t get it religious people think they know everything based on one fantastical book while scientists are always in search for more knowledge is that not what this is saying
where did they post that some context might help edit i m the idiot here disregard lol
it s not really a huge offense given how many people use this sub as a platform to post things they agree with
lol this is a joke about another post https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/12dzuht/selfexplanatory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/12dzuht/selfexplanatory/) x200b the facepalm is that post so im basically saying exactly that redditor seems like a idiot bimbo

maybe it s a joke about of sweden s population being muslim
i m willing to bet this is a joke and the person asking the question just chose swedish at random
in france it s
nah i believe it is deliberate sweden is seen as pure to the viking loving nazis and since people from west asia fled here they are screaming about the great replacement
