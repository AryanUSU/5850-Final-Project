puck futin
day cdviii part i thread dxlix
a very merry fuck putin
during the full scale invasion russia fired about missiles into ukraine for billion according to forbes the russian federation has almost completely exhausted the reserves of caliber and x555 missiles this is probably the main reason for the use of more expensive kh kinzhal missiles however there are still thousands of short range missiles of the s type in russia which strike at a distance of up to km and destroy front line cities https://twitter.com/flash_news_ua/status/1644096670244765696?t=6butiid_z-n8vlg4ufvnna&s=19
hey fuck putin
thousands that s an absurd amount hopefully most are not well maintained
wow a raid on blackrock
if you are in need a good revolution you just know it s gonna start with the french
couldn t have happened to a nicer bunch
well to be fair if the day of reckoning is ever going to happen the revolution will probably start in france meanwhile we will have inflation in the uk and just complain that teabags cost per box
would ve personally preferred they go after blackstone
i see a lot of debate back and forth about the french protests the arguments about wealth gap vs practical needs to reduce pensions i guess all i d say is that if i have to pick sides and it s between corporations and the people i m going to side with the people
fuck yeah blackrock is the worst fuck shit up frenchies
the french really are masters of all cuisine here they can be seen basting the rich before they eat them
france fucking knows how to do it ain t no protest like a paris protest
canadians should be taking lessons considering the complete fuckery our provincial and federal governments are currently pulling can t house the people that live here now but for sure lie to immigrants and tell them they ve got a place here in canada just saw a shitty bedroom apartment going for month in port hope ontario population take note canadians and let s fire some shit up
removed
as per usual the french are ahead of the curve
hopefully the french can lead the world into a new period of social democracy and shared sacrifice prosperity they did this before thanks to monsieur lafayette among others we can not ever accept that a compassionate society only works in homogeneous postwar european nation states
a trader reportedly tells the invaders this is a stock exchange there is no money you can steal to which the invader responds then why are you people here
meanwhile in the us the retirement age was just upped to and nobody said a thing
this is what should happen here
blackrock has more than t rillion dollars under their direct management i think they ll be fine
do you hear the people sing
as someone who works in asset management seeing this thread of people spouting absolute shite makes me realise how little reddit knows about most things
fuck yes thank you to all those protesters
cool now do it in nyc
i respect and admire the french for their actions americans take note and rise
maybe they ll take that into consideration in their next esg assessment
evil company
when paris sneezes europe catches revolution
based good luck to all the french protestors hopefully the damage to blackrock is irreparable
this is straight up what i thought america would look like when they took away reproductive rights
this seems like a cover up you see in movies plan a protest while spies sneak in a grab sensitive info
this is the way
good
their protests are such an inspiration i wish north america was capable of having that much dedication and courage to bring about change
blackrock are the absolute scum of the earth yet never seem to get the same attention as the other giants
removed
i may be the only one who read the article but it seems like blackrock isn t involved in pension reform it looks like the french socialist party is using the unpopularity of the pension reform bill to attack macron and capitalism as a whole
as they say viva la france
where is black rock usa i d like to storm that place too
interesting that they chose a shithole corporate building instead of their neighborhood bodega owned by their cousin or a government building
wow i m probably going to have to wait until to get fewer benefits health care
ok now go for blackstone then billionaires
the republic is dead long live the sixth republic
good shit
i wonder if you get a pardon if you kill employees in the black rock offices
don t you do that don t you give me hope
kudos to them for standing up for themselves and always getting cool pics with colorful smoke in a dark setting
gene wilder stop don t come back
is it time
ninjas
those in the u s take heed
keep it up
need more of this for sure
americans need to wake up and realize that we can do this too we have gotten so fucking lazy and complacent man it s in the constitution we also have the right to overthrow our government france out here making us look like scared bitches we should just give them back the statue of liberty we don t deserve her anymore
blackrock just manages index funds and retirement money for a pretty reasonable fee storming blackstone i can get behind however
they are being too nice this is blackrock we are talking about
redditors really are a stupid bunch the amount of people that are complaint about blackstone
man blackstone must be laughing their ass off right now seeing the confusion lmao
both cnn and fox has been covering it msnbc all i can tell is mostly covering the tennessee vote on democrats
my favorite happy ever and we sit and fight about a beer logo and orange man burn it allll good for france
don t blame them life s too short retirement age should be coming down if anything
blackrock is the company that buys up most us homes at an exorbitant price to rent them out to families they are actively trying to create a renter class blackrock pushes the esg rating environmental social and corporate governance which is why so many companies have gone woke because they want a high esg rating despite pushing the esg they own the most stocks in exxon chevron marathon they also recently invested billion into coal companies black rock holds significant stocks in every major corporation business in the us health care fossil fuels defense manufacturing tech banks retail fashion entertainment your grandma s flower shop this ties into the previous statement their assets are worth over trillion dollars trillion with a t that is not a typo there is no reason the left and the right democrats and republicans progressives and conservatives shouldn t be united against blackrock they push the political division in america american politicians aren t owned by corporations they re owned by blackrock the french are going for the head of the snake it s time americans do the same
so you attack the building of an asset manager who invests money to ensure that the pension fund meets necessary returns to pay beneficiaries smart what people don t realize is that these pensions can t guarantee payments based on taxpayer contributions alone they generally have investment offices that invest with places like black rock in order to help generate returns to pay beneficiaries
i feel like i m witnessing one of the largest global workers movements in my lifetime and i still feel like this is only the beginning what an absolute privilege to witness
fuck blackrock
blackrock pays good money to fly under the public s radar this is pretty funny
blackrock the world s largest asset manager has played no part in the pension reforms really is there anything that blackrock doesn t play a part in
i m not too clear why they would target blackrock in these specific riots though they are assholes but they don t have anything to do with france s public pension plan the article just says vaguely that they re targeted because they manage private pension plans makes no sense honestly
are the french still protesting
don t worry iran already gave france good advice
occupy wall street didn t end it just moved to france
need to do this is the us but i m worried i d just get gunned down by the police
appropriate behavior toward blackrock
this is amazing fuck all you motherfucking real estate investors
do that in nyc next so i can work from home
fuck blackrock
i love it give em hell comrades
can a few of these guys come over here to new york and burn that blackrock hq too vive la france
volunteer fireman here please find ways to protest besides starting fires indoors
hopefully leroy is part of them
this is a setup there s one level shaman hiding right inside the door waiting to purge their world buffs
i hope a dal rends drops
i hope they remembered their world buffs or this could end in a total wipe
lfm melee dps ubrs felstriker and dal rend reserved
i typed in blackrock but my finger slipped and it said cock and i gotta say i saw a lotta bro s with nice cocks i did eventually figure out that it s an investment company
damn i wasn t invited i need that robe for my mage
did they get to overlord wyrmthalak
perhaps we ll finally have a france reborn
in almost all cases a movement is dead the moment they start fucking with the money even though that s the most effective thing that could happen not the french though they know how to fuck with the money
french revolutions tend to be a bit gruesome with no real winners not sure they are the model
right blackrock is also associated with blackstone the company that is vacuuming up single family houses like crazy oh and they also happen to be heavy donators to fucking fascists https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/02/stephen-schwarzman-blackstone-republicans-campaign-donations edit and to all the but they aren t related anymore oneoneone my ass just because a company becomes two separate entities doesn t mean they don t have any relations anymore in fact i would argue they probably just did that as a show hey look we re different now move or for some sort of tax dodging bullshit
y a know the vast majority of the people that work at blackrock are just regular people
the usa has the same problem we put up with so much bullshit and plenty of people are mad about it but we can t seem to organize or do anything about it
seems the garden caught fire
what you re talking about happening is very literally happening right now the revolution won t be called the revolution
the uk will never do more than grumble tbf every time they have tried to revolt against the powers that be they have been beaten into submission they have some kind of collective stockholm syndrome
these protests aren t going to change inflation or prevent the french social pension system from imploding i know reddit is young people who hate companies but this isn t doing france any favors if anything companies won t want to operate in france anymore the reality is france has low wages high taxes an aging population increasing cost of living and expensive housing nothing is changing that these protests don t fix a thing
canada has this problem it s too bad we don t have the strength to riot over anything other then hockey playoff losses
the year is still young my friend
only wtf
all countries should be condemning this it s literally kids being kidnapped from their families and thrown into foster care
i thought deportation of children was spelled kidnapping
my question where are the other countries even if it s just optics how can others not condemn for their actions those who stand for nothing fall for everything alexander hamilton
only countries are against genocide
plus this is worse than just genocide it s quite nearly ethnic cleansing and could be sex trafficking human trafficking slaves
i wish the article would state what russia s attempt at justification is was
the countries that stayed silent are complicit in russia s crimes
those poor children my heart hurts the world will never learn
this is some hand maids tale shit right here wtf russia gilead
definitely not enough countries condemning that
well ain t that some classic russian 3d chess play using the ol un stage to trump up their so called humanitarian operations in ukraine nice try but countries ain t gonna let their lies fly without a fight i d say kudos to the uk for throwing a wrench in their webcast propaganda though that ain t repairing the families torn apart by their bs props to those who put them in their place it s good to see some ballsy pushback on their constant carousel of sneaky plays but sadly kids still suffer
republicans are backing russia actions in ukraine
the war crimes version of thoughts and prayers
and yet bbc news actually broadcast putin s excuses bbc news can t be trusted anymore
and the eu so countries not sure why they dropped the eu count from the headline edit oh some of the eu countries are also listed in the weird never mind
security council is utterly useless
deportation
there are countries in the world
and not a single country says anything about palestine
maybe the reasoning is to take them out of war zones and keep them fed clothed and educated would it be smart to leave children in areas of conflict russians view things differently than the west these children are living national assets of a future russia remember russia lost so many to ww2 the population hasn t recovered
pos world leaders i m sure at least billion people disagree
those numbers should be higher
how is russia able to make the decision to deport ukrainian children
look if you want to waste humanity by sending them to a fruitless war fine but leave kids and animals out of it they are the few total innocents in a world that would make dante rewrite his images of hell
do everybody really think that it s better to let them stay in the active war zone
yes you d think that siding against genocide would be a global no brainer
the joint statement was issued on behalf of andorra albania australia austria belgium bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria canada croatia cyprus czechia denmark estonia european union finland france germany georgia greece guatemala hungary iceland ireland italy japan republic of korea latvia liechtenstein lithuania luxembourg malta moldova monaco montenegro kingdom of the netherlands new zealand north macedonia norway poland portugal romania san marino slovakia slovenia spain sweden switzerland ukraine united kingdom and the united states
too many spineless countries
if it helps any the article says that it was the eu other countries
a lot of them are afraid of russia
as we see in russia extreme corruption and authoritarianism is a disease that will handicap a nation and its people from being successful all decent people know that child trafficking is wrong and those that will not speak up against such obvious crimes have no futures until they change
this is much worse actually it s genocide because they re forcing those kids to be raised by russian parents in order to destroy their ukrainian heritage and culture
deportation is the name of the war crime in the geneva conventions it s not some attempt to make it sound nicer
if a government does it it magically becomes ethical
i don t think it s about the number of countries many places in the world aren t emotionally invested in this war it s far and has nothing to do with them and their own personal struggles it should be more important to note the countries within the region and the countries that have the means to do something about it i can t hate on a country that has its own issues what do you know about the tigray war do you understand the nuance of the conflict what is your stance with on the two sides it s important to stand for what s right but it s gambling if you don t know what you re standing for
most of these states have been either colonized or bombed by western states at one point doesn t really take more than a second to know the reason why the majority of the world are not aligned with the west just considering that the main supporter of ukraine is the same state that bombed and invaded several states all over the globe with absolute impunity and unconditional support from other western states you reap what you sow
idk go around asking ecuador and sudan and bangladesh why they aren t
moving kids out of harm s way is generally not frowned upon
probably didn t even read the thing or don t believe whatever a majority of western countries come up with it is often a lot more complicated than you might assume based on a small article
when you start to list the countries not on that list you start to realize there aren t that many good ones
plenty of countries will outright not believe anything the west comes up with it isn t that they are not against genocide but they just don t trust information from the west
seriously
panama senegal and brunei won t get any with their complicity
the purpose of the security council is to ensure that the world s major nuclear powers don t turn the planet into a toasted marshmellow so far they have a success rate
this is always said by someone and it s always
the european union and countries so that s when of the world calls you a serial child kidnapper that kind of matters
perhaps you weren t paying attention during the first few months of the war but many attempts were made to create humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate russia would agree to one then fire on it as people tried to escape killing them then they d agree to create others but only let them lead to russian territory to the east instead of to the west they had been acting horrible since the beginning making sure as many citizens and children ended up on their land then those kids disappeared separated and sent to the four corners of siberia to be told by their adoptive families their parents abandoned them or are dead and tell them they are russian from now on it s obvious cultural genocide
it takes a special kind of fucked in the head to invade a country then steal its children because they re not safe in a war zone
world war two was multiple generations ago it s not a demographic factor anymore the population of russia dropped precipitously after not just because of the loss of satellite republics if they were just worried about taking care of them they could deport them with their ukrainian parents maybe that s being done i don t know a ton about what they re doing right now
things humans traffickers say to justify their actions remember russia lost so many to ww2 the population hasn t recovered no russia s lost so many to it just being a completely shitty country
most of the world doesn t care about this if you look at the map supporting urkaine it s basically the west plus japan and south korea
i mean would you there are countries doing that very thing right now the world is not necessarily reasonable
so essentially nato and or eu eu candidate nations their closest allies in sk japan australia nz with the only standout being guatemala from the entire rest of the world dissapointing
and the informal statement was specifically in regards to russia organizing an informal meeting of the un security council aimed at spreading disinformation about its widespread and unlawful forced deportation of thousands of ukrainian children statement https://twitter.com/sergiykyslytsya/status/1643611335739965440/photo/1)
thank you guatemala very cool
and brazil s absence makes me feel ashamed it s sad seeing a president once known and admired for his diplomatic stance siding with russia on that matter
deleted
good to see the swiss on the list
dammit mexico why aren t you there
too many spineless complicit countries
you might have misunderstood that the countries consist mostly of eu member states the eu itself is listed as a separate entity
removed
does the tigray war involve the kidnapping of children because if so i would be against it x200b that was hard
i am not against a country committing genocide because the west makes no sense at the end of the day it s more simple illiberal countries are at best indifferent towards genocide
so by that logic some countries from the global south don t have to condemn the holocaust because hey at least germany was attacking their british and french rulers
why the majority of the world are not aligned with the west just considering that the main supporter of ukraine is the same state that bombed and invaded several states all over are we watching the same news pretty sure the majority of the world is aligned against russia save a handful most significantly india china north korea and iran turkey depending on who they re talking to that day there are a few other nations as well but most have small populations that said this wasn t a question about the war in general but specifically the kidnapping of children from their families to your point about the wars waged by the united states and united kindom i assume though you didn t specifically state i can very much understand the lack of support other countries have for us and uk that s not really relevant here ukraine is an autonomous country the ukrainian people elected a government another country attempted to influence and overthrow it and failing that invaded and waged war upon it
i believe it was implied but you have a point that one should be more direct can anyone from the other or so countries on the planet offer explanation on what justifies kidnapping children from a country you ve waged war upon specifically russians kidnapping ukrainian children but will accept any other like tigray uighur inuit sami or romani for example
when you move kids out of harms way you don t adopt them out to russian families and begin the same indoctrination process done on russia s native born children to erase their ukrainian identity and remove any connection to their families if they were being temporarily kept somewhere safe and then repatriated to ukraine during prisoner swaps or they had a system in place for them to be moved to a safer part of ukraine that may be a different story but it isn t
moving kids into harms way is
this is an interesting way to try and justify kidnapping
that is not what russia is doing but i can see you re pro rape and murder so i don t see a point in discussing this with you
that s like saying it s okay for your buddy to move a kid out of harms way and into your home cause he was in the house you were robbing and that s a dangerous situation
russia is not a safe country for ukrainian children this is literal genocide btw
and most of these countries are massively corrupt authoritarian rely on the economic benefits of doing trade with russia or china etc it s not that they don t believe the west they selectively choose not to it fits their narrative
what an excuse obviously they trust telegram or rt
i assume you re self hater westerner guy almost each of those other countries is corrupt dictatorship having death penalty for being gay radical religious and some of them literally having modern slavery despites of colonialism the most moral countries today are the west and well almost all of the non west countries don t even trying
it was to prevent war in general and it s abysmal at that but good at organizing humanitarian relief efforts basic manifestation of an overly idealistic idea having bad consequences in the real world woodrow wilson s fantasy of the league of nations
not really i mean of the world has criminalized homosexuality it s even less meaningful that the you say that matter has exported more children from conflict zones than russia has in ukraine by a factor of but hey you do you
you can disagree with the war itself but if the russian troops take territory which was originally in the separatist donbas region and then discover abandoned or orphaned russian speaking children what are the actual troops on the ground supposed to do with the children russia has no diplomatic relations with ukraine or the west so they can t exactly walk them over to poland or something
well in many countries the police can arrest you and hold you in protective custody
so almost all of the advanced nations that isn t surprising
lol you say the west as if it s just this one small thing hahahaha
it s actually us eu and all the democratic asia minus a couple of countries barely democratic or not at all i live in romania and we re not from the west but we proudly support ukraine efforts though whatever means we can like helping with refugees or exports definitely we cannot help with millions billions like usa does most of the world cares
sad but true they d start caring if it directly affected them
most noteworthy absences i ve noticed so far are israel and turkey
not nato turkey is missing
yup shows exactly why we need to stop fucking around with eachother and start working together for good not only now or for the next years honestly it is pathetic that the eu and the us are waging a lowkey trade war with one another every single day while we need eachother to maintain the world and the values we all love a few years ago both the eu and the us were trying to move away from eachother in favor of china and india
which is most of the developed free world yep
that s the only countries care about the conflict rest of the world doesn t care
im surprised the philippines is missing considering its close military ties with the us didnt they just get new us bases
no other sovereign state in the world has a name in english that begins with united states so it s perfectly reasonable to not need to include of america much like it s ok to say united kingdom and not united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland everyone knows exactly which country is being referred to
existed the united states of america is one of two countries to have united states in its the name the other is mexico and the official name is united mexican states and even then that fact isn t well known
mali bolivia and vietnam must answer for this
yeah but are you going to say anything else about it beyond war bad are you going to post all over social media about it it makes sense why there s less emotional investment for the average person in the us or germany or japan but let s not pretend the bias isn t there here in my city tens of thousands turned out for the ukrainian rally last year but only hundreds attended the iranian rally it s just how it is
except very few states everyone condemned the invasion on multiple occasions in the un just do not expect them to holler at every chance because again reciprocity exists and yes they are indifferent just like any other states when they re not active parties in a conflict
it is nothing about being liberal or illiberal liberal western countries in the are quiet about plenty of other things when it suits them and there are plenty of liberal countries outside the in the end it is always about the geopolitics other countries don t condemn russia because for one reason or another they can t afford to it is simple as that
did the u s do anything about rwanda
the entirety of the global south was colonized back then very few had independence if you let the self entitlement down for a second and start treating the inhabitants of the global south as human beings with conscience feelings and political and economical interests that they have to maintain you may understand anyways except very few states this invasion was condemned by almost all of the un member states and they voted against russia multiple times
and basically all countries condemn starting the war when the war has already been started it s not unreasonable to think that it s good to move kids out of harms way and it s not unreasonable to wait with declaring something as evil when you don t have any unbiased sources about its consequences i know we all dislike russia but seriously people here lack critical thinking skills
russian vodka does not go well with long life and prosper
seems like kind of a big deal changing practice partners
armenia is nervous about invasion by azerbaijan the last time azerbaijan attacked them putin just shrugged and told armenia it was tough luck
pesky peskov and horseface lavrov will go apeshit
nato is a defensive pact for member nations csto is a defence pact for russia and tool to enslave non russian countries it s worthless except for dictators who might need outside help from time to time in case of revolutions
woaahhh
nothings confirmed a report on singh s announcement posted on the pentagon s website was edited on thursday evening to exclude armenia from the list no official explanation was given for that revision the armenian government did not comment on it either it was thus not clear whether yerevan had initially agreed to join the war games before deciding to pull out of them this was from https://www.azatutyun.am/a/32352696.html
mr krabs laugh gif
might be nice if armenia also stopped those iranian drones from being passed through their country to russia
i don t know if this will work out since they have an active territorial dispute and eu relies on azerbaijani oil
isnt armenia landlocked
some pretty mixed messages here they e allegedly afraid russia would destroy their dairy industry if they arrested putin yet somehow working out with nato would be okay sigh it s all too confusing to have a reaction just yet
how does this work given the russian base near gyumri wouldn t shouldn t they expel the russians i d get a french foreign legion base or something there asap
how was it that one fat fuck said on the russian news years propaganda party like it or not russia is expanding i think it was hows that nato expanding finlands in soon sweden too many more eyeing to join too its all going according to putlers plan
great
yikes
i know there s a conflict in that area but even just the armenians saying they want to take part in nato exercises is not insignificant
i mean the armenians have been getting fucked by the azerbaijanis for the last few years and russia has done dick all to help them considering how weak russia looks now after a year of getting whipped in ukraine this should not be that shocking to see ctso start to fracture towards nato china
yeah i m surprised its not getting more press although they are still csto members and de facto ineligible to join nato due to their border issues with azerbaijan
but it s good slowly having armenia switch to nato defense will ensure peace in the region even as implausible as it is russia is sucking us dry and azerbaijan will kill us if we don t switch anyway so there s no reason not to try along with the ability to democratize as well
kazakhstan has apparently moved away from russia in favour of china also
how does this affect nato azeri relations the us specifically has developed very close economic and military relations in the years following the end of section
last time armenia got attacked by azerbaijan they asked the csto for help and they were like lol no i m sure that made a lot of people in armenia think well then what the hell is this organization for
were they ever attacked by azerbaijan even russia has said in the past that nagorno karabakh isn t armenia
lukashenko cough cough that was more through the union state though which is the csto but even more russified
iran and russia share a border with the caspian sea which has ships
perhaps georgia will stop now that they are looking west
good call on china the winners of a csto collapse are both nato and the sco increased us eu presence in the caucasus will be met with increased chinese influence in the ferghana valley
even if they didn t have those border issues with azerbaijan i don t see any possibility of nato membership as long as turkey is a member
do you have a source for that they both are in nato s partnership for peace program which among other things helps ensure their nilitaries interoperability with nato troops along with consult with and report to nato if threats made to the security territory or sovereignty of a participating state are detected armenia has political parties that want deeper connections with nato and one that wants to leave the csto and join nato it d be kinda silly for political parties to have a policy of leaving csto and joining nato when they are ineligible to do so
still i m surprised that there hasn t been a stronger response from russia armenia said they would arrest putin and i don t remember seeing russia respond to that at all and you know that s a big deal to putin for armenia to be siding with the west guess russia should ve helped when they invoked article but i am concerned that a stern response is coming and i expect it won t be friendly
love the reforms good luck friend
kazakhstan is a lovely country trapped by shitty geography i genuinely believe they have zero interest being involved in the geopolitical bullshit they keep getting dragged into because of russia or china
very nice
nothing substantial az still has way more european support so they re very unlikely to feel threatened
there have been border skirmishes resulting in armenian deaths whilst the border is contested by any metric that s an attack
even other than nagano karbakh armenia and azerbaijan should theoretically have enclaves and exclaves within each other but they ve more or less occupied each other s enclaves and exclaves
you have a strange history of defending azerbaijan whenever you get an opportunity lots of interest in taking a strong position in nationalist politics in general
i m referring to reports that iran is currently using land routes through armenia to ship drones
makes sense for the nations closer to china to align with them makes sense for the nations closer to nato to align with them russias the big loser here and good riddance
deleted
greece is in nato too
when i say de facto ineligible i mean that its generally considered an extremely small possibility because for any state with serious territorial disputes to became a member state is seen as tantamount to a declaration of war because the new member can immediately declare article armenia specifically would also have a lot of trouble getting turkey to cooperate also worth mention that russia is in the partnership for peace program lol edit tried to fix sentences i m really tired sorry if i dont make sense or whatever
thank you
that s what i suspected both countries seem to becoming much more willing to negotiate through the us and nato concerning nagorno karabakh as well probably because russia couldn t care less they also are becoming very interested in improving western relations in general and loosing progress over something like this just seems trivial
that said it would look really good diplomatically if someone in nato could broker a truce just saying
karabagh is legally azerbaijani territory
nope azerbaijan doesn t occupy armenian territory edit except for a 40km2 village with formerly inhabitants as people noted
that s very unlikely armenia s borders with turkey and azerbaijan are closed while the border between georgia and russia is also closed
turkey is in the caucus area and so is georgia turkey is a nato member and georgia is a prospective member armenia s location is no different it borders the two
its apart of europe and asia georgia is applying to be in the eu too
yeah but that doesn t matter you need unanimous support to join nato if even country objects they re not getting in no matter how many friends they have voting in favor
pelosi already had success in the past it s just a really complicated situation since both countries have enclaves surrounded by the other country
maybe so but ultimately armenians have died the ctso providing no input whatsoever clearly hasn t gone down well in fact nancy pelosi went to broker a peace deal whilst putin did nothing it s not great pr for russia and the ctso
they are referring to the border skirmishes that occurred earlier this year not the 2nd karnabakh war
there is also the zangazur corrdior https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zangezur_corridor) that both turkey and azerbaijan are really keen on and which azerbaijan has threatened to implement by force
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/artsvashen
look at a map even azerbaijan says it holds artsvashen pending peace settlement it s part of the negotiations now on the border
turkey is in the caucus area turkey has land in europe though constantinople and it s suburbs sit on both sides of the bosphorus the west of the country is in the balkans
okay i stand corrected they occupied a people village but comparing it to karabakh is still a joke at best km2 initially by armenia vs this 40km2 village
yeah that s a 40km2 village it s like i m occupying a room of your house and you re occupying a whole city comparing them with each other is insane you should try looking at a map yourself buddy
let s play spot the greek or the orthodox christian or the crusader kings europoa universalis player
i didn t compare it to karabakh i was just pointing out to say that there s none categorically is incorrect
i think you re not grasping that people aren t bringing it up as a comparison of scale but as a comparison of principle
whoops lol it s the third one
okay that s still misleading since someone uninformed might get the feeling that there is something comparable and mutual since the way you said it sounds like they re occupying notable lands of each other you worded it like they re doing the same thing which is technically the truth but far from what happened
my money was on your being greek because i know a lot of greeks and they do not let it go
well they are doing the same thing but i wasn t talking about the nagorno karabakh conflict i was talking about the enclaves and exclaves of de jour armenia and azerbaijan here s something from wikipedia describing them additionally in the northern stretch of the boundary area there are four enclaves one armenian artsvashen baknd and three azerbaijani sofulu yukhari askipara verin voskepar and barxudarl since the war all four enclaves are now controlled by their host nation and have for all practices purposes ceased to exist though they are often depicted on official armenian and azerbaijani government maps the conflict of those enclaves in exclaves kind of takes a backseat too the nagorno karabakh conflict because like you said in terms of a sense of scale it s orders of magnitude smaller but it certainly doesn t help the situation that both countries are illegally occupying each other s sovereign territory
check out the balls on bulgaria
can a ship under russian flag enter in a harbor in eu i have no idea but i am guessing yes
what just now does romania still allow them entry
  
about time
weird i mean after last election it s still a politic deadlock right meaning bulgarian president which is pro russia still appoint the government
should be called ballgaria
it s not a matter of showing balls i m afraid i m bulgarian and i m not proud of what our temporary government did in relation to that special operation of course russians have corrupted most of our politicians really much in those years
big gohones
in theory yes
i won t allow it
it can
kinda but it likely won t have insurance that can pay for damages in those countries so it might be refused
i don t think so us troops are doing training excercises there
glory to bulgaria
no president is a bitch who can t do shit but wave his dick around he is only able to appoint a temporary parliament if the parties can t figure it out by themsevles
in some dialects of english it is pronounced that way
bulgeria
bulge area
ah my bad i read that they re being pressured to comply if it makes you feel any better and it probably won t the u s also has politicians corrupted by russia
cahones
can it leave
flexercises
you can dialect these nuts
republicans corrupted by russia and democrats corrupted by china we re hosed
i ve got eggs how bout you
nicely done
there is no one in the democratic party who is pro china like some republicans are pro russia like it s not even close
it was the republican nixon that started the chinese romance

how the hell does he know
he had a girlfriend and nearly married people the two popes movie covered it well he went to priesthood due to many many reasons
not the way i do it
i don t think francis has any molested skeletons in his closet we haven t heard anything about him although i wonder if we would in any case this was a candid conversation with people in their 20s asking questions about things that they are seeing in their day to day life gender identity access to abortion the nonstop investigations that always turn something up the role of a religious leader is in part to help faithful people understand their lives in the context of their beliefs not yet having seen the documentary i expect that the young people are all catholics and the questions are about what is the right way for me as a catholic to interpret all these things i see in my life in that there s nothing inappropriate here the jokes itt about sex with boys look i ll shred the catholic church as much as the next guy but this is actually an interesting action by francis previous popes failed hard in helping catholics understand how to follow their faith in a world that looks nothing like even just years ago francis is using a documentary to tell young catholics his view on how to look at things
sex between two people is a beautiful thing between five it s fantastic woody allen
take a shot every time someone mentions child in this thread permanent midnight right there boys
most christians don t think sex or even premarital sex is some evil thing that will send you to hell instantly just like most liberal women aren t getting cream pied times a day and getting monthly abortions
people are asking how the pope knows about sex and some people are answering that surely he lost his virginity before entering the priesthood maybe he did i don t know but there s also a hugely obvious second way that priests know about sex people constantly talk to them privately one on one up close and personal about sex about things they never mention to anyone else so second hand at least priests would tend to knew a lot about sex obvious as that is i didn t figure it out all by myself it was pointed out to me by the hbo series the young pope
and then you get to watch cartoons afterwards
asterisk as long as you re married and straight and doing it in the pope approved positions
how does he know
pope gets it
sounds like my high school biology teacher
it really depends pope
consensual sex is a beautiful thing
paul u w0t m8
hope he wasn t discussing the alter boy priest dynamic
john waters said it best keep sex weird
he got that dawg in him
sex is a beautiful thing that s why we share it with children the pope
the church wants more babies they dont care how it comes about
between consenting adults he should have added
the rest of the world you mean sex between consenting adults is a beautiful thing right the pope let s not be hasty
great timing to correspond with the md attorney general released their report https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp-video/mmvo168281669721) on the hundreds of child sexual abuse cases perpetrated by church officials for those children it probably was not so beautiful
looks like i agree with the pope
best pope ever
or so i ve heard
human sexuality is a gift from the lord a blessing
if only they d stop preying on children
how would he know
there s a misconception that christianity views sex as evil it s not sex is a gift from god as long as the couple is married before i married my wife our pastor had a chat with us he told us that re sex everything is permissible as long as it s between a husband and wife i thought aloud even a threesome he grinned he was the cool pastor if you were married to the third party sure however the lord only recognizes monogamous marriages
yeah but not with children
he shouldn t have said that very few people can comprehend what that means
pope but not for the gays fuck them heterosexuallly of course common sense on what grounds pope they can t breeeeeeeeed common sense so post menopausal or barren women or infertile men can t have sex pope no that s a beautiful thing common sense what what s the difference pope penises go in vaginas penises go in vaginas penisesgoinvaginassssss
pope s used to be able to marry
particularly with small children the pope

has he experienced it before
especially with young boys
hey preacher leave them kids alone
this pope fuqs
a friend once told me
did they switch popes
glad he thinks so
i m not a priest or the pope but i don t even know what he s talking about
it is when the people love each other
so is flying like a swift wing bird not that he s done that either
he shouldn t know
nothing but a pedo club
with boys he forget to say with boys
well of cause it is no matter what fucking gender the partner is as long as it s with consent and not pedophilia so basically the opposite of what the fucking guys at the church are doing
sex has always been considered a beautiful thing by christianity as long as you re straight married and haven t done anything else to affront conservative christian values
this pope fucks
how would he know unless nvm
fanatic catholics fuming in a corner
it s creepy when he says it
someone should tell him pedophilia isn t sex
sex with boys is a beautiful thing x200b uh your holiness maybe we should modify that just a bit
hey pope does that include priests having sex with kids
what a dog francis you rascal
only sex between a man and a women or a priest and a small boy the pope
he can go fuck himself
i imagine he whispered that into the ear of a sobbing child
they left out the end of the sentence where he said between a man and young boy
pervert pedophile
god literally created sex organs for sex and hardwired us to get pleasure from using them he can hardly turn around and say oh that s dirty you naughty lad i mean he shouldn t even be watching
deleted
genuinely why does anyone care about this this is not news to anyone sex is the only reason we exist of course its beautiful
catholic call to all altar boys right there
he prob meant with little boys
or so i ve heard
oh he likes to watch
this guy fucks
sax i was going to say sax
so beautiful that we spend half our time and energy condemning most of its manifestations and forbid it to our clergy
the pr religions need to stay relevant is fascinating
yo this guy fucks
his face his quite swollen suggestive of congestive heart failure
sorry no in real life sex is farcial even comical at times it s two human bodies rubbing together in a way that generates sweat and various kinds of fartish noises it s great of course we were sculpted to love sex and always will but beautiful even watching the most beautiful people money can pay to have sex boning in a set where some expense has been spared you still get post nut clarity and realise just what you ve been watching
if its a young boy
sex between consenting adults right between adults right
removed
removed
it is give the guy a fucking break
not gay sex i mean it s not gay when it s an alter boy obviously just bros for jesus then edit downvotes either mean that people can t smell sarcasm or that people won t acknowledge the catholic church s plethora of molestation accusations convictions and cover ups
unfortunately the statement was during a documentary on priest abuses around the world
he better qualify that statement thin ice jorge thin ice
is he thinking about little boys
came here to make a pedo joke all the good ones were taken pleasantly surprised
unfortunately the pope didn t state whether or not he was talking about sex with adults

sex is a beautiful thing a sacred act for catholic men and little boys p
i don t think i would agree with him on what makes sex beautiful
says the 80yovirgin
i have it all the time why does everyone else get joke upvotes but mine it to much it s a joke people good lord i can t figure this place out
it sure the hell ain t there isn t anything beautiful about thrusting your hip into someone else s hip it s grotesque af but feels good af let s be honest though sex is gross but good sex happens when you embrace the gross
us in lebanon watching our currency go from for in to for a dollar present pathetic
all part of putin s 5d master plan
in reality it is probably even worse than this virtually no one is buying roubles now that all major global currencies are fiat currencies everything is based on faith and we re all just kinda making shit up a recent yale study https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/with-zero-visibility-into-the-russian-economy-the-imf-is-parroting-putins-line) indicates that no one really knows wtf is going on with the russian economy but that it s probably very very bad the imf is just relying on the kremlin s officially stated numbers which are likely being fabricated out of thin air yale s investigations into international private sector dealings with russia suggest that it s a shit show over there hopefully this is correct and the sanctions are working
its lowest level so far homer
soon to be renamed the rubble
russian ruble lost its convertibility on march 8th so the exchange rate has been meaningless from that point on the rate is basically set artificially by russia s central bank and has no meaning outside of russia from outside you cannot buy any financial instrument denominated in rubles nor exchange it for anything
a fuck russia b the rouble was to the dollar on march so yes the rouble is at its lowest value in the last days but lets wait until they lose this stupid fucking war to pat ourselves on the back
i was reading somewhere else in the near term the rouble is likely to continue weakening towards against the dollar but the potential for a corrective strengthening of the rouble remains bank st petersburg analysts said in a note can someone more knowledgeable than i explain what these measures could be and if how will they be effective
it was almost double of that a year ago and half of that months ago what a rollercoaster
i checked the roubles to usd and it shows the lowest point was immediately after the war we re close to that point again but needs to drop another
which is a pointless statistic as the ruble is not a publically traded currency it is completely state controlled the price of the ruble is what russia says it is
title is factually wrong it was on 12th of april
doesn t really matter since the currency isn t really tradeable real value is can be as high as
it s like when i tried to trade in my old car and they offered me and i said hey it s worth more than that i just filled the gas tank
the value of the rouble is entirely fictional at this point there are massive government controls put in place and alot of behind the scenes nonsense even the economic values we re seeing are fabricated by the kremlin
price fluxuations in a profoundly illiquid market are probably not strong indicators of macro trands but the like four people in the world who want to buy roubles with dollars must be happy
people would tell me last year that the sanctions would have no effect on the russian economy it would appear that the sanctions have had total effect on the russian economy and it was just a matter of the time it needed to take for the system to finally break itself down in war college somewhere this is going to be a textbook example of how to beat your opponent without even firing a single shot
i was living in russia in when they first invaded crimea and benefited from the rouble collapse at that time i had usd in cash with me and would exchange each monday at the bank i went from pretty carefully budgeting where i d spend it to living like a king the last couple of months i was there
it would be nice if they surpassed argentina and show them what hyperinflation really looks like
keep those sanctions up
who knew that robux could be more profitable than roubles
too bad you can t safely travel there right now it s always nice to go to places nobody else is going with a currency in the toilet
this is after russia is eating through a large stockpile of foreign reserves used to prop it up
they should make it ply
but i kept reading the sanctions did nothing and russer has an economy as strong as it s ever been what happened are people coming online and fibbing
on what market can you exchange these currencies
i would love to visit again but only once putin is disposed and a new government is in place
obligatory the lowest level so far joke
zimbabwe those are rookie numbers you gotta pump those numbers up
amazing all the pro russia people on here claiming this is no big deal nothing to see here life goes on as normal for russians this may be true to an extent but this volatility can foreshadow something quite disastrous for the russian economy can russia and its significant allies come up with their own currency and ignore the west or will russias allies like china and india take advantage of the failing russian economy any way they can i m betting on the latter and that russia will be unrecognizable in years
it s a sign of winning when even your artificially propped up currency keeps on falling
what do you mean the rouble completely rebounded back to normal after those initial sanctions sanction don t do anything against our great economy some ruzzian last april
i recommend moscow where the american dollar buys seven rubbles beep beep twelve rubbles beep beep sixty rubbles beep beep one thousand rubbles i must go
its at it was at last year for a brief time needs to hit to be lowest level
so it s basically back to levels pre ukraine
planning a cheap vacation to russia this summer
to put this in perspective one rouble was worth a little more than one dollar
not low enough cracks whip
how is it possible that while the rouble traded in the years prior to the invasion between it went to after the invasion but then last summer it was even at so last summer it was at it s strongest within the past years in the middle of all the sanctions
for those who s interested go look roubles to usd chart for the last years this article is a bit escalated
it spiked then dropped hard but its completly recovered strange article and comments
awww is someone running out of the ability to prop up their economy
can we buy russian oil in rubles
shoot china is going to come in soon and take some of tgat sweet sweet timber land in siberia
it s falling so quickly the gamestop bros are looking to prop it up to harm the capitalists
this is despite the fact russia s interest rate is like in the 20s lol putin is running out of money to prop it up
kamikaze economic strategy
how many bees is that worth
good thing china is adding roubles to their reserves a real win win situation they ve cooked up
you could say theyre in trouble
what s it worth in schrute bucks
trump would never have allowed this to happen just waiting for him to say this
this is good manufacturing will move from all over the world to russia now for its low cost of operations s lol
it s back down to where it was in it crashed down to ruble usd after the invasion and went up to imagination land after russia clamped down on its financial markets nobody knows what s really going on there not even the russians since everyone lies i hope it ll free fall
just wait give it some more time its going to look like the fall of the ussr people are going to end up using wheelbarrows of cash to buy a loaf of bread
i was told by the financial experts in the bitcoin and forex sphere that the us dollar is done as a reserve currency because russia and brazil were switching to the yuan
how soon until they have to re name their currency to the rubble
this is called negative growth
make the only option moving forward for the russian people to kill putin
russin ruble surpasses the value of the russian rouble
how many schrute bucks can i get for it
i was alive to see robux surpass the rouble in value
lowest level yet meanwhile norwegians are laughing all the way to the bank having brought massive gas reserves on line and selling to europe buh buh rouble
eurodollar baby the need usd at the end of the day to pay debts and new growth
good i welcome any and all bad news happening to ruzzia
hey look it s finally down back to pre war levels now absolutely embarrassing i say lol
meh i m argentina we re at pesos per dollar and it will explode soon it ll be pesos per dollar before
good to know that in case people lose their minds and start hoarding toilet paper again we always have roubles
zimbabwean roubles
so it s official putin has turned his currency into toilet paper
so around per yuan i guess that s the more relevant exchange rate these days
i thought everything was fine and russian finances very strong
conversion for the americans in the comments dollar is equivalent to roubles
good is there a further way to crush it
don t worry i m guessing india will just bankroll all of russias wars india loves that new cheap oil source god only knows what china is exploiting
hows that war goin son are you winnin
can we u s buy general products and things from russia or is general trade blocked
why it isn t worthless is beyond me
so like could i hypothetically go to russia and buy a ps5 for around
good fuck russia
lowest so far
but it s pretty much the same as the day they invaded ukraine title is misleading it was worth then and now it s and before you comment on how low is japanese yen is today conversion rate is not everything
unfortunately it seems to have since recovered much of its value lost when they invaded ukraine
yet lowest leverl yet
as someone must have pointed out it doesn t mean much the exchange rate of rubble is artificially set by ruzzian central bank it is not a reflection of its true value which could be around for all i care
not even as bad as the japanese yen and they are one of the worlds major financial hubs not saying they don t deserve to be razzed but choose better points
stares in zimbabwean
the trick was to take a massive loan in local currency just before it started never let a good crisis go to waste
can you do a reverse split on a currency
to the moon
damn that is basically doubling every months
cause of death self inflicted gunshot wound to the pocketbook
i wonder how our country gonna survive this its devastating
rouble further down the shitter and finland in nato i remain a master strategist
but i was assured by so many two day old firstname_randomnumber accounts that the ruble was in great shape and that trying to sanction the russian economy was pointless surely they weren t just pumping out bullshit for useful idiots
the dimensions of pu tin s chess set only gets greater and greater just like the losses of his military
nonono hear me out any day now the petrodollar is going to be substituted by the ruble yuan and then the us economy is going to crash putin will distribute free unicorns to all citizens after they reach kyiv in days do your research
everyone in russia loses except putin and his inner circle they simply don t care
person injured by shrapnel this is the biggest rocket barrage in years from lebanon netanyahu is assembling the security cabinet if things keep heating up israel might have to respond which could lead to another conflict operation in the region
why lebanon is already suffering hugely on an economic level this can t be an official action by lebanon right that would be suicide
as if the people of lebanon don t have enough problems already so fucking stupid
when was the last time from lebanon fired i cannot even remember
this is a huge escalation an attack of this scale is bound to face a powerful response this will have huge consequences i can only hope that this isn t the beggining of a new war in lebanon
hezbollah denying involvement idf saying was hamas in lebanon
iran again
pretty crazy how everyone on reddit thinks they re an expert in middle eastern conflict and speaks so matter of fact about everything
during the passover holiday
each rocket is a political advertisement for increasingly far right politicians with more hostile foreign policy
from lebanon the geographic region it s from iran
lebanon fucked up they are in no shape to start a war with israel dumb asf
like clockwork every year this time
more rockets were just launched from lebanon into israel
likely a palestinian group in lebanon i wonder if the israelis will respond in their usual way of artillery fire targeting empty fields
can you imagine the global outcry if this was happening in the us or many places across the world
thanks iran and israelis are supposed to suck this up
don t worry those are anti zionist rockets not anti semitic reddit could live another day
isn t the un organization unifil meant to keep the peace and prevent the transportation and assembly of rockets in south lebanon does unifil do anything productive
without reading the comments i am willing to bet that at least one fucker has already said it s just in retaliation over al aqsa as if sending in police to clear riots in a mosque justifies firing rockets at civilians
crazy how that region probably hasn t seen peace for longer than a few years since the stone age
fireworks are a favorite past time of a most peaceful and joyous people
during passover too definitely trying to send a message
side note i learned that when the sirens go off rocket attack young children in border villages mostly farmers are taught to put their arms up in the air as everyone scrambles to find a bomb shelter adults grab children s arms and carry them to a shelter doesn t matter if you know the kid or not you see arms you grab them i can t imagine teaching my kid that and having to shelter often
lebanon can barely wipe its own ass but have money for this tomfoolery that achieves nothing
another hezballah fundraising drive start a war with israel to get more money from iran only costs a bunch of lebanese lives
more rockets of peace trying to enter isreal how will we find a way to blame isreal
i am in israel visiting from america and heard about this for the first time now
why would lebanon do this this will only help netanyahu
tough day for us celebrating passover and enjoying life
i live in the us and i can t imagine having two separate volley of rocket attacks from two separate countries as a response to religious groups trying to worship their god s where they please religion is a hell of a drug no good parties in this scenario however this may be unpopular with those who are pro palestine anti israeli israel has a right to fire back when being attacked by volleys of rockets and by polls the large majority of people agree
israel is going to hit back hard
who in lebanon are launching those missiles
i was vacationing with my family in the north and we witnessed the iron dome launches pretty much right in front of us crazy shit the explosions were very loud as well we cut the vacation short and drove back as there weren t any shelters around us and we don t wanna risk being stuck there if more launches happen during night time
why does lebanon hezbolah attack isreal with so few weapons with zero tactical advantage only to provoke a response
and instantly every redditor has a phd in international relations
these groups are most violent after their friday prayers or during one their religious holidays
hezbollah not surprised
prophecy is coming true and no one talks about that
all dem countries who be bombin israel need to realise israel is just wayy to strong of a country to wage a war at they can destroy lebanon
the lebanese people don t want or need this this was done by palestinian militants from within lebanon there are displaced palestinians living in refugee camps in lebanon that cannot return to israel and are stuck in lebanon they cause all kinds of crimes and problems and the lebanese military is not even allowed to step foot into these camps it is a massive problem for lebanon
freepalestine
freepalestine
i bet they put a bunch of year olds out as a meat shield
why is israel so aggressive towards their neighbors because they just wanna be left alone but they be doing this shit ofc they gunna be on edge
and the arabs complain whenever israel does anything to protect themselves are they so stupid that they d think is real wouldn t retaliate
lebanon just stepped into it big time
i hope we can all agree that no matter how we feel about the israeli government attacking civilians with rockets is beyond the pale i hope that instead of doing whataboutism and making excuses for this we can strongly condemn the rocket fire and accept without complaint that israel has a right to respond will israel s response be disproportionate maybe did i wish this could have happened when an actual terrorist like ben gvir wasn t in the governing coalition of course do i wish lebanese civilians wouldn t get caught up in what is likely to come one thousand percent nonetheless israel is not the initial aggressor here we must accept that israel like all nations has a right to self defense and we must hope that all civilians come out of this blowup relatively unscathed
when will they learn now israel will have to go kill even more kids and beat the elderly in the mosques they just dont have a choice s
lebanon having literally destroyed their own country now start shit with their southern neighbors to distract their population from the real problems
is there not enough war going on
they are trying again after losing every single time smart
here for the people defending lebanon for killing innocent people
the world is cracking up
it s almost like it was a bad idea after world war two to literally steal land from sovereign nations transplant a group of people with drastically different ideologies and then arm them with nuclear weapons
poor lebanon
netting yahoo is under pressure in domestic politics so has manufactured an assault from lebanon to take the focus off is troubles a true dictator in the making
imagine if a giant asteroid were detected headed straight for earth with nothing we could do about it imagine how all our conflicts would disintegrate into trivialities and suddenly we would realize our place in the grand scheme of things all the hatred would be moot and all the bloodshed over temporary ownership of specs of land on a cosmic grain of dust would suddenly seem unimportant briefly for the very first time in human history we would cease our meaningless bloodshed
and they have no one to blame but themselves after they abandoned the prowest south lebanon army in that provided an all important buffer zone
no way this is a distraction from all the political stuff going on i m sure
netanyahu quick pass the judicial reforms i ll save everyone next week s article israel s protesters under attack by ben gvir s praetorian orthodox guard
the bbc will only report this when israel fires back
pray for the peace of israel
time for israel to cry wolf and force the us to send them money
nothing can defeat israel
fuck israel buch of fucking war criminals
just like clock work for ole netanyahu rile up regional sects some rockets get lobbed israel gets another war to test weapons on various groups rinse and repeat
shit like that makes me a zionist
by god if lebanon or more correctly hezbollah wants to start the 3rd lebanese israeli war we will return them to the stone age
interesting nobody is speaking about why they attacked
to be fair israel treats the palestinians like shit and have forced them into a hopeless situation i hope palestinians get their freedom soon
israel should fuck them up
on a holy thursday damn
a bit over a month ago i was sleeping about miles from the border i heard them firing guns and blowing shit up every night
more fighting in middle east yawn
convenient timing for netanyahu
bibi creating more excuse to keep himself in power
it was a peaceful protest
the reddit pros back at predicting everything in their stinky ass apartment
they love that rock
i thought lebanon was over all this shit and knew better
i guess lebanon is having some internal issues and trying to distract their population
oh fuck off but you won t talk about what you ve been doing to the people of palestine lately or for this long
probably due to them first bombing syria this week just a thought its never ending isnt it
israel is already in war with its own citizen anyway
more than artillery shells were fired into lebanon by idf in response to the rocket barrage
direct hit in israeli town a bank was damaged by sharpnel and some small warehouse got hit and is burning firefighters trying to put out the fire there s some videos in r combatfootage you can check out of the iron dome intercepting some of the rockets right now numbers suggest rockets were fired in total
that s certainly what the guys who fired the rockets are hoping for
never too broke for missiles
number of rockets fire is being said to have been around rockets in total israeli ministers are talking about a harsh response unknown what final decision will be gov is full of extreme right wing people so they talk a lot in the end bibi and the idf chief of staff will make the final decision but towns near lebanon have opened all their shelters and are preparing for war situation
it s becoming a yearly routine since every may we have an operation including rockets aimed to tel aviv s area i hate to say it but the last year really made me tired of living here
this would be the 4th time israel invaded lebanon in my lifetime if it occurs i saw a poll one day of countries with negative opinion of israel and lebanon was the highest one palestine didn t count as a country in the poll higher than syria saudi arabia iraq or iran its was more than and across all faiths shia sunni druze maronite christian assyrian christian and so on
which could lead to another conflict operation in the region yes a perfect distraction to stop the protests in israel
this never ends seems like it has been going on for as long as i can remember
removed
is it sad or amusing that the injured person is an arab himself https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uiiv-dsaqa0 hamas s violence knows no bounds
i see no one seems to have posted why these attacks are happening idf attacked people inside the al aqsa mosque a few days ago https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/israel-al-aqsa-mosque-rocket-sirens-around-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/israel-al-aqsa-mosque-rocket-sirens-around-gaza) this was an obvious ploy by netanyahu to provoke them and allow him to get more support within isreal
insh allah
person injured by shrapnel this is the biggest rocket barrage in years from lebanon really shows the power balance there best the terrorists can do is injure one person
every aspiring fascist state needs a good ole scapegoat to blame oppress and ultimately conduct crimes against humanity against
i thank pure chance everyday i wasn t born in a country like russia
nope not a fascist government no sir russia is a free country everything is perfect if you disagree you are a cia agent and will spend your life in prison have fun
must be pretty embarrassing for russia that everyone can see how scared they are of gay people
ah yes the gays well known for destroying societies from within as opposed to crazy authoritarians who always craft well ordered societies where everybody is wealthy and happy
hahaha look i live there pls help
oh look russia has become nazi germany the very enemy they fought against so long ago
is it hard to exit russia why would lgbt people stay in there if they know they ll get arrested if it ever gets out
i get that everybody is mad at russia but it s pretty fucking bold to run an lgtbq youtube channel when russia literally has state sanctioned gay concentration camps and has for years lol
that s what homophobes everywhere want all the propaganda and shoving down our throats is just code for all that gay shit they just want us gone
poor excuse for a government
any questions about why the gop suddenly loves russia it s the fascism you have desantis saying that the gop are fighting the democrats who are nazis exactly what russia says about all of their enemies while implementing fascist nazi social restrictions
gay propaganda is just so ridiculous on the face of it like there s a large concerted effort by some shadowy gay cabal with some kind of unified gay agenda other than being allowed to exist in peace
it s amazing to me how in line our present day gop is in line with the ideology of russia on social issues in the era of reagan they were so adamant about the dangers of russia better dead than red
here s my obligatory message to us folks trying to say republicans are taking notes us conservatives don t need inspiration or notes because they ve been doing the same basic shit they re doing now for many decades longer than a lot of us on this website have been alive if you re too young to know firsthand and haven t learned that yet bless your heart if you were too young to have paid attention to some of the things that happened in your childhood it s okay the point is that blaming russia for fomenting these sentiments erases the work done in front of your faces and behind the scenes by conservative groups in the us for a long time our community being called groomers https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1096623939/accusations-grooming-political-attack-homophobic-origins) isn t new trying to ban content related to lgbtq people https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/in-some-states-versions-of-dont-say-gay-bills-have-been-around-for-awhile) isn t new banning restricting cross dressing beyond just drag https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/arresting-dress-timeline-anti-cross-dressing-laws-u-s) isn t new and some of the groups funding lobbying advocacy and legal efforts behind these recent laws beyond the ones related to the lgbtq community have been heavy hitters working to advance their conservative christian ideology for decades examples include the alliance defending freedom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_defending_freedom), formed in the s the family research council https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_research_council), formed in the s focus on the family https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/focus_on_the_family), formed in the late s the american college of pediatricians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_college_of_pediatricians), founded in the early s the heritage foundation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_heritage_foundation), founded in the early s and the eagle forum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eagle_forum), founded in the early s so i reiterate if you blame russia for what s going on now you minimize the work our own people have been doing long before the election i know a lot of it comes from not knowing any better so let this be your crash course on some of the things us conservative groups have been doing in the us and also abroad if you look up some of the groups i mentioned they have international operations that have played contributing roles i say contributing because i don t want to erase the agency of the governments involved in the making of their laws in things like the current uganda law making gay sex punishable with a life sentence https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/uganda-anti-lgbtq-bill-rcna76630), and a few people even had their hands in anti lgbtq policies in russia https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-us-evangelicals-fueled-rise-russias-pro-family-right/). edit attached links to the heritage foundation and eagle forum
russian lgbtq can request political asylum in the us and christians in the us can request asylum in russia
desantis s dream
this is what republicans want in the us
don t go near any high windows
putin s russia where gay propaganda is punished with a stay in a siberian prison while war criminals get medals
they really care and want to dictate what people do with their genitals
i guess moscow has gone all the way with don t say gay a favorite of fascists world wide i bet disantis mouth is watering
isn t it odd how republicans target lgbtq folks the same way russia does
the wording gay propaganda implies a mindset thinking being gay is contagious and a bad thing what an emotionally fragile state wow
well it s russia so that was expected
this makes it easier to understand why the gop loves russia so much it s envy
arresting people on charges of gay propaganda seems pretty gay to me
russia s leaders are severely mentally ill if this is what drives them
i laugh at people who say russia is being bullied by the west when i see the oppression that they attempt to oppress people with
russia is so fucking disgusting holy shit
but then there are some dudes on reddit claiming that russia isn t homophobic because they have gay clubs in st petersburg
do people in this world not realize there s over species on planet earth that engage in homosexuality or are people really ignorant and self serving to actually believe it s a homo sapien creation
russia becoming 8chan and building up to
gop taking notes
you know with the drafting the outlawing of lgbt people and the migration of many russians to neighbouring states at the start of the invasion id be fascinated to see how big russias population is part of putins whole rationale for the annexation and invasion of ukraine was a part of a solution to russias depopulation surely it has only furthered this
wow russia is really batting a thousand with just about everything these days huh how many human rights violations can a country commit before it isolates itself from participating in the rest of the world forever i guess they re trying to find out
perhaps we should begin a program to help republicans emigrate to russia
oh look at that another thing republicans nazis north korea middle east and russians have in common
it s so weird there is so much gay porn that comes out of russia
how did it take them this long to get arrested hasn t russia had anti gay laws for a while
why would you not have left that country by now
backwards fuckwits
me every conservative government shit things are going poorly at home quick let s find some minority to persecute to blame it on and distract the plebs
someone should tell them that homophobia is super gay
this is what christian nationalist and far right types want by the way
in years this will be happening in america at the rate things are backsliding for lgbt rights they are going to have to go so far back into the closet they gonna end up having to push for lgbt rights in narnia really feel bad for my lgbt friends
i like how quickly people point it out when it s a gay youtuber but not the thousands of people before who ve been thrown in prison just for speaking against the government
this the so similar to what conservatives in the us are doing to trans people
is the alliance defending freedom a front for russia or is russia a front for the adf
this is why the likes of mtg and bobo the clown love putin s russia so much it s what they aspire to
tennessee would be proud
so much is going on in the usa with lgbtq laws being passed it s scary how much power governments have over our bodies and what we do with them
be mother russia doesn t have gay people just ask putin
you could replace russia with florida or tennessee and i wouldn t be surprised
this may be coming to a home near you very soon the cult has been conditioned to love putin fox pumped them up years ago to con them into loving a vicious dictator rump s beautiful brilliant buddy could knock him off faster than he can type defund the police they hate me
america desperately following steps
next rule russians are only allowed to marry the person they hate most
corporatism patriarchy superficial hypocritical version of christianity praying publicly but very anti poor hateful and promiscuous behind close doors for heterosexuals only homophobia no wonder the gop wants to sabotage support of ukraine they want russia to win and rise to a great power so their s values gain validity again
any gay russians wanna marry me for a green card my employer hires a lot of russian ex pats so i can probably get you a job too
ukraine is going to keep pushing past their own border and de nazify russia
currying favor with the far right everywhere on brand for putler
this is why many in the gop side with putin
and we wonder why magats are cheering russia on
russia is fucking joke
dude i m gay and i live in china this sucks dude i m gay and i live in georgia this sucks i know let s move to russia i honestly feel bad for them but why would you move to a country that has laws against lgbt people existing and then post videos of your lgbt life why didn t they choose an actual civilized country instead of a fascist one fuck putin and his fanatics btw
yes they should only do very straight propaganda like riding a horse shirtless for a photo shoot to show your saggy man boobs
us republicans taking notes
wonder if bud light is sold in russia
damn
that s disturbing
i hope putin gets a really cold shower that he can t heat up
lol maybe they should not be doing things that generate bad pr right now its like a bad comic book villain that just doesn t learn from its mistakes it would be hilarious if it wasn t costing so many their lives
this is why american republicans like russia
removed
the russia nhl players look pretty rational now
terrible putin at work behind the scene again war criminal that doesn t have much open mindedness for a guy that is suppose to be well educated a genius according to mike pompeo and djtrump
i bet the barbaric republican party is taking notes and figuring out how to implement this in the us
ukraine better invade because they are acting like nazis
coming to a republican state soon no wonder they are obsessed with russia it is either they have dirt on them they are corrupt or they truly agree with their ideologies or some combination of the three
every time i think that they ve hit rock bottom and cannot possibly get any worse they get worse
coming to a gqp state near you
they literally announced months ago that they where going to start doing this why the hell would they stay in that country
holy shit there are so many people saying gop taking notes you understand you re being influenced by disinformation farms right take a small grain of truth a portion of the religious gop is extremely against the lgbtq but now it s a fact that gop they hate anyone not cis are you serious really you think everyone in the gop is like that it s not true wake the fuck up friends our enemies know when we are divided they can chip away at our country there are places in the world that will hang you for being gay this isn t one of them
i wish this was surprising but sadly it s not
considering i have two friends in russia who i constantly fear for and who both are lgbtq this makes me fear for them even more bonus that one of them has a husband who is pro kremlin unlike her secretly and the other has actually done a few things to act against them making me add to the worry so this makes me hope even more that either russia itself or nato puts a end to putin s madness and who wants to bet these two will be secretly yanked from prison given rusty shovels and thready fatigues and ordered at gunpoint to charge in a random direction while yelling a fake battle cry until a ukrainian machine gun nest installs air conditioning into their stomachs while the public is told they disappeared
we need a modern thebes which nation gets a unit of ultra badass all gay commandos
republicans are swooning for daddy pooty again
and tucker will probably be singing their praises tonight
gop scribbles furiously
gop taking notes
this is where maga world is headed in the us
they are trying to gain more favor with the christofascists of the trumpy maga qanon cult that s ruining the lives of american people
interestingly enough this isn t too different from how the us treats trans people
desantis is putin putin is desantis
i bet stuff like this is why republicans are so pro russia these days
thank god now russia is safe s
how dumb do you have to be to live in russia and post a video criticizing propaganda laws unless they knew the consequences and did it anyway in which case then props to them huge balls
russia is doing this so it can get some additional swaps from the west
gop collectively blow a load on the back of their underaged pool boys in celebration
russian government is quickly turning into the gop
this is the best tl dr i could make original https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/04/05/poland-cancels-world-cup-fencing-event-over-admission-of-russians-and-belarusians/) reduced by i m a bot poland has cancelled a women s foil world cup event it was set to host later this month after the international fencing federation rejected proposed restrictions on russian and belarusian competitors the psz wanted russians and belarusians to also sign a declaration that quot they do not support the war in ukraine which is a flagrant violation of international law and international treaties quot and quot are not associated with the regime of vladimir putin against whom the icc has issued an arrest warrant quot in votes held last month the fie s members chose to allow russians and belarusians to return to the sport extended summary http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/12dglzz/poland_cancels_world_cup_fencing_event_over/) faq http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ version tl drs so far feedback http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr pm s and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords fie russian belarusian fencing allow
bravo poland has stepped up in spectacular historical ways well done
what would be hilarious is if they allowed the tournament to happen but just denied entry to russian and belarusian passports make it glaringly obvious when there s parts of the bracket missing
good terrorists and their supporters should not be left to mingle and participate in official events just like isis will never be allowed to do the same there is really no significant difference between theese two
now boycott the olympics no country that s committing war crimes get to compete bravo poland for taking a stand ruzzia must be defeated
i think this story sums up the polish responses as a whole in polish mercenary rafal ganowicz was asked what it felt like to take human life i wouldn t know i ve only ever killed communists get fucked russia
that s the right thing to do russian and belarusian athletes could ve signed the declaration that they do not support the war but they decided not to besides almost half of russia s medals at the tokyo olympics have been won by soldiers police source https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/334095-tokyo-olympics-military-soldiers)). some russian olympians wore the nationalist z a symbol of support for russia s invasion of ukraine on stage at a pro war rally organized by putin while ukrainians were massacred in bucha amongst other places source https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120716/putin-holds-rally-at-luzhniki-stadium)). some even wore the z during competitions source https://twitter.com/rwesthead/status/1500169855198281729)). a demand to distance themselves from putin s regime seems reasonable given the circumstances
the best way to hurt all these sports organizations federations that refuse to block russian and belarus athletes from participating and i mean the ones that don t want to condemn russias fascist gov for invading ukraine is to hit them where it hurts the most aim for the sponsors put the sponsors on the spotlight shame them everywhere it s possible also ban gazprom and any other russian state owned sponsor ads from stadiums and other sports event blurr that crap out during broadcasts whatever just hit them where it hurts money every sponsor and every tv and online sports network and channel
the fie had proposed allowing russian and belarusians to compete under a neutral flag and as long as they are not linked to the aggression against ukraine but the psz wanted russians and belarusians to also sign a declaration that they do not support the war in ukraine which is a flagrant violation of international law and international treaties and are not associated with the regime of vladimir putin against whom the icc has issued an arrest warrant that led to an angry response from russia s fencing federation whose president ilgar mammadov called it a provocation and violation of human rights
poland got some big balls i definitely see poland with a different eye then before good stuff poland bravo we don t like them russian kurvas
good on you poland a country with convictions
why not have the event but ban these countries
many thanks to polish government and people
i love poland
every world class sports event should ban countries like them event though it hurts the athletes just play for another country by moving or change citizenship
removed
more people need to take a stand against authoritarian regimes and make it understood they are not acceptable in modern society
love poland and there stance against genocidal invaders
good consequences are long overdue the russian federation chose to behave as a bandit kingdom violating article of the un charter and the consequences are to lose privileges as members of international civilization
the real shame is for all the non russian athletes who have no agency in this and are punished equally however i imagine this event will probably just be relocated my guess would be to hungary
russia needs new leaders too

france also cancelled a mens competition last week
checking the links of such persons with aggression u s china france and uk are in shambles
i don t remember america being punished by the olympic committee for invading and occupying iraq or afghanistan when neither country had anything to do with the terrorists they harbored very silly turn of events and also easy to see how the global authority comes from a very specific part of the world
these are smallish things and i am really impressed they are happening it s actually easier to do the big things with small things like this you get so much push back over it doesn t matter either the people doing this are totally solid and can brush off this push back or there is little push back because a lot of people feel it does matter both are excellent signs
why cancel it why does every one else has to suffer just don t let those fuckers compete
they prefer to stab their russians on the battlefield based
asking the athletes to sign a statement _that will get them arrested the moment they go home_ isn t brave and it seems to very much miss one of the points of world sport events to bring _people_ not political representatives from different sides of various disputes into a common venue where they can interact in a different way and remind each other and the world that there are normal people on all sides of these disagreements that pay the price of their governments actions in different ways just ban competitors that won t sign a document that says they have no connections to the government or the military will russia try to hide a competitors background to allow them to attend probably but let them let them be forced to lie and say someone isn t part of the problem when it comes out they will be embarrassed twice once because they got caught and a second time because they lied and claimed someone connected to their war machine wasn t tacitly admitting its actions are internationally embarrassing and unacceptable
doesn t mean they are bad people just means they are of a different nationality don t make them badd
sign a declaration that would get them killed back home so the russian people are the enemy now as well huh i mean it makes sense i feel the same about the russian people now as i do about the americans during the iraq and afghanistan invasion complicit
it s sad how acceptable xenophobia has become in the west we re told to accept anything and anyone unless they re from a country we don t like then discrimination is apparently totally fine imagine if other countries treated all americans like pariah s because of their government s actions abroad
gotta love these kinds of performative actions that very famously hurt the government and not just the people living under that government
international fencing federation fie rejected proposed restrictions on russian and belarusian competitors there s no reason to cancel the whole thing just do it except without them great fie isn t invited either i don t understand the problem
eh i don t know precedent was set when nazi germany hosted the olympic games we need to have the integrity to follow through with this
weird how no one was calling for the banning of american athletes for their government s war crimes
i still don t understand the point with these charades
i m a bit uncertain of what the point of isolating russia like this is i guess the idea is to weaken russia as a nation but it will also make the people and the leaders more afraid so is this overall a good thing
so russian athletes et al are now cancelled does this apply to russian citizens now too
disgusting move by poland
removed
holly cow way to go poland this is how you stay united and strong
poland has stepped up big time since russia invaded ukraine
idk it seems kinda cowardly of poland to run away from a duel and just giving the russians a free win
should be noted that they re following in the footsteps of france who did the same last week https://apnews.com/article/fencing-france-russia-ukraine-2821983e726628c8bbf21e1eb8dd8c76
how can someone who loves in russia sign something saying they don t support their president and go back home and not expect repercussions even if they don t support him they are placing these athletes between a rock and a hard place
as they have done in the past it was their brilliant code breakers that saved europe in wwii and we thanked them by letting them be occupied by the soviets for years
russia s neighbors know them best
years are hard to forget and forgive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions\_of\_poland
yep my respect towards poland have increased exponentially during the ruzzias attack on ukraine
now wait for the twitter mob to discount all that poland does because poland also upset some people
yeah their underminding of the rule of law oppression of lgbt whatever oppression of women and so on and so forth is really worthy of praise poland is lucky that their facist tendencies are being overshadowed by an even bigger evil the hero worship of glorious poland scares the hell out of me its growing darkness will just turn into another ultra nationalistic facist tumor upon europe after the dust of the current war settles with some luck the current affairs will at least break the anti democratic alliance between poland and hungary but i doubt it
poland has no love for russia in fact it must understand more than most if not all other countries what danger russia poses to them and then the rest of europe and from there the us russia it topples ukraine poland has also experienced what ukraine is currently experiencing from russia russia today is the same as russia under stalin a hero of putin and has russia ever played nicely with others ever
so punishing normal athletes who have nothing to do with the war and ruin their lives just because of where they were born is spectacular
i suspect the polish fencing association doesn t have the power to control entry into the country
read the article
first i am totally on board with this because participants are representing their counties but being in isis is more of a choice than being born in russia or belarus so i can t say they are totally the same when talking about all russian and belarusian citizens
exactly and if they had any guts they d do the same with america genocide or sporting events pick one cause you can t have both
the average russian or belarussian is not a terrorist that s like saying a subsistence farmer from iraq is a terrorist edit i m as against the atrocities in ukraine as anyone just trying to understand the reasoning behind this
i can t wait for fifa to fully endorse russian and belarusian teams because money
no country that s committing war crimes get to compete oh boy you re not going to like who is on that list
poland is actively organising coalition of countries to ban olympics together in protest of allowing russia it s a big thing in polish news since a few weeks but i guess it gotta get more traction and more members on board before the news get global as far as i remember around countries backed it as of today
no country that s committing war crimes get to compete fuck there goes the g20 participants as well as poland post wwii ethnic cleansing of ukrainians germans and lemkos absolutely understand the anger and russia and belarus can be reasonably argued as not deserving to partake but we probably should err away from language that pretends the rest have clean hands if war crimes and crimes against humanity disqualified you permanently from international sport there wouldn t be international sport to any great extent
i agree let not allow north korea isreal and the us then
that s a pretty distasteful quote imo
deleted
to be fair the russian athletes all would have been defenestrated if they had signed any such declaration
their military ranking is strictly ceremonial
besides almost half of russia s medals at the tokyo olympics have been won by soldiers police this may look bad but it s actually normal in sports many countries employ athletes in the armed forces it s an easy way to get an extra source of money for professional sports and to give steady employment to people who can t really do any other work while competing at the highest international level it s the same in poland lots of our olympic athletes are soldiers
i don t disagree with what you re saying but signing that declaration would land them in jail in russia so not that surprising whether or not they support the war
i m sure there d be no consequences for the athlete if they signed something and were then used as a global tool to criticize putin using his own athletes
fencing isn t widely televised this would also likely hurt the tournament organizers
poland has a distinctive history invaded and split up for a long time by russia prussia and austria but the people kept it alive it had the first constitution in europe it allowed all people regardless of race or religion to settle it s why it had of the world s jews they weren t allowed anywhere else
they might not be allowed to a lot of international sports competitions come with contracts that say you can t discriminate against any nationality for example imagine how many middle eastern countries would want to ban israeli athletes from competing so a lot of them have neutrality clauses that say you either accept everyone or you don t have the tournament at all
international fencing org you can t restrict russian and belarussian competitors polish fencing org you can t force us to hold the event
i mean i am all for sanctions against russia and whole shebang but calling regular russian people biowaste is way out of pocket quite a lot of them didnt ask for this war
deleted
have you been waiting all these years until you had acceptable targets for disgusting speech like this
yep from the article sport pl reports that the world cup event which was due to take place in the city of pozna from to april is now likely to be moved to tunis in tunisia
only of those countries have participated in an invasion of another country in the past years there s a clear odd one out
whatabout whatabout whatabout
oh yeah obviously the reason for this decision is xenophobia not the fact that russia is currently attacking ukraine with belarusian assistance right s
i agree if this wasn t mass genocide they re part of the problem
because it s a combat sport they likely need the federation for its insurance and licensing
not that i m not agreeing with you but just clarifying when berlin made the bid to host the olympics in it was still the weimar republic and hitler wouldn t come to power for another years by the time of the vote only barcelona and berlin were still contenders and by then the spanish republic was only months old and would dissolve about years later with the spanish civil war so to start with two bad options but the newness of the spanish government would have really influenced the vote no one really expected hitler to come to serious power at that time when hitler s regime came to power the ioc did consider moving the games to rome but hitler assured the committee that jews would be allowed to compete in general and specifically on a german team if it sounds familiar that countries continue to promise the ioc they ll play by the rules and then don t it s because the ioc has a history of failing to commit to consequences and then of course the bribing doesn t help
germany hosted before wwii and before we knew about the camps not really precedent
just because a precedent exists doesn t mean it s a good precedent worthy of emulation
yup luckily we won t make the same mistake twice iraq was such a mistake but if we come together we can try to make sure it doesn t happen again sadly russia was too weak to stop the iraq war
it s to deny the russian government the chance to make propaganda with their athlethes
and you probably never will
russia must suffer and pay consequences that dwarf any possible gains from its wars of choice the russian people must feel the pain to the extent that they oppose this type of russia
it s to deprive putin of one of his many propaganda tools which he has used many times before to domestically garner support for his international crimes russian athletes are not independent they are tools funded and used by the state not to mention supported by fsb operatives in systematic doping programs this is long overdue we should have learned this lesson years ago
no the point is to tell them to their face to stop their bullshit and fuck off back home or the isolation will intensify they can always just again _fuck off back home_ if they cared so much about being isolated
how exactly
should make things interesting for the olympics next year let me check who is the host oh paris
and denmark who also canccel theirs days ago https://sport.tv2.dk/faegtning/2023-03-30-dansk-forbund-aflyser-staevne-grundet-russisk-deltagelse
yeah and even before france refused i don t think anyone in their right minds would ve thought the poles would let the russians and belarusians compete in their country it s kinda funny though damn fie read the fucking room will ya
hell look at what happened to allan turing the thanks he got for breaking the enigma code was chemical castration and hormone therapy until he killed himself
yeah a lot of people know about alan turing bletchley park and enigma not as many know about the bombe biuro szyfrow and marian rejewski
considering france and uk entered to war in order to save poland from being destroyed it is really hard to call the allies the victors when the other invader of poles got to keep it all
a father thrown in jail and his child having her world turned upside down because she drew a picture asking for a better world the only conclusion i can come to is that russia under putin has become a fascist state this is the sort of thing the nazis did
this is just horrible not surprising at all though which makes it even more horrible
this is a great example of the difference between crime and morality
a reminder that putin states that lgbtq propaganda will destroy families while his regime destroys families
what a literal joke of a country
i m getting nostalgic stalin vibes from this story
the future that right wingers want did your kid make a woke drawing you straight to jail child straight to orphanage
that reminds me of the time that american kid was dropped off to the cop shop for drawing a swastika quick lesson kids don t try to be different from the crowd you are with
she was too busy pulling a matrix on russian missiles
removed
letting a mother take custody of her biological daughter holy shit what will those dastardly russians think of next
why is this news surely there are more significant things happening
this is the type of thing that happens in dictatorships russia has never not been one
russia under putin has become a fascist state it has always been
always been fascist
i don t know if the nazis incarcerated parents for drawings of their kids they did get the kids to snitch on their parents and then got then into jail but i don t remember if this kind of bridge thinking got parents jailed for things their kids did in the third reich meaning that modern day russia is a lot sterner in their playbook than the fucking nazis given that i didn t misremember which could be likely
the only conclusion i can come to is that russia under putin has become a fascist state this is the sort of thing the nazis did was it nice under that rock where you lived for so long
so he s doing pretty much what red states in the us are doing and they wonder why we woke libs refer to them as traitors
a child was taken from their parents for posting a meme on snapchat in florida this week the parent the women who ran against ron defacist
are you saying none of this actually happened if so you should take that to the news with proof and make a million dollars or so russiatv will be glad to have you on
thank goodness we have a credible expert like you to set the record straight
you get this has been covered by russian state media because this is a warning to other russians to make sure they don t speak out against the war right it s to make sure everyone is scared at what happened here and so that even kids know not to draw pictures or speak out in any other way this article is literally just repeating what the russian government is proudly announcing it did it s kind of ironic that you re right in that this story is propaganda but its propaganda for russia to use against its own citizens
well considering the year old didn t have a guardian after they they arrested the father for allowing her to drew a sketch at school in support of ukraine also we are talking about an estranged biological mother so it may not be the best home environment for a year old hopefully not but she was estranged for a reason
they put her dad in jail because she drew an anti war picture try harder tankie scum
a slugbrained tankie spewing bullshit holy shit what will those dastardly r shitliberalssay users think of next
lmao is that your best attempt to summarize what happened
the fact that putin did this put a girl in an orphanage for drawing an anti war poster is funny because he s taking a page from trump s playbook trump invented putting children in orphanages with his border policies putin is following the lead of that old wannabe mafioso real estate shyster from florida how humiliating for him
well genocide is pretty important
surely it is possible to be concerned about more than one thing
yes and no to some people this is very important to others not so much i think it s important
why don t you just go read what you deem significant this news is significant to me as it shows how serious things are in russia and how people children included are being silenced and punished for speaking up and this war has affected the world so it belongs here how do you determine if some news is significant or not anyway if it directly affects you then it would be very insignificant to me if it directly affects the entire world then nothing really qualifies barred ww3
there are lots of things there are also lots of writers and publications
please give a list of what you would like to be informed about and what you don t want to know
i m sure you d think it was significant if it was you in prison and your daughter taken from your custody
probably so how many news stories do you figure we should allow to be reported simultaneously maybe the top important ones s
thinking about it you are right they went from a monarchy to autocracy stalin even made a pact with hitler
i think if a kid s drawing exposed his parents jewloving the outcome would be similar
putin had republican senators coming to his palace on thanksgiving for secret conversations
i m confident her estranged mother will provide a better home environment than a russian orphanage this feels like a total non story that s being blown up for propaganda points
they did have those few years with drunk puppet boris jeltsin but everyone knows that was just them needing time to divvy up the assets after the revolution the fall of the wall was just theater very sad but very true
stalin even made a pact with hitler only after britain and france declined to form an anti fascist alliance with the ussr
gee i wonder how she ended up in the orphanage in the first place

oh hey russian agitprop cool
this is a it of a red herring as the soviet union took up overtures from nazi germany on treaty negotiations while negotiations with france and britain were still ongoing several conditions the soviet union demanded of the western allies made the prospect of an anti german pact in pretty unpalatable namely the expectation of aggressive intervention in the baltic states should they align with nazi germany and the passage of soviet troops in to poland should the latter nation come under attack considering that the soviet union would go on to invade and occupy the baltic states eatern poland and part of finland all by the end of it s not exactly farfetched to consider what the soviets expected in a western alliance to be a hard pill to swallow at the time in the spring of the uk and france governments didn t consider war to be a foregone conclusion at this stage in contrast to the soviet position though one might argue that the soviets ensured that war would come by virtue of germany securing a non aggression pact with them at this time tl dr suggesting that the soviet union only secured a pact with germany because the western allies turned down the opportunity is a bit misleading
lol so russia formed alliance with fascists only because they couldn t form anti fascist alliance do you realize how ridiculous you sound

tl dr suggesting that the soviet union only secured a pact with germany because the western allies turned down the opportunity is a bit misleading it s not and you re wrong the soviet union only began talks with germany after talks fell through with britain and germany
the soviets were in a development hole they couldn t handle germany alone they only barely held out years later with shitloads of lend lease aid from the allies i m not going to excuse the land they annexed or their baltic imperialism but a temporary non aggression pact was necessary as you can see with the winter war russia would have been shitcanned by germany
do you realize how ridiculous you sound letting everyone know you don t understand something as simple as realpolitik
whats the realpolitik for murdering finns and poles
i wonder if they will differentiate between the house of hanover and the stuarts
the house of saxe coburg gotha was founded in slavery was effectively abolished in if anything its the stuarts and hanovers who were on the throne when the uk thrived during slavery
we re going to find out that the monarchy had a lot to do with slavery exactly no one will be shocked and life will continue on like usual
this will be very interesting if you know anything about british monarchy history the monarchy s increasing lack of power as history went on especially following the glorious revolution meant that the monarch had virtually no power in most of the british empire s colonialism and also the role private companies in slavery and colonialism are often overlooked by people with little knowledge of the subject no matter what people on reddit say the monarchy s role has mostly been viewed by historians as minuscule it will be very interesting results no matter what they find i hope they distinguish between individuals houses and opinions vs actual power

i doubt the monarchy was heavily involved or more involved than market makers people who run companies and do the work to make markets for slavery are the real culprits the monarchy was just the enabler perhaps
i continue to wonder why the arab slave traders get a free pass on their history is it because they castrated male slaves and bought more instead of breeding them
guy can t catch a break really looks like he s trying his best to reconcile his family s history with modern moral attitudes and generally do the right thing
one thing that is also interesting to mention about the british monarchy and slavery is that they were one of the first institutions in the world to seriously advocate to complete abolition william the iv pushed and was able to ban slavery through the empire and queen victoria and prince albert campaigned furiously to get the country to spending tons of resources and using the military to basically make england the first country to fight the international slave trade this is not to say that the royal family didn t have a large role in the atlantic slave trade before the mid late s but one has to remember almost every civilization had similarly bloody hands in the participate of slavery and ironically the uk and was ome of the first countries to realize that slavery couldn t be justified anymore and to actually seriously do something about it

study into links
what does it matter most people who whine about slavery or reparations aren t even linked to slavery victims basically every nation has known slavery either being victim of or party to let it go america cries super hard for blacks but openly ignores how it killed irish and chinese in droves our first major railroad was half chinese corpse
i misread it as slavery kinks
i bet this is going to focus specifically on chattel slavery and ignore other abusive practices at the end of the day is we ve taken all your land come work on our farms and mines so you can pay our exorbitant taxes or we ll cut your hands off meaningfully different from slavery
and let s not forget about the indentured servitude system that the english used for labour in the colonies too they basically transported people from one colony to the other worked them for years before freeing them
these families that ended up monarchy didn t get there hugging and kissing

damn that fella looks british af

wouldn t that study just be a biography of elizabeth the first and robert dudley isn t it really really really well established that the british monarchy made bank from slave trade
slavery how about the crimes committed by their military in kenya the raped women and children and the lack of justice for the murdered women women have been shunned by their tribes because of their white children i think they should worry about focusing on their most recent atrocities convict those still alive and then look into their history
good publish a report then release a proper powerfully written magically charmed official statement that addresses the whole thing and inspires new frame of mind for a new world to leave the old shit behind
ah yes the great british empire we definitely know nothing of their exploits and need to investigate exactly what they did when they conquered so many other countries s
i m convinced the royal family and their constituents wake up every day trying to figure out how to assert their relevance to the public
in the s i was an archaeologist excavating in eyemouth the unit van was made available for recreational purposes so we decided to visit as many monuments as possible one weekend one of those was fatlips castle weird name we thought let s go and see it had only fallen into disuse in the s so the internal woodwork was all intact wandering around someone looked up on the ceiling of the first floor was this enormous taking up the whole ceiling black head in profile with huge bright red exaggerated lips i remember it having a slave collar but these fried neurons might have added that detail i m pretty sure it didn t have a bandana a bandana you ask this is the earl of minto owner of fatlips coat of arms https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/earl_of_minto_coa.svg/800px-earl_of_minto_coa.svg.png) hello meanwhile wikipedia has a ridiculous explanation for the name the castle is said to have obtained its unusual name from the habit of the members of the house to greet guests with less discretion than was considered decent at the time one of the pleasures of a visit to fatlips used to be that every gentleman by indefeasible privilege kisses one of the ladies on entering the ruin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatlips_castle) the point of the story is that while the study might appear pointless i think it s important that these fuckers aren t allowed to both literally and figuratively whitewash over their past involvement in the heinous acts that provided their wealth
poor king charles live long to become king and everything is left upon his shoulders within this woke generation i guess it isn t good to be the king

that is until they re asked for reparations
what about the children the queen kidnapped from canada

not my fucking king stop buying into the mere idea the myth of royalty it s something that only appears to exist because we suckers buy into it and passively accept that this or that person is royal is special in some way bullshit royalty is a scourge on everyone it demeans everyone fuck the idea that these people are in any way higher up or better than any of the rest of us
what s their reason for doing this all of a sudden
does this include ireland and scotland or are we just doing pocs this round
uh how about start with the british raj which wasn t even that long ago
what does he think his wealth comes from
his mother was a segregationist white supremacist so the outlook s not great
stop calling this old crusty german nonce king he was pen pals will jimmy savile
most useless person in the world
this man wants to know how the sausage was made
he s never shown much caring about slavery before i think he s just decided he has to appear to care because it s a hot topic at the moment
were they powerful and rich years ago then they had slaves what is the mystery he wants to solve here
but stop there cuz some of the other links are dangerous

chuck wants more material for his yank bank
well i didn t vote for him
is he starting with diana
make the crown pay reparations
ha what a joke
i can see the tories going anti monarchist over this
result the royal family has never been enslaved
perhaps they could also investigate the impact that their family also had on first nations people across the world too
slavery has been a cross cultural and near universal economic system for all of human history and well before i m happy it is gone but it was the west that killed it much to the chagrin of other cultures
another study is needed
wondering if he ll authorize that dna test on those children s skeletons found at the tower of london i doubt it but it would be interesting
that s going to be a short study
all the people who might ve actually been involved are pretty dead by now what what yes your highness jolly good might as well look into all this fuckery then
the irish weren t slaves they were criminals serfs peasants some old racist brit
this is what s gonna happen oh it was that royal family we re not that family
no i m descended from someone who pulled a totally differerent sword out of a totally different stone
that and as u kaioone pointed out in this comment https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12dic3f/king_charles_supports_study_into_royal_family/jf71nly/), the monarchy played a considerably smaller role in the atlantic slave trade than most people think
the modern house of windsor is descended from the house of hanover it s just that when victoria ascended hanover which ran according to german rules of strict male only inheritance kicked her branch out of the house so i d say those are some pretty strong family links the british house of hanover is in turn descended from james i and vi of england and scotland of the house of stuart albeit it none of the other stuarts in between since jimmy died in we can probably give the modern family a pass for most of the stuart stuff pertaining to slavery though
unless i am mistaken and i very well could be diana was from the stuart line which makes william part of this line
inland slavery they just did it percent remotely in other countries at some point
the house of hanover is the house of saxe coburg and gotha when it comes to british royal succession victoria was a hanover and she married albert after becoming queen her children inherited their father s house name but their claim to the british throne was due to their mother s lineage prince albert was born in the house of saxe coburg saafield but the family lost saafield in and got the city of gotha instead house names are usually territorial designations and in albert s case it is the name of their duchy women don t change houses after marriage but their children inherit their father s house name this means technically the royal family should be house mountbatten now but they ve decided to stick with windsor the royals do use mountbatten windsor as a surname when they need one though anyways they are ultimately all the same family when you trace it back far enough the hanoverian claim to the throne based on descent from the stuart sophia of hanover was the daughter of elizabeth stuart son of james i vi the act of settlement of designated sophia s and her heirs as the legitimate successors to the stuarts and elizabeth s son became george i the first hanoverian king of the uk
p s see you at the saxe coburg canasta evening that should puzzle her
all you have to do is see how eager britain was at supporting the south during the american civil war if russia didn t park her ships outside of ny and napoleon was just a smidgen more convincing britain would have at least legitimized the south
the royal family being descended from them is not really the issue here if they d all been bastards or adopted or something along the way that wouldn t erase the link of inherited wealth from these crimes the only reason people are so angry at them for this is that they still have the money which they have because they claim to be linked to that royalty if they didn t want the benefits of descent nobody would be going after them for the costs of it
people need to generally acknowledge two things there are lots of pricks in every old enough family tree and if you re rich a lot of that wealth likely came from those pricks that doesn t make you so specifically a bad person even if you re still benefiting from the generational wealth that those pricks extracted it s much more productive to try and persuade them to share some of that wealth than to call them names like colonizer
we re going to find out that the monarchy had a lot to do with slavery find out don t we already know this for a fact
well yeah obviously i m not gonna hold you accountable for the actions of your great grand father either that would be very silly indeed
exactly why are they investigating this pretty sure almost every country in europe was invested in the slave trade lol this is honestly laughable
should we follow the good christian bible and punish the children and children s children for the crimes of their ancestors
the east india company was founded by royal charter oh
more like we investigated ourselves and found no conclusive evidence we did anything wrong
yep and they propped up the south during the civil war all the while claiming they were against slavery so they could have cheap slavery cotton for their textile businesses
bro people ignore a lot of slavery facts already and just shrug
monarchies like slavery belong in a museum
people often overlook the role of early capitalist companies in the slave trade even though even american kids are taught about the use of slaves in the growing of cash crops
i mean this is the dance that defenders of the post glorious revolution monarchy always do right when it comes to the good or glamorized aspects of the empire it s god save the king he s the monarch he s the head of church he s the commonwealth the monarch is everything then whenever any atrocity comes up suddenly the monarch has no power and is just a figurehead a rubber seal a unifying symbol just a face on currency it s like that expression about god if a monarchy has power and their empire does evil they re evil if a monarchy isn t evil and their empire does evil then they re powerless if a monarch is powerless then why call them monarch then it s just an old fart in a hat you re humoring edit it s also funny because unlike other monarchists once you go back far enough english monarchists become parliamentarians explaining that the king is an institution not an individual ignoring this was the biggest legal post hoc ju jitsu bs in history to explain how the king could possibly be tried for treason against himself
not really specifically relevant to the house of windsor but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_african_company these private companies can hardly be considered separate from the crown when the crown s charter granted them a legal monopoly the british monarchy should in no way be considered having virtually no power when it comes to this topic
imagine having to face repercussions for something your family did years ago
and the romans
vikings gotta cough up too
lloyds of london has it s origins in insuring slave ships in the triangle trade the uk flourished during slavery under the stuarts and hanovers but the role of the monarchy was never at the forefront
that s a large part of it if those slaves had been able to leave tens of millions of descendants today it might get at least a bit more focus
what do you mean this is a good thing for the monarchy to do it s not about catching a break it s not like he was personally involved so why should an investigation into the history of the royal family negatively affect him
modern moral attitudes will never be sated
it d be nice if the royal family used some of their private wealth to try to address some of the multigenerational inequalities that stemmed from any such involvement check out what glasgow university did

bruh it s greece the place that made a femboy a god
wasn t there a ton of buttfucking going on in ancient greece i m surprised same sex marriage hasn t been legalized yet
i mean the greek men have been fucking each other forever it was part of their mentoring process ffs and the ilse of lesbos need i say more greece should have been the first place to legalize gay marriage
greece is super gay it s like the gay ancestral home land make greece gay again
why is greece so behind the times
all while voting against the common law living arrangement bill that was currently in parliament to give same sex couples almost equal right under the guise of all or nothing in the name of progress but this exact party and leader were in power for years nearly bankrupted greece and did mention once about leagalization then they just adding a known rapper to the party ticket that is a known homophobe and misogynist literally days ago and its all over the news and they are defending their choice yea im going to call bullshit and that this is pre election lies to hopefully get votes all while dogwhistling all the other shit above to the conservative part of his voter block but good article real good quality reporting

i feel like most people are taking the entirely wrong tack to this issue we shouldn t have to get the government s permission to get married in the first place my maternal grandparents were denied permission as was my best friend that i was her maid of honor since her husband to be was the ex wife of the country clerk states like california added so many requirements to get married as did my state of washington we should reduce the rules and fees rather than increasing them my great niece is currently fighting to get her wedding legalized which requires her to get a superior court ruling here in king county wa the case just keep getting delayed because the county auditor asks for delays
in greece this counts as traditional values
it is time to bring back the tolerance of classical greece alexander the great would want things back the old way

how does greece of all places not have same sex marriage greece never ever allowed same sex marriage why surprised now
the orthodox church won t somebody consider their sincerely held religious beliefs the ones that allow them to stop others from chasing their own personal bliss
ancient greeks were never pro same sex marriage they were pro powerful men diddling slaves and boys because women were so gross they weren t worth having sex with outside of pure necessity
if they had the ways of the ancient hellenes that would be significantly worse for greek homosexuals what a stupid fucking thing to say
dionysus is where its at now he is a proper god for the new millennium he s basically jesus if jesus was a rabidly insane bisexual party boy egalitarian naturist feminist who liked to bottom and cross dress

why is greece so behind their own ancient pottery
did they force you to marry someone of the same sex if not it was not shoved down your throat
because that democracy deemed gay people are actually just normal people and that they are entitled to marriage and all that legally entails religion or the state doesn t own the concept of marriage
poor guy it must be really hard for you
does that mean you are a homosexual now
waaahhhh why are they shoving equal rights down our throats
i m sorry about your weird unnatural and harmful homophobia

just because there were lesbians that filed such a bid does not mean that they actually represent all of lesbos lol this whole article is about a single court hearing that went absolutely nowhere
having been there i can say lesbos absolutely leans into the whole gay weddings tourism that their name brings it s not the prettiest island by greek standards so they ve got to make the most of what they have
a lot of gay women ellen is a n in famous example also reject the slang and simply use the word gay

gawd damn abrahamic religions we should go back to praising odin
there is a little something called the orthodox church
depending from the greek city state they waged war against each other and had different forms of democracy that was the most common thing
gay people i know don t make jokes about being miserable with their chosen loved one i think we know very different gay people i think this is more of a generational thing than a gay vs straight thing i was raised by two moms and they make jokes like that literally all the time about their marriage
i feel like you made a very valid criticism with that use of subreddit as hashtag but then made yourself sound extremely self righteous with the comment below it
as we all know the gays are perfect and never need to divorce ever
it was an old fashioned joke about marriage in general not about any particular gay people you may personally know not everything is about you you didn t find it funny and that s fine
a lot of people are probably thinking about the ancient greeks when making posts of being surprised
they take resurrection very literally there
greece is very conservative especially the islanders i obviously don t mean each and every one in lesbos feels like that but probably most are
when were you there just curious i want to go one day haha
odin was a big fan of butt stuff zeus too

is it self righteous to think it s weird that straight people always make jokes like let gay people be miserable in marriage as well there s rings in marriage the engagement ring the marriage ring and the suffering lol so funny the tag and the comment are the same thing are the straights ok why do they always joke about how awful their marriages are
that isn t what they said lol

okay and what you re implying is that with so many people owned by the church the politicians don t enact laws that provide for social acceptance right
they forgot the third option stay but not be at all ready for the battle
you have two option cold borscht cold borscht on lap
tear em up
while the battle will be bloody and difficult given crimea s geography hoping ukraine can battle their way into sevastopol interested to see if the afvs and tanks supplied through the winter will pay off here
i am glad to hear this but saddened that there will be many more deaths russia should kick out putin before their population decreases further
gee i wonder which one russia s going to choose hmm i wonder
yeah not going to happen crimean geography makes it impossible to assault it without loosing at least men and with fortification prepared and russia did prepare them probably triple that then there is a problem with those million russians in crimea the logical option would be to cut off crimea bomb and ships trying to re supply them starve those million people into leaving and or death but logical option won t look good in the news
don t tread on me
i mean yeah that s kinda war
you obviously don t understand efficiency you only need gun for every men if you re going to lose of them to artillery mines and loiter munitions anyways
it s russia this is the foolhardy route they will choose or you know be shot by their own soldiers for running away
the super secret actual choice lol
option defenestration with cold borscht
ukraine has been redefining what is possible with help of ruzzian incompetence
you underestimate russian incompetence it s been a game changer for the ukrainians
i think you re probably right but not quite the way you are stating i think the real plan is very likely what you ve called the logical option but ukraine s ultimatum is intended to draw another russians into crimea and away from other positions then ukraine strikes those weakened positions and cuts across russia s land bridge cutting off crimea from resupply then they take out the bridge on the far side hunt boats and wait for the trapped russians to surrender
ukraine will get the 100k men after they have freed up other parts of the frontline by pushing the russians back across the border and then replacing those troops with border guards and territorial defence and creating a no man s land anyways there is nothing that says both cannot be executed at the same time ukraine can cut off resupply to crimea then attack after russians do not have the strength to resist just like what we saw in kherson where the russian line suddenly pulled back because they were at risk of collapse after ukraine made several breakthroughs on the frontline just that it might not happen until late this year or maybe summer
and because you re getting slaughtered so quickly no bullets are required smooth
here s the comment the dude made right before he replied to you from a joe rogan sub oh he s morphing into his final jewish form every jew does it it s the final and the most beautiful part of their life cycle once a jew has accumulated sufficient wealth their bodies start morphing into final jew and at the last stages of this beautiful transformation they build a cacoon around them and inside there their bodies undergo radical changes their clothes change their hair grow on the sides they grow majestic beards and they enter the final stage of their lifecycle
cut off how sure maybe they might be able to destroy the kerch bridge which russia is much more protective of after the bombing but even then ferry will do the job and the strip of land connecting crimea to the rest of ukraine is incredibly thin it may happen but it would be very late into the war
what a fucking piece of shit
there literally is no such comment in my comment history the commend i made before this was this decades also do you think i am pro russian for pointing out the fact that crimean geography means funneling all the troops via 6km 3mile wide land bridge is pointing out the difficult reality now considered pro russian in these delusional subs if ukraine decided to attack crimea they are going to lose at minimum troops that s a fact and second fact is that this would be a turning point in war with russia having an upper hand afterwards
attacking the ports the ferries operate from i mean the ferries have to operate from somewhere right
yeah and most of their other comments are very pro russia hard to even tell who is a bot these days edit then they bitched about my going through their comment history then immediately deleted it i invite absolutely anyone who s curious to browse my comment history it s public information that i chose to publish
well yeah but it s hard to attack a port without naval access to it maybe they could pull off a few attacks from the inside but completely cutting off supply would be almost impossible

his opponent had organized crime ties his own party nearly voted to charge him with the crimes earlier this year and the opponent s party had previously campaigned on social issues but failed to make progress on big issues like housing prices while they were in control not to mention some big feminist names in that party were outed for covering up sexual assaults by their peers it wasn t a case of this guy being likeable but the alternative potentially being worse edit removed references to the party being liberal because sk has multiple parties some of which are more liberal and because sk liberalism doesn t really map cleanly onto us or european liberalism
many of his own voters of the korean president hated him and still think he is a dumbass the guy he was running against lee jae myung was a horrible candidate he was my governor he is beloved by the left but also is one of the most corrupt politicians in korea which is saying a lot
that was hilarious though especially calling all of congress a bunch of dumbasses
he cussed at joe biden for no reason in korean not _at_ joe biden but at the us congress particularly the republicans causing gridlock his comment was something along the lines of if those dogs members of congress don t pass the spending bill as biden promised it d be embarassing as fuck not very statesmen like and i dont like yoon for unrelated reasons but he does respect the potus
cussed the video shows him calling our senators idiots which honestly i agree with as an american we are fuckinggggg dumb
can you read the answer to your question is in the first paragraph
does south korea flourish with that system
real shame too last guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moon_jae-in) was a beast former human rights lawyer was imprisoned by the dictatorship made s korea into a slightly less horrendous place to work handled covid like a champ and well at least my theory is manipulated kim and trump into not bombing the fuck out of each other
just like politics in the us then
deleted
he s not wrong did you see them questioning the tiktok ceo i m not american and i got second hand embarrassment
they hated yoon because he told the truth
he isn t wrong lmaooo from an american
yeah they brawl on the floor of congress like drunken idiots oh wait that s in south korea
speak for yourself
south korea had a string of military dictators since korean war in 1950s they only became truly democratic in or so term limit is probably precautionary measures as for the election the choices were between a shit sandwich and giant douche yoon s opponent wasnt much better and is now in hot waters due to corruption charges etc
mexico has the same
except in korea they actually go to jail
no
i wish we would bring back fist fights in congress they used to brawl
i mean a guy in state congress did get shoved a few days ago by another congressman and we do have history of brawls happening
sounds like their equivalent of cspan should be a pay per view channel then
i don t know much about korean politics but i watch a lot of korean tv for entertainment i always found it strange every time they talk about korean tv history old tv show actor movie etc the history only goes as far back to the s virtually there s zero mention about anything prior to that as if tv show entertainment didn t exist prior to the s as it turns out like you said prior to that tv were just a dictatorship propaganda no one wants to remember that era
isn t donny going to jail now
didn t someone get their ass beat with a wooden cane in the house once lmao
fuck it man let s bring back duels
to be fair to them syngmam rhee and park jung hee are not dudes i d want to bring up either
as much as we would like it s not going to be anytime soon trials will be years in the making south koreans have made jailing their ex presidents a national pastime https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55657297
lol no way man he will have to pay a fine at worst this is america rich people dont go to jail
not over the ny indictment if he goes to jail it ll be over the georgia thing where he threatened the state government and demanded they magically find enough votes for him to win i think georgia is going to indict him within like or months tops
a democrat beat the shit out of a republican on the house floor with a cane which would be an republican doing it now caining of sumter i am too lazy to look it up someone correct me
president emmanuel macron is on a state visit in china until saturday his office rejected responsibility for the failed talks and laid blame on the unions notably the moderate cfdt who it said did not want to compromise with the government public anger was further ignited after prime minister lisabeth borne used article known as the nuclear option to push pension reform through parliament without a vote on march sparking widespread anger days later the government narrowly survived two no confidence votes french president emmanuel macron insists the proposed changes which include raising the retirement age from to are needed to reform a moribund system but some of the government s own experts have said the pension system is in relatively good shape and would likely return to a balanced budget even without reforms
two years of work ended up costing them a lot don t fuck with the finish line
i cannot express how in awe i am at the french people seeing people care like this gives me hope for other less politically active populations seriously i m visiting relatives in spain in a few months we re now taking a weekend trip to france to help support their local economy time for france to step up and become a global superpower again if you re french and see an american latino struggling to speak any local language please be patient with me
may god continue to bless the french protestors may we americans some day find such courage
franais n abandonnez pas
their sluggish economy and high unemployment much because of how resistant to change france is on so many levels won t see them become a superpower any time soon
you won t be a super power when your productivity is lower than other nations and getting even lower
deleted
being a citizen of a superpower doesn t do much for the hundred million americans who can t afford a basic emergency expense or a trip to the doctor i d gladly trade being able to dick wave about our superpower status for france s labor protections healthcare and so on not to mention france is hardly a weak nation militarily by any stretch of the imagination
and why do you think we want to be a superpower
the fact that you are on at the moment really goes to show how difficult it is not just trying to make difficult choices in government these days but merely trying to explain the need for those choices to the population
completely wrong https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_gr#
china could very well fall into the middle income trap unless they can figure out a way to increase the birth rate quickly and that won t be easy and they can t really rely on immigration for political reasons india definitely possible
why does everyone latch onto the superpower part it was in response to the previous comment i honestly don t care if france is a superpower or not
i was responding to the previous comment
yes i mean the french can do whatever they want it doesn t bother me but there are structural issues that need to be addressed one way or another
because it s the subject of your entire comment your comment was one sentence but you re acting like you made numerous assertions and people are unreasonably focusing on some niche detail france does stuff therefore they won t become a superpower soon what deeper meaning do you expect people to find address here
because you typed it and presented it as something to aspire to i got some dirty boots is your tongue free
one way or another one way or one way ftfy you re welcome love emmanuel
dont tell russia
once we forgot poland we won t make that mistake again

interesting as a pole i had no idea cause our whole country literally runs on coal and diesel so i guess it might be all for export
the difference between no and though
i m just happy these things are not being made in china nations need to learn the lesson from the russian invasion of ukraine china and russia will use their leverage over their customers to extort them into supporting their war crimes torture genocide etc it s better not to do business with them at all so they can t threaten you
ayyyy well done polski s congrats now being a citizen of the premier power on planet earth i respectfully ask of my fellow americans to get our asses in gear we re being outdone by fuckin poland per the article china makes of all battery capacity per year with poland and the us of a contributing roughly each we re losing the race folks
poland s labor costs are also about they of the us so their batteries will be much cheaper
more power to them
our government is so stupid that they are the most against ban for petrol based cars even though we have no oil no car industry yet if we were to have a second largest li ion production capacity it would have been great news for us
worked in poland for a few years that economy is a powerhouse and no one is willing to say it out loud a lot of media with headlines that convey surprise some of the smartest and most ambitious people i ve ever met who are also humble and very kind strong sense of their own history and identity and done being pushed around also the sheer amount of humanitarian and military aid that poland has provided to ukraine is staggering russian invasions of sovereign countries is no longer tolerated i d love to go back sometime soon
polska gurom
but the usa does not produce any lithium so if we want we have to buy
i m guessing russia is watching that pretty carefully
guessing no one looked at the amount china is producing and let s not forget where the raw materials for all these batteries come from
at first i m impressed then you look at ranking and it s china vs the rest being negligible lmfao but i think it ll change in the coming years with the us taking this more seriously
i can see the headlines in his dreams rn putin plunders poland for post petro powerplants
the only batteries they gonna get is the himars ones we just bought they have an express delivery button
my grandma visited russia back in so the fall of the berlin wall and the soviet union collapse was very fresh while being driven around she noticed that all the cars were manual transmission even in america at this time it was common to find a car with a stick shift but she never saw any automatic transmissions so she asked her guide why they didn t have any automatic transmissions the guy replied whats an automatic transmission keep in mind that the 1st commercially avaliable automatic transmission was built by gm in the s
polish batteries were always part of muscovy
my guess is why they invaded ukraine for the lithium deposits in the east knowing ukraine they would have sold it without a moments notice to poland instead of russia
so special military operation to denazify poland starts tomorrow fortunately they are not a soft target
they re the men now dogs
their anthems name actually is poland is not yet lost i find this quite funny
behind only china which produces times more update us in years if we re still around
looks like lg has a battery plant there making batteries for european car manufacturers https://insideevs.com/news/576028/lges-ev-battery-gigafactory-poland/
yeah i think poland is 4th lowest in ev s in europe maybe pis will give us all one of those new toyota ev s to promote pl jp trade
poland s makes a lot of electric buses for domestic use and export and has a pretty good network of electrified railways so that s all pretty nice poland s very much a net importer of petroleum and its many attempts at exploratory drilling in recent history have been duds so it s a bit odd that it doesn t push for evs and other mobility solutions harder
yea china leads by a huge margin but i think this is still quite an accomplishment for poland beating out the us batteries are the new oil gas coal go poland
i m just happy these things are not being made in china uh should we tell him guys
how does this comment get upvoted times did nobody click on the actual link and look at the very clear chart that shows china dominates this industry with of all battery manufacturing wtf is going on here
it s on its way https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/03/20/governor-newsom-visits-lithium-valley-to-highlight-momentum-on-becoming-global-source-for-battery-production/
see thacker pass https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thacker_pass_lithium_mine
we re losing the race folks nope we intentionally threw it because demolishing domestic battery production as well as solar and wind power industries was a requirement for the renewables don t work storage is impossible storylines fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies both relied upon for many years
the production didn t rise because the prices were too low to be financially worth in western countries but that is changing the same goes for lithium mining
tell democrats to push through permitting reform and allow mines and oil production every time you block a mine like pebble in alaska or other critical resource you re pushing production to africa and asia
shorten it to pppppp and i m all ears
warm water ports
take this fucking award brian peppers music plays
jeszce polska nie zqinela
poland is 30x smaller by population and by gdp
nah we should wait until he clicks the link
when i said these things i meant these particular batteries that are being made in poland rather than china you are misreading my comment
the salton sea has a lot of lithium will be cool to take advantage of this
mic drop
mostly chinese owned per the wikipedia article
lmao no liberals killed mining in america if you don t allow mining for critical resources then china and russia and counties in africa will do it pebble mine dems killed it amber mining district dems killed it and still are and many more just in alaska dowa mine in south east alaska
the answer is nuclear not wind or solar
give me a p and another p
deleted
yes just drove past yesterday excited for the development
i had not even looked at who owned it https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/lithium-americas-spin-off-into-two-companies-2022-11-03/ the split which was approved by the lithium americas board on tuesday will separate the north american and argentine businesses into two independent companies each publicly listed in toronto and new york by the end of next year general motors bought in there is still plenty of controversy the environmental impact statement is a wild ride
if the answer is nuclear you are asking the wrong question the answer to co2 neutral sustainable production of electricity is either nuclear renewables or storage renewables there is exactly no chance for nuclear to be economically viable compared to setup of nuclear base load and renewables
or a healthy mix of many different things there s not a single solution to everything
not sure what question you thought was being asked but nuclear usually means generating electricity via nuclear energy and lithium ion batteries are great at storing such for other uses also wind and solar have had rapid cost improvements even with it s fairly small amount of scaling and production learnings so far even in a variety of markets and conditions outside of the us so they do seem to be proving themselves out to be pretty useful
the answer is all of the above putting all your energy supply options into one basket is stupid even if we get commercial fusion power generation working one day you still shouldn t leave energy options on the table unused
we know that but the tides are shifting to other countries for example the united states and canada are teaming up for massive local battery production in the near future in an attempt to pull away from china canada has considerable lithium deposits other countries are doing the same
and their point was that it is good other countries are making them other than china and russia to lower dependence what are you people not understanding here
a pretty wild ride honestly is the best way to say it and not a great one
this is the right answer nuclear cannot economically decarbonise the economy in any scenario we will need a cheaper source of energy even if not reliable to power chemicals production metallurgy and concrete production nuclear is also not enough to economically cover peak consumption without relying on other energy sources
storage and nuclear can be nice because some nuclear plant designs have a technically or financially difficult time to substantially change power output levels at a rapid pace but meanwhile demand over the course of the day can have radical change in that sense storage could potentially improve nuclear in some instances as well batteries are great for electrifying things like a lot of transportation and nuclear energy for commercial usage is almost exclusively targeted towards electricity generation so yea if nuclear finds itself booming in the near future it s a good thing then that we re moving ahead on energy storage
was replying to the post read it
absolutely i just sold a portion of my farmland in the midwest to a company that will be building a l ion plant
not a great one the great pyramid is feet the mine tailings filter stack will be only feet high its a slope and a long flat top berm it will be something like 50x as much material as the great pyramid i am not sure why they would make something that big and ugly but not make it into some sort of monument stick biden and trump s faces on it or something along those lines the main pit is much bigger they are talking about backfilling it rather than making anything they could bury catacombs make ski resorts or build an amphitheater instead they are just destroying it and piling shoving it back into the same hole
a possible solution to this issue is instead of building off a low baseline and adding capacity at peak load times is to instead build a high baseline modern nuclear and instead use the excess capacity for incentivized ev charging i e lower rates during off peak times
i did read it and unfortunately it s unclear what you thought the question was since there was not a question presented i thought that was clear but here s the posts you were responding to in order to the top nope we intentionally threw it because demolishing domestic battery production as well as solar and wind power industries was a requirement for the renewables don t work storage is impossible storylines fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies both relied upon for many years in response to ayyyy well done polski s congrats now being a citizen of the premier power on planet earth i respectfully ask of my fellow americans to get our asses in gear we re being outdone by fuckin poland per the article china makes of all battery capacity per year with poland and the us of a contributing roughly each we re losing the race folks
they still have millions more to clean up
too bad henry kissinger isn t being made to personally clean up every bomb he ordered dropped

the computers that read the computer tapes that recorded the bombing mission data no longer exist so we have the data to precisely mark the bomb fields but it cannot be got at
when you travel to southeast asia sometimes a person with no hands will walk up to you and put thier stumps in your hand this is henry kissinger s legacy
you know what there s plenty of negative ways to look at this but go you laos one point eight million unexploded bombs that no longer pose a threat to your inhabitants good job keep it up to everyone involved with the effort
is that one bomb every minutes
this is the country the us dropped all those bombs on despite not being at war with right just dumped the stuff they didnt need anymore in vietnam
thanks america
american tax dollars at worst
on the good news china construction exports gave laos a brand new trains n tracks laos is happy to be financed from vietnam as for america you could at least set up a fund for reparations and clean up but no you choose to forget like every other war crimes you committed all over the world
the us should be fined individually for each bomb for each day it has remained
why do to this day so many americans want so desperately to be seen as having won such a dirty war winning wouldn t be something to be proud of even if it were true vietnam and its neighbours like laos were victim to one of the most one sided wars in modern history and the us still lost the us did not achieve its military aims and therefore lost but even more important are the awful horrific crimes the us committed during that war not just to the vietnamese but their neighbours as well there is literally not one aspect of that conflict americans could or should be proud of the rapes the bombings the napalm the massacres the racism the unjustified aggression against a people that simply wanted their independence from a foreign colonial oppressor and let s not forget the tens of thousands of unexploded ordnance the us dropped on cambodia and laos in the process which still kills and maims people to this day in laos alone the us military dropped over million cluster bombs about million tonnes of munitions over the course of bombing missions this is equivalent to a planeload of bombs being unloaded every eight minutes hours a day for nine years nearly seven bombs for every man woman and child living in laos it is more than all the bombs dropped on europe throughout world war ii and then to top it off america s and americans basic refusal to admit how wrong they are about absolutely everything in that war not only did the us inflict tremendous suffering onto the vietnamese and their neighbours but many of them are to this day saying vietnam didn t actually win the war what a vile thing to say
ukraine has so much to look forward to
that is a lot of duds is it too late to ask for a refund on a serious note it is great that they are being cleaned up but it took entirely too long the people of laos should not have this threat
lockheed martin raytheon s products
must had wmds s
if they didn t explode when dropped i want my money back
wait is this out in the open now i thought it was all being kept quiet on the down low
yet bruce jenner is brave
they should drop them on russia
these numbers smell fishy maybe millions of tons but not million of bombs
jesus fuck
yea i missed the bomblet part so i found a figure of cbu2a cluster bombs dropped with blu3 bomblets per munitions so that s million bomblets let s say didn t explode that s like approx million unexploded bomblets wow what a waste of fucking money and resources
yes i am well aware
kind of makes current crying about war crimes n atrocities look pathetic doesn t it we never declared war vs laos never were attacked by them their land was used as a bypass by the vietcong so of course nixon decided to bomb the shit out of them now who does that remind you of not supporting any bombings btw
estimates are that it will take years to clear up all uxo from laos https://laotiantimes.com/2022/09/30/more-than-1000-years-needed-to-clear-all-uxo-from-laos/
yeah millions is unfortunately close to nothing a quick google search says there s an estimate of million bombs that did not detonate
pretty sad that everytime my family s home country is brought up its always about the bombs went to party and it was like you re from that country that got bombed a lot right
they
kissinger is still alive there is still time to fly him to den hague before he finally goes to hell
that mans a saint you watch your tongue
that s what happened when you pissed off america in the 1960s million little packets of freedom
seems like it d be a small feat to just redesign these computers
uh like as a hand shake because i really doubt someone injured by unexploded ordinance would try and bother a tourist just because they can
the halo trust helps out there and on a side note when anthony bourdain went to laos he highlighted this issue the laos government and its partners have been working hard on this and i agree that it should be celebrated
plane load of bombs every minutes
more try to get rid of supply routes through carpet bombing
laos was bombed by an average of one b bomb load every eight minutes hours a day for years thirty percent of bombs failed to explode a lot of them are cluster bombs and a lot of the bomblets are made to look like fruit children are the main victims of uxo accidents
no the military supply trail ho chi minh trail ran through laos neither the north vietnamese nor the united states wanted to admit that they were utilizing laos for wartime operations so its been largely brushed over in history laos became the most heavily bombed country in history per capita i believe
removed
i m not saying it was right of the us to do but north vietnam was using laos heavily pop over the border into the south attack then cross into laos again and recover resupply while being safe
american tax dollars at standard and usual
as for america you could at least set up a fund for reparations and clean up the us in fact does provide aid both for munitions cleanup and general development for things such as healthcare and education i am of the opinion it is not enough but the us does send aid
we should at least be funding more money into the process i know we send some but i remember it being a pretty paltry amount
almost everything you ve said here is true but i don t think the majority of americans think we won the war or that it was even justified i personally haven t met a single person who thinks that way i don t remember the specifics but our own government lied to its people about multiple aspects of the war dragging it on and sending tens of thousands of our people to ultimately pointless deaths
this cleanup is just the beginning at this current rate it will take another years to clean up all of the of the uxo left source https://laotiantimes.com/2022/09/30/more-than-1000-years-needed-to-clear-all-uxo-from-laos/)
lockheed martin and raytheon did not exist then
the bombs dropped in laos were largely made by government employees in government owned ammunition plants the contractors made their money off the airplanes delivering them
the article says over million of them were cluster munitions which makes the math work out if one cluster bomb is turning into hundreds of submunitons which are still just as deadly
there are over million unexploded bombs from the usa remaining in laos which is the most bombed country in history laos was a neutral party not at war with the usa the usa bombed them anyway to cut off communist supply routes into vietnam it s definitely worth reading up on
maybe millions of tons but not million of bombs millions of tons would be even more bombs most bombs are smaller than 2000lb
might want to read up on what we did in laos
most dropped bombs have a mass of less than one tonne so not having a million bomb if there is a million tons of them is quite hard if you look at the mark bomb that was induced during the war is mass is ln kg and at the time the third heaviest bomb in the us arsenal the mark series contain and pound bombs the blu daisy cutter was the heaviest at tonnes only were made it was dropped from cargo airplanes or heavy lift helicopters to create helicopter landing zones in the jungle the mark bomb was at tons it was used by fighter jets and classified as a demolition bomb so you need to use very few bombs that are not the heavies bombs you have for general usage to get million tons and not a million bombs it woul be impossible with to get millions of tons ie more than and not drop million bombs the headline is by the way incorrect it uses bombs but the rest of the text says million unexploded ordnance million of them was bomblets from cluster bomb only was large bombs of the uxo devices removed and detonated were cluster bombs were large bombs and were land mines while other types of munitions were also located and detonated lao national tv reported on wednesday citing the uxo update cluster bomblets are small commonly less than kg the result is a 250kg cluster bomb can contain more than bomblets a b52 with tow large displacers in the bomb bay could carry bomblets the bomblets will have a lot higher rate of failure to detonate than large bombs so million bomblets can have a mass of fewer than tonnes
how long do the bombs remain viable to explode surely rust and water would degrade it at some point right
million bombs that did not detonate that s horrifying when you take into account that many many more than million did detonate
what else has your country done worth talking about
kissinger is proof that it is the good who die young
let s have him arrested for war crimes
oof i thought you were just joking because who could sincerely believe that but given your top to bottom deranged comment history i guess you re actually serious
lmao you sure are funny
suck my balls
i hope that hell is real so i can piss in his and your eyes for all eternity
you re psychotic
i m sorry your life is so bad or you feel so inadequate that you have to resort to being an internet troll hope you get that worked out someday
you forgot the s
if that man s a saint i don t wanna know what a devil looks like
wow your standards for saints are low
you forgot the s
how well do you represent the georgian left as you claim to be
laos did nothing to piss off the us
some individuals are trying to collect parts and scrap units to allow the tapes to be read but the tapes sit in storage in the archives with further danger of tape decay and degradation the tapes mark all the mission targets and would assist in mine clearance
they are begging because no hands no job no income
uh it happened to me
beggars they re showing you hands for sympathy and money
the links you posted below do not prove that they were designed to look like fruit just that they were called the name of the fruit due to the resemblance
bomblets are made to look like fruit source
laos became the most heavily bombed country in history per capita i believe not per capita just straight up the most heavily bombed country in history there were more bombs dropped in laos during the vietnam war than were used during the entirety of ww2 the main reason for that is because the us wasn t bombing buildings and infrastructure which are contained to a small specific area but were bombing poorly defined roads and jungle paths so they had to carpet bomb huge areas with cluster munitions of which about failed to detonate on impact which is why there are still millions of them there today
depends on context here or a thread that s directly regarding such a topic completely justified to call out the u s on its bombing campaigns overseas doing it in response to russia bombing a ukrainian city probably whataboutism most rational people are firmly on the side of it was wrong when the u s did it it s wrong now and it will continue to be wrong regardless of nationality
then what are you saying
the u s aid is piss poor compared to how it would take another more years to clean up all the bombs something that is more than a few million dollar of aid has to done to help the people who will be suffering for nearly millennium here is the source https://laotiantimes.com/2022/09/30/more-than-1000-years-needed-to-clear-all-uxo-from-laos/](https://laotiantimes.com/2022/09/30/more-than-1000-years-needed-to-clear-all-uxo-from-laos/)
technically not but all the big defense contractors around now are the result of many mergers for example martin aircraft was around during vietnam the raytheon company existed during vietnam
any interesting links to more info
not sure how long but there are still wwii bombs in europe that go off have to be detonated in a controlled explosion every now and again so i guess the answer is at least years
the cleanup from world war i continues https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_harvest) with the belgians defusing tons of unexploded ordinance in people are still accidentally exposed to mustard gas every couple of years and a couple of demolition experts died to a century old bomb in modern bombs made in the us are now designed to spoil but that wasn t a concern until the severity of these problems became apparent
there is a less rude way to phrase that question i think particularly because laos didn t do it to themselves other countries did it to them what would you like to see laos brought up in conversation for
railroad hydropower plants japanese and chinese investments
he s also proof that the nobel peace prize is a joke
planning on going to hell
could you imagine pissing for all of eternity like not even stopping to refill just age upon age of constant urination into a handful of bad men s faces
well if it s the opposite of kissinger it s probably a pretty good person
north vietnam s supply ran through laos which was the reason for the carpet bombing not that it justify it but that was the explanation for it
you re right it should be that s what happens when you re the next door neighbor of someone who pissed off the usa in the 1960s
laos did not deserve it but its leader did piss the us off by threatening to go full communism which wouldve paved the way for downstream nations
it would be rather trivial to make optical digital scans of those tapes and then apply pattern recognition to the result that way the tapes only have to be accessed once and can be analysed in every digital way possible from then on the fact this is not happening is because the us does not want to i am willing to bet the life of a us president on it that the pentagon can crack the thing withn hours
i bet they d assist in some evidence of war crimes too no wonder there s no real effort to get at that data
https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30023803 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blu-3_pineapple
they bombed it so much that the vietnamese made use of rubble from the destroyed mountains to build the various roads in the ho chi minh trail
so was the majority of rolling thunder and linebacker taking place over laos instead of vietnam then
that they didn t just bomb it because they felt like it they did it for strategic reasons which does not justify the war
russian aggression is the reason countries bordering russia want to join nato russia is literally doing everything on their own making their own problem and then cry about it and blame everyone else
yeah it doesn t change much unless they will be nuking ukraine kaliningrad is closer to most european cities
russia attacks non nato countries finland still doesn t want to join nato putin finland you better not join nato or else finland joins nato putin oh my god i cant believe they joined nato
nato expansion is in response to russian aggression russia should aim those missiles at the real threat themselves
we are going to do something about finland ok what we uh we already did it
finland and sweden rapidly joining nato is a direct response to russia attempting to invade and conquer the independent neighbouring country of ukraine in soviet russia logic defies you
master strategist putin doubles russia s border with nato meanwhile tens of thousands of conscripted kids are dying in his name and for his yacht club biggest threat to russia is putins existence
bruh the idea that putting nukes in a mid sized country that already borders russia and is located entirely east of kaliningrad is supposed to scare anyone is embarrassing and tells me that maybe their nuclear capabilities are wildly overstated
nuclear deployment is to make sure that this rogue state continues to be one under puppet government of the kremlin
nato expansion is response to russian aggression in europe finland would never of joined nato if russia did not invade ukraine
how dare you expand your defensive alliance trumpers russians do not seem to understand that if a nato country were to attack russia that country would void their nato protections no one in nato is allowed to preemptively declare war on anyone the alliance only exists if a nato country is attacked first putting missiles in belarus has nothing to do with nato it s simply a cover story to further absorb belarus into russia
when everybody else agrees to work together to stand up to a bully the bully doesn t have the right to cry that they re being targeted
do they use trebuchet to launch their nukes is there a point in moving them closer
soooo not only move part of their nuclear arsenal closer to nato s borders purely for posturing making them easier to strike if hostilities with nato forces do kick off they re also making them potential targets for belarus partisan groups who have been engaging in sabotage against the russian forces within their territory for the past year not to mention that if when they pull their forces out they re likely to forget about bringing said arsenal with them by all means russia please continue with your posturing and 6d chess reverse logic
nobody who knows anything about nuclear weapons gives a shit about russia putting their nukes in belarus
do it then you big fucking pussy
russia once again threatened by a neighbour s defensive posture
there s no way a corrupt country like russia with a pre war gdp smaller than italy has been doing any maintenance on their nukes maintaining nukes is expensive the u s spends more maintaining our nukes then the russian defense budget and they have more nukes on paper to maintain and they are much older as well they couldn t even afford to keep their one aircraft carrier working while engaged in a very public operation in syria
their nukes just like ours can hit anywhere in the world regardless of where they re stationed this means literally nothing
what will their response be when sweden joins do they have a second belarus hidden somewhere
these guys can t go a day without saying the word nuclear
does russia still have working nukes isn t that why they pulled out of the inspection treaties so that the world wouldn t find out that their arsenal is so degraded
russian federation collapse in response to nato expansion
nato expanded because they knew it was only a matter of time before russia resumed their imperialist bullshit
boo hoo russia you did this to yourselves doesn t mean shyt anyway just to make themselves feel good
oh no anyway
so tell me when was the last time nato invaded a country over some land claim
last week it was because of depleted uranium shells which is ridiculous what will it be next week in remarks broadcast saturday putin said the immediate trigger for the deployment of russia s tactical nuclear weapons to belarus was the uk government s decision to provide ukraine with armour piercing shells containing depleted uranium putin toned down his language after first falsely claiming that such rounds have nuclear components but he insisted they pose an additional danger to the civilian population and could contaminate the environment https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/28/why-does-russia-want-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus
fuck you and your fascist aspirations putin

putin can posture all he wants but unless he s willing to irradiate his own country there is no way he s ever going to let the nukes fly wind is a thing and he s living next door
they are so unhinged everyday genuinely how do they sleep at night on a mattress full of lies russian diplomats should be shunned when saying bonkers shit like this
so we re gonna send our rust bucket bullshit filled nukes to our fat friends house so there
nato expansion is a response to russia invading their neighbour
i m going to threaten you with these weapons that if i use them will guarantee my destruction nobody cares putin buzz off we called your bluff ages ago
well since you re getting your ass kicked by a country you thought you could wipe out in one day and you re chasing gay people down because you re manly what else is left for you micropenis m and putin just gave nato almost more miles of border but you guys keep doing what you re doing oh yeah don t forget to threaten everybody with your big bombs
forgive me but what difference does it make moving nuclear weapons around when they can fly it s not like they have to pick them up and throw them
go home russia you re drunk
nato expansion is due to russian aggression
nato expansion is a response to protect nato countries from bully russia
kinda did it yourself there vlad
crazy how s there s billions of bullets in the world and not one has found it s way into putin s temple
nato is a defensive alliance the fact that russia is reacting to its expansion is just evidence that they are the aggressors never mind their invasion of ukraine in this case of course
guess twice why nato is expanding you fkn morons
and nato expansion is a response to russian aggression
kremlin confirms they wont do shit about finland by claiming thing they did last week was in response to something that happened this week pusssssssies
sounds like he s worried about nato invading belarus which is ridiculous because belarus is a problem that will eventually solve itself much like russia nato is solely a defensive agreement to counter russian imperialism stop being an expansionist genocidal terrorist country and you have literally nothing to fear from nato go ahead give belarus nukes as long as they don t accidentally go off it doesn t matter the belarusian people will only be crushed under lukashenko s fat heel for so long and we ll be here for them when they decide they want to lose a couple hundred pounds of useless dictator just like russia in the mean time nato will do it s best to protect the sovereignty of non nuclear states that want to keep their borders intact
pathetic
but they only expanded because russia invaded ukraine like is this dude so bent over backwards inside his own asshole that he can t realize this is the case
nuclear deployment to belarus is our response to nato expansion uh you mean the nukes you deployed over there since before finland s joining the same nukes you ve been spouting for months about deploying to
repositioning their nuclear armaments like chess pieces on a board doesn t really constitute a threat it just highlights the limitations of their icbm capabilities
those rust buckets don t have enough purity to have a snowballs chance in hell of being fissile most likely they re just fancy dirty bombs plus putin would never willingly hand over his favorite toys to another dude this is the gamer equivalent of handing your brother a controller that s not plugged in
the kremlin has an interesting way of defining words typically expansion begins from within and pushes outward like if you send your troops to fight a neighboring country not in defense but to expand your borders
belarus will eventually join nato too so those nukes will be part of the western arsenal
yeah yeah blah blah blah blah blah
didn t they say it s a response to uk pledging uranium shells
russia s whining about nato has become a self fulfilling prophecy their aggression leads to more countries wanting to join nato and they respond to that with aggression
well in that case you can give ukraine nukes back
nato is not invading ru any time soon correction ever russia should fear china and not nato they re the ones wanting ru resources wait until china can counter any and all ru weapons at that time china will invade and conquer ru
yeah ok whatever just putin stroking his nukes changes nothing
we have nato nukes in turkey seawolfs cant drive up the arctic right up to russia s border and strike without ever being detected
hollow gesture it means nothing and makes no difference lol
nato expansion is response to russian leader being a murderous douche bag
russia is like that gif sequence of sideshow bob repeatedly stepping on rakes you re doing it to yourself russia nato expanded because a free country decided it was safer to join that alliance than exist as your neutral neighbour
i hate russia so much
what missile are they going to use because they don t have many left
nato targeting belarus potential launch storage sites with nuclear weapons a response to russia siting nuclear warheads and missiles in belarus there we go parity
go ahead and rattle those sabers all you want putin is a weak strong man
so nuclear deployment to finland when
lol which in itself is a result of russians illegal invasion russians are nothing but a blight on this earth a nuclear armed mafia
they won t do it it took them years to build the storage facilities in kaliningrad it s bullshit
literally stuck in the s lmao they could deploy nukes in canada and it wouldn t change much of anything don t see how nukes in belarus makes any difference
fuck putin
how many of their nukes are actually viable if that
i wonder if russia still even has any nukes left i mean they had active tanks missing in april after the failed invasion they called up the next batallion and it was only there on paper x200b no one wants to buy russian tanks unless they re desperate plenty of people want to by nukes
we have moved our intercontinental ballistic missiles metres closer
that s going to make it a lot harder for russia to invade belarus once their euromaidan moment comes
as a belarusian i must tell literally nobody i know supports returning nuclear weapons to belarus unfortunately the regime does not listen
nato expansion is a response to russia invading a peaceful country and breaking their agreement in the budapest memorandum of
people need to take the power back from government when shit like this happens
oh no russian nuclear missles will now reach western countries minutes sooner
belarus doesnt want russia nukes
can we ask china to leave taiwan alone and just take siberia and put it under better management win win
sure but the response to moving the nukes is going to be more expansion how long is it going to take for them to realize none of this is in their favor
ohhh big bad kremlin shaking in their wittle baby boots
get western nukes in ukraine in response to the aggression of the internationally recognised terrorist state of nazi russia works both ways
i mean they said they were going to do this basically immediately after they invaded ukraine so basically they d have done this anyways even if finland hadn t joined
why doesn t russia just annex belarus instead of ukraine
don t blame me for beating you up if you d stop resisting i would have been finished thrashing you a long time ago you re just prolonging your own suffering now with your corrupt western notions of self defense integrity and international rights when those nukes get launched it s gonna be on you
reminder none of this matters since russia has icbms and slbms
can t wait to read how the nazis at r conservative spin this to somehow be a good thing
just wait for what the most advanced military alliance on the planet has to your outdated nuclear deployment to a third world underdeveloped nation y all making the swiss choose sides say goodbye to the russian federation and belarus as independent countries their break up is coming closer and closer
their logic is that since usa keeps building military bases in every country which joined nato deploys abm there and refused russia request when it asked to join nato in 2000s nato must have always been anti russia and obvious goal of nato expansion is reducing flying time of missiles enough that decapitating first nuclear strike becomes possible
mark my words sweden joins and they ll put nukes in nicaragua
can nato deploy nukes to ukraine they were unfortunately dismantled in at the request of the united states can t we just give them back
the united states has nuclear missiles in germany italy and other countries it is logical that russia would make a similar deployment of atomic missiles
that man s face look like he realises how screwed he is
for a heads up these missiles were there before the split as well as in ukraine
oh cool missiles collecting dust that can already reach european cities are now like a few hundred kilometres closer collecting dust i m shaking in my boots
oh dear the missiles that can reach most of the planet no matter where they are just came a little bit closer

bunga bummer amirite
that sounds like blockade talk actions have consequences and i m willing to wager that sending maritime militia to harass international shipping will rustle a lot of jimmies internationally and within the region a fuckload for now i ll chalk this up to being another one of china s final warnings this would be a big grey zone escalation for sure
china s fujian maritime safety administration launched a three day special joint patrol and inspection operation in the central and northern parts of the taiwan strait that includes moves to board ships it said on its wechat account day special operation where have i heard that before
don t worry the chancellor has secretly dispatched two jedi to settle the blockade dispute
i would expect an actual response from the us if they tried doing this
the us will just send another destroyer through on a freedom of navigation trip they won t blockade and they certainly won t try to board
this is just the next level of grey area tactics that china have been employing against taiwan for years they re carefully and systematically escalating things with them so that they don t cross the line but just keep pushing it out further and further and it s working china s belligerence and dick waving is all but normalized in most people s minds
china will keep finding ways to be a pain
state sponsored piracy you say not even that far from operation ocean shield operation zone let s do it
lmao this is because the us just signed an agreement to use philippines military bases china big mad
can china just not for a little while
china is claiming almost the entire maritime territory that surrounds itself taiwan and the se asian countries they acting like bullies
who is china to inspect ships in international waters now poor american ship captains are going to have to go so far out of the way to dare china to board them
neighboring china is annoying
a blockade is an act of war that is regulated by international law namely by the paris declaration respecting maritime law and by articles of the london declaration concerning the laws of naval war
china always seems to react whenever an old or middle aged woman enter or leave taiwan seems like they re pretty emotionally insecure
love it good thing australia isn t ordering submarines and japan isn t bolstering their military
thoughts on this this is basically a perfect way to galvanise public support all against china international shipping getting fucked with makes this everyone s problem and crushes china s shipping industry which is hurting right now and is a self declared embargo by china against itself they are a net food importer madness chinese laws are not like we know them in the west they are transient to make a statement temporary e g all the traffic police on the roads from monday to thursday of one isolated week or a few weeks of that brothel next to the police station getting shut but then it reopens and business as usual so if this even happens tries to happen it may not last for a long time just a petulant short term thing
there is a certain misunderstanding what is going on with taiwan because it is being framed as an economic conflict the ccp leadership sees the kuomintang chinese nationalist party and by extension taiwanese democracy as a threat to its power as the legitimate authority of one china a powerful and independent taiwan will continue to seen as a threat to the legitimacy of the ccp an independent taiwan is a threat to ccp power as far fetched as it may seen the ccp claim to legitimacy requires a defeat of the kmt and final conclusion to the chinese civil war any weakness failure or loss of the legitimacy of the ccp could theoretically open the door for the rise of the chinese nationalist party which of course would be the ultimate disaster and humiliation of the ccp elite as far fetched as this might seem to you this is the thinking driving xi jinping how really far fetched would it be for the chinese national party call for free elections in china given the right circumstances this would be the disaster it wasn t all that long ago taiwan held the china un seat
sounds like a job for the uss ronald reagan let s see them attempt to board that
park a us carrier group there with a message try it
perhaps a us carrier should inspect chinese ships for drugs
oh look more thuggery from the chinese military
shits going to get real if that is the case buckle up knuckles
welp looks like it s time to sail the big ass pacific fleet through the strait good luck inspecting that
yet another ratcheting up of china s threatening behaviour
this could end up backfiring on them they are clearly trying to enforce their will on taiwan but if they are unable to enforce this policy they will look foolish and weak and given that the us has a high military presence and is incentivized for trade to not be interrupted with taiwan i don t see them sitting back and letting this happen while on the flip side i don t see china having the ability to enforce their will on the us

china is approaching the f around and find out final stage
aight no more iron or coal from australia let s see how long they last with their infrastructure crumbling around them
do the americans and taiwanese get to inspect china s ships
blockading taiwan would result in china effectively blockading its own ports of shanghai dalian tianjin and more
good news everyone edit i see a downvote so i ll note that is a quote from the tv show futurama and it doesn t mean what you might think if you arent familiar with the show
time for the us navy to sail right through that son of a bitch
america can decide to inspect chinese ships in logistical bottlenecks worldwide this nonsense would stop within hours
why does the chinese government have to be such shitheads the average chinese person is just like us they don t care about this political power bullshit they just wish to prosper and enjoy life with friends and family china could be an amazing good superpower within the world society if it wasn t for the ego driven hunger for dominance by the political powers
i know this may not affect america directly as a lot of ships aren t registered in america but fucking with american ships preceded a lot of freedom operations
what could possibly go wrong
this definitely doesn t sound good funny this starts to happen after china an russian have talks a month or so ago
china continues to act like a glorified bully and thug attempting to scare taiwan it wont work it only makes china look incredibly daft
blockade is an act of war
china can go eat a big bag of all the dicks
this is ridiculous just because the taiwanese leader met with the us house speaker kevin mccarthy the chinese should be happy about it she probably walked away dumber from the experience
it s a special quarantine operation
on what grounds this is another by china to attempt to control the strait despite having legitimacy to do so
pooh lost his pot of honey
i think that s a great idea the us might like to do the same in straights of malacca too o_o
fuck no
maybe we should send the pacific fleet for a drive by
the us better step up its freedom navigation runs
china trying to mess with the worlds supply over of computer chips is gonna be funny
i had this as my final piece of wwiii bingo
china numba
our country the us needs to shift focus pdq
let china protect their merchant vessels on their own then if they want to project power they should be forced to try and do it globally let s strip thrm of their ship it for free developing country status while we re at it
china russia and north korea are like adolescent bullies in a playground may one day they wake up
our blockade is perfectly legal xi gunray
good luck pulling inspections on a us carrier group they will call it an act of piracy if not war and sink the living fuck out of what ever tries
it is not a positive optic of power to try to bully a little island nation like taiwan
rhetoric forcefully boarding another nations ship in international waters is the fastest way i can think of to get everyone in the region on board with sinking china s navy given current capabilities that would take a few days at most imho if you don t count a few submarines that dare not move lest they be located in a twist of irony the leaders of china really need to read sun tsu s art of war
the us will do a big freedom to navigate exercise spontaneously board this aircraft carrier i dare ya s
and yet another step towards war and this one has real potential creating an incident resulting in death and an excuse to invade the world is about to get so much worse
hey xi don t be a putin leave the country of taiwan alone
the world is pell melling into war
why the fuck is macron in china trying to secure trade deals appeasement doesn t work cut them off from the world
taiwan s transport ministry s maritime and ports bureau said it has notified relevant shipping operators that if they encounter such requests from china they should refuse them and immediately notify taiwan s coast guard to render assistance i really doubt many shipping companies will do this on the one hand they are not likely to ignore an armed vessels demands on the other they are not going to want to be blacklisted by china on some bs piracy charges either
china is escalating the conflict
time to start inspections in the malacca street then
can t wait until i can accept or refuse this in a paradox game
first reports of their military build up along the border with india and now talk of boarding ships in international waters
looks like china s maritime safety administration is taking social distancing to a whole new level with their three day patrol and inspection operation in the taiwan strait talk about boarding ships uninvited at this point they might as well start playing battleship
its called the taiwan strait for a reason sigh
it s time for our game of chinese chicken
has xi considered fucking off
be a shame if chinese warships started sinking out of nowhere
nor will the us navy
wait didn t this happen with cuba and the world almost ended no no that s the trade federation s blockade of naboo
west taiwan should leave taiwan alone
so here we go i guess
well the us has an aircraft carrier down yonder
china can suck my container
the us cannot be the world s superhero yes we need to help countries to stand up to bad guys but if we don t have strong allies that are right there with us we risk being alone in the end our number one priority should be convincing our friends to step it up
blockade their oil for a week and see how long they continue with this idiocy
the us needs put china in its place forcefully they are as of right now an inferior force give it a few more years and things get more interesting they obviously have every intention of fighting us at some future point why wait until they are closer to parity with our navy do what needs to be done now
so what happens when the independent country of taiwan sinks the chinese boats
if they re going to keep pulling this crap it s time for the usmc to invest in some armored tug boats and just start pushing their ships out of the way want to ram and cutoff boats then begone bonus points if you push them aground they wouldn t dare actually fire on it
this was my fear china met with russia and said we ll support you on ukraine if you support us on taiwan
sabre rattling it never means anything until it does
war coming
america may have to start accompanying taiwanese ships in the straight
we re from the government and we re here to help
we re doomed
geopolitical analysis by gpt4 heightened tensions the operation comes amid rising tensions between china and taiwan as evidenced by the recent meeting between us house speaker kevin mccarthy and taiwanese president tsai ing wen in california this meeting is significant because it is the first time in decades that such a high ranking us figure has met with a taiwanese leader on us soil likely provoking china s decision to initiate the patrol and inspection operation asserting sovereignty by launching this operation china is demonstrating its claims over the taiwan strait and reiterating its long held stance that taiwan is part of its territory the inspection of ships on both sides of the strait could be seen as a show of force and an attempt to assert china s sovereignty in the region potential for conflict escalation taiwan s strong protest and instruction to shipping operators to refuse china s inspection requests highlight the potential for conflict escalation in the area if china continues to insist on unilateral actions and taiwan retaliates with corresponding measures the situation could quickly escalate potentially involving other regional players and the us impacts on regional stability the ongoing tensions between china and taiwan have implications for regional stability the us s increasing support for taiwan coupled with china s assertive actions in the taiwan strait could lead to a potential flashpoint in the region with the potential to draw in neighboring countries and global powers economic implications the taiwan strait is a critical shipping route for global trade increased tensions in the area could disrupt supply chains affect global markets and have broader economic implications additionally the inspection operation targets illegal sand mining activities which could also have environmental and economic consequences for the region
i am just afraid that china tries to board a ship the ship refuses to let them board and there is some sort of firefight and people get killed how to stop the crisis from esclating from there
anyone who stops and allows them to inspect their ships will legitimize china s control of the strait
seems a little small for a blockade considering it s coast guard ships and not a fleet of navy ships this is more like a gray zone pressure tactic on taiwan it also is not the first time it has happened either they did a similar thing to during pelosis vist source https://twitter.com/brianthart/status/1643802750327635969?s=46&t=hankklxiuqx_4gurqpukbq) there s lots of good info from this guy so it s worth taking a peak
this will absolutely escalate things with the us people talk smack about the us playing world police but since ww2 the us navy has provided a guarantee that global trade would freely move in international waters
it s not a gray zone though to anyone outside of china
if you re doing business in china get out now blockades are an act of war
china s actions in inspecting ships in the taiwan strait could be perceived as blockade talk and it may have consequences it could escalate tensions internationally and within the region causing concerns among various stakeholders this could be seen as another one of china s grey zone escalations which may further complicate the situation
smart move by finland nato
well we are entering anime levels of war here given that missile names already sound like magic spells must be a good one the israeli wouldn t use a name like that lightly
russia has done an amazing job arming other countries
ha that s a pretty cool name for a weapon though
man i hate the way these articles try to sow fear into the readers the threats from russia are so common that the finnish people really don t care but this article is connecting the dots between the threats and the anti missile system it s not like we were threatened and instantly decided to buy that system purchasing one is a long process and the threats have nothing to do with it the threats aren t news
last time they threatened finland they ended up joining nato dont threaten finland i guess russia never learns
last time i saw this i made a joke that runner up in that competition was mary magdalene s dildo and got voted down hard was it just a shitty joke or is r worldnews not the right crowd i thought it was solid
i wonder if this is the reason russia instructed its terrorist allies in the middle east to attack israel today with rockets

moscow smokes pole
ah the hollow moscow threats maybe if they stopped launching missiles in the neighbours finland wouldn t need them
given finland s history with russia they also should have a strategic stockpile of shovels and preserve open land to house the newly buried russians also need iron sights for farmers
russia just keeps playing itself and losing it s amazing to watch as it unfolds
missile names already sound like magic spells lmao it was originally named magic wand before being renamed a few years ago
half made my raytheon
waiting for something called excalibur some random reference to a japanese event or a god something called herakles hercules and a few other random names on historical and mythological figures and we d have a fucking holy grail war
finland threw away eight decades of being actively neutral to join nato while it may be a tad of a stretch to correlate one specific threat to their government s decision to buy a missile defense system their overall purchase is clearly a response to russian aggression
countries don t act like reddit they do in fact take threats seriously and react they just don t share their actions on twitter for twits to see
they were at least threatened enough to join nato and buy this system and russia is the only threat they re responding to maybe this isn t the best scenario to nitpick
if russia doesn t pose an existential threat to finland why did finland join nato you do realize that russia was planning to invade and subjugate or annex finland right
i mean they finland cares enough to buy a middle defense system if they didn t care or weren t worried they wouldn t spend the money
russia s never learned because it s never been properly humbled that s its problem it is an infamously proud nation with a culture of excessively macho chauvinism where even the government is obsessed with acting and looking super tough to the best of its abilities doesn t work internationally nearly as well as it does domestically but ask anybody who used to live there but who no happily lives in the west they all confirm this one russian friend of mine was saying that bullying culture is especially prevalent in schools there which comes as no surprise either i was speaking with another fellow anglophone friend of mine and he said his russian friend said the exact same thing and it s something i ve heard before as well especially regarding the hazing rituals of the russian military which as we all know always forces people to serve in it year after year via conscription it doesn t take much to find this out in the wild either watch some videos by the uploader on youtube they make fantastic unedited and raw on the street interviews with people in russia they clearly lean very pro western and anti kremlin and the footage speaks for itself sometimes it s bloody unbelievable the kinds of things people say and believe there many of which carry their statements with the same kind of wholly unnecessary macho fervour acting like russia is the greatest be all end all country which has ever graced the face of the earth now think about how you think of say germany or japan do these countries and cultures have these kinds of negative reputations and or associations definitely not and both of those countries used to act like this until they got properly humbled

their overall purchase is clearly a response to russian aggression i get where you re coming from but i d still disagree it s business as usual and not a response to any aggression finland has and always will keep up the deterrent of anyone invading it sure the biggest and only threat is russia but purchases like this are what we ve been doing for years and this particular one isn t any special or a response to anything we ve been buying tons of shit in the last years but there haven t been any news about those purchases and them being linked to some threats edit for example this particular purchase that we re talking about has been prepared since https://yle.fi/a/3-11617878)
i mean if you re a fan of tabloid style gossip writing instead of actual news more power to you
the key difference is that germany and japan were occupied and their governments were overhauled by the occupiers after ww2 germany was properly humbled and heavily punished by the allies in ww1 which just gave rise to the nazis who promised to settle the score and culturally the japanese still think they are the greatest people on earth just that they re not supposed to have an army anymore
that s a fair point
unfortunately no russian conscripts nearby that i can force to do that looks like i m out of luck

i think it s a bit misleading to say this is business as usual the last year is far from business as usual even if most of us have become numbed by it there was even worry in the government https://yle.fi/a/74-20019750) that if ukraine collapses russia might actually lean into it and quickly move on to the next target since they had nothing more to lose the possibility that russia might threaten or invade other countries such as finland was also earnestly discussed by the finnish government haavisto reveals yes this was a possibility first of all there was the idea of who would be next if ukraine s defences collapsed and if russia achieved its goal of taking over all of ukraine s territories what kind of pressure would be put on poland on the baltic states maybe even on the nordic countries haavisto says obviously that feeling was shared by the voters since we ended up quickly changing our minds about nato and subsequently joined i do agree that the lead time on weapons systems purchases is pretty long it s probable that this was something that had been assessed before but put on the back burner to wait for funding after the invasion of ukraine the military suddenly had a carte blanche for equipment and has been making deals for all the systems they need

very funny to read the reception climate change action such as this gets and then to scroll up and compare it to discussions of the protests in france curious
because that has worked so well when they did it the first couple times look i am all for promoting climate awareness but that s not how you do it all this achieves is annoying the average person making them far less sympathetic to your cause none of this affects the people in charge of the decisions that affect our climate
i enjoy articles on this topic so i can downvote every last one of the crybabies lashing out about how protests like this do nothing and only inconvenience people the myopia is astounding
arrest them and long jail terms
this is the only way to get the attention of politicians around the world nearly every country has been captured by the fossil fuel industry and its army of lobbyists who bribe politicians as a result people s concerns about climate change are always ignored that s why people have to resort to civil disobedience and economic pressure to force governments to act our survival depends on doing things like this unfortunately the people do not have enough bribery money to out bribe the fossil fuel industry

ironically they caused climate damage by causing hundreds even thousands of cars to idle i wonder how many emergency vehicles were stalled in traffic
not the way to protest nothing will keep me away from a cause faster than morons disrupting regular people and not the people whose fault responsibility it is just dumb
this is why eco activists get panned because the shitheads make international news
would love to see prison time equal to every minute of every driver who had their day ruined by this sentence goes up exponentially the longer they stop traffic
why not protest in front of exxonmobil or royal dutch shell s corporate headquarters people would be significantly more supportive of that
having someone to blame in particular for a very clear and sudden problem usually helps with that not to mention feeling like you re getting economically shafted is a feeling that everyone understands and hates the climate change crisis is simply a very different problem in a lot of factors and as such garners a different response not to mention the difference in the type of protest and the related goals protests simply aren t going to gain the same reception purely because they re protests it s going to depend on a lot of factors that s not curious that s simple logic
have there ever been successful protests and calls to action that haven t been disruptive
i actually agree with your first sentence while completely disagreeing with everything else you wrote these forms of protest are intended to bring awareness to the public the issue is they ve been occuring for years the public is fully aware of the issue and nothing has changed the time for blocking traffic throwing soup on glass cases protecting paintings and strongly worded petitions passed a long time ago these protests no longer have any noticable effect the action needs to be much more disruptive widespread and be uncomfortable for all of us i don t think it will happen until climate change is much more disruptive impacts the first world to the point of suffering and it s way too late
i ve read this comment thousands of times sounds reasonable moderate smart classy but fuck all of it fuck people like you who don t get it how much of a fucking emergency the climate crisis is how there s only time for planning mitigation and nothing more reversing or solving anything is fantasy since two decades ago if your calm person s preferred aesthetics in communication are not met fuck us you are not listening to us right
fuck you you should be annoyed you should be fucking fuming our children will inherit a barren husk that has been mined hollow but you re worried about traffic oh but the painting was so nice why did they throw soup on it just shut the hell up already and get the fuck out of the way
please confine all your protesting to the designated free speech zone in sub basement between the hours of am and pm monday through friday
oh no some people got annoyed what other ways of peaceful protest draw this much attention and it s also without any property damage we should be doing this more
somebody stuck in an ambulance would be more than inconvenienced
wouldn t it make more sense to livestream yourself tied to an oil refinery fence or road or anything
absolutely true
the problem is that this way they annoy the public and politicians and the rich make them the badguys without doing anything against climate change i think they should act more aggressive but against the right target buy a liters of cow shit and fill the kitchen of olaf scholz or steffi lemke burn down stuff owned by the highups of rwe like markus krebber and michael mller they want to dig for coal they can dig through rubble full of charcoal i dont think a single german would be sad if they would steal all the cars of someone actual powerfull and responsible and sell them in bulgaria
what an obtuse opinion clearly you don t understand climate change at all
it s actually the law to turn off the engine if stuck in traffic besides that it s a weak argument to begin with these protests are designed to disrupt and change things in the long term not to immediately stop all pollution as for stuck emergency vehicles probably none as there would be nearly no reason for them to drive there also there is a law to always keep a lane open when stuck in traffic so the responsibility doesn t rely solely on the protestors as there is always traffic anyway
dumb response seeing as the cause is a literal life and death one for millions upon millions of people would you refuse to eat soup without a spoon if you were dying of starvation just because it is a little inconvenient
same blocking traffic like that for a pet issue is stupid people have important places to be like work medical appointments and emergencies it s not up to a mob to tell people when and where they can drive
exactly what kind of activism do you want to see peaceful non disruptive shit doesn t achieve anything
and the non shitheads won t ever make a headline when your goal is to draw attention to your cause you have to make headlines even if people consider them shitheads for doing it
i get what you re saying but i don t think the causes are as different as you re suggesting both have pretty easy targets for blame both require action by the government to resolve and both causes will have little effect on the rich while disproportionately harming the poor realistically climate change is a much bigger threat and yet those protests have been way more reserved in comparison to what s happening in france i reckon the main difference is that this is specific to france whereas climate change is global now to be clear i m not talking about the protests on the ground i get why the sudden appearance of this issue would get people so angry i m talking about the discussions surrounding the protests especially online unless french people make up the bulk of these discussions a vague explanation like they re different doesn t really cut it and what really led me to make that comment is that i noticed both of these causes have blocked traffic recently normally this results in people slinging insults claiming that it s hurting the cause and otherwise treating that as a sacred red line that shall not be crossed it would seem these french protests are the exception and in my opinion that suggests the opposition to disruptive action isn t due to the actions themselves but rather the fact that many of them don t actually care about the cause as much as they claim
perhaps but successful protests in general would be orders of mangitude fewer in number than the amount of social movements or would be revolutions that have died in infancy by alienating public support it s possible to succeed in spite of it but far more likely to fail because of it historically speaking
maybe this is a psy op to poison support for climate action
uncomfortable for all thank you for your plan to make me uncomfortable this is for the best and will encourage india and china to change their policies on internal combustion engines and coal power plants sooner than which is probably when they re intending to i can t immediately see the connection but monks wear hair shirts in order to encourage the public to repent for sins so it could work in a similar way
on point
out of the way of what exactly i guess the fantasy goes something like this massive public support for protestors more than half the population makes a public display of destroying something valuable and then goes and sits in the road the european governments who are already very good about climate change take notice of this public opinion and declare that they will do even more about climate change the many many governments around the world who in combination are responsible for the majority of emissions are influenced by the europeans more than they have been already and make substantial reductions they weren t going to before because they were too short sighted and focused on local problems but people sitting in the road in europe and wrecking their own economies made the difference
and climate change will make sure millions people die if we don t make noise now none of these protests would be happening if politicians and corporations weren t willing destroying everything we need to live
oh yeah because shitloads of people are gonna tune into that
too risky these activists would have to actually risk bodily harm same as the soup morons they want the glory of fighting for the environment but don t have the stomach to do a greta or a green peace and square up with authorities and risk themselves with harm or hardcore criminal charges it s classic entitlement and virtue signaling of course when you call these fuckers out like that then you get brigaded by the at least they are doing something police
wow that s a pretty shameful and dishonest reply to his rather accurate comment
i think i m acute
yes because as we all know the best way to get people to care about your cause is to piss them off also your example makes no sense
define pet issue because as far as i m aware this is very much the biggest issue facing humankind and not anything to do with people pushing selfish agendas
oh yeah you re right these folks actually ended the climate crisis i hadn t realized that on first glance
lol green peace would like a word
i get you and i only merely said different because getting into the differences wouldn t be short anyway focusing on the online commentary focusing on reddit for ease of checking and specifically r worldnews right okay so lets start with the easy point the french protests are absolutely not the exception the israeli and iranian protests also have a lot of support in the comments granted the general vibe of the support is different i d argue but we ll consider that a separate point similarly there have been other protests usually against a government that also had a lot of support another example being the hong kong protests a few years ago which have included blocking of roads and etc we can easily check this and while i agree with your points regarding the similarities between the climate crisis and the french pension crisis they are ultimately not the same and based on my previous point we know it s also not exclusive to france to use an analogue raspberries and blueberries are both fruits they are both berries both contain sugars and vitamins neither grow on trees and you re likely to buy them from the same farmer or grocer which will likely also be taxed somehow by your government and yet despite all that people could like only one and hate the other like both like neither like one most or be allergic the point being that you re going to get different responses based on the differences not on the similarities and clearly they aren t getting the same response so we know it s not about their similarities so let s start with the difference between this climate protest and the french protests first big difference is simply the scale of support and members the protests have in real life the french protests clearly have a lot more people involved and scale does matter for how serious a protest is going to be taken fewer people are going to complain about a protest of 10k people blocking a road in comparison to like of them another difference is also in the goal the french protests have a very simple goal having the government not increase the pension age from to it s simple it s understandable and it is also very clear how they can get their goal this is very important for getting people on your side in general but a climate change protest especially the more general ones would struggle on that point imo for starters it s a global issue so even if you get the government to listen that doesn t mean they can make a noticeable difference especially considering it would take a while even if they could and i do believe this affects how people view climate change in general it s why climate protests such as against factories dumping waste into rivers and other bodies of water is generally going to garner a lot of support it s a clear problem the government can do something about quickly and it impacts people directly you can find posts regarding issues like these and protests focusing on these issues that will have a lot more support than this one would it has to do with how easily we can visualise a problem scale usually being a factor in them anyway what i think it boils down to is that a small protest like this is simply not going to be taken all that seriously and as such if it does something like block a road it s going to be considered an annoyance people will still support the general cause but not that specific protest whereas a large protest like the french one will be taken seriously and people can understand why they re pissed sorry if this comment is a mess i m quite tired we can discuss further if you like regardless of if we agree or not
eric shuman who studies the psychology of protest and collective action at the university of groningen in the netherlands and the hebrew university of jerusalem says protests such as peaceful gatherings and petitions that comply with societal norms are more effective at drawing support from people who might be sympathetic to the cause but if the goal is to change policy support among people who might otherwise be ambivalent to the cause then more disruptive protests such as civil disobedience strikes and boycotts have been shown to be effective he adds https://www.dw.com/en/disruptive-climate-protests-do-they-help-or-hinder/a-61379793](https://www.dw.com/en/disruptive-climate-protests-do-they-help-or-hinder/a-61379793)
bro just give up climate change is legitimately a serious problem you re not doing shit to convince them their protests are hot air they should be protesting outside of exxonmobil s headquarters but obviously they won t because they re scared
brain dead
nobody really tunes into this shit how about strap yourself to the top of ft smoke stack the problem isn t our footprint or cars for that matter go to where the actual problem is better yet since our collective governments are the one allowing this shit glue yourself to your local political building
great point explains the misguided attempts and what looks like lack of any real conviction
a few hundred cars idling is nothing compared to the massive amount of emissions we create daily it is entirely disingenuous to say otherwise these comments come up every time people stop traffic in climate protests like clockwork almost like there is a group of individuals that are trying to change the narrative on climate action
at least they are doing something to bring awareness what are you doing
sure it s a big issue however it is selfish to block traffic because you think people aren t paying enough attention to it when you want them to it s not a simple inconvenience to block traffic people have important health related stuff to get to or important jobs that can t wait imagine you re on the way to the hospital to deliver a baby but you can t because a couple of morons are sitting in the street
yes that s how change works it just materialises
lmao you evidently don t know much about green peace then green peace protestors parked a boat in a scheduled nuclear weapon testing zone in an attempt to prevent more nuclear weapons they block shipping to oil refineries https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/45015/greenpeace-continues-peaceful-blockade-despite-orders/) and they block roads too https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/greenpeace-activists-block-road-outside-downing-street-in-cambo-oilfield-protest-8qwk0j7wc) and they ve been doing that for decades https://www.upi.com/amp/archives/1991/06/17/greenpeace-activists-block-highway-to-protest-pollution/3826677131200/) and they ve been doing it all around the world https://www.haaretz.com/2002-09-18/ty-article/five-greenpeace-activists-arrested-after-blocking-road-in-haifa/0000017f-efa2-df98-a5ff-efaffa900000) what do you think have them the clout that lets them make headlines it was direct action
to be clear you believe that throughout history disrupting the public has led to more successful revolutions protests etc than those that have failed by alienating the public or do you just believe that very modern protests have taken on a much much different form impact than those which have occurred through the rest of history and thus the historical dynamic has drastically changed in recent years
yes fair point me making noise about the protestors is little different from the protestors making noise in the first place let them do their soupy thing
except it does it spawns a shitload of articles like this one that people read and go wow what a bunch of silly people but at least they are confronted for a second with the knowledge that our planet is dying and our governments are doing dick about it also people do tie themselves to political buildings
sigh where to even begin he didn t say that the idling cars created massive amounts of emissions he said they caused climate damage which is true the idling cars idled and burned more fuel than they would have otherwise you said that his statement of fact was an obtuse opinion your response was obtuse not what he wrote to begin with seeing as it was true you said he clearly doesn t understand climate change at all which is again obtuse he clearly understands it you are just mad at him for pointing out that these climate protesters are hypocrites which they are see then in your response to me you accused anyone who points out this hypocrisy of being plants for the other side which is ludicrous pointing out the hypocrisy of one side doesn t mean you are automatically on the other side your response was dishonest
perhaps just being aware quietly for what good it does we may already have widespread awareness depending what awareness means how does this or will this future tense if you like help reduce global emissions is the idea to get the majority of individuals to reduce their carbon footprint substantially the world over that s your plan
i believe successful protests and calls to action are inherently disruptive and sometimes outright violent suffragist movements civil rights movements labor rights movements apartheid protests have all been disruptive which successful protests haven t been disruptive
anytime anyone suggests to them maybe you should protest against the actual source instead of bothering random normies they freak out and lose their shit truly pathetic behavior makes me embarrassed to be a leftist and be unfairly associated with them their reaction is proof of their wokescold virtue signaler mindset you can count the number of actual genuine leftists on one hand lmao
and then they hate you for it and say all the shit i m saying this does nothing for the cause just like throwing soup on paintings
that was a great way to say a lot while actually providing no substance the emissions from idling do nothing to the total co2 emissions typing this message caused climate damage too so does bussing to work obviously the end result is that there is no real change to the total emissions of co2 why don t you provide a reasonable way to protest without causing more emissions
i appreciate your level of understanding of the issue here the depressing part for me is that its only the morons with moss in their ears that have the time energy to be activists i d love to get back to nature and actively fight shit corps and governments for their disregard to issues unfortunately i am poor and like having gainful employment and a roof over my head so i have to make the shameful decision of only voting for people i hope will help solve the issues
historically it s also the main reason that disruptive movements fail alienating too much of the public this has been true for literally thousands of years every society in history has been hit with myriad prophets revolutionaries reformers etc who ve attempted to enact change through disruption the overwhelming majority of them have failed because they couldn t drum up enough support that s basic historical fact and not a belief i think you are mistaking me identifying the historical trend that it usually doesn t work for me claiming that it can t ever work which successful protests haven t been disruptive to the public not many in the modern sense the delano grape strike comes to mind they focused their disruption on the industry itself and getting dock workers on their side and never turned their cause on the general public but still garnered large scale public support but i ll certainly concede that this was the exception rather than the rule taking risks for causes you believe in is not a bad thing even when chances of success might be poor i m not demeaning that but you also have to be realistic about the kind of impact your tactics can potentially have and that forcing the public to notice you at any cost is a double edged sword that can potentially come at well any cost
if that s so then i guess those hundreds of millions will suffer tremendously due to climate change
do some homework on where percent of these emissions come from there is nothing you can do but vote and pray you finally pick someone who gives a shit after that look into how much of what you recycle actually gets recycled stop sitting in the middle of the fucking road and start gathering like minded people and protest your government and the companies polluting the most
stop your logic is too strong for these kinds of people also i find neo climate activists all seem to think they can do the whiny white person version of mlk and it will change the world and completely ignore the history of climate action usually being fueled by either money or death and destruction
pollen is a huge problem in japan after they planted heaps of japanese cedar trees to use as wood then imported wood became far more popular and the mass tree plantations started producing prodigious amounts of pollen after they matured to over years old
ish years ago i watched an episode of a super sentai show where the kaiju monster was a tree capable of spraying pollen in large areas back then my ignorant childish brain thought it was lame and exaggerated how wrong i was
relevent part about how you wage such a war kishida s plan is expected to include more logging and replanting forests with trees that shed less pollen as well as promoting a type of rice that is said to alleviate hay fever symptoms the mainichi shimbun said
the world stands with japan against the forces of ah chu
i d like to join the coalition as a tennessean
spring pollen in japan is really bad eyes were watering and i was coughing for minutes even with a mask on when biking around last week
as pollen levels in tokyo surged to their highest in a decade kishida told a parliamentary committee this week that hay fever had become a social problem adding that he would work with ministers to devise a response we want to get results he said according to local media his comments came in response to a question from an mp from the ruling liberal democratic party who described the allergy as a national disease and suggested that kishida would go down in history if he eradicated it about of japanese are said to experience hay fever symptoms including itchy watery eyes and sneezing as soon as the country s huge population of cedar and cypress trees begin shedding their pollen at the start of the year in a study of japanese hay fever sufferers about said the symptoms made them less productive article continues
i was just there fucking hell i needed to blow my nose every minutes as i slept it got in my lungs and i coughed so hard thought i had covid kobayashi s nasal cleaning kit did wonders after the sensation of semi drowning passed yhe feeling of minty saline washing out my skull was surprisingly pleasant
as a german i kind a misread the first words xd
is this because they planted male trees primarily i ve heard this is common in many locales and is a driving factor for experiences of hayfever and other pollen related woes
i just read the first three words and that was the fastest double take i ve ever done
this has been known for a long time nobody is surprised that the cedar trees are the cause nobody is going wow you think getting rid of them might help absolutely nobody is even raising an eyebrow at this plan what isn t being mentioned is who is paying for it and when will it get done japanese politics are glacial and incompetent on a good day i will believe in the plan once i hear the chainsaws start

cedar fever cen tex stands with our valiant allies
for an example of how bad it gets here s an excerpt from shion miura s the easy life in kamusari which is a fictional account of japan s forestry workers i probably ingested more than a lifetime s worth of pollen that spring while we worked in the mountains pollen rained down in sheets showers of pollen turned the mountainsides yellow in the evening on the way home from work we looked as if we were coated in panko and ready for the fryer seiichi and iwao were wrapped up completely in protection with not an inch of skin showing except around their eyes behind goggles they wrapped their head and ears in a thin towel and then put on a helmet another towel covered their nose and mouth worn over a pollen mask they even wrapped their wrists and ankles to keep pollen from getting up their sleeves and pant legs

reminds me of the time australia declared war on emus i think it was emus
the names of those brave soldiers who volunteer to kamikaze pollen spewing trees will be remembered for decades
love japan but this cant be good
fuku yu paaren
so a war on nature
these headlines man had me scared after the words
pollen does not care about your mask does not care
in japan entered into a ruthless battle against tree sperm
woah easy with the words japan declares war x200b you f ing troll
the japanese start of strong when declaring war
sneezes in texan welcome to the party
we went to buy allergy meds at cvs today i was shocked at all the empty shelves we still bought some but wow lots of others are buying it too
deadass thought it said japan declares war on poland
haha i m picturing japanese airplanes clouding the sky ready to bomb some pollen
i am declaring war https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mztvmyqsl_w)
oh they re gonna start toururing the pollen
i thought japan had a pacifist policy
can we please don t do titles like that in times like this my heart did not like that
i guess it s more convenient than fighting air pollution
logging company buys politicians politicians try to save face
pollen is basically tree sperm so when you get hay fever you re actually getting raped by the trees
never really bothered me in south jersey on a windy day you can take a drive through the pines and see huge clouds of the stuff blowing off the trees gets into everything bad time to armor all the inside of my jeep
benadryl is illegal in japan maybe legalize it as part of the pollen war and that would help
shit flying in my mouth man i can t see pollen let s get the fuck out this country mothafuka
the newest covid variant i see
whatever
japan already had insane levels of sanitation before covid something tells me they ve gone completely overboard with sanitation after and i strongly suspect that this could be a contributing factor to allergies being on the rise
yeah it s definitely the pollen s fault for that
this explains the sniffling nightmare i am experiencing on a train home from dinner
i m glad i ve only got mild hayfever used to know someone s whose entire face would swell up it looked horrific
they love their cherry blossoms
policies hostile to pollen had great results in china just saying
pollen blows here in the southern us i had my window open for a couple hours a few weeks ago and the pine tree pollen is so bad that it coated everything in my room
while nk is waring against the sea
can we stop declaring war on abstract concepts
doesn t article of the japanese constitution the no war clause prevent any such declaration
i don t mind hay fever as much as i do a persistent layer of tree bukkake on my car for several months
this wasn t the lesson i would think other countries should learn from the us practice of declaring wars on random things but alright
one more reason why the japanese always wear a mask even before covid
this makes me feel great kinship with japanese people we shall defeat the pollen scourge brothers and sisters
come to houston for live oak bukkake season
the tree pollen is coming for us
california has issues like this way too many imported trees with nasty pollen everywhere imported trees imported european starlings imported rats rabbits etc not a good way to balance the environment
i ve been in japan for years developed the allergy to cedar about halfway through and now i hate the spring would gladly cut down or burn down these trees if allowed
have huge cedar tree at the back of my house around april if you look at them when the wind is strong you can basically see yellow pollen raining down from them those guys are the reason i have to pay for power washing pretty much every year looks nice though
i ve seen winds hit them and just yellow pours out of them i m glad i m not allergic to the trees i think i would cry
trees are so freakin metal
japanese cedar mountain cedar and other tree pollen is the final boss for my allergies so i can definitely imagine how much they re suffering
i was wondering why there was this pollen warning season thing in personas thanks
this sounds like that one movie
the wood is probably fucking gorgeous though
they are such gorgeous trees
you can use trees for wood
now that s a war i could get onboard with
promoting a type of rice that is said to alleviate hay fever symptoms ok lets see the peer reviewed study behind that
long ago in a distant land i ah chu the shape shifting master of allergens unleashed an unspeakable sneezing
dont forget about his father asneeze men in tights reference

georgia sneezes at your side
thank god for chattanooga allergy clinic
the allergies from pollen in japan are so bad that drug addicts are converting their meth back into sudafed
the white of my eyes swelled up today in shinjuku which is wild because last week in kyoto i was doing better even though sakura season is here
that is depressing news i have horrible allergies in places without such a bad pollen problem
deleted
cheap neti pot and saline packets are readily available in most us pharmacies i just wish i d discovered sinus rinsing years ago it really makes the spring pollen manageable along with showering before bed and washing pillow cases frequently on really bad days claritin d or a cheaper generic does the trick
i bet a bunch of dyslexic polish people had a mini heart attack reading that headline
you misread it and instantly started preparing a blitzkrieg from the other direction admit it
japan declares war on oh shi pollen oh
american cities have the same problem they ve started planting female trees around the streets and boulevards to alleviate it
i ve heard this line too
i m in canada and it s an issue here not as extreme as in the article at least i don t think so anyway
who is paying for it someone needs to start marketing japanese cedar as some super high end wood for furniture or something and begin logging them and replacing them with something else that doesn t produce so much pollen
austin is the allergy capital of the world we stand with our japanese allies flonase for all
i would read this manga
this was my very first thought on reading the headline thank you
elon could have saved like billion if he just bought 4chan instead

i thought they were only policing people talking shit about musk
and yet twitter stuck a state backed media tag on npr s account
twitter which has eliminated its communications department returned an emailed request for comment with an automated reply of a poop emoji a year old who think he s still a teenager runs one of the most important social media platforms what could go wrong
i noticed after the ukraine being censored story broke a few days ago that today ukraine was trending for me again for the first time in ages it was oddly full of russian chinese spam trying to hide any information so not surprised to hear this wish i could say i m surprised the muskrat has stooped even lower
elon sure caught a bad case of mierdas touch
what do you expect there is no one left to monitor the damn thing twitter has degraded into wild west of social network
nor is it doing anything about the indian propaganda bots swarming both reddit and twitter twitter has been accused of bowing to government pressure in india https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/twitter-accused-of-censorship-in-india-as-it-blocks-modi-critics-elon-musk)
yeah i think everybody could have called that imagine if musk doesn t do as the chinese say factory gets closed employees get relocated fees and fines get applied licenses get removed i know guys like jackie chan get a lot of flack for being subservient to the chinese govt but now musk is no different don t tow the party lie saying something wrong and everything you have is gone
looks like musks paymasters are trumps paymasters buying a tesla is not only bad for your country it is bad for all freedom loving countries
wondering if this is related to the labeling npr as state run which isn t true https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/05/npr-was-twitters-example-of-what-should-not-be-labeled-state-affiliated-media-then-musk-added-the-label-and-retconned-the-policy/). edit after some comments i m leaning towards china pressure being the catalyst
well twitter is just proving how spineless they are by letting those state backed media outlets run amuck on their platform it s like letting a bunch of foxes into the henhouse and expecting them not to eat any chickens but what can you expect from a company that s all about profit over ethics
i see musk preparing for the coming us election
to be fair fox news is still on the air so all of the propaganda is making it to the american public anyways
so stop using twitter it s really that easy
it s funny how naive we were thinking that elon couldn t make twitter worse than it already were just look at this shit pre musk twitter was a masterpiece of a social media compared to whatever it is today
gotta let the trash in to fill up the gaps when your platform is dying populism to the degree of russia and china s propaganda was and is never an alternative to proper discourse but it works as a temporary glue until people realize the indoctrinating shithole twitter will have become although this sounds super out of this world sadly that s how it goes because if you have an out of touch maniac governing anything really the sane people will leave and find a different place for proper and progressive discourse
follow the money a 250b twitter must be funded somehow
you guys how could they they can t even police accounts pretending to be hillary clinton they ve got like five engineers
why is anyone still using twitter why continue to feed into this mad man s megalomania
does this shoe fit is this how twitter is still running with so little income and not paying rent etc
ah yes there is the inevitable reality of being in serious debt to some horrible people and regimes
what do you expect from a tyrant he is so fragile he gets his company to promote his own tweets
i am so fucking over the bird and so fucking tired of hearing about the rat why the hell aren t you lot on mastodon yet just let the rat and his bird die in their self made irrelevance it s not difficult
twitter is pretty much a shambling corpse of its former self so that s no great surprise
elon musk is a chode
an international soap box owned by a moron used by the people we least need to hear from
phony stark needs to be forced away from spacex for national security
stop using twitter
and he s getting paid to do so dictators around the world are hanging him money to silence dissent and promote propaganda
have people caught on to the fact that this was the plan all along that elon is an authoritarian loving billionaire funded by saudi and russian money aiming to disrupt debase and destroy one of the most democratizing tools in human history putin and his confederates are still upset about the color revolutions that twitter more than any other platform helped launch and organize there is no other explanation including incompetence that so fully fits the facts
no surprise here even if musk wanted twitter probably doesn t have the workforce to
you know how they say that if you find yourself at a table with nazis and you don t leave you re at a table with four nazis twitter is like that at this point
both probably pay elon directly in exchange for influence
it s really time to take musk down another notch
ah that sweet freedom of speech that comes with a dodgy billionaire taking social media private the only thing musk has spent on for defending free speech is his right to call the british cavediver who saved children in thailand a pedo completely baselessly by arguing it s a commonly used insult in south africa what a pos
elon going full traitor not surprising in the slightest buys twitter but doesn t want to then has to and gets tax exempt in china for doing what he s been doing to twitter at least i think that s what is going on
why are people still using twitter seriously it s clearly hot trash run by a not very smart but very rich unstable dude who does things on a whim like fire half the staff why do people still use much less trust that crap
why can t people just let twitter die and move to another platform there was a big change to the experience after musk bought it and let everyone go
they literally removed npr as an example of what doesn t qualify as state backed media when they labeled it as such but left the bbc despite the bbc receiving most of its funding from their government while something like of npr s is federal makes me wonder who they re trying to please or piss off this genuinely could just be musk being a contrarian because he s the richest troll in the world
went on twitter for the first time in a month yesterday and my for you feed was filled with anti liberal accounts fucking kid rock was a suggested account
the bottom line with elon musk is the dude is just not a responsible adult it seems like his goal in life is to impress early teenage boys and the only reason i can think of for that is that he s a deeply damaged person and that he needs a lot of therapy
another day another example of musk being an idiot
elon knock off the shit
cancel twitter
elon is a great example of why his perception of free speech could be dangerous for one he shared a hoax on the assassination of nancy peloci s husband and him being drunk or something citing an unknown very controversial source then the crime peninsular question which he clearly misunderstood and didn t do his research on and simply stated what russia has been airing for years as propaganda don t even get me started on re establishing some of the most controversial accounts on twitter of white neo nazis or peps who share conspiracy theories that s just sad to spectate how a respectable person turned himself into a controversial oftentimes bully type twitter user
been calling this since he lost all that money i knew his anti free speech pro authoritarian investors like china and saudi arabia were using elon as the fall guy to take down the the worlds best platform for open source journalism
why has doge replaced the twitter icon this is another attempt by musk at cryptocurrency manipulation isn t it
but elmo moosk is the savior of free speech lol i pity the tools that fell for this chump s lies
i wish every non conservative would just leave twitter so we could stop hearing about musk and his stupidity
who do you think bought twitter
i ll make this so simple for everyone get off twitter the platform does absolutely nothing special that the internet hasn t been able to do for the last years people only want to be on it because everyone is on it as soon as people start leaving everyone else will leave and elon is stuck with the bills for a useless website
meanwhile tiktok is under fire
for the love of god deactivate twitter it s nothing but a platform for misinformation can t go a day without seeing them doing something shady yet you all keep propping the platform up
of course it isn t right wingers like musk love russia and china and are actively trying to destroy our democracy and replace it with a totalitarian dictatorship like they have
how long before countries ban government employees having twitter on their phones just like tiktok
the only reason twitter has influence is because people keep using it if you don t like the direction twitter is going delete your account
elon muck has unlocked autocrat boot licker achievement
elon is a fools fool
time to stop using twitter if you don t want to see state sponsored propaganda and other clowns paying for a checkmark
my offer doge coin
you don t police something for which you are an arm
what s the point of twitter now you can t reliably verify the identity of an account the owner seems to have the interests of other nations in mind it s still a social media tools millions of people use daily but it s been propagandized to our detriment how long before people realize this it s blatant at this point
nat sec issue they need the tiktok treatment
musk can suck a bag of dicks
ban tiktok why not ban twitter wtf is going on here
should i be worried what is china and russia going to destroy that americans haven t destroyed already
i think i m going to start a russian misinformation website that sounds like fun
musk is a chinese agent it s quite clear
explains why 40bil didn t matter probably wasn t his but funded by the tank square lads
dropped twitter three years ago best tech related decision i ve made in four decades on earth
seems like elon got his asscheeks spread by winnie the pooh that s what you get for heavily investing in the openly hostile economy that can nationalize your shit in minutes stupid manbaby cunt can t believe he still has a cult like following
people still using twitter
so how likely is npr to win a defamation lawsuit over this if their lawyers decide to go for it
birds of a feather flock together authoritarian types always dick taters apparently they re quite delicious
a south african with chinese and saudi ties has labeled npr as state run propaganda and is soft on chinese and russian outlets seems like something the fbi should be looking into
and that my friends is why i am not using twitter
blows my mind people insist on using twitter
did these people just realize that now lmao did the wagner ads not strike hard enough
so he wants favorable access to chinese markets and putin is his proto fascist brother in arms is that his angle
that s been overwhelmingly obvious just looking at the top tweets of any political topic literally across the board it s right wing nonsense
of course they aren t that would require staff
you mean his investors
if you don t police us corporate media be consistent and don t police other media corporate us media is far more insidious than chinese or russian media cause most people don t know what is actually being pushed with these other countries its very obvious
completely irrelevant irishman s opinion but it would seem both sides throwing random information at each other and trying to convince others they are the good or bad guy is honestly as bad as each other with one showing a bit more western morality than the other being unbiased with all information is trully what we should be seeking
twitter has turned into a cesspool where you can t know what info is coming from our enemies
why don t people just leave twitter simple enough
every time i read a headline like this it validates my decision to terminate my account
on tuesday night twitter users began noticing that the site had added a us state affiliated media label to the official account of national public radio the social network previously said that it would not affix the label to outlets like the bbc in the uk or npr in the us because they maintain editorial independence npr s name later disappeared from twitter s website trump supporting musk worshipping twitter users are they any other way see editorial independence and place that ideal firmly in the same camp that they place the fed the cdc the myriad courts that upheld the election the fbi the doj scence and politically inconvenient truths the persecution of donald trump and the reversal of that upon the liberals whomever they are since that s their interpretation of the word now as something bad
oh but npr is the state affiliated media sure ok musky boy
elon musk is one of the worst people in the world
twitter is russian and chinese state backed media
i deleted twitter just like i deleted facebook years ago you can do the same you are welcome
sounds like someone lost a blue check and is not happy about it
as a now occasional user of twitter for severe weather purposes it s an absolute zoo now it s like that one mall that used to be awesome and now it s just scary even during broad daylight
i deleted twitter back in but clicked a link to a tweet the other day and i cannot believe they are using the doge meme in an official capacity in the year of our lord it s beyond embarrassing my year old mother would think the meme was played out if you showed it to her two years ago jesus christ
what a shame they used to release full datasets from uncovered state backed disinformation operations we used it to illustrate how much money is spent by the rich to sway public opinion for a project to create a group effort to sway it back to the interest of the masses https://github.com/massmove/warroom](https://github.com/massmove/warroom). might be time to activate it again
even better reason to leave even better proof that elon s a corrupt sellout
meanwhile twitter can t pay its bills
it s seams like the middle e is about to go live
yea if they try to keep that rocket bullshit going hezbollah lenanon are going to get fucked up just like in
is anyone else unbelievably fucking tired of this same old shit fuck sakes
missiles shot from lebanon bomb gaza then _  _
gosh it must be so hard to be a distant spectator to violence
even more sadly is that it seems there would never be true end of this kind of mistrust and violence there would always a seed of brutality awaiting for next germination and here it is
hi israeli here yesterday morning a rocket barrage was launched from gaza which is pretty par for the course here but still major it only became a really big deal when lebanon joined in yesterday afternoon both of these attacks went unanswered for a few hours this is the response to them both
i understand you re angry but i m trying to show my sympathy for people subjected to unnecessary violence and bloodshed you re condescension won t change that
yea you re right this is breeding nothing but hate violence and hell
maybe your gov shouldn t be invading al aqsa just to beat up worshipers twice but then again there is a lot horrible stuff your gov shouldn t be doing
seemed like you were showing apathy more than sympathy
first i agree our current government is batshit crazy and dangerous i m one of those protesting weekly against it second though we can get into the specifics of the al aqsa beatings i don t think poeple with fireworks batons etc are peacful worshippers but even if we say the police just decided to beat up worshippers for fun which again they did not that would still not excuse firing rockets at civillians and dragging us all into another war it s a whole other level of aggression here
lol because that totally justifies random rocket attacks even assuming there was no justification for police action just to beat up worshippers prove it
i mean yeah there is a certain level of desensitization in my comment which is all the more tragic that this is that common sorry i wasn t as clear
firstly israel illegally occupies the land al aqsa is on so israelis and especially your batshit i d f has no right to be there in the first place secondly idf has invaded al aqsa like this before some people obviously brought something to defend themselves with although fireworks and batons are no match for military rifles thirdly israel had already escalated the aggression when it invade one of islam s holiest sites in its holiest month and brutally attack worshipers what do you think was gonna happen and don t forget the palestinians had locked themselves in the mosque they weren t a threat to the idf the idf like all occupiers just didn t like their authority questioned
kinda of an important point to mention though israelis alway act like the rockets are fired at random coz palestinians are evil rather than it being an act of retaliation by a people under occupation and abused which the rest of the world doesn t care about
the situation at the mosque isn t really relevant overly brutal police action does not justify foreign rocket attacks one is much more serious than the other
it s an important point to mention because without it people might thinking launching rockets at civilians is wrong it s like my mom always said if you get beat up up the stakes by launching artillery you re insane

washington classified war documents detailing secret american and nato plans for building up the ukrainian military ahead of a planned offensive against russia were posted this week on social media channels senior biden administration officials said the pentagon is investigating who may have been behind the leak of the documents which appeared on twitter and on telegram a platform with more than half a billion users that is widely available in russia military analysts said the documents appear to have been modified in certain parts from their original format overstating american estimates of ukrainian war dead and understating estimates of russian troops killed the modifications could point to an effort of disinformation by moscow the analysts said but the disclosures in the original documents which appear as photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries troop and battalion strengths and other plans represents a significant breach of american intelligence in the effort to aid ukraine biden officials were working to get them deleted but had not as of thursday evening succeeded we are aware of the reports of social media posts and the department is reviewing the matter said sabrina singh the deputy press secretary at the pentagon the documents do not provide specific battle plans like how when and where ukraine intends to launch its offensive which american officials say is likely coming in the next month or so and because the documents are five weeks old they offer a snapshot of time the american and ukrainian view as of march of what ukrainian troops might need for the campaign to the trained eye of a russian war planner field general or intelligence analyst however the documents no doubt offer many tantalizing clues and insights the documents mention for instance the expenditure rate of himars american supplied high mobility artillery rocket systems which can launch attacks against targets like ammunition dumps infrastructure and concentrations of troops from a distance the pentagon has not said publicly how fast ukrainian troops are using the himars munitions the documents do analysts said on friday it could be difficult to assess the impact of the documents disclosure on the frontline fighting now and in the coming months russia s own recent offensive has struggled to make gains in eastern ukraine and western analysts debate whether the russian military after suffering staggering casualties is capable of mounting another or resisting a ukrainian attack it was unclear how the documents ended up on social media but pro russian government channels have been sharing and circulating the briefing slides military analysts said the analysts warned that documents released by russian sources could be selectively altered to present the kremlin s disinformation whether these documents are authentic or not people should take care with anything released by russian sources said michael kofman the director of russian studies at cna a research institute in arlington va for example one of the slides said to russian soldiers had been killed while ukraine had suffered as many as troop deaths the pentagon and other analysts have estimated that russia has suffered far more casualties with closer to killed and injured while ukraine has had more than killed and injured nonetheless analysts said parts of the documents appeared authentic and would provide russia with valuable information such as the timetables for the delivery of weapons and troops ukrainian troop buildup numbers and other military details a document labeled top secret offers the status of the conflict as of mar on that day ukrainian officials were at an american base in weisbaden germany for war game sessions and a day later gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and gen christopher cavoli the supreme allied commander for europe visited the sessions another document includes columns that list ukrainian troop units equipment and training with schedules for january through april the document contains a summary of combat brigades that are being assembled with nine of them apparently being trained and supplied by the united states and other nato allies of those nine brigades the documents said that six would be ready by march and the rest by april a ukrainian brigade has about to soldiers analysts said the document said that equipment delivery times would impact training and readiness in order to meet the timeline total equipment needed for nine brigades the document said was more than tanks and more than mechanized vehicles that the documents could be posted on a widely dispersed social media channel and presumably get into the hands of russian officials is a big coup for moscow at a time when russia had appeared to be trailing the united states in intelligence gathering in ukraine the leak is the first russian intelligence breakthrough that has been made public since the war began throughout the war the united states has provided ukraine with information on command posts ammunition depots and other key nodes in the russian military lines such real time intelligence has allowed the ukrainians to target russian forces kill senior generals and force ammunition supplies to be moved farther from the russian front lines though u s officials say ukraine has played the decisive role in planning and execution of those strikes but early on during the war ukrainian officials were hesitant about sharing their battle plans with the united states for fear of leaks american and european officials said as recently as last summer american intelligence officials said they often had a better understanding of russia s military plans than of ukraine s concerned that sharing their operation plans could also highlight weaknesses and discourage continued american support the ukrainians were closely guarding them even as american intelligence was gathering precise details on what the kremlin was ordering and russian commanders were planning the intelligence sharing between ukraine and the united states loosened up considerably last fall and the two countries have been working closely on options for a ukrainian offensive but an intelligence leak of this sort posted on social media and available around the world is bound to harm intelligence sharing between ukraine and the united states

i d say among the populace in cambodia china and it s citizens here are not popular the destruction of sihanoukville for example that being said i think the article downplays the influence china has they re the superpower in this region of the world and many countries are dependent on them maintaining good relations with them is no more an option for cambodia than it would be for mexico to the us if they push hard for a military presence here they re probably going to get it
china should send their spys to north sentinel island
my god they have a flying observation facility swirling in place above cambodia this is the future
or stupid toilet bowl island hahahhahaha
if he s ousted turkey may become closer to the west would love to see him go
it would be better for europe if erdogan should step down he is a wanna be dictator that plays at both ends his country is in nato but he also helps the dying dictatorship species represented by putin this is insane turkey should be a fully democratic eu eligible country
tbh i expected his challengers to have fallen out windows by now
the good news is that most of the major candidates are pro nato and anti russia even erdogan however some would be way better for the alliance and for keeping russia in check than others erdogan is still one of the worst candidates on this issue he won t destroy nato or start a bromance with putin or anything like that but he s hardly the best choice if the issues surrounding nato ukraine and russia are your top concern the biggest problem he has on this specifically is that he s leading turkey on a bunch of foreign policy adventures that run counter to what s in natos best interest and are largely motivated by his own personal goals and religious ethnic beliefs in the middle east mediterranean and caucuses that are making things harder for everyone else
if erdogan should allow himself to lose it will be better for turkey and nato big if
no offense to turkey but i thought erdogan had a dictatorship built in is it possible for free elections there edit i am ignorant on this fyi
i would like to read more on turkish citizens opinions on erdogan here in luxembourg europe some turkish people have good things to say about him that he has helped to crack down on terrorist and better for the economy
i get the notion he is a putin puppet
if turkey joined russia they d have another earthquake from all the rolling graves
and if he doesn t go i hope the next coup detat actually gets him next time
how very un nato of them i for one would be fine if nato went back to thirty countries trkiye erdogan is consistently a piece of shit
there s a spot for him in maralago
it will primarily be better for turkish people investments from the west could come back if trust can be etablished again and with good economic policies
let alone guy helped to drain the fund for disaster relief that asshole is rotten trough and trough
one things dictators are not known for is stepping down
there are armed attacks to opposition party buildings in the last days it s just wasn t covered on r worldnews first one https://balkaninsight.com/2023/03/31/turkey-opposition-leader-blames-erdogan-for-attack-on-party-building/ second one which happened yesterday https://newsbeezer.com/greeceeng/alarm-in-turkey-armed-attack-on-kilicdaroglus-party-office/
you re mistaking turkey for russia in turkey they will simply creat a bogus charge to prevent you from running like they did with the favorite candidate ekrem imamoglu istanbul december the conviction of istanbul mayor ekrem imamolu and the ban on him holding elected political office imposed on the basis of a comment to the media should be seen for the violation of rights that it is and as an unjustified and politically calculated assault on turkey s political opposition in the run up to elections human rights watch said today https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/14/turkey-court-convicts-istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu
erdogan has legitimate security threats though in the east thus any alternative leader will not differ too much in bargaining over concessions regarding sweden s nato application on top of the disdain a lot of turkish have for the terrorist groups harbored there
last elections were regional elections and the opposition won both istanbul and ankara biggest cities in turkey they redid the istanbul elections claiming the difference between the candidates is too close yeah sure buddy then the opposition won even harder in the re election some people are afraid that erdoan will try something funny it is really hard to imagine what it will look like if he loses for me too maybe he will try stuff but i dont think he will succeed turkey always had problems with democracy many experts grade the country as a competetive autocracy well there is still competetion dictators do not get free reign they gotta provide some stuff to the people or dissent will arise erdoan could not he is losing the game and the opposition is not a one man movement they want to democratise turkey to european standards so maybe this will be it for autocracy in turkey for the most part
same in germany so crazy i know lots of german turks that are in favour of him making use of our democratic rights living in one of the freest countries of the world having all our press freedom and using our social systems and then still beeing in favour of someone who is against everything that they experience and use at the moment holy fuck so much patriotic bullshit they want turkey to be some dictatorship but choose themself to live in germany just go to turkey if it s so great don t get me wrong i have no problem at all with immigrants i just think it s crazy that people come here live here very good and then go on to support a fucking dipshit back at home back at home they wouldn t even be allowed to do the things they do here and there is an obvious reason why they want to live here not there that s ok but how can you then go and support this shit same with russians so many brainwashed russians here
better for the economy it s in the shitter
if that were the case he wouldn t have blockaded the bosphorus against russian warships effectively preventing further invasion by sea and likely saving odessa he s not giving sweden a hard time to help putin he s doing it to help himself and there s every chance his replacement could be worse instead of better i m no supporter of his since obviously he s an asshole but we should be realistic about what our luck is like
he didn t no fund exists that earthquake tax was like any other tax to be used as the gov sees fit withing the budget
and there you have it this election can t come soon enough
they just want euro to be high af so they can go and stay in turkey for whole summer and enjoy infinite money
i have russian family friends who say the same about putin they ve lived in the us for years yet still think putin is outstanding it just goes to show that a lot of people really don t know anything
earthquake tax so instead of relief it s really more of an additional burden
we all knew erdoan will do anything to keep his seat that includes using violence and terror so far the opposition stays resilient and are not cowed by his attacks
i d tell them to go back to russia if they think he s doing such a great job family friends or not i don t tolerate people ass kissing a genocidal shithead
yup everything has a tax in turkey
that man erdogan is trying to turn turkey into iran especially since he literally added turkish kurdish free cause party hezbollah into his coalition it wouldnt suprise me if this misrepresenting fool to use jihadist terror attacks to save his own ass
they are not criminally charged the crown is seeking terrorist peace bonds under such a bond reports the canadian press a judge can order the defendants to enter an agreement that they could face prison time if they don t meet these conditions which can include curfews and weapons prohibitions among others a terrorism peace bond is not a criminal charge but similar to a peace bond in domestic cases there may be a curfew imposed limit on who the individual can meet with requirements for counselling etc when kimberly pohlman another detainee was put on a peace bond last year judy trinh judyatrinh april
return to sender
justice needs to served
these women can t just come back now that isil has largely been defeated they committed high treason and should be treated as combatants
it would be unconstitutional to not allow canadians into canada we re not going to rewrite our constitution based off of this fringe event
high treason oh give it a rest nobody gets charged or convicted of treason these days but people like you loooooove to us the word for everything from literally worked with isil to i don t like the prime minister just stop you are ignorant of the law
you could pull a uk and revoke her citizenship https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53428191
in r canada this comment would already be at points because apparently the mob s feelings should supersede the rule of law
it s the same in germany so calmez vous svp
chilling and eloping with isis is the most un canadian thing ever though
these women are a threat to national security who sided with a hostile power but obviously you re okay with treason
are you surprised that the mob does not want to see extraordinary resources spent on people who ostensibly betrayed their country and actively participated in trying to bring it down that s the basic thought and if accurate it s a fair one the reality is that these things are complicated and few of these cases are that cut and dry this is why we don t have mob rule
this is about canada do you typically get snarky with people when they explain to you how things work
yes but being un canadian is not actually legal treason
no i m just not a convidiot who thinks legal terms mean whatever my feelings wish they meant
do i need explaining from someone who doesn t understand that things work the same here
aiding and spreading the propaganda and terrorism of a hostile organization sure sounds like treason to me
well then your return to sender comment makes no sense it s unconstitutional
are there nobody in france who supports the bill or is it just reporting which makes it seem it s the president and prime minister vs unions
before random people come to say french must work older is the actual minimum age for retirement you also need years of working to get your full pension is the age where everyone can get full pension even without the years there is a huge gap between working middle and executive classes about life expectancy and life expectancy without invalidity an actual average working class man live years after he retired left at for the average executive man it s years with this law only the minimum age is increasing so it mostly impacts working class who will have work longer years for the same pension and them life expectancy will decrease making the gap with executive people even bigger the law barely not impacts other social classes the opposition against the law is because it sucks and is unfair for the poorest

i guess i m a fatty because at first glance i read french onion
macron is finished but unless the french left pull off a miracle the next president will be marine le penn
and macron were busy to go on a ball scratching tour to russia and china
i must be missing something is this just over raising the retirement age from to that seems like a pretty reasonable adjustment given current life expectancy
removed
that s pretty much it people oppose the bill it goes up to if you only consider active population
those who do are either already retired or rich enough to retire way earlier both groups are very quiet in general
as a robber baron i fully endorse the maximization of human capital right now within my own country i m trying my best to bribe the political class to extend the retirement age to after all you only exist so that i can exploit you to my benefit
it s one of the laws that only make sense if you re looking at govt and pension plan financials will always be opposed by workers unions in any country but politicians will usually prefer it to pass because it means more money can be spent on other stuff
an actual average working class man live years after he retired and there is that concept of healthy life expectancy which is even lower for the working class it is pretty different to spend your retirement enjoying whatever you want to be doing and spending your retirement bedridden and in pain everyday
you are not alone in that misreading
up under umbrella utter upset unions totally says onions
big cunk energy https://youtube.com/shorts/_nhtdozgwna?feature=share)
yep
yeah you don t follow fr politics much he can t run again anyway he just won and le pen has never won her father never won no le pen will win
macron just recently won the election and he already is serving his second term so could not run again anyway
i doubt that she will be the frontrunner for the rn in it ll probably be someone younger like bardella
the reddit hive hind does not share this opinion you are stupid active workers to support every pensioner is sustainable
how s the boot taste
they and most of the commenters here should be embarrassed if only for their complete lack of basic economic literacy after france set a very low pension age even with high tax rates generous pension low retirement age financially unsustainable macron knows damn well how much the people hate his move but there is no getting around the laws of economics tax revenues do not grow on trees it has to come from somewhere so if they want to keep it at they re going to need to either raise taxes substantially and not just on the rich and corporations cut benefits or both one could make an argument that macron should have done one of these instead of try to raise the age but what can not be argued is that something must be done and i m not hearing much of anything financially sustainable or otherwise from the unions or workers
now realize it would have only taken a majority in parliament to override the law but the french parliament chose not to
three whole years beyond the ever diminishing life expectancy tee hee
correct me if i am wrong but i was under the impression that the money saved by this law is minimal and that they already had measures to cover the expenses of those years of retirement
the and years for men must be the figures for life expectancy without disability in france according to this report https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2021-10/er1213.pdf) it s years for men in france at the age of vs years for women male life expectancy at the age of is years and at the age of it s years insee https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2416631#tableau-figure1)).
i haven t seen that but yeah haha that s what i get for going on reddit half asleep and only one cup of coffee in
she might win in sadly if nothing improves or the left manages to unify she s polling excessively well lately
right i mean i only worked directly in the pension dept for a benefits service company after college but wtf do i know
removed
that s because you don t listen to the unions
that would have also mean losing their jobs so maybe repealing the law wasn t their priority
in addition to that it introduces more competitive workforce resulting in lower median salaries as a result
if nothing improves or the left manages to unify the left unifies what everyone save for those who would potentially vote for le pen years from now no one voted for hildago in the early rounds and she was left it s not about left vs right what matters are all those who are inbetween social democrats etc who can they unite and convince that they re electable and can build coalitions etc and that s years from now a lot can change and to speculate anything you ll have more luck and reliability in opening a fortune cookie otherwise it s blah blah bs
she does well in the polls when she s silent as it is the case since that attempt of reform started as soon as she starts to speak she tends to loose polls real fast
holy shit i ve never read a bigger self own than this in my life like just genuinely blindly using what sounds like a miserable and in no way profitable existence as supporting evidence for your conservative views you did it you can smoke weed pay rent and still have in the bank time to give finger guns to lefties who want to work remotely cause you totally owned them with your badass work ethic and success you rarely get to start the day seeing someone just absolutely clown themselves like this
imagine flexing because you can afford a steam deck fucking lol
also don t accuse me of anything either i m a socialist sure you are buddy also did you really create an account just for this thread really
shittiest socialist ever get bent
so to summarise you slaved away for bosses that did not value your time with fair compensation and are only just this year have been able to save any money from living week to week which sounds like it was driving you to drink too much and it definitely drove you to smoke too much weed and french workers should be embarrassed
sorry man you re never gonna retire keep working til you re dead
hahaha sure buddy sure
r thathappened
ah the anecdotal defense i see this very often
sounds like a pretty convenient feature
to make things even more twisted we don t actually know what are the exact retirement rules for deputies they refuse to provide them to the public or even the deputies themselves
not if you re doing something of the working population wants then you d win a bigger majority in the next election typically if the opposition thinks it s good for them they d force a by election if they can

not a feature a direct threat that macron established ahead of the vote
you represent yourself as someone very young arrogant but without any demonstration of having life experience typing goofy shit on the internet i bought a steam deck is such a funny juvenile response to a strike on retirement age this is about retirement bro do you know what retirement is do you have an ira set for yours do you have a plan the steam deck isn t going to carry much value into your s i don t really care just very funny
wealth when i think wealth i don t generally associate just this year elevated from living paycheck to paycheck
you re a socialist but you agree with macron raising the age of retirement without going through a vote pretty anti socialist lol
so when you said this is the first year you re not living week to week you were a goddamn liar and you were getting good pay all that time before but you just sucked much at financial responsibility that you had no money left wow talk about embarrassing

what do you mean burning down their city they lit one building on fire and that s it they are literally just putting up road blocks and lighting them on fire if they gave up their protesting what s next their vacation time their parental leave and more this is how america got so bad they got complacent now you see a country that fights for what they want you should be supporting them due to them supporting each other no one person should take away years of freedom of another person
i am morbidly curious to hear your definition of socialism
i for one look forward to the day of the rake and the incorporation of a few new american territories
that s what it is called when you have no money left over from previous paydays
you made two comments stating two different things that cannot both be true either a this is the first year you ve had money left over from your pay check or b it is not the first year you ve had money left an untrue statement is called a lie and the person doing it is called a liar that s cold emotionless logic you also said i told you how you should work and how you should be angry i said nothing of the sort another two lies you just can t seem to help yourself i don t give a fuck about how you work or what makes you angry and a self proclaimed socialist labelling a labour movement against a dictated law reducing workers rights as embarrassing i think there s another lie in there about your political views

no you didn t use it as a figure of speech you specifically said this was the first year you had money left over from your pay check and your clarification that no money meant about bucks that you couldn t save still means you were living pay check to pay check by definition i didn t define the term

so skynet will be started somewhere in india got it
the key here is yet india says it doesn t regulate the ai yet
there s a theory that when ai overtakes humans they will be kinder to those that enabled ai to advance to such a stage maybe india is playing the long game

just hoping ukraine gets a healthy dose of plot armour
ukraine understanding the effectiveness of foreshadowing
if the counter offensive does take place primarily in the south then crimea can be put effectively under seige i imagine any talk after that will be along the lines of evacuations and surrender
the conditions under which ukraine will accept russia s surrender have not changed all russian soldiers out of ukraine return of all ukrainians forcibly relocated to russia payment of reparations for all war damage and the surrender of all accused war criminals to the icc now that includes putin himself russians have to pay for putin s war
translation we ll talk about crimea once we have it dangling by one precarious destructible bridge in short we only trust russia to be serious with a gun to its head
he s doing this to also demoralize the russian troops who are defending those positions but simply want to return home wanna go home just let us take some land
peace talks should only be after russian terrorists leave all of ukraine alone
when we kick your ass then we ll discuss what you did to our friends you go ukraine
yeah yeah we will totally talk hang on one second though watch this zelenskyy probably
in a nutshell negotiate now retreat now and we ll save you the humiliation of being pushed out of crimea too
the conditions under which ukraine will accept russia s surrender have not changed all russian soldiers out of ukraine return of all ukrainians forcibly relocated to russia payment of reparations for all war damage and the surrender of all accused war criminals to the icc now that includes putin himself
after they ve kicked russia s teeth in they can talk about the staged exit from crimea because that will be the next region they take back no negotiating with terrorists
this is really good so at worst for ukraine russia will divert resources to secure crimea away from the other parts of the front
why talk to russia at all ukraine needs to take it back and all the other lands russia has stolen
i suspect there will be some ukrainian territorial concessions in the initial peace plan likely involving crimea however these annexed territories will eventually be returned to ukraine in exchange for the west removing sanctions this is my armchair prediction
russia will never return crimea and crimea is too well defended it s history is that of a fortress that takes an unfathomable amount of blood to take the most likely scenario is a partial blockade of crimea blowing up the bridge if possible etc after ukraine makes major advances in their counter offensive elsewhere then russia can negotiate to keep crimea and everything else goes back to ukraine pre war there just won t be the appetite for bloodshed for ukraine to try to take it back and possibly likely fail
yet the russians have no other invitations to a party to attend to
ukraine will not negotiate with russia until they retreat back to their country
ugh if they fail this is going to bite them in the arse so hard
take on
wow only of people in a warzone support making any concessions to bring peace faster that s crazy to me
alleged war crimes in bucha why alleged there are videos showing troops doing target practice on civilians
deputy head of president zelensky s office has said ukraine was ready to talk with russia about crimea but only after its long awaited counteroffensive had succeeded after we kick you in the balls and give you two black eyes and take back what you stole from us you re gonna wanna negotiate with us
if not plot armor hopefully the western armor at least helps
hoping the hole world gets some plot armour
they would definitely need it if they want to take the offensive into crimea https://youtu.be/mfydysyapz4
chekhov s leopard
if they destroy the bridge connecting crimea to russia then crimea is effectively under siege plus cut the water supply
crimea is extremely defensible ukraine is in a very difficult position if they try to recapture it it could very easily be a bloodbath
uh no buddy crimea would be very hard to take and even harder to hold most of the people there now do not want to be part of ukraine also how would they even siege crimea a place primarily surrounded by water under russian control
they need putin gone to get to that
the only two point that seem realistic in this list is russia withdrawing from terrorities not includong crimea and returning ukrainians russia is not going to return crimea hand over criminals let alone putin their leader and they won t pay for the damage caused in ukraine you can hope but russia won t do so and there won t be any means of forcing them to do so
if there was any justice there would be many open windows in the kremlin every night until putin leave via one
never going to happen
i wonder how many children adults that russia took they replace with pro russians claiming to be the original person
i m guessing its the hint at going back to pre with another year lease on military base
that might be ukraine opener but they will probably need go negotiate down things like reparations icc to a token number of minor politicians and probably some pre2022 land i want ukraine to get all oc that but they wont short of a total victoru
our land back
maybe that s what after this counteroffensive means
you accept all our conditions regarding removing troops returning crimea repaying damages prosecuting war criminals returning children prisoners giving belgorod gifting the remains of the moskva to ukraine s national museum and in exchange we allow you to publicly claim victory in the russian language
what about the lives of the ukraine soldiers that would die in the offensive
and ukrainian leadership knows that all of these terms will never be accepted by russian leadership it s just the negotiation tactic of extreme demands followed up by small slow concessions
sieging crimea is plausible if the bridge goes down at which point its probably cut off from the north as well ukrainian anti ship missles can make life hell for russian supply ships considering how skittish the russian black sea fleet gas been since the moskva went down the russian military can then retreat or starve
crazy to think that after all the suffering and death caused by the invasion there could be literally nothing gained by russia nor ukraine
lotta folks in europe thought their defensive fortresses were the shit right up until september
at most they might negotiate to demilitarize the region with the exception of sevastopol in return for keeping water flowing based on the demographic map of crimea it will be a boondoggle even if they did get it back i don t see it happening after they retake the east they should start a siege and then wait for russia to sue for peace
better not to try at all than risk failure s oh wait not trying means rolling over and giving in to russia s demands
it seems this rhetoric has hit its target you
you re the kind of person that would be screaming and crying for help if this happened to you people are dying and you re hearing screaming about propaganda this kind of behaviour is what makes humans worse than scum children are dying
because due process
to be sure the footage isn t fake out of context old footage recycled etc plus identifying those involved investigating who gave the orders totting up individuals crimes at the top it takes work you don t want them to half ass such important international operations we all get it it sucks that justice is so slow that s no reason to drop due process for bithbreasons of our own morality and allowing them to slip out of the cracks we create
i can t wrap my head around anyone being able to do this to another human being they must be so undeveloped mentally
if you don t say alleged before a legitimate conviction is handed out it can be slander
no no hole in world armour
that s a nice dream but probably not gonna happen it is very hard to blow a bridge that doesn t have pre positioned demo charges i m sure that bridge is covered by aa as well took hundreds of sorties to destroy a single span of the thanh ha bridge in vietnam and it was pretty quickly repaired anyway
i think the bigger problem is that crimea is now filled with pro russian nationalists it has a population of million but somewhre between half a million and a million russians have been moved there since since and all the ukranians and the native tatars have all been kicked out the ethnic cleansing of crimea has been completed and its gonna be extreamly difficult to undo
but it s also very isolated without the bridge if ukraine manages to take back the coast they can just dam the canal supplying crimea with water again and wait it out if i was zelensky that s what i would do not like there are many ethnic tartars or ukrainians left there anyways due to genocide reasons
it will be a bloodbath russia has been fortifying crimea for months the natural characteristics of the peninsula make it difficult to invade you can bet your ass it is littered with anti tank mines if ukraine tries to capture it will be a long slow grinding push realistically if they re successful with their initial counteroffensive push towards crimea they d be smart to try to use the russian as a good time to negotiate i e ceasefire we recognize crimea as russian the donbask regions are given back to ukraine without further bloodshed i could be wrong but my guess is ukrainian military understand this and using the threat of crimea invasion as a bargaining chip they don t even have a real navy to try and take it by sea
the icc should be able to provide that service for the russian people
more than just putin gone who would be the one to give up all that
wait you think they ll return the kids no chance not as long as putin exists will russia give up genocide they would be missing territory is iffy but kids i don t see ever returning if he s in power
this is why the war will be very long if ukraine has a great counter offensive putin will double down this only ends when putin goes bye bye until then war will not stop
plenty of russian funds were frozen last year they just have to be used for rebuilding ukraine
i disagree just lifting the sanctions on oil and taking off the top example only would be agreed upon in the western world no no sanctioned relief
if russia keeps crimea then i think the only scenario where ukraine is remotely happy is to become an immediate member of nato upon signing the peace treaty that gives up crimea as i ve been thinking about this i m not sure what other scenario is likely to happen in favor of ukraine russia keeps crimea ukraine keeps the donbas and ukraine becomes part of nato to protect from losing more territory otherwise if ukraine invades russia that s a very high risk maneuver particularly because western support is likely to evaporate
russia is not going to return crimea hand over criminals let alone putin their leader and they won t pay for the damage caused in ukraine when ukraine s army is bearing down on the kremlin in six months russia won t have a choice
but don t you understand i live halfway across the world and have zero relation or proximity to this war and its horrific consequences so i m willing to sacrifice the lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of people in order to make my completely unrealistic demands that are never going to be accepted but they do stroke my sense of righteousness
since they ve changed many of their names and possibly falsified or destroyed records there could be a long forensic search using dna if available
that s one scenario and maybe there will be proposals including a russian enclave or repatriation of tatars and safeguards for their rights but nothing will be negotiated while putin is in power that is certain
does russia get to keep the raccoon
it s war more russians will die than ukrainians slava ukraini
those don t sound extreme they sound like the bare minimum you invaded and now want peace ok stop invading and no you don t get to keep the land and sex slaves you ve taken so far
once putin magically disappears this will all happen quite smoothly
crimea has been historically very bloody to take even as recent as ww2 the same vulnerabilities to supply line disruption make it very hard to attack a siege is possible but an assault although very possible historically they have worked would be very very bloody you also have the reality that there are a shitton of russians there the population itself is now russian so ukraine would effectively be an occupying army trying to fight an insurgency it s very easy to lose the world s good will if they start displacing civilians that are russian that have made that their home for the better part of a decade i m not saying it s fair at all but it s the reality crimea is unique compared to the rest of the illegally occupied territories the russian butchers have temporarily taken over
and they mostly were verdun was a battle over a fortress
how about fucking doing it instead of pumping prime wartime propaganda just fucking do it cut off crimea cut off water for them bb any and all ships trying to resupply them instead of talking about it
the due process that the people in bucha never got
aren t arrest warrants already out for some of the war crimes that were committed
thankfully the due process has already been gone through in the court of public opinion hopefully the legal side will catch up soon
who else committed the war crimes come on man fuck that bullshit of due process
in the case of the bucha footage out of context isn t a concern there is no possible context that changes the conclusion checking for fakery is important though you are right shopping someone you hate into such footage wpuld be a good way to end them
no horrific acts can be done by anyone well adjusted people included that s why it s so insidious the holocaust wasn t done by finding the most underdeveloped and evil people in germany it was done by the carpenter who was conscripted into the army orchestrated by the worst people on earth yes but they were intelligent and knew what they were doing attributing crimes against humanity to underdeveloped people and sociopathy does a disservice to us all if you don t think you could ever commit war crimes you haven t looked carefully enough

i d think replacing a single span of a bridge isn t difficult but likely if a vertical pier between spans gets destroyed then you might be talking about an entirely different set of logistics i e its a lot hard to span 100ft unsupported than 50ft its not just double the effort its exponential
well that s because they were bombing it with non precision weapons the bridge was taken out with laser guided bombs and i believe laser guided bombs were developed specifically to destroy that bridge could be a different bridge but it was during the vietnam war that the laser guided weapon was developed
didn t they already damage that bridge
with precision munitions it is easy to put a hole in the deck with boosted glide munitions you could also skip that and fly horizontal against the flow of traffic the bridge is fine but flaming pieces of truck still block traffic for awhile i m sure that bridge is covered by aa as well so decoy drone then let the 20mm ammo handle the trucks also send harm to take out the radar that forces them to pull more away from other fronts
you re either woefully misinformed as to the capability of modern munitions or you re a vatnik it would be child s play to destroy a bridge like that given the right weapons especially given russias terrible track record of being competent at defending military objectives
technically speaking as a signatory to the nuclear arms proliferation treaty ukraine can apply for non weaponized nuclear explosives such as for excavation work deepening the kerch strait to allow for docking of heavier warships and submarines would be a worthy project and they aren t required to give notice to structures built without ukrainian government approval blow up the ground underneath the bridge with excavation nukes create a deeper harbor for war vessels and destroy the bridge all in one go without violating any nuclear treaties or aggressing against russia in any way they aren t legally entitled to under international law it s a win win win scenario
you re not completely wrong but as others have said precision weapons make the bridge easy to hit if it s in range and as for rebuilding it it s a highway rail bridge if it gets hit hard it will be a long and difficult undertaking for russia to make it usable again
russian aa is absolute dogshit though
all illegal occupiers who moved there after should be deported but it will be very difficult if not impossible to restore the original people s homes
but it s also very isolated without the bridge given that ukraine has no navy and russia does russia would be able to ship troops and supplies on pretty easily granted the russian military essentially has two left hands when doing logistics by anything but rail even so you can move a lot of men and supplies on ships
and how do you propose that will happen the icc is gonna invade russia
i don t think they can return the kids either because they might not be able to i doubt they kept a complete register of who went where when russian soldiers were looting and kidnapping through burning ukrainian towns
i m guessing after the war is over ukraine or any pro ukraine organisation would form a group to hunt down the russian war criminals and to track down and return the kidnapped children to their families
headline sounds like it was written in the 50s
during its initial flights the vehicle flew to an altitude of about meters and reached a maximum speed of about kilometers per hour the company said wow flying about the same altitude as denver just over half the speed of the world s fastest production car maybe if they spent more time measuring in imperial they d get there faster
isn t it a scale model at the moment as a proof of concept
well a rocket powered spaceplane is a pretty significant leap forward in space tech currently to get something to orbit we have to strap it to a launch vehicle and send it up a fully operational space plane could take off from a runway fly up into space zip around and fly back

xi said a conversation could happen when the conditions and time are right so xi said he d talk to zelenskyy inshallah
xi hi this is xi i wanted to talk about ways to create a peaceful resolution can you please just let russia take control of your country zel no xi what about a compromise you let russia keep just a couple parts of ukraine zel no xi folks i tried i really tried to create peace between russia and ukraine but ukraine is unwilling to compromise
xi will talk to everybody except the victim
xi cares about xi and chinese hegemony
you used to call me on my cell phone late night when you need my love
let them talk zelenskyy wants it so why not
day late a dollar short
lol xi wants ukraine to manage russia after it collapses

probably right before ukraine finishes taking crimea back
time to supply taiwan with even more weapons fuck china
willing sounds like such a chore
zelensky is like dude what the fuck
china will not support peace because of the parallels the situation has with taiwan i know it s not really the same and it s more complicated but they need that bloc to have their back when they inevitable go after taiwan so any peace talk is going to be similar to russia s demands regardless of what they actually think besides russia s current status quo of being cut off from most western countries via sanctions is good for them personally and is undoubtedly making them a lot of money
pooh only cares about pooh man not even piglet
this is why no one should have taken china s peace plan for the conflict seriously this is what conflicts will look like in china s aspired multipolar world them selling to both sides making no meaningful effort towards peace because the conflict doesn t affect their region and using the opportunity to try to denigrate the us
xi should help ukraine finish the job but zelenski is not an autocrat so that will never happen
as a muslim i chuckled
xi expresses willingness to talk to zelenskyy xi is pushing russian agenda xi does not talk with zelenskyy xi is refusing to talk with zelenskyy so clearly they are on russia s side yeah ok
i m shook reading this i thought xi hated himself and his country wtf
jesus i hate to see exact same comment under every article about china yes china care about china usa care about usa and germany care about germany you don t have to be einstein to figure that out
why not what s wrong with a country s leader act for his own country s benefit
i know what that red light mean
they have been consistently russia s biggest sponsor of course they plan to pick the corpse of russia clean but they were hoping this would go well and they could be assured the west would back off taiwan which is stupid it s impossible even if only america stands against them
western news were actually very hopeful about xi talking to zelenskyy that would at least mean china is taking a position but then xi just went to russia got a blowjob of his life from putin and decided he isn t going to call zelenskyy at all are you reading some alternative news
china is already supplying russia with military aid they are on russia s side
you re so smart wow
it should be reiterated though because people seem to understand this statement yet give india flack for purchasing russian oil from their perspective its perfectly understandable
it s only for his own ego not even his own benefit man s an idiot and fascist
is it his country s benefit is the country the people or the leaders or the rich
it depends on your perspective china is not just acting in china s interest xi is trying to do this at the expense of countries like the us who should be allies the philosophical differences between the ccp and first world democracies are essentially unresolvable when us interacts with allies it doesn t take such a punitive or aggressive approach
nothing s wrong but in this case china doesn t get to play their fully righteous global peacemaker card
nothing really but that also means he shouldn t be going around proposing peace plan acting like he wants mutual prosperity he needs to shut the f up
thank you
lol he s not a good guy but an idiot he is not
lol it s xi willing to call ukraine s zelenskiy and you are already asking about the country the people or the leaders or the rich x200b xi takes a dump after lunch but is this for the country the people or the leaders or the rich
i don t get it why is xi willing to call zelenskiy aggressive isn t this good for ukraine zelenskiy requested who the us supports i thought the us care about ukraine people s well being or at least tried to act like so
well they just brokered the peace between saudi and iran they just did peace not even about playing peace maker card
well dude brokered iran saudi peace why do you think ukraine request the phone call to begin with
i ve seen no evidence he is intelligent or competent he s just a whiny little bitch who has skill at bullying his political party from within
you brought up the country s benefit not me your horse isn t as high as you think it is
given xi s increasing economic support of russia this is disingenuous xi would love to negotiate peace this is not because xi cares about peace rather he would like upstage the west and the us in particular
he s just a whiny little bitch who has skill at bullying his political party from within wtf you think bullying up his way to the top of the ccp doesn t take competence and intelligence it s such a dangerous game and one wrong move you d be in prison just like his biggest political opponents and that s just taking power holding onto that position is just as difficult since he faces enemies both foreign and domestic who would want to take him down r worldnews really has been taken over by children lol
you care about disingenuous of a politician for a brief second i thought we are discussing xi s case for the next jesus xi would love to negotiate peace if you thing so ukraine people think so too i doubt where they care about his disingenuous more about the peace they can get
ukrainians do care about how genuine the negotiation will be as that affects whether or not the process is even worth their time especially as there will likely be a short cease fire that allows the russian side to further set up defenses china s hollow peace plan and xi s willingness to personally meet putin in russia but not even hold a phone call with zelensky until the time is right show china is not particularly genuine in its role as a peacemaker

the goal of these policies is to create maximum insecurity for the unemployed make them desperate for a job any job it s wonderful from the point of view of corporate employers an employee that can quit anytime and still afford food water electricity a phonebill etc is a terrible situation from a ceo perspective employees that know they have no alternative have significantly less bargaining power they will accept terrible working conditions or low wages they will fear speaking up for their rights or unionizing in germany they had the hartz reforms to significantly reduce unemployment benefits to quote minister peter hartz who created the hartz reforms those who refuse to work for a corporation should not be able to eat

so the government should pay thousands more so people can make a few more hundred a year benefit sanctions slow down claimants progress into work and are likely to force them into taking lower paying jobs that leave them hundreds of pounds a year worse off
i m having one of those man humans suck experiences this is like formalized hate
reading comprehension not on point today the first bit of the sentence reads benefit sanctions slow down claimants progress into work so they actually mean people spend longer on benefits costing the government more then when the claimant finay does get a job it is less good than the one they d get if they hadn t been sanctioned so the government gets less tax from that persons wages the government loses in literally every way the only party that benefits is the company who get to pay the claimant less money
in other words russia is forced to sell its oil to europe through middlemen and thus loses most of its profit btw fresh data from russia oil and gas revenues to the state budget of the russian federation q1 trillion rubles q1 trillion rubles edit for those who wonder where these numbers come from these are the official statistics of the russian ministry of finance https://minfin-gov-ru.translate.goog/ru/statistics/fedbud/oil?id_57=122094-svedeniya_o_formirovanii_i_ispolzovanii_dopolnitelnykh_neftegazovykh_dokhodov_federalnogo_byudzheta_v_2018-2023_godu&_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-us&_x_tr_pto=wapp).
this isn t new nor is it a problem we get to keep the russian oil while russia has to sell it cheap

at the end of the day it is a super win for eu it doesn t hurt us at all and russia looses half of its profit to india our best friend against china
if these are the total numbers and not just official the difference is bigeer as i suspected because of higher prices that should limit the losses
so western countries will fund any inhuman war aslong as there is a middle man that will not directly link to them western country is drinking all the blood oil from russia and then crying shave ukraine all day
still in colonial mind set west will fund any terrorist or war crimes as long as there is no link to them directly you guys are litterally funding the war by buying russian oil and crying save ukraine the also crying that some other countries are puppet to russia
i like your comment because i would totally be europe s best friend against china
colonial mindset fuck kinda bridge did you crawl out from
bud russia is selling its oil for a barrel and the price of oil is a barrel factoring the cost of obtaining said oil from the ground and transporting it to said buyer and russia is really hurting right now the fact that they are feeling the pain and bolstering their opponents fuel reserves shows sanctions are working
can europe give the money to you instead of india
yaah but the best i can do is spread european propaganda against china among my bunch of friends but i just got an idea how about you help fund mandarin schools in india so that we can teach indians the language and redirect the scam centres towards china
the article says that by the end of they had only five employees left do they travel the country and massacre old equipment office space style
making every employee s office space destruction fantasy come true
the monetary amount is chump change for a company like cisco but good on them for pulling out as decisively as they did
i work for cisco and they made it clear immediately that we would be leaving both russia and belarus they supported the people in those countries who wanted to leave the country and relocate offering them guidance support and financial assistance they worked immediately to get the ukrainian employees and their families out of ukraine upon invasion i love my company i am proud to work here in addition they match donations for certain ukraine funding and we have internal share point for ukraine support upon the invasion there was a smart sheet where our employees from all over the world would open their homes extra bedrooms one bedroom flats to incoming refugees it was so many people and so many touching comments like it s just a one bedroom but i am happy to share and i have a child who would play with your children if you have any we live by a park in poland or we have a farmhouse you are welcome to live there and bring all your animals regardless of what people think about cisco the people of this company care about eachother and supporting its employees and highlighting events in the us and around the world encouraging people to speak up do the right thing give back and be the voice for others yes maybe not a drop in the bucket but that was something they never highlighted what they highlighted was how we could help our ukrainian employees and help people who need it also talos which is our incredible cybersecurity organization has been working diligently with the ukrainian government if you re interested in that here is the video link https://youtu.be/czrjgym7sr4 it goes beyond the product we left behind we cut off service to russia including all software and service support immediately those of you in tech know that your equipment can t operate effectively if you can t call tac and can t download new software or code
lots of jokes here about cisco s quality or the value of this loss so i ll say it good job cisco not only for pulling out but preventing russia from swooping in and claiming a bunch of free tech they could ve gone the route of liquidating or leaving behind assets like many companies did article says they even destroyed furniture
jesus christ million that s gotta be like what a couple managed switches with lifetime subscription licenses brutal
if they had just left it intact russia would have just aquired it used it and attempted to replicate it
i ve known enough cisco routers to know that the difference between operational and destroyed is pretty thin
russia and belarus im glad the world is finally acknowledging that belarus is a nothing but a puppets state its gone way too under the radar in all the sanctions and other things they thought they could turn ukraine into another belarus and the world would ignore it
i m guessing the overall financial and nonfinancial impact is significantly higher from now on they will have to run all their enterprise networks on black market equipment that can t be updated and whatever the chinese can bootleg sure would be a shame if a bunch of their oil companies got ransomwared because they couldn t keep anything protected and patched
yep you destroy everything because anything left is going to be taken by russia the items and their cost is a minor loss for cisco but it s the message that they aren t coming back and here s the smashed furniture to prove it
that s how it s done
destroyed 42m worth of equipment that must ve been a fun day at work
til that cisco was destroying their equipment and didn t even invited me to the party
i all of a sudden like cisco more than i ever have
if you ever wondered that s what fuck you money looks like
this should be the way all western companies respond to putin s blackmail as we saw with mcdonald s they will just restart buissness under government direction
i love all of these it people on here absolutely ripping cisco s prices hilarious
how s you do that cisco set fire to the building nah we just pushed an untested firmware and thought fuck it we can spin this instead of fixing it
42m in enterprise routing hardware is a lot less than you think
so like routers with support contracts
yea at this point this is how you do it
was that list price or discounted price and as someone who works in the industry that s not really that much gear even if you go off the discounted price and it s also pennies if you look at cisco s total revenue https://investor.cisco.com/news/news-details/2023/cisco-reports-second-quarter-earnings/default.aspx).
good job cisco hoping other companies follow suit
put pressure on sales force sap and other saas providers to be decisive
well done cisco don t leave and leave all that tech behind for them to take and use against ukraine or anyone else or for russia in any sense of the word this is how you exit a terrorist country end contracts evac employees more or less and then when you can t borrow another buck you might a match
thats how you leave a country committing genocide
that not just it stuff it s furniture and such not a whole lot to cisco
holy crap that s like of their switches
do they have the ability to remote brick switches this is probably the one time i wouldn t be against it
there were reports that another us tech company did the same but before deciding to leave russia their manufacturing centre had a suspicious fire that destroyed half of their operation after a night of knocking down the fire a massive flare up happened the next night that burnt down the rest of the building oddly enough the company had shipped out most of their computer hardware the month prior and destroyed most of their documents they said they sent their computers and records to an offsite location as part of their disaster recovery risk management plan
that is actually pretty stand up especially compared to many of the other large asshole companies
this is what you do to prevent equipment from falling into the hands of the enemy
take a byte out of crimea
mill of cisco equipment is about server room haha
fellow cisconian here can confirm this is the place to work and feel good about it can t say enough good things about working here
lovely that everybody roasts the pricing of the cisco systems just hilarious
if you re wondering companies that have a lot of locations starbucks hotels cisco makes a mint on them they also purchase smaller competitors
those last few weeks must have been a fun time to be working there
talking with a boeing employee and i hear that they did the same thing
as much as i want to hate on cisco that s pretty respectable
russia oh you talked to jeff cisco yeah it s cool there s gonna be new shit here in mins it s a lot nicer than this c mon guys keep it coming
it seems that cisco systems took drastic measures to dispose of their equipment in russia with only a handful of employees left by the end of office space style indeed
they should have sent out a patch that bricked all their hardware while at it
considering the sheer amount of backdoors and security issues in cisco equipement it wouldn t surprise me if russias infrastructure is now more secure on average than before
23million so they destroyed a few access points and a switch p
destroyed so they bricked them
so like switches and six aps
they are one of my customers love that they did this my company pulled out our product and services as well not having our product definitely makes everyday life a little harder for russia so glad we could help to contribute to the pain
i d like to picture the cisco employees walked out setting off bombs like heath ledger s joker in the dark knight
if anyone tries to call the russian cisco offices now it ll just be a never ending loop of their hold music
this actually has nothing to do with the war in ukraine russia just refused to convert to smart licensing
wow looks like russia is losing yet another valuable company i wonder what s next on the list
they could probably do some interesting things with firmware updates downloaded from russia too
that number is suspiciously full of significant digits
removed
here they are doing it https://imgur.com/qlpgg0u.jpg)
after the war russia will be in a worse state than the soviet collapse at least back then there was still some internal industry and robust manufacturing
we need to support the companies that do this and shun the ones who stayed
soooo layer switches a smart screen and phones meh their shit s expensive yo
brave and principled patriotic stand good on you cisco
they office spaced russia
wow even destroyed the spare inventory in russia before they pulled out that is amazing mad respect to cisco
that s like dwdms with modules each they probably sell that to ixps and corporate data centers in an hour
at least that s how it was listed under assets on the balance sheet no further questions
so routers
if they really wanted to punish russia they should ve left the equipment intact although being forced to use cisco apis is probably against the geneva convention
regular day for cisco with their equipment being proprietary
i see lot of people belittling the price in here that is not a small price tag stop evaluating it relative to the company s worth and start thinking about it in real terms i can assure you cisco did that is a hell of a sacrifice
we love to see it
cisco trying to undo decades of bad reps from tech workers
smart move i gotta felling russia is going to to turn into a north korea like state whether they win or lose in ukraine
didn t cisco dang near build the great firewall let me know if i m wrong but this seems like a weird play
so like a dozen nvidia gpus
couldn t they like send that equipment elsewhere
let it all burn they just gained a new fan
now this is how you cut a business relationship
cisco can swallow that cost easily that s just chump change to them the but message is clear good on them
that s billion dollars in umbrella licensing if you want to know the real cost to cisco
you mean they didn t just leave it all behind for the enemy to use
that s about six routers and switches lol
hands down the best hold music of all time https://youtu.be/pais41iw5dk)
maybe we will see american businesses come back home and the government will stop playing hero with tax dollars
23m retail thats about 500k to 750k incremental manufacturing cost or the fully loaded cost of about full time employees for a year
right on cisco i will continue to buy your routers with pride so rare a company does something right that isn t an accident
here s another reminder heinekin supports russia s war crimes they could do this too but they refuse to follow through with their fake promise they think you re going to forget about russias war crimes
so two managed switches and an access point were destroyed
a true american company a real guidepost for corporate america go cisco
so that s like what or aci leaf switches
i need that kind of job
so i used to work with cisco in russia and might be able to speak to this essentially cisco switches and routers and some of the software on them are considered top of the line over there the cheaper russian companies will use stuff from china but the top of the line russian companies will only use cisco russia was a big market for them traditionally this stuff would be rma and it would be sent back to cisco who would either resell it or destroy it in the us some companies will allow customers or distributors to destroy the equipment but they need to provide evidence of destruction like a photo to receive it if they want to get compensation so companies like cisco know that it hasn t been sold on the grey market in this case here the war in ukraine obviously created the need for cisco to leave russia quickly in order to comply with sanctions and the transportation cost of shipping all that shit to the us was too expensive cisco likely had all their distributors ship their remaining equipment to their central warehouse outside moscow which i ve actually been to once there it would be documented and destroyed office space style and someone in cisco s main headquarters will need to review all the evidence then tick and tie it with known inventory levels by sku note that this stuff will be in pallets with unique serial numbers so it s not like someone is reviewing every single router destroyed more like every single pallet with routers in it tl dr yes it got destroyed office space style in a sketchy russian warehouse likely by several rotund middle aged russian men the actual auditing and accounting of this was more complex than you d think
cisco sledgehammer certified
this might be the worst article ever written
nah at cisco s list prices that 4m of equipment they destroyed is basically two switches a router a handful of qsfp28s and years of dnac licensing up front one guy one bat one afternoon the other four were off raising venture capital to back their latest spinoff ruznov systems
pc load letter what the fuck does that mean
we need a tv show about this
ideally you d destroy it in such a way that it looks repairable or salvageable so russians waste extra effort trying to fix it back up
sounds like an interesting job indeed but remember it s important to follow proper procedures and regulations for equipment disposal to protect the environment
must be a remote kill switch

shouldn t have ignored yesterday s gazan rockets the iranians and their allies are smelling this government s weakness
it makes me sad when there is not peace
look at lebanon trying to make explosions in other countries now glad they re moving forward from the beirut tragedy and the ensuing destabilization of their own government good time to be starting a fight yea
stay safe dude
i m sorry you re going through this
removed
the situation in lebanon is terrible i wouldn t be surprised if this was an attempt by the government to get everyone angry at a common enemy launch rockets at israel wait for them to strike back and now you ve got a nice scapegoat to make everybody forget about your own shortcomings
lol endgame isn t on anyone s mind neither sides have been acting towards realistically ending the conflict in many many years they even benefit from it in several different ways
the problem is that there is no original border or agreement think about it before it was ottoman then british mandate land in the un drew up maps but the palestinians rejected them immediately and the arab armies invaded there wasnt even a jordan back then so no external borders to rely on then it was a string or wars even the lines people talk about is just a status quo that existed after a war with nobody really being happy about it current borders are de facto borders as opposed to agreed upon borders israel has a nice track record with giving land for peace with egypt and with jordan they have proven they re willing to do that when they withdrew from gaza unilaterally i imagine a similar approach is very possible in terms of solving things with syria lebanon and the palestinians but that requires a stable government that can reign in their local militants and terrorist groups and currently none of the three i mentioned can or even want to do that unfortunately the forecast looks pretty shit until there s political change in those countries
they all think they serve god so they ll kill people until god shows up sounds stupid it is
arab nations and terrorist organizations have made their objectives clear decades ago the destruction of israel and genocide against the jews organizations like hamas have this written in their charter for israel the end game is just to survive and protect its citizens
my religion owns the holy land so my story will come true religion makes people nuts
my book is better then your book burn in hell infidel s
violence begets violence is in some book i can t remember where i read it
yeah that s decades of being sad for a lot of us over here
all the people sitting in buildings talking about a god love peace happiness those are the people keeping us from peace stop believing in peace after life and make peace here for fucks sake it s not complicated
isn t the rocket shot by palestinians refugees
thoughts and prayers lmao
ah please don t let me ruin your enjoyment of a decades long military conflict i m sure there ll be plenty more action for you to come soon enough
doubt anything could unite us heck we nearly had a civil war because of the fucking time half the country postponed daylight saving time and the other half followed through with it and we had time zones depending on who you asked
don t forget israel s endgame of stealing as much land as possible and commiting genocide against palestinians
isn t it that like their religion holds the holy land so now my god will bring about the end of the world
it s not a religous war it s an ethnic conflict between groups which also happen to have different religions in fact most major wars in the history of this conflict have been fought under secular nationalistic regimes
the my god has a bigger dick than your god theorem
apparently containment also begets violence so if the result is all the same might as well punch the other guy too
yes it was palestinian refugees
israel can steal all the land they want in days if they wanted to steal it that much
everything you said is a lie
my reply was just that a reply it s scope being the post above it while what you said is true it does not take away anything from my post
my imaginary friend is harder than your imaginary friend there all fixed
well of course one of them is circumcised
i actually want the world to end so i can t wait
and most westerners support them doing so meanwhile suing gazprom will make russians want to kill you
these are bad faith actions by the government the international oil companies have invested over billion in developing these fields and the government is now trying to change the deal terms deal terms that wouldn t have been good enough for the companies to invest the billion if they had been there initially and where did xom and shell get this huge amount of money to invest from our 401k retirement funds so when governments try to screw over major oil companies it is you and me who are getting screwed
hi nephronum your submission from bloomberg com is behind a metered paywall a metered paywall http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paywall#.22soft.22_paywalls) allows users to view a specific number of articles before requiring paid subscription articles posted to r worldnews should be accessible to everyone while your submission was not removed it has been flaired and users are discouraged from upvoting it or commenting on it for more information see our wiki page on paywalls r worldnews wiki paywalls please try to find another source if there is no other news site reporting on the story contact the moderators i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r worldnews if you have any questions or concerns
that s not at all what the article says it says that they are violating the terms of tender it s also far far from the first time these companies have abused their host actions one way or another when a country agrees to have them come in and set up oil operations it results in a colonial situation where the companies profit and the countries get a cut she ll is a dutch company that doesn t do shit to your 401k and 401ks are a scam to get people investing in the stock market with their retirement savings which results in stupid shit like voting for trump because people think the president has a magic wand that determines what the economy does
do you even understand how oil concessions work whether it is a production service contract a fixed or variable royalty or whatever form it is a contract between the state and the mnoc the mnoc provides capital and technical expertise and is allowed to explore for develop and produce oil and gas in a fixed geographical region by the state the state gets the vast majority of the revenue but the mnoc is generally allowed cost recovery what is likely happening here is that the state is trying to get some of the cost recovery revenue from the mnoc it is classic behavior by oil producing nations get mnoc to invest huge amounts of capital and then renegotiate the contract
not if you read the article the claim is that the agreement has been violated and yes i understand oil concessions they are corporate colonialism let us help you we help ourselves permanently and give you some
while destroying your environment with toxic run off n wastes and pretending they don t know anything about that so no point in asking for cleanup costs
wait gaza is in the south west while lebanon is to the north
sure changed the conversation off of the israeli supreme court
apparently south lebanon is being hit by airstrikes right now reports of explosions in civilian districts
israel taking it s anger out on palestinians once again
iron dome failed to intercept a good amount seems the opposition got a hardware upgrade
hamas launched the rockets from lebanon so they re striking hamas targets
they re striking hamas and pij targets as well as some of the other minor militas unconfirmed reports of planes over southern lebanon as well
cmon lebanon got enough of their own shit to deal with they ain got no time for israel it was hamas that attacked from lebanon
hamas also launched rockets from gaza confusing headline
what a strange coincidence
man nobody plays the victim card harder than palestinians they can literally shoot dozens of rockets unprovoked and still manage to be the oppressed victims and everyone buys it it s astonishing
rofl more like israel attacking military targets after they discriminately fire at civilians during the holiest time of the year its beyond ironic how much muslims bitch and whine about respecting their religion and then try to pull this shit
because the palestinian terrorist organization called hamas fired rockets at israel unprovoked from lebanon so israel is going after their leadership and known targets in gaza too this is very simple unless maybe you have an agenda to push hmm
damn imagine poking a bear with a stick and expecting the bear not to be pissed off and taking out his anger at you
most of the projectiles were intercepted but there were two minor injuries and a fire
the planes are there my parents live there
not to mention they love using children as human shields and report year olds as below so it looks like more children die as a result of isreali strikes
unprovoked cognitive bias much
the never ending encroachment into palestine isn t provocation
why was there a fire and injuries
hope they stay safe
israel left gaza in unilaterally withdrew all of their citizens and forces and handed over the entire territory to the gaza palestinians and even helped them set up elections the palestinians there then elected hamas which is a terrorist organization that it instantly declared they would never cooperate with israel and that their goal is to wipe out israel and have been attacking israel ever since nearing two decades now of constant belligerence despite all that and the nearly constant rocket fire hamas sends at israel from gaza hoping to kill literally whoever they hit israel has not retaken one square meter of the territory they handed the palestinians in gaza in so how exactly is israel encroaching upon gaza then
nothing is but i d say it s doing a fairly good job considering the circumstances
because the iron dome wanted a break it works too much and thoughts of unionization are in the air
because most doesn t equal all
i mean it seems like every month i hear about a new settlement into palestine are you just splitting hairs by saying they are technically not going into the one particular area they said they would not
it refused to shoot rockets in protest of the controversial judicial reform
so you re admitting now that you have no idea what the difference is between gaza and the west bank never mind the nuances of israeli and palestinian plo control in the west bank such as areas a b and c please stop commenting in this thread you re far too uninformed to have any useful input i suggest you spend the time instead learning about the palestinian territories starting when the arabs rejected the un partition plan and tried to murder all the jews in their midst in pay particular attention to what happened after their later attempt to do the same thing in as the result of that attempted genocide against the israelis led directly to the current borders on the west bank and the west bank is not gaza literally fundamentally different situations in almost every way imaginable
doesn t sound like you have any kind of unbiased view on the situation and you seem to be trying really hard to avoid simple questions nice insults though from amnesty international in march the un special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the opt determined that the political system of entrenched rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for the existence of apartheid in november the un special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing reached the same conclusion in relation to israel s policies of home demolitions some states including south africa condemned israeli apartheid echoing statements by palestinian israeli and international human rights organizations amnesty international is an international non governmental organization focused on human rights with its headquarters in the united kingdom
wow you didn t just shift the goal posts in the topic you ripped them out and placed them in a completely different stadium
who was the one saying there was no provocation who couldn t answer the simple question of whether encroachment didn t constitute provocation what do you think home demolitions are
why do you think any home demolitions are occurring in gaza oh right we already established it you re clueless about the palestinian territories

previous post https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12b8gmu/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jezchq1/) day of my updates from kharkiv the past days were pretty quiet yet again there were no missile or drone strikes and the air raid alerts were quite rare too sometimes people also report hearing explosions which actually end up being the sounds of our military conducting exercises somewhere not so far away from the city it s nothing to worry about but it still startles people because you never really expect it continuing the story of a guy with a grenade from days ago it looks like he actually ended up killing himself with it there were conflicting reports at first but a bit later our police reported that he actually died because the grenade exploded in his hand though thankfully nobody else was harmed this is the second time that someone has died from a grenade in our city in just the last month which is just horrible that story about our military s documents being leaked is honestly pretty weird the troop death numbers are obviously made up but also why would they publish the leaks in the first place if it was something important that they can use against us if they have a spy that obtained highly classified documents for them then why would they blow his cover by releasing those documents for their enemies to see that just seems so stupid but i guess they think a leak like that might delay our counteroffensive

this a school basement in a chernihiv village that russians turned into a concentration camp i visited it today and i listened to survivors for hours shocked in disbelief the media narratives do not do the justice to what happened there on the first day of occupation russians rounded everyone alive and put them in this basement there were almost people for sq meters more than people per sq meter they stayed there for a month russians killed about people on the first day to instill fear on the walls in the basement there are numbers of people kept in a room in this one there were people with children see the sign on the left the person who showed us the basement ivan he is a survivor he told us they would let people out of the basement once a day in the morning to a toilet a line would form then the russians would start shooting around people with mortars for entertainment there were infants the youngest was month old the oldest people were in their 80s people had to carry them in carts to this basement everyone who was older than died in the basement during that month this is the entrance the sign says careful children there was not enough oxygen in the basement that s why elderly died first they would go insane then they would scream and then they would go quite and then in the morning they would not wake up and their neighbors simply would carry them out to an oven kochegarka to get oxygen people would get to the walls closer to the water on them that was dripping down people felt there was more oxygen there we talked to survivors at first they are quiet but eventually they start talking telling detailed stories i have made records after a while they stop talking and simply thank me for listening a year old lady told that she feels better now after unloading this on me she also said she would rather die if she knew what she would have to go through i asked people why they think russians did it to use us as a protection against the ukrainian army is the only answer i heard russians paraded kids in front of the building when ukrainian drones were nearby these people come across differently from people in kherson there is a sense of something grim when i tell them that at least now it is over i got the same response but there are so many people who are still occupied and it made me realize a fundamental truth that we must liberate all our territories it s because our citizens are currently under occupation there and are suffering a similar fate i knew this truth before but it was abstract theoretical today i felt it https://twitter.com/mylovanov/status/1643614498807324674

huge if true russian forces are falling back from vuhledar and marinka they are also falling back from around avdiivka reports are coming that after 4th of april force recon of zsu russians got orders to fall back even to donetsk itself they are falling back by km in vuhledar area ru positions in krasnohorivka are endangered that basically nullifies their territorial gains leaving only bakhmut and soledar region with any russian gains however not so long russian army is preparing to fall back from northern and southern outskirts of bakhmut leaving prigozhin alone there that information is partially confirmed by today counterattack and getting a few city blocks of bakhmut back under ukrainian control russian army apparently is falling back to prepare for the defense of donetsk i can translate a full article if you guys want https://t\.me/volyamedia/603 ok the full translation sorry for crudeness and possible errors sources in the russian armed forces and the afu russian troops retreated from vuhledar and marinka the ukrainian army removed the threat of encircling avdiivka since the evening of april we have been receiving reports from the ukrainian military about the successful advance of the afu north east and south of avdiivka on april we learned from ukrainian officers that the russian armed forces had retreated from marinka southwest of donetsk and from vuhledar on the night of april and this morning confirmations also began to arrive from the russian military the afu deployed fresh assault units to the donetsk direction which first conducted a successful force recon battle at vodyanyi pushing the rf armed forces by km and then dislodged russian forces from positions northeast of avdiika striking at the base of the russian outpost at novoselovka according to reports from both sides the russian armed forces have withdrawn to novoselovka and there is a threat of losing the settlement if the afu continues to advance this could lead to an encirclement or a quick retreat of the russian armed forces from their positions near krasnohorivka these are the same positions that russian war correspondents called key positions and assured back in the fall that it was from there that the rf armed forces could successfully encircle avdeevka fierce fighting for these settlements has been going on since the start of the war now all the local successes of the russian armed forces are likely to result in their withdrawal from the blood soaked positions the russian armed forces also retreated east of avdiivka retreating closer to spartak and yasynuvata this is confirmed by sources in both armies also according to ukrainian and russian officers the rf armed forces retreated about km from their positions near ugledar this territory is not yet occupied by the afu according to sources in the headquarters of the russian armed forces in ukraine the retreat was due to two factors first the russian units were unable to advance further because they had exhausted human and materiel resources second the actions of the afu assault units near avdiivka showed that the stretched front could be broken in several places at once so it was decided to shorten the line of contact in order to create a denser defense around donetsk yasynuvata and horlivka as well as strengthen the defense around volnovakha the situation near bakhmut is similar the russian armed forces are preparing to withdraw from positions to the south and north of the city while the wagner have completely lost momentum in bakhmut itself according to ukrainian sources the afu began to gradually recapture neighborhoods in the center of the city volyamedia

do you think there will be a clear start of the ukrainian counter offensive maybe even an official announcement or will attacks just increase over time and a few weeks later experts will say that the counter offensive has already been going on for a while similar to the russian offensive a few months ago

what s the last we heard of glsdbs i know they were ordered by what s the timeline again

so no one wants to consider that the leak wasn t another feint
i don t know i think there may be some purpose from the leaked documents kinda like the d day leaks to cover the real target
in light of the leaks i would ve scraped any plans written in those documents to make as much of that information as irrelevant as possible whoever leaked that is screwed
fuck putin
certainly feels like the calm before the storm
these coming months are the most important of the second cold war these will be the make or break on whether this war will be of attrition over the next few years or an absolute midyear of chaos leading to ukraines victory
i wonder what the chances are of any tricks weapons vehicles etc on their way that we don t know about yet like if this upcoming ukrainian offensive is going to be bigger than any of us could have expected seems there s been months and months of planning and training and procuring and setting up logistics this isn t going to be some half arsed push
friendly reminder putin is old enough to be incontinent

sweeping generalised statement because i read some news articles stating a fact because i read some news articles s stop it geopolitics is complicated and nuanced wars are complicated and nuanced don t buy into absolute statements there is no cold war who knows there might be one in future but very unlikely trade still flows and is required there is no stalemate a stalemate is where no force can conduct effective offensive work this is not the case what we see is ukraine timing offensive and defensive actions to the conditions ccp is not taking siberia sure it may want it but there are nukes and a lot of complications including trade and alignment at stake if you find yourself buying into big ideas or concepts or blanket statements you need to research more and not things that reinforce you point of view that is an echo chamber they re really bad and all too common these days sorry just seen too much of it recently

might as well ask russia to mediate
china and xi will do what they want to do when it is in their best interest they will stay on the sidelines while russia and western countries drain their resources in ukraine looking to see how they can benefit from this war
oh fuck off macron ukraine is not surrendering land zelensky has made that abundantly clear
let s ask north korea too
macron is such a tool
quit being so nave
china said they ll think about it right after they invade taiwan
any mediation at this stage is pointless ukraine still hopes for game changing weaponry to be delivered so they can turn the tide and rid the country of the russian invaders russia still hopes for the west to get war weary and eventually stop weapons deliveries and or financial support for ukraine possibly after a trump or desantis victory in in is probably the best time for negotiations regardless what the result of the election is

seems india is then redirecting it to countries with sanctions against russia
idiots in the comments seem to be blaming india for this keep in mind the sanctions allow this to happen for a reason the objective isnt to stop anyone from using russian oil but to rather make sure he gets less of a profit right now his profits are slashed by a huge and the money goes to india instead of the russian war effort and lets not forget how many oil producing countries are already under harsher sanctions

russia has increased its oil exports to india by a massive since sanctions over the invasion of ukraine cut the country off from its european markets supplies to the people s republic of china and other markets have also grown this is also the result of the great work that has been done in the industry russia has rerouted its oil exports through neutral countries since the european union embargoed seaborne russian oil deliveries and introduced a price cap on russian crude oil in coordination with the g7 late last year
yeah it s literally called market economy eu does not have enough economic and military power to force other countries to implement these sanctions ergo exports to india are going up if eu finally decided to get their shit together enforce it and starts sizing ships russia and india are going to declare them pirates and india will start seizing european ships whole situation is not simple
apparently russia is losing on every barrel india are making hay off the russian numpties
let s start with this it has to go somewhere but this is the best case scenario sanctions were designed to impact the russia economy which this does russia now has to sell oil to india at half the price or less than what they were getting from european countries at the beginning of the war so that s a win and the other aspect is it provides cheaper fuel to india which is also a win this is precisely what sanctions were aimed to do india then re selling it on the secondary market isn t an issue in the least
thanks india for saving europe from higher gas prices more thanks to indian people who allow the indian government to use the funds saved for placing orders with european businesses as defence deals and aircraft orders rather than translating it to the lower fuel price for indian people hang on europe even if your politicians continue to sell your children s future for funding the weapon industry and mafia that makes profit out of conflicts india will send aid in the form of business orders whoever survives the upcoming collapse look out to the asian african south american countries they ll help your future generations despite all the bad you did to those civilisations
so why us is going to sell million dollars worth off naval weapons to india if they are doing shit like this all the time they are selling everything to russia that they order and then they buy oil i wouldn t sell them anything at all not even a bullet
india soullessly cashing in but it still hammers russia right in the revenue nads on the third hand the west will only tolerate this cynical profiteering for so long
history will remember india as a country who made deal with devil
man narendra modi s got a knack for a good bargain
india benefiting so much from this war
india has become the world s center for overt capitalism putting above souls
remember india karmas a real bitch
time to sanction all of india
eu should stop all trade with india and shut down all indian based call centres as they a lot of them have massive security issues when it comes to customer data
oil laundering
why r we sending aid to india that has got to go
of course it is india is working as a middleman now
in summary eu imports from russia have dropped by about million barrels per day bpd and indian imports have increased by about million bpd
this one puts it in simpler terms https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/russia-exports-91-of-its-crude-oil-to-china-india-in-march-as-trade-routes-shift/2864079 of russia s crude oil exports go to india and china
that s true the demand will always be there it s not like europe is the only place that needs oil and gas the global south isn t really interested in stopping their trade with russia especially now they can get cheaper energy from them i never thought that eu stopping oil purchases from russia would actually have a big effect cuz they could always sell to other countries
https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/little-gains-india-saved-just-2-per-barrel-even-after-russias-deep-discounts-8480991/
the cost of shipping shipping insurance etc also increases hugely someone there is making money there s a whole grey shipping industry to ship this stuff india otoh is saving just per barrel
that s what we want to happen we still need the oil not getting oil at all would hurt us way more than russia this way we still get the oil and russia hardly earns something from it
well ukraine war is not indian s problem and russia helped india for the majority of cold war why do you think india should ditched their firm ally for reddit point and moral high ground not only that but cheap oil is crucial for india to developing heavy industry they don t want to be poor forever you know
im so sick of both sides of this argument tbh one side acting like india isnt shamelessly profiting off a crisis and the other side taking some unjustified moral high ground are both mocking a nuanced issue
massive since india was buying almost zero previously in absolute terms india buys significantly less than europe japan etc do and india turns it around and sells refined oil to the us and others reducing the global market impact and domestic support there russia gets lower funds overall it s too big to cut out of world market altogether india gets about savings per barrel and the grey shipping ship insurance and finance industry gets the difference with russian discounts price cap
eu does not have enough economic and military power to force the us threatened india with unilateral sanctions under caatsa if it bought iranian oil a few years ago one year later zero iranian oil buys by india and the us was the largest oil exporter to india the us sanctioned venezuelan oil india many others aren t buying venezuelan the us and eu cannot totally sanction russian oil and gas because russia is too large a supplier in the market if markets seize support for ukraine in the us and eu would drop so they set up a scheme to cap the price russia sells at using financial shipping and insurance leverage russia gets less funding india ships oil right back to the us largest importer and other countries the scheme is working as designed by the us europe
firstly sanctions are not only eu you forget us uk and others from your power fantasy secondly why would they use force since they have not sent troops into ukraine where the actual fighting is happening exploiting the situation is profiteering and history will remember
indian oil companies save money and the consumer saves money not the indian govt indian govt doesn t get that money the aircraft order was a private company and the defence equipments have been in the pipeline forever i almost always regret coming to worldnews
us is actually ok with this as it keeps the price of oil down and india gets the oil not xina
this is actually intentional by the west india is buying the russian oil at the sanction price cap or even lower this means that russia is barely making money on the trade and on the other hand the global supply of oil still remains roughly the same europe is buying oil from other sources while india switches from those other sources to russia the end result is no sharp rise in the global price of oil like what happened with gas russia s income has been minimized while still having them contribute to the supply the global market what india is doing with the oil is expected planned and even encouraged
well considering how a lot of this oil is refined and sold to the west at cheap rates by indian companies there is plenty of cynical profiteering to go around
ok now quickly condemn japan while you are at it part of the western block isn t it and tolerate dumbass mfs think the world moves at their whims try doing something about it little puppy
history will remember india as a country who made deal with devil history will remember the united states as a country who made deal with devil illegitimate wars in vietnam iraq history will remember the uk as a country who made deal with devil ruthless colonizers that were responsible for multiple genocides during their reign the truth is history is forgotten very quickly nobody remembers these things after a few years as long as the country in question is economically thriving india knows this they were on the receiving end of british colonization they know that as long as they are economically a powerhouse in the future everything will be forgiven taking advantage of this situation makes a lot of sense for india short term gain with no long term consequences
geography will remember the other devils
no country is clean not mine not even yours even if history remembers no one has the moral high ground to criticise india
removed
no one will remember nor care about this a week after the end of the war
hi devil i am the history
yeah keep remember silly rabbit ideology are for kids real man is opportunist
siding with russia is the least of indias problems history will concentrate on how they treat woman and role of caste system instead
the username fits
nobody is sending aid to india if any it goes to ngos who finance protests against government of india they also use aid money to run conversion programs since there aren t enough christians and muslims already
also eu and us imports of oil products from india have risen substantially
and there it is india covers less then a third of cancelled european orders
below or near production costs while having to cover a lot of idle production capacity russia has few options and their partners know it
the big effect is that they sell it at a much lower price
here is the kicker india sells the refined products back to eu at record profits man these sanctions are working out great eu leaders are a bunch of clowns
dont compare barrelprice for one country compare how much barrels have been sold from ru and what did they get for that in total before the sanctions ad after them you will see a significant change the sactions are not targeted at india but russia so check what russia has more or less at the end of the year
are you sure have you checked the price russia sells to india a lot of people here are commenting but i see to numbers no source india s discount dollars https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/little-gains-india-saved-just-2-per-barrel-even-after-russias-deep-discounts-8480991/
this doesnt make sense at all
who is we the us could stop importing today and would see only a few months of price hikes we would be fine after we finish more natural gas facilities
now you aren t justifying buying oil from russia you re justifying being best buds with russia and not caring about its invasion and genocide of ukraine
well ukraine war is not indian s problem a nuclear war is everyones problem and russia is constantly threatneing to use nukes also this invasion has shown the world that you can invade others if you have nukes and you need nukes to protect yourself i wouldnt be surprised if more countries start obtaining them for both defense and offensive means which makes the world a more dangerous place the blocking of grain exports also doesnt help the world either some of which india consumes
why do you think india should ditched their firm ally war crimes
this is no way justifies india s profiteering off of european war sanctions reddit point and moral high ground do you think the sanctions are imposed for fun russia is a terrorist state that invaded an innocent country with its plundering raping kidnapping torturing genociding army of uneducated pedophiles not only that but cheap oil is crucial for india to developing heavy industry so developing the indian economy is more important than saving ukranian lives i see where your priorities are
bruh algos sending nukes straight to delhi if someone in us or russia press that button
i mean west continues to block sale from every oil producing nation then prices will skyrocket can t buy from iran iraq now russia where will this end
wait a minute us energy exports to eu are at all time high but ofcourse it is india who is shamelessly profiting this whole operation was us s idea and it as always made tons of profit
for india it s as simple as buying russian oil is good for them while sanctioning russia their ally is bad for them indias interests just arent aligned with ukraine
history is hard to know because of all the hired bullshit hunter s thompson
history will remember the politics of history teaches us again and again that lessons of the past are quick forgotten none of this will be effect future decisions the issues of the day will decide those
how are you going to force india from buying oil write a strongly worded letter ask them nicely again ask them less nicely start implementing sanctions against india and expect india not to create sanctions on you or do what eu said they are going to do take over ships on pretext that they are not insured because you unilaterally declared they are not insured and then expect that india is not going to do the exact same thing for your ships near india it s not like this is a new thing uk has been literally patrolling oceans in s to early s looking for slaver ships and basically enforcing british rules
opportunist always win thailand did that and they re one of the winner so is turkey
corporation tax in india is if the companies save money they lower opex and increase profits which means more money to the government at tax time
still it s not enough some of that free money bonanza india wallows in should be funneled back to ukraine
anyone can criticise anyone about anything you don t need moral high ground to be critical and it shouldn t stop you either
i will remember d
gee you think i expect at least one country ukraine will probably care and they might seem to remind everyone during important trade conferences or when they are in nato
removed
yep russia has lost its lucrative refining industry
not just covers less than a third but it s a third at a lower price
and help subsidize china and india economy in every industry to compete with the west
the difference goes in shipping shipping insurance etc someone there is making bank huge
that s on average for all the oil they consume from your article the average landed price of russian crude for india for april december was per barrel about lower than the average price of non russian barrels a bbl is a big basis differential in a world where refining cracking spreads purchase price of oil vs selling price of refined products are
because of sanctions russia is forced to sell to india who is offering a much lower price than what russia is used to india can do this because they know they re the only country willing to buy their oil india then resells the oil to us at prices we normally would have paid anyway we still get the oil but russia gets much less money
i mean india is benefitting from this not really russia or anyone else
it does but whether it s actually working in that matter or if it was intended hoped for is questionable sanctions can be a double edged sword and the more intertwined the economies are the greater they hurt both sides eg sanctioning iraq during and after the first war wasn t super harmful to anyone else but sanctioning someone like china would have serious negative impacts on countries other than china as well including those countries leveraging the sanctions if sanctions against russia causes the prices of their oil ng exports to drop by then the price europe pays to source them from elsewhere is also going to rise by some related amount if india buys russia s oil at the now discount russia s still lost a lot of income if india turns around and resells some of it to european customers at markup back to the original price then that helps stabilize the price increases europe would be seeing and blunts the double edged problem of sanctions again this is all theory i personally have no idea if this is what s happening the numbers are made up for easier understanding and math this is what the poster you responded to was saying though i believe
it s the kind of cope that only a brain that has to somehow balance anti russian propaganda with the need for cooperation with india can come up with
rich countries won t go without remember that when prices spike it hits the world s developing countries hardest
yeah and india might see it as their best option to not go in and throw more fuel in the fire it s not their problem
how many country ditched usa after vietnam way and iraq war especially after weapon of mass destruction is proven to be false none so i expect the same from india
lol everyone should have left nato after iraq then
a country looking out for it s own citizens is a crime now according to reddit
so developing the indian economy is more important than saving ukranian lives i see where your priorities are yes if we look at history nato countries have been against indian interests let s avoid bringing uk into the conversation just so your argument doesn t crumble on itself if you don t help india when it needs you cant expect it to sacrifice for your benefit regardless of how it seems the eu will never be a friend or even an ally to india for obvious reasons so i really don t see how you can expect india to act otherwise
it sucks for us but put yourself in indian shoes ukraine has no effect on them so why would the average indian care if china invaded mongolia we wouldnt really care here in the us because we have little vested interest there it s not worth it to ruin current allegiances india russia to get involved
do you justify us and nato profiteering from ukraine war let s see where the reconstruction bids go it s not as if the nato countries are doing out of goodness of the heart if they are so concerned send their militaries invoking article is not automatic
please stop your moral policing it isn t how the world works
not venezuela either but i think they re having their own issues at the moment anyways
i did not claim it would impact daily decision i said india would have to come to terms with it for example the fact that finland allied with nazi germany in ww2 is still a sore topic for many here edit actually the come to terms part was in another reply in the thread not this one in any case in both cases i meant that
seriously you are back to force no one is or will be forcing india to anything as is clear from the increased imports india chooses to increase the imports and receives criticism for it as it should but what in the world has given you impression that someone would use force since you like history as i said history will remember

their opex or operational expenses remains the same cost of input goes down along with the sale price the profits remains more or less the same and it s taxes on petrol that the govt get more money from not the corp tax itself and yes indian govt makes more money why shouldn t they only americans or european govts should have money indian companies will buy russian gas the indian public will enjoy lower gas prices and the govt will make more money on taxes nothing anyone says will change that it s india s right tired of having to justifying living our lives
why dont the brits sell their entire island and funnel those money back to india for the bengal famine redditors are literally insane manchild

misleading headline i didn t see anything about a warplane coalition
when will it end
wtf is macron doing
hopefully with a liberated crimea
the more support we give to ukraine the faster it will end
hopefully soon but i feel this will turn into a ww1 type stalemate where thousands are dying for small portion of land
even looking at this from a purely strategic perspective hamas and hezbollah have miscalculated every single time a nation is under attack the people rally under the flag it s unite or die and the people would rather unite than watch their country end up in flaming ruin israelis are fighting each other it s a mess leaders were openly mentioning the possibility of civil war the prudent response for israel s enemies should have been to sit back and watch but now at least for a time israel will be united in a will to respond the internal squabbles will be put on the back burner the islamists will not succeed in destroying israel or liberating al quds but they will end up with scores dead among their own ranks good luck with that all in all extremely dumb

religious fanatics often do dumb things that end up backfiring on them
absolutely agree often enough is hard to fathom just how dumb people can be especially under the influence of religion it s really baffling
as they say the arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity yet another excellent demonstration
except hamas and hezbollah need bibi or a similar strongman to exist for their recruiting purposes if israel doesn t lash out in response then there s nothing that leads people to join those groups plus if they aren t fighting israel people will start questioning what they re doing for them and why they aren t doing anything for them
pretty convenient for bibi
like that s going to work it s wishful and narrow minded thinking far from reality and applicable strategies
depends on what you mean by surgical israel doesn t have bombers so air strikes are limited to what they can do with some ish multirole jets surgical air strikes are generally what they are limited to as for chances they do something in lebanon unconfirmed reports of planes over southern lebanon atm and supposedly the un forces in lebanon have been told to get to shelter though that could be early panic the israeli cabinet is still making lists for targets and the israeli air force is actively bombing gaza right now whether or not targets in lebanon made the list is something we won t know until we get reports of hits
it s almost like they raided al aqsa to prod a response like this
i think the count was updated to two last i saw but it could be more
israel went in to arrest terrorists who were stockpiling weapons in the mosque in preparation for an attack against jews praying at the western wall which is next to the mosque israel s actions were completely justified to save lives shame on you for defending terrorists
have you not seen how propaganda and rhetoric are affecting the us imagine in less developed areas where there is much less access to outside information and the hatred runs deep
isis was bombed to smithereens and their attacks have been reduced significantly the evidence shows that deterrence works
a quick google search says they do have bombers
yeah except the actual reason they raided the mosque was because palestinians were raining rocks and fireworks down on jews celebrating passover down below i guess bibi hired those palestinians to do this like the do every single year during ramadan
yeah and israeli fighter jets having a missile go squirrely and hit an orphanage would be amazing for recruiting since it would stoke that hateful fire into a justified inferno im suggesting that hamas and hezbollah leadership may prefer a bibi over a moderate
isis attempted to create a nation state and their troops were in uniforms terrorist organizations fighting guerrilla wars are far harder to fight it s exceptionally rare to beat a terrorist organization purely through military means policing and diplomacy are an order of magnitude more successful historically speaking

this is not the time to talk about reducing the debt ratio this is the time to talk about forcing companies to accept much lower profits drastically increased wages at the bottom of company structure drastically smaller wages at the top and rules preventing layoffs or price hikes to cover the loss to shareholders or investors slower growth is not a bad thing impatience and greed are this is the time to talk about reinstating retirement at and paying for it by heavily taxing the ers global businesses like google and amazon and preventing tax dodges of the super wealthy it s time to consider making it illegal to purchase property for the purpose of a business opportunity so that homes only have value to people looking for somewhere to live rather than someone looking for unearned income this would healthily collapse the housing market down to a manageable cost per square meter allowing normal people with real jobs not abstract office nonsense but actual sweating grunting people who bleed on the job sometimes to easily afford a home rather than saddle themselves in vast debt just to secure what ought to be a human right it s time to write laws preventing wealth concentration and promoting better distribution of wealth within the economies operating in the eu it is not time to be concerned about the debt its time to be concerned about energy fuel the climate and most importantly the quality of life of the lowest earning and zero earning in society and it will be time to do that until every single homeless person every single struggling family every downtrodden person in the place has been elevated to a state of peace security and contentment at least and until then no prattle about abstract notions like national debt ought to even enter the heads of a single solitary political entity
article brussels april reuters planned new european union public debt rules should require governments of highly indebted countries to cut debt every year by at least of gdp a german paper prepared for discussions on the rules to be held in the coming months proposes the paper seen by reuters also said countries with medium debt challenges should be asked to cut their debt to gdp ratios by of gdp as a minimum while the eu has yet to define which countries it would classify as high debt greece and italy with public debt to gdp ratios of of gdp and of gdp respectively are obvious candidates the german paper is part of a discussion among the eu s countries and especially the that share the euro on how to adapt eu debt rules that underpin the common currency to new realities of high post pandemic public debt and the need for high investment to prevent climate change it aims to build on proposals by the european commission to allow each country to negotiate their individual debt reduction paths with the eu executive rather than impose a one size fits all rule on everybody the existing rules require every country to cut debt annually by 20th of the excess above the eu ceiling of of gdp but that is now seen as unrealistic after governments borrowed heavily to pay for covid relief measures berlin and several other eu countries are worried that the proposal for individually negotiated debt reduction paths would give the commission too much political discretion the rule should fix a binding lower limit for a necessary decline in the debt ratio of an appreciable magnitude in each year the german paper said as a floor it could for example be foreseen that the debt to gdp ratio must decline by at least percentage point per year for member states with high debt challenge debt ratios and by at least percentage points per year for ms with medium debt challenge debt ratios above the paper also called for the use of the expenditure benchmark as a way to steer public spending keeping increases in net primary expenditure below increases in potential growth rate of the economy the bigger a country s debt the bigger the gap between increases in spending and potential growth would have to be leading to a overall decline in the government deficit and therefore also debt the paper said to prevent governments from back loading any painful spending cuts or pushing them until after elections berlin called for deficit reduction paths to be no longer than a regular electoral cycle

please read the article the currently existing rules force countries to payback of their debt that d over countries like greece are currently required to lower their debt by of gdp annually this proposal aims to give them more financial freedom by only forcing them to lower debt by
so your solution is to continue increasing the debt forever even if you could loan money forever the intrest payments alone would make that plan unsubstantianable in the long run
did you even bother reading the article before coming here to flame the currently existing rule requires eu countries to lower their debt by of the debt amount that s over so if you have a country with debt it has to lower it s debt by in a year the proposal to set a debt reduction is ment to give these countries more breathing room allowing them to keep more of their debt because they argument is after covid and now the war it s hard to pay off large amounts of debt so they want to lower the amount that has to be paid back
borrowing more and more money is way better and faster way how to destroy your economy greece showed the way italy and spain will soon follow
that will never happen so should we never start caring about debt
that is called debt so they are asking them to not do that and pay for real this time instead
you are right this would be beneficial for greece however if i understand this part correctly build on proposals by the european commission to allow each country to negotiate their individual debt reduction paths with the eu executive the current consensus is that the countries will negotiate their debt reduction plan individually so some of them might insist on a very lenient schedule and this is the scenario germany would like to avoid the rule should fix a binding lower limit for a necessary decline in the debt ratio of an appreciable magnitude in each year the german paper said but as we all know politicians love to spend money hence my comment that they will oppose this plan
okay thanks for the clarification
pay for real this time instead as opposed to what
wait they re just nipping the frogs legs off and leaving it to die that s fucked man
__importers of frogs legs and foie gras will have to declare production methods to be able to sell them in switzerland which bans force feeding and cutting of animal limbs without anaesthetic the government has decided __ this follows a decision by parliament on declaration of banned production methods three types of declaration will now be required according to a government press release on wednesday the first is for animal products obtained without eliminating pain this may be the case for frogs legs or for products from animals castrated without anaesthesia according to the press release second there should be a declaration obligation for products obtained by force feeding geese and ducks plant based foodstuffs will also have to be declared if they originate from countries in which plant protection products internationally classified as particularly hazardous are used the government says it will also examine an import ban on furs and fur products produced under conditions of animal cruelty
oh lol so no pork then in na they castrate young males without anesthesia squeeze slice pop snip and then a lil iodine spray right in the nutholes and bam your adolescent bacon eunuch is ready to live the next couple months until butcher day grew up on a pork battery farm so fukt fuck big ag
what force feeding a goose via a feeding tube until it s stomach splits open isnt acceptable
yea force feeding geese is quite cruel were people actually chopping frog legs off while alive that actually seems harder to do than just killing the frogs first
easy enough with frogs just send them whole problem solved
in one or two years we ll have lab grown foie gras anyway there are already several companies working on it

cows can yall stop cracking our skulls open with a stun gun now too hello
foie gras makes sense but i dont think you can logically target frogs legs without talking about the entire halal butchery market or is that a mountain too steep to climb
i m skeptical i ve never seen a frog in a wheelchair
i m curious how the french feel about this the concept of the food and its regulation
tried foie gras and it isn t that great enough for us to torture the animal for it frog legs on the other hand is pretty good and why not kill the frogs first do we just chop the legs off and let the frogs slowly die
how about there s no such thing as humane slaughter in general stop eating animals
i can see foie gras ban but frogs unless there is a shortage on frogs but when you got too many frogs the noise can be deafining and they still cant control the mosquitoes or flies
do they eat the bones with frog legs what s it like i m trying to imagine it like can you just eat bone and all like it s soft enough to chew or is it just the flesh
banning foie gras sounds like it makes sense from the perspective of shoving food down the throat of a human but with ducks and geese the parent s actually do this to feed their babies from birth naturally its hardly cruel from the perspective of that species could the process be better yes are we imposing our own comfort standards onto others definitely so
removed
the problem with foie gras it not necessarily the food itself but probably with the gavage there are ways around that https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/11/ethical-foie-gras-no-force-feeding-necessary/66261/ https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/01/487088946/this-spanish-farm-makes-foie-gras-without-force-feeding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foie_gras_controversy
panics in french
lolwut frog legs they dont kill rm before chopping em off or something i get the foi gras
spoiler alert people are fucked man
bans force feeding and cutting of animal limbs without anaesthetic good i ve been to michelin star restaurants i ve tasted the best foie gras prepared in the best of ways it s not at all worth torturing an animal for it no food is get the fuck over yourself and treat animals etc humanely until the point of their painless death it s not hard gods it s so easy to just not be an inhumane asshole b b ut traditions halal and koscher yeah fuck those too if your gods require animals to suffer then your gods don t deserve the shit it d take to defecate on them
all i can see are millions of frogs on tiny crutches https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&v=om0hni_c6ko&embeds_euri=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f&feature=emb_logo)
lots of na food is already banned by european regulations anyway not sure the one you described is currently accepted
that should be on the list as well but this is a good start the truth is that there are so many fucking awful things we do to animals because we want tasty food it s hard to know where regulators should even begin
i ve castrated bulls with cheerios small thick rubber bands you put them on balls go numb balls fall off a few weeks later from lack of circulation i think that s the most humane method
it is possible to have foie gras without force feeding the force feeding system is a shame and needs to be ban simply playing around with the light and providing rich food is enought for ducks and goose to make them eat a lot storing fat for winter they will naturraly develop such hypertofied foie gras
depends the goose canada geese fuck em
what s this practice called
to be fair foie gras is so good that it is a sacrifice i am willing to make edit god why the need to mass downvote me just because i like foie gras and i am not ashame of it
tell this them fuckers who insists on cheap meat every other day
so send all the frenchies whole into switzerland
i doubt that the current foie gras enthusiasts are keen on adopting a lab grown version sure it may draw in a new set of consumers whom have been curious for its taste texture other reasons but the real thing will continue to remain in demand
nah it s not a mountain too steep to climb at least not in my opinion halal butchers should not be allowed at all religion culture that bases their shit on the suffering of other lives is not one we should endorse
i understand your point of view but we should take steps towards each other instead of talking directly about bans we have very strict rules and laws on meat production in switzerland which is why meat costs times more than in direct comparison with other countries and we have increasingly voted for animal welfare
you see a chicken leg you eat it a frog leg the same way you gnaw on the flesh around the drum
you just eat the flesh it s not that different from eating a chicken leg
it s like eating chicken wings
so you think france is in asia
why are you like this
both of the mentioned dishes are french besides animal agriculture and slaughter in the west is just as bad as any in china look up pigs being gassed in the uk if you don t believe me
nice xenophobia you got there about the biggest continent on earth no less
for the gavage for the foie gras i saw two different place one with a label where you could see the duck actually running to be fed and fed a strict amount based on their age and weight and another where the cheap kind of foie gras was produced were it was really brutal and killing duck in the process was just labelled as lost so as for foie gras i m kinda on the fence as gavage can be done right naturally by playing with the light to make them think we are always close to winter so they will do it on their own but then they can t be really let outside and live their whole life inside it will take longer and so cost a lot or simply use the gavage but based like i said on decent amount and they will come themselves for it but as for everything animal related the real problem lie when you try to draw the price really low as animal will always suffer from it
btw in switzerland the practice of shechita which involves bleedinganimals to death while they are still alive is prohibited if they havenot been previously stunned the ban on shechita dates back to apopular initiative that was accepted by the public in and wassubmitted by animal welfare organizations in the ban was includedin the animal welfare law
tbf there is foie gras that isn t produced through force feeding not much as far as i m aware but it certainly is possible to do so and pushing towards that would be an improvement apparently they re also a lot better in terms of taste
b b ut traditions halal and koscher foie gras and frog legs have nothing to do with those things but go off i guess i m not well acquainted with all that halal entails but kosher slaughter meat prep is very ethically sound and doesn t involve nor require suffering of the animal in question
would you say taking someone s life against their will is humane
it s not at all worth torturing an animal for it if the animal didn t want to be slaughtered why didn t it just live checkmate
i m all for banning force feeding and the cutting of animal limbs without anaesthetic there s no sacrifice in quality in the end product from treating these animals with more respect than that halal and kosher butchering methods however are not done for convenience or to maximize yield like the inhumane treatment of geese and frogs referenced here so there s no room to equate them with casual forms of cruelty in service of industrial scale production these were some of the first attempts to standardize a method of dispatching livestock which would minimize their suffering and today the shochet s methods are meant to cause insensitivity to the pain in the animal through the severing of the vagus nerve and a loss of consciousness due to a rapid loss of blood pressure to the brain and i say that as someone who does not adhere to either set of dietary strictures and who finds them rather amusing for instance the contention by one that if something intoxicates in large amounts it is forbidden in small amounts would appear to prohibit the sinful practice of drinking water https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_intoxication).
cutting of animal limbs without anaesthetic insert popular image of screaming frog people oh his no funny that frog was screaming after seeing his future in the tubs next to him
and why is it worth it to kill an animal for food
so what you re saying is that you re ok with eating what you re not ok with other people eating clever
since they take both legs frogs in tiny wheelchairs seem more realistic
solid reference lmao
most american pork have higher ractopamine than allowed it won t make it in regardless
i think asking yourself if someone s life is more important than your taste buds is a good start
the most humane would be to leave their balls alone i guess i am the weirdo here but i feel like we should not go around touching animals genitals much less cruelly mutilating them
i suspect the humane method you described isn t as profitable or as quick as force feeding so we d need regulation or more public awareness to encourage its competitiveness
yes you can kind of make foie gras without force feeding there s a chef dan barber that is working on it
as i french that love foie gras i am okay with having more expensive foie gras without force feeding but i am totaly against banning it freedom of eating what you want to eat excpet human an other poples pets of course is an important freedom
i wouldn t fuck with canadian geese those things are monsters
gavage
it s called i should have stopped sooner
hope you re just being edgy for the sake of it
i bet you are fun at parties
who not whom p
it depends entirely on taste no if you can t distinguish then i doubt enthusiasts care
we don t have frogs here well we do just the tiny ones so it was hard to imagine how big small the leg is but that kinda makes sense
this is a good point also the running to eat thing is very true they love it they essentially eat like kings and at the end of the day it looks worse then it is because they have no gag reflex and they essentially put a hose down their throats and feed them i m not really a fan of foie but it isn t all inherently tortuous so i think it s good to standardize a way to do it that doesn t eliminate it s place in cuisine also how is this different then when people are fattened up and sent over to the pharmaceutical industry to line their pockets with health bills
agreed a fair amount of foie gras is produced already and has been accepted as a quality product so yeah let s make that the standard i can believe it with regards to the taste the best meats come from animals treated humanely contrary to some local folklore that persists https://nodogsleftbehind.com/stop-yulin/). the same should be true of organ meats
pretty much the exact same as halal it is a standard that at the time attempted to minimize the suffering of the animal not sure the commenter actually understands what those traditions entail or what the conditions are like in modern abattoirs
shh we don t talk sense here we kill and eat animals but ooooonly if they re murdered ethically
people are downvoting you for hypocritical reasons
for most people on the planet it simply is convenience and a perceived increased pleasure but people don t like to admit that and declare animal consumption a necessity
i mean i agree i ve been vegan for several years for that reason
that s something people don t want to do as is reflected in the downvotes unfortunately
yeah sometimes
it can reduce aggression protecting the farmer and herd i get my pets neutered so i don t see a problem with it in an agricultural setting
deleted
it probably isn t but i d raised ducks and geese most waterfowl are basically in a state of constantly eating if at all possible when i fed my show ducks it was like watching piranhas in a pen no matter how fat and well fed they got i am sure that if someone studied the ways to optimally get them to gorge it would be totally possible to make them do this on an industrial scale without the intubation it may be slower and less profitable due to the time it takes but it s also likely to be much easier to scale upwards since it no longer requires intubation
freedom of eating what you want to eat excpet human an other poples pets of course is an important freedom no it s not unnecessarily cruel practices to create luxury foods has nothing to do with your freedoms
how is your pet dog different from my pet duck they can both be eaten as food or we can respect the life of the animal and not eat either of them
so animal suffering is less important than your freedom of what to eat
this statement makes me really angry stop eating torture food ffs
lol get fucked only cunts eat foie gras ban it entirely
you make an exception for not eating other peoples pets would you be okay with force feeding your friends dog til his stomach bursts
lol who defines what s a pet ducks and geese are great pets it s apparently more like my taste buds define whatever is pleasant for me dog meat tastes fucking fabulous especially the really young ones so i guess i can now freely open my dog butcher shop
piggybacking on this to say that gavage comes from the verb gaver which means to force feed
wow i looked it up and am super shocked i always assumed that foie gras was some fancy grass not animal meat
not at all i am just a french guy that like foie gras and the day we stop doing it i hope i will not see x200b plus i honestly don t see the problem we kill and eat animal all the time i like foi gras i am not ashamed of it i will never stop eating it because some jugmental cry baby tell me it s bad for the duck magret de canard cooked rossigni way s it a delight also cooked foi grasis something else
not french ones
diamonds are trivially easy to manufacture in a lab but it hasn t affected the demand for identical diamonds dug out of the ground
it s a distinction thing people who eat foie gras enough that their opinion matters to the industry are very often snobbish they want the authentic thing
people get off on the brutality of it see the explanation of diamonds
and you too
times are changing
it can reduce aggression protecting the farmer and herd yeah right we are really doing it for a noble reason i guess the aggression is not really a problem when the farmer actually needs the semen and so they put a electric probe in their asshole to make them cum so they collect it i get my pets neutered so i don t see a problem with it in an agricultural setting we are not exploiting pets and then killing them off when they are not useful anymore and the testicles are certainly not cut off with a fucking rubber band and weeks of suffering until it falls off it s the opposite of humane we are torturing and killing animals by the billions each year
so is that boar taint or tainted boar
bro people where i m from eat wild boar meat all the fuckin time what is this fuckin take

i don t understand why anyone thinks xi can convince putin to end the war by talking to him we re well beyond that possibility sanctions are the only way to do this and china is opposed not only to implementing their own sanctions but to those the west has implemented i don t even know what to think of macron at this point is he actually stupid
tells
there is no reasoning with a madman

mcron hey xi tell your dog to behave
past reasoning with war criminals only way to end this now is for russia to turn over putiner for trial
macron is one of the most useless politicians today all he does is tell other leaders to stop doing something how about sending ukraine supplies for them to win this war quicker
i wonder if macron s knees hurt from all that kneeling or does he carry a pillow with him
those are some shitty guns for the military
i don t know why he keeps putting his cents in can t he take a fucking hint or is his nose to far up in the air like our canadian preminister with china fix things at home before u go telling other countries what or how to do things its obvious china s not gonna listen and its obvious utin has his agenda get it together world leaders
does anyone remember the peace plan xi put forward that the west refuses
nothing will stop putin but force he is intent on restoring the soviet union and will listen to nobody not even xi
why would xi listen to macron who can t even keep his own country from rioting
china is the only country that still has some influence on putin due to the heavy reliance russia has on china at the moment why do you think putin waited to invade until after the olympics in china were done
we french are wondering about the same question everyday for other reasons i think he s the one hanlon s razor doesn t apply to
macron went to china to gargle on xi s balls and he s simply trying to offset that perception by asking xi to reason with russia
reason can mean a lot of things explaining a future that is very negative and implies no support from china can be a very credible threat in a diplomatic way
when did sanctions help end a war
yeah noticed that too
you do realize those are for ceremonial purposes right
ceremonial guns don t you know
oh the one where russia gains all the land they illegally annexed and a seize fire all the while never talking to ukraine to make it a good faith plan so that a common ground could be found between the two countries that are at war with eachother x200b it was a charade and we should be glad that the west declined it to note ukraine also declined it which is the only important party to actually decline it china s peace plan ok d to illegally invade your neighbor not achieve your tactical objectives and still gain land off your illegal actions dont be blind my friend
that is not a peace plan it is siding with the agressor to help them secure land
sure but simply trying to reason with putin at this point that s not going to achieve anything what exactly is xi going to say please stop everyone s a bit tired of this the only thing he can do is apply economic pressure sanctions yes putin possibly waited until the olympics were done however i m pretty sure at that point russia had convinced themselves and the chinese that the special military operation would actually only take days we re in a very different place now
there s so much influence you can have on a nuclear armed state it s like reasoning with north korea slapping secondary sanctions works
we don t know if he waited to invade until after the olympics i guess it is just pure speculation
seeing as how a lot of wars end when one side runs out of cash id say a lot
i m pretty sure all chinese guns are ceremonial
it s certainly a better plan that sending billions of dollars worth of weapons into a conflict that s already lost and bound to provoke a nuclear war if someone doesn t get a peace deal and all of this could have easily been avoided if nato had not provoked this war nine years ago you d think they learned in georgia but they didn t and worse they keep provoking and escalating with depleted uranium munitions and now the americans are violating their own agreements with china because they ve decided that anything less than a war of apocalyptic preparations is the bipartisan consensus we re fucked already with the climate but they re not even going to try to mitigate it now
so it s only bad when americans and proxies aren t the ones doing it got it
so it s only bad when americans and proxies aren t the ones doing it got it but literally if the shooting stops then the world can start a tribunal to punish everyone involved in the conflict rather than being forced to endure nuclear war
yeah i agree with everything you said still right now china could swing the balance don t want them to take a more active role in supplying russia so i just think it s common sense to keep appealing to them
must have missed the war already being lost
it is but i doubt xi can succeed putin s rule is in danger if he loses this war and his life might very well be in danger too this war is personal for him and no economic leverage can convince him otherwise
deleted
whilst simultaneously guaranteeing nuclear war lmao
china has never supported putin they just wont support the west either russia relies on china for trade and also not to attack them as they are also their biggest threat xi can use both of those things to inflence russia except putin is a madman and wont listen to anyone the war wont end while putin lives
you re just repeating what i ve already said xi can t talk putin out of ukraine he s in too deep negotiation at this point is doomed xi can pressure putin out of ukraine with sanctions oligarchs will get on board in this scenario respectfully where you re wrong xi did fully support putin s invasion of ukraine if not for anything but to test the west s response in order to gauge china s strategy regarding taiwan
it feels like we have the pre text for azerbaijan to let a certain country use their territory to launch a strike against iran
there is a sizable azeri minority in iran
iran definitely doesn t want to fuck around with azerbaijan especially after turkiye sign a defense treaty with them israel and the us will provide military assistance if things trigger a full scale conflict

no pretext needed
chinese officials have pledged a sharp but unspecified response to the meeting with mccarthy there was no immediate reaction from china on wednesday a holiday there everyone knows you re not going to do a damn thing
probably the best thing mccarthy has done in the past decade piss off china
they will complain but the us should simply ask who they were meeting with last week
suck it china
well would you look at that he did it hinting at having a spine mccarthy
china must learn who buttered their economic bread for years we will move on to diversifying our manufacturing in latin america india africa for their own economic growth and our goods going forward if any country we ve invested in goes rogue we can easily shift that manufacturing to a partner that mutually respects america a healthy combination rather than putting all our eggs in a backstabbing communist basket
didn t republicans freak out when pelosi did this
china baby please calm down she s just a friend
the republicans threw a fit when nancy pelosi visited taiwan
need to make that island a fortress need some mines laid on the sea floor that release and float to surface once the chinese trash barges head that way
wow for the second time ever i actually support something mccarthy is doing the first is making a mockery of the gop in his efforts to get his position
china
the wick was lit a long time ago
we once again find ourselves in a world where democracy is under threat and the urgency of keeping the beacon of freedom shining cannot be understated mccarthy added uhhh we re a constitutional republic thankyouverymuch
didn t the republicans lose it when speaker pelosi went to taiwan
remember conservatives shitting on pelosi for doing the same thing
mccarthy before agreeing something with taiwan uh let me check with matt gaetz
i am convinced that world leaders and politicians are just putting on a show for the masses to take sides and feel like they have freedom it s like a big show of wwf and china is the undertaker and america is hulk hogan they own the stadium they write the narrative you buy the tickets follow the stadium rules sit where you are assigned eat it up and spend all your money shouting and screaming until you die and then they repeat with your children
boycottchina
these republicans are absolute melts they kicked off when pelosi did this yet when they do it it s all good and dandy hypocrites
my god china will never recover from this event time to free tibet
get ready for some more military exercises near taiwan very scary china
wow he actually did it i am very surprised now can he grow a spine and wrangle his people in no didn t think so
the ccp can suck it who cares if their feeling are hurt they need us way way way more than the world needs them and they know it
would be nice if these people would get over the 1950s this is such a stupid and senseless obsession they have with taiwan
i mean everyone knows that us is trying to irritate the war between mainland china and taiwan just like what they have done to ukraine and russia once the war started the capitals and companies would have no choice but switch to us considering europe is struggling in russia ukraine war however if china does want to occupy taiwan they already took action last year when pelosi visited taiwan but they didn t they clearly knew about us s trap
why does china persist in issuing all these ultimatums they actually have the opposite effect a lot of people tend not to react well to bring publicly bullied or warned
china s lucky nato doesn t treat protesters like china would to protesters in their country
china has acknowledged and stated that crimea and ukraine are not russian territory does this mean that they won t be taking taiwan by force i like the chinese everyone i ve met from there is pretty cool they just want to get on with there lives and look after their family
chill out china and try being the actual good guys for once instead the big dick
shhhhhh china you need us too or your economy collapses
go fly another balloon xixi the pooh
fuck your balloons
the scumbag does have a working spine afterall
it s a complicated issue the roc did received help and support up to a certain point and then the us gave up on them and then supported proc now that proc is getting stronger and more influential the us and the rest are trying to cock block them so that they can remain on top even though they got up there by doing much more worst thing lol
i thought there were no protests in china
biden administration is the worst china us relation in a long long looooooooong time proxy war soon probably
i find so funny how everyone goes hysteria mode fearing china invading a small island near his border after china never invading or attacking anyone in the last i don t know how many years in the meanwhile the us managed to invade over countries in his history of freedom democracy and bs i already know i ll be accused of whataboutism so i ll prevent that by saying if you re thinking whataboutism you can suck my balls
hard to believe that mccarthy had the gonads to do this he must of got permission from his master s mad marj greene and matt and gym the pedo s or else he would never had done this on his own
american politics is about breaking up other people s countries creates problems for other and then comes in playing peacemaker
fuck that go to ukraine
i feel bad the taiwanese president needs to entertain that clown mccarthy
fuck off with the taiwan rhetoric so far the war mongers have given the ukraine 200b to watch ukraine men being blown to pieces how much money will you give taiwan to see them get mowed over by the chinese stay in your lane america all you do is fuck things up
mccarthy along the us state dept is deliberately provoking china in an attempt to stoke public outrage at china and continue its superficial war with china do not think for a second that the us will protect taiwan or its people the us has already stated they will destroy the superconductor plants in taiwan if china reasserts its right to taiwan the former taiwanese president stated that taiwan and its people have always been apart of china do not claim this is about superconductors or the economy at large it is about the us empire dying and attempting to maintain control over the world working with china and the east to develop a peaceful world economy is the best path forward for humanity
aye good job broken clock kev he struck again
so this will be taiwan to join nato making progress to new taiwan
mccarthy leader of terrorist cell
checking up on their microchip interests
i think mccarthy needs to buy some more suits this is the only one i ve seen him wear every time i see his pic
expecting the us not to attend diplomatic meetings is a bit unreasonable
the timing of this meeting is so subtle tsai ing wen knows how to warn china s ideas built by xi s government this is a sort of non verbal signal that china shouldn t commit a war against taiwan the us house leader s position is the no ranking in the us government actually the ccp regime should think carefully about this one more time
dae west taiwan winnie the pooh fuck ccp did i get it right
as china proceeds to shid fard pizz and cry
what is the chinese problem with proper house music
us and taiwanese leaders shake hands xi oh bother
i never got china position in taiwan why not just butter them up and make taiwan feel great about everything and run misinformation like russia did and does in the us like i am pretty sure they can start now and in years china can probably get a lot of taiwan population on their side not that i want that but people always talks about china has great long term goals it s like they need this war with taiwan or something it s weird
paper tiger rhetoric
weren t the right shitting their collective pants like a year ago when the last speaker planed to head over to taiwan pretty sure it was a huge thing they were bitching about
china s saber is becoming rusty yet they rattle it all the same
they are probably going to blockade for a day or two again and issue a final warning again https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china%27s\_final\_warning
they ll continue using soft power and economic leverage to make confrontation unthinkable they own the largest european port in the med they own of all ports of entry into europe they control billions of dollars worth of coal agriculture and water extraction in australia they ll continue to turn africa into a chinese colony https://youtu.be/hhmat3bluau if only we had smart leadership who could follow through with long well thought out policies

they re gonna send another blimp
just sabre rattling as usual
anyone remember how supportive the republicans were when pelosi visited taiwan last year https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-blast-nancy-pelosis-taiwan-trip-photo-op-foreign-policy
he s gonna show up and make a big deal about american investments not going to fund wokeism or something equally asinine
it s a win win china will get mad to make mccarthy look tough and get him re elected while while mccarthy fuck ups america
i don t know looked scripted
yet when pelosi did something similar last year the right flipped their collective shit
you mean west taiwan
always a good idea to piss off your largest trading partner
fuck off don t ever give that swine a single grain of praise fuck him and his goons
don t worry about it xinnie the pooh
good spine mccarthy a california republican who became speaker in january had said last summer that he intended to visit taiwan if he was appointed but he and tsai have now agreed to meet in california instead in a move designed to avoid a demonstration of force by the people s liberation army similar to when then speaker nancy pelosi visited taiwan in august https://www.ft.com/content/69b627fc-ab7f-4b19-9ea3-5c308d81c6ef
he has a spine when trump is not around
good thing pelosi paved the way
yeah except he s doing it in the states lol too scared to go to taiwan
hardly mccarthy wants to make the news abroad to deflect a little attention from orange daddy look at me i m an international hawk rattling china s cage don t mind jabba in new york
exactly this too many seem to believe that china and only china can manufacture goods
mexico is going to become the new china they just need to get the cartels under control
latin america india africa literally all of those are moving closer and closer to china while flipping the finger to the west especially india who just recently was overwhelmingly pro west
if it was that easy why haven t you done it already
latin america probably belongs more to bric these days than the us india s rupee move this week imo is indicative of how unlikely this is now manufacturing facilities are capital intensive and take time and a skilled labor pool this type of move would take years in a place like africa even without having to open a second front to ward off warlords and grease local palms ww3 seems like a more likely outcome we will either die by inflation papercuts or reestablish hegemony the old fashioned way i suspect the rest of this decade is gonna make covid look like an episode mr rogers
rather than putting all our eggs in a backstabbing communist basket with the strongly enforced government influence in most of the aspects of life the high level of economic disparity stark lifestyle differences between social classes and private properties everywhere i don t even think china is truly communist they re too right wing to be a communist society
then when india challenges the us after moving all manufacturing there we will repeating this whole propaganda charade again except it will be india instead of china
diversify oh you mean exploit poor people so you can buy a burger and coke for
a lot of mental gymnastics
it pretty much already is
they ve been preparing for this war for decades
you can say fuck china here you won t get sent to the principal s office
a wise man once said that rooting for one side or another in politics is a form of worship the worship of jackals by jackasses
better than dying in the trenches
you re not wrong this is a lot of what politics is about unfortunately they have to please this or that group or their career is over so this is their solution it would be better if people came to an agreement for how to run things then there would be no contradiction to the leaders and they could instead focus on better things

this is funny because it doesn t affect china at all
china forced his hand he probably wouldn t have even cared to meet her before they told him not to
i don t think he wants to be seen as soft on china something his party often accuses biden of doing while ignoring his party s fondness for russia of course
when the us can t even fix its own problems half of the time
downvotes without counter argument that s funny you might have hurt some feelings and nobody has any good answer
from the article according to the report all nato members agree that ukraine s membership in nato cannot be discussed while the war with russia is underway at the same time according to two people who attended the talks some are supporting offering ukraine a political path to membership at the vilnius summit which would strengthen kyiv s ties to the alliance the ft writes that the united states opposes this proposal and is urging allies to focus on short term military financial and humanitarian aid to ukraine in order to help it repel the russian invasion tldr no membership with nato but continued support
kinda makes sense considering ukraine is at war as we speak i m sure ukraine will have a path forward if they win this war and don t have any territory disputes
washington is concerned that deepening ties during the war could fuel russian dictator vladimir putin s narrative of a hostile nato i hadn t thought of this one of the options under consideration is to transform the nato ukraine commission into a nato ukraine council thus raising the status of ukraine as a partner of the alliance and making it a more active participant in nato meetings and consultations fair compromise as long as they continue with supplies for ukraine victory
this might sound surprising to some but it s currently in the us s best interest to do exactly two things keep ukraine out of nato for now so that it ll be more reliant on the us keep ukraine just supplied enough that russia can t meaningfully advance but not enough to allow ukraine to make significant gains either this is because the us wants the war ukraine to last as long as it possibly can that s not to say that the us wants to see ukrainians or russians hurt or killed it doesn t but what it does want is to keep russia mired in an endless war that it cannot retreat from nor win but in order for that reality to exist the us needs to ensure that ukraine is never in a clearly advantageous position with every day that the war continues more and more money resources and materiel slowly get siphoned out of russian coffers and into western hands it s unfortunate but the war in ukraine is a massive boon for the us defense sector and is helping secure a us led western hegemony on the global scale for the next century at least that all being said i imagine that germany sees the same thing obviously there s the official line which may well also be true about not allowing a nation at war to join nato but knowing how keen germany within western geopolitics i m sure they also see the immediate value that the war in ukraine is yielding the west
plot twist
the us and allies have drained a major global power of their ammunition and soldiers and revealed their incompetence to the world without having to fire a single shot
membership action plan is different from membership the map is a list of steps ukraine needs to take to be eligible for a vote of membership
per nato s own rules ukraine is inelligible to join due to ongoing conflicts this isn t news ukraine is still like a decade away from joining nato from just a standards and modernization standpoint though the western arms support is certainly shortening that time tremendously i m all for ukraine winning and i m all for ukraine seeking best solutions for itself however i respect that same sovereignty for every nation ukraine will be closer to eu membership which has its own military treaty aspect than nato membership as for ukrainian dependencies on us arms and support specifically ukraine is free to refuse american arms if it wants to refuse american terms and conditions there are plenty of other nations can afford to support ukraine but those nations are too lazy or have rendered themselves to militarily incompetent or too dependent on american spending to do so i think it s ridiculous nations spend decades shitting on us war machine to suddenly cry for help when russia starts doing something if russia collapses and turns into the nuclear balkins everyone is screwed and that s something the us is also cautious about either way in years no matter what happens some terrorists are going to be attacking the us for revenge for this conflict they could be russian veterans ukrainian veterans or both
i m pretty sure netanyahu is the enemy of israeli democracy
reports that un forces in lebanon were told to get to bomb shelters anyone in lebanon who is anywhere near anything of strategic importance ought to get into a basement good odds israel declared open season on the hamas pij iranian and various militia officials meeting in beirut
it s a bit coincidental that whenever netanyahu faces any sort political pressure israels gets attacked shortly thereafter or is it
isn t that the plan regardless of what they do pay will all their land
what a convenient timing for netanyahu guess israel will have to focus on this external threat rathar then worry about the dictator in making in their midst oh well
the timing seems a little convenient doesn t it
can we just stop fucking fighting with each other and get along
netanyahu s political life is now almost entirely relying on the support of religious fundamentalists in israel which gives them lots of leverage that alone is jeopardizing the security of the nation for any religion the extremists are the most dangerous forces hezbollah is no good guy but when was the last time they launched rockets at israel i am not justifying anything they did but what triggered the escalation of all these violence i hope more and more people are aware of it
way to not fall into the stereotype of a jewish guy asking ya to pay
iran we make bibi look good
is that before or after he gets out of prison
that may be the case but the anti israel terrorists and their allies are the number one enemy of israel s existence israel will deal with the terrorists first and then netanyahu the main opposition parties have already said they will support his actions against the terrorists
we shall fight the war as if there was no netanyahu and netanyahu as if there was no war
he didn t get his way in taking over israel s judicial system so he s starting shit with the palestinians israeli liberals don t want bibi but they still support killing palestinians so he ll probably pick up some points with the attacks on the mosques
well they can do something about it or not he is a stain on israel s history
reports that un forces in lebanon were told to get to bomb shelters you got sources
israel gets attacked all the time statistically anything that lasts for any sort of time is going to overlap with some bullshit or other and netanyahu is a highly controversial politician who has pissed off most of the other parties and so he is almost always facing political pressure you might as well think it s coincidental that this shit always happens on days that end with a y
israel gets attacked no matter which government in in power
we are being attacked all the time redditors just don t upvote of those threads so they get much less visibility probably because it makes it harder to blindly hate us and hold the black and white narrative of israel bad that is so common around here
if you re being constantly attacked you ll always be attacked shortly after something happened
if you make the affirmative claim that the rocket attacks are an inside job you have to back that with evidence
not if youre arab apparently
a threat to israeli democracy will ultimately be a greater threat to israel s existence than any terrorist or terrorist group
palestinians were throwing rocks at jews celebrating passover the israeli police was called to stop them hard to believe so many people naively fall for the palestinian propaganda bullshit
liberals are getting wiser to netanyahu s methods israeli s are generally more aware of why these escalations happen and that they serve a political purpose
sources or not lebanon was bombed mins ago
nothing in the traditional media yet just unconfirmed reports from my osint setup if you want early warning on stuff check out israelradar on twitter telegram they re usually fairly reliable on getting good info early and credit where it s from obviously take things with a grain of salt
but you have to agree they re all very curious coincidents
no they are saying that a politician diverts his people s attention by focusing on an external enemy instead of dealing with an internal issue it s one of the tenets of fascism
both threats are deadly so israel has to deal with both
i ve spent time in the region american non military you can t lie to me
you happen to have more osint telegram stuff i used to do that through twitter but ditched that a while back
that is not an interpretation most people would have after reading his comment but ok
it s not fascism the us has done it plenty wait
oh wow you ve visited congratulations and now you re an expert i visited europe does that make me an phd european political science there are videos of palestinians firing fireworks in the mosque all over the place
right back at you the same could be said about your comment they didn t say it was an inside job
i ve seen you can t lie to me

you sound like a kid that covers their ears and yells i can t hear you when they don t like what they re hearing
could say the same thing about you i m an israeli i served in the military here mostly in the west bank i was here during the second intifada second lebanon war and every operation in gaza in the last years i can tell you from first hand experience things aren t the way you think they seem in the news
seems to me like palestinians shouldn t be throwing fireworks and rocks on jews and then hiding in a mosque and expect that the police won t come try to stop them i don t need the news to tell me this
at least flux capacitors

obviously the current situation works well for us and western europe eastern europe has different worries
i mean the existing members can set conditions to membership so they could just go sure you can join on the condition that none of us are obligated to respond to article being invoked for this conflict
ukraine will eventually become a member it s just a question about when
how exactly would that make wwiii a certainty that makes no sense russia would back down or get their ass beat
the guy who worried about russia is an idiot the only way for ukraine request to be taken and voted on is when russia has ran out of steam

same type helicopter cause accidentally crush some years ago
shouldn t it be several people go missing aboard a japanese helicopter
no because that would imply the helicopter is not missing and the people aboard just up and vanished
or that the helicopter is really really large and while the people are definitely there other people who boarded the helicopter can t find them

give em hell ukraine
russia does not have any perspective running this war
we ll be seeing a lot of this as ukraine keeps the russians guessing as to where the axe is gonna fall
hasn t ukraine been pretty public about mounting a counter offensive is russia using internet explorer or something
outstanding remember what makes the green grass grow
no major counter attack is likely until the rain lets up and the ground dries out a little though it s expected that that will happen in the south first looking at the weather forecast for melitopol there s some rain but not all that much maybe it s going to happen soon https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/melitopol+zaporizhzhia+oblast+ukraine?canonicalcityid=1ae84a5a155d36c00500f5b2969ea9f71834106c80027aa05cca8a6751c1abab](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/melitopol+zaporizhzhia+oblast+ukraine?canonicalcityid=1ae84a5a155d36c00500f5b2969ea9f71834106c80027aa05cca8a6751c1abab) looks like it s going to be raining in tokmak for at least a week though even if the weather is nice in melitopol they ll still have to get there some how https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/48e64485d5f4c348348bacc198d4df579db145cab0883683d9caaf18b85ed5d7](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/48e64485d5f4c348348bacc198d4df579db145cab0883683d9caaf18b85ed5d7)
duh russia started it russia should expect comeuppance for what they have done
more russians must die for that evil fuck putin god speed to the ukrainian people
good blow up as many industrial plants as possible see if putin likes it
title is wrong explosions rock russian military occupied city of melitopol
i do wonder if when russia is pushed back if there will be officials and collaborators we find out we re secretly feeding intel to the ukrainians i cannot remember the name but i think something like that happened with one of the major occupied vichy france people about the german submarine bases in france
hopefully all the civilians are evacuated
comrades don t worry its the good old fake news that you have spread across the globe its just fire crackers just sit back and stare at your favorite picture of putin hanging on the wall
that s a fucking m2a2 howitzer 105mm i trained on those didn t realise they existed outside museums now
counterattack is unlikely at this point imo they just got a ton of rain making any mass movement difficult they are probably softening up for an upcoming offensive just not quite yet

the russians are ready this time this isn t september there is no shortage of troops lack of defense lines reserve units like there was in kharkiv oblast this ukrainian offense will most likely fail badly

goooooo get em boys
eat dirt ru


outstanding remember what makes the green grass grow
i guess its because russia is used to fighting against people who cant fight back and dont have any experience or competence when it comes to actual war
this war was supposed the easy part the hard part is after the war if the invader is unwanted it will never work afghanistan vietnam hitler napoleon
all warfare is based on deception therefore when capable feign incapacity when active inactivity when near make it appear that you are far away when far away that you are to lure him feign disorder and strike him when he concentrates prepare against him where he is strong avoid him anger his general and confuse him pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance sun tzu
that s what i m thinking the ukrainians have a talent for being tricksy and the messaging about what s going on with any possible counter attack is all over the place if i were a betting man the intent is to keep the russians spooked and encourage their commanders to spread their forces out to try and defend everything at once or to goad them into a silly knee jerk reaction somewhere
probably straight for crimea tbh make russians in the north panic and then retake the rest luhansk
it is wartime nothing is set in stone ukraine might have been threatening counter offensive so that russia would have to slow down and reduce territorial gains so many military analysts says ukraine will punch right down and separate crimera and the russia mainland but ukraine s elite troops are placed around bakhmut and ready to break russian army with possible encirclements the truth is no one knows and it is even said ukraine cancelled large scale attacks around bakhmut due to heavy snow just days ago
yes but it is an incredibly long frontline and there s still lots of opportunity to misdirect suprise with it
bayonet charges
blood blood blood
the sun
the rain won t let up soon it will turn from water to hellfire
no one should be loosing their lives all because a power hungry psychotic few the masses are paying russian population does have a part to be blamed for not stopping the madness but at the same time it is population that has been fed fake media for many decades its a damn awful situation we are going through and i hope it finishes fast and with the freedom of ukraine and hopefully other russian invaded countries
is melitopol actually producing much for the russian war economy seems like most of the workers would have left factories are expensive better to leave them intact as long as they aren t being used as a military fortification if we assume that melitopol will be under ukrainian control in the not too distant future i think ukraine is doing the right thing going after rail hubs russian logistics depend heavily on trains and the only rail link between crimea and the rest of occupied ukraine that doesn t go on a long detour across the kerch or through ukrainian controlled ukraine goes through melitopol
i think it s pretty common knowledge that everyone is feeding ukraine intel edit do you mean intel from russia that d be interesting i m sure it s happening on at least some small scale
double agents most definitely certain nato nations are renowned for their use of double agents during previous wars they d definitely have taught ukrainian intelligence how to use them
the one with the lipstick
the wanted poster
or to keep the russians guessing and spooked while causing them a bit of trouble in the mean time remember just last year ukraine fooled the shit out of them
metallica is going to play the black album in all its beauty live as ukraine rains death from above on russian scum
you been living under a rock the past years
explosions in melitipol believed to be ukrainian saboteurs prepping for the counter offensive major gunfire exchange in a city in crimea believed to be friendly fire between the russian army and either wagner or another private army mercenary group as a result of tensions ministry of defense building in moscow caught fire believed to have been set by the national republican army nra a russian partisan group responsible for the recent bombing attack in st petersburg all this just in the last hours
escalate they are already at war
tensions escalating like they are getting closer to them engaging in war we are far beyond tensions
i m not sure how much they can escalate they re currently at a full scale war with each other
blood blood blood
the rotting corpses of fascist russian conscripts
it took years and tens of thousands of deaths to retake chechnya they barely able to fight barely armed militia
apparently they re even sending wagner back to africa to steal diamonds and gold from the poors again
they were losing a war in afghanistan for ten years before they gave up
did ukraine have any particular experience or competence previously i think it is strongly affected by the influx of modern weapons from so many countries putin thought it would be over in a matter of days but now there are so many others that have piled in against russia his actions have brought unexpected unity and alliances against russia
worked in australia americas tibet xinjiang chechnya and so many other places was working in crimea too history is littered with invaders not leaving and settling down comfortably that s the whole inspiration
but sun tzu s central strategy is russia s drive deep into enemy territory where your forces at risk of being overwhelmed will fight to the death if the russians had listened to zhuge liang they d know sun tzu s book is folly after all it was devotion to sun tzu that killed ma su and nearly destroyed the shu army as the soldiers meant to fight to the death turned and fled
no it s blood and entrails the good old country way
blood blood bright red blood drill seargeant
why is the sky blue private
kill
i m sorry the answer we were looking for is blood blood makes the green grass grow womp whomp wa woooomp
yeah as much as i want ukraine to win i feel bad when i hear about things like russians being sent to their certain deaths just so the more experienced troops can spot the ukraine defence it s really horrible
this it s about the supply chain for the russian military
from occupied ukraine mainly but perhaps from russians as well
im always too late what did he say lol
wait what is that about the ministry of defense building catching fire i am usually pretty plugged in but have heard nothing about this
if they re conscripts they may not be fascist just alcoholic
and chechnya is their own backyard ukraine is their neighbor their dreams of making it to berlin are straight up goofy
retake is a strong word moscow figured out a deal with local warlords where one family gets to run chechnya as a country in country and moscow gets their oil
right now wagner is classified as a criminal organization https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1220](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1220) what the us could should do is upgrade their classification as a terrorist organization that way it can be full on open season against wagner a bit more of this would be fantastic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viuuzggac5m
that is so on brand with russia they need the money for thier continued war in ukraine
psshh only years rookies
against a conventional army
so same as us and uk
ukraine was preparing for years so
i think it is strongly affected by the influx of modern weapons from so many countries and nato training and intel
i think it is strongly affected by the influx of modern weapons from so many countries compare afghanistan s government and military collapse when the us withdrew to what ukraine has done with the weapons just getting a bunch of weapons and gear will not win you a war you need to soldiers who are trained and willing to fight ukraine has shown mastery with the weapons they were given so far as well as tenacity and willingness to actually fight for their country absolutely there is competence there every single military that has trained ukrainians has praised their morale willingness to learn and drive
after the initial clusterfuck in ua had been modernizing thier military that s why russia is learning the phrase start shit get hit the hard way
i wonder if all the genocide had something to do with it
australiaand and americas don t really counts since those natives didn t have acces to ieds and a lot of guns and other explosives can t speak for the rest though there s a lot of counter examples as op said vietnam afghanistan but also palestina ish and western sahara is still an enourmous shit show and these are probably way too shortsighted to put in as an argument because i guess nobody really tried to actually settle there but most of indonesia is also still indonesian and most of africa is still african could swing both ways but the ammount of recourses behind ukraine would probably swing it more into a vietnam style
uk too
if the russians listened to zhuge liang they d probably have wheelbarrows to carry stuff around quicker too
if the soldiers were able to flee they weren t in a situation were they had to fight for their lives and barrier troops won t work if the opposing side offer you to turn your self over
the art of war makes it clear retreat is an option and that it s good to not be afraid of shame if you must retreat i don t think you ve read the art of war
bc god loves the infantry
and why is the sky blue
there is no bombing mischa just like no war in oceania
if they rename bakhmut to berlin they might have a chance
bizarrely they ve almost made it to new york though
   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5rgqsevviu my direction to the chairman was for the force then to be annihilated mattis said and it was
the difference is that it completely broke them the us just got bored and moved on
well no us conquered kabul within a month and occupied it for years the ussr spent years without ever getting to the occupation part
they don t call it the graveyard of empires for nothing
so let s just assume that it s really that easy to compare yes the same what would this fact change in this current discussion
not really only minimally this invasion was not expected until they started building up which was not that long before the invasion
genocide and colonization helps a lot
it s the difference between fighting a near peer war and fighting one of total domination
from what i ve seen of russian logistical capability that may actually be an improvement
there s never such a situation honestly unless someone is dedicated to a theory like clausewitz part of the problem with sun tzu is that it makes a lot of assumptions about what the enemy will do it s a taoist philosophical treatise disguised as a military manual
hizbollah and palestinian terrorists have taken the whole country of lebanon as a hostage for their futile war against israel
what a surprise
iran involvement possible how unexpected
netanyahu wants this from the moment he took office he has been intentionally poking the tiger to provoke a response exactly like this why i have no idea but his actions have been intentional so when things like this happen it s not a surprise at all netanyahu wants it and he s getting it i honestly believe he wants to start a war but doesn t want to fire the first shot this way he can claim to be the good guy
they also took gaza hostage those terrorist do not care about their own people at all
they provoked this whole mess by throwing rocks and fireworks at civilians provoking a response from israeli police
rome depopulated the jews years ago before they returned to form israel it s been about years since the palestinian expulsion they ve got a few centuries before your idea of futility kicks in
this has nothing to do with netanyahu even the opposition leaders said they would support netanyahu s response against the terrorists this type of attack has happened repeatedly no matter who governs israel
i m the last person to ever defend natanyahu he s an hole and i do think he is capable of such actions but blaming this entire situation on him is racist beyond belief you re basically saying that the palestinians and the lebanese are nothing more than mindless deadly beasts with zero agency
it s a tactic that has been commonly employed by corrupt leaders like netanyahu throughout all human history the goal is to divert people s attention to outside threat justify power grasp douse fire on his ass the list goes on many wars have started because of this bs
yep this happens often too those terrorists like to hide weapons in the mosque to make israel look bad when it inevitably responds to prevent a terrorist attack
not at all what i am saying and it s not just him his coalition also wants this that s why they wanted him
i m a dumbass and even googled casteist to try and understand but alas dumbass can somebody please explain like i m what casteist is exactly something about indian classes
you probably shouldn t go to prison for saying mean words online
since long ago india had a system of classes based on their profession this is called caste based on the system the brahmins priests were the highest caste and were considered the purest since they worked with god the second was khysatriya warrior basically the king nobles etc whose job was to fight wars and keep the kingdom safe the third is vaisya businessman these were the traders and stuff who made business happen the fourth were the shudras these people worked as garbage collectors barber drain cleaners butchers etc basically people who had to get dirty for their jobs and were poor the people of the lower castes were forbidden from touching the higher caste as it was considered that they would make others dirty it fact in some places the brahmins would refuse to even stand in the same shadow as the shudras or even look at them dalits are a race of the one such shudras since the abolition of untouchability they have been given equal rights by law however some parts of the society still treat them as dirt
caste is associated with untouchability which is still running rampant in indian socio cultural and institutional life despite substantial progress on social and legal reforms it is best for you to see what untouchability looks like in action in this documentary and many others https://youtu.be/um85zvt6xcu
yes they should go to prison for breaking the law as mentioned in the article
this was very easy to follow thank you
thank you very much i ll give this video a watch now

another challenge is the tight hold of the hindu caste system on record keeping while most of the older firms captured details of brahmins khastriyas and vaishyas another set of priests has records for scheduled castes our records are relatively recent maybe just years old this is because caste hindus would not allow sc people to leave their villages and come to pilgrimage centres says gangaram of har ki pauri ghat who deals exclusively with family histories of scs it is only in the last years that people from communities like meghwals and regars have started coming here he says adding that poverty is another reason they don t travel

china has changed their relationship status to its complicated
words and meaning are unrelated china ambassador
to be fair china s ambassador to the eu saying this is also nothing but rhetoric tell everyone what they want to hear
china will do anything for russia but they won t do that
we weren t even dating
it s okay russia you still have belarus and north korea
it was a typo it was meant to say no limit friendship oops they shouldn t have the un logo there either
nothing we say should be trusted come on you should know that china s ambassador china ccp
china we re friends but not like that
i mean people are calling bullshit but it really isn t it s probably one of the most honest things they have said in awhile about the war lol china taking advantage of russias lack of options to exploit them for personal gain and control they also get the bonus of demonstrating how costly it would be for nato to intervene in their conflict with taiwan if russia ever became too large of a liability they would just cut the cord they don t give a fuck china isn t stupid and it s unwise to assume their actions aren t calculated
russia is going to end up a vassal state of china did jinping bring a measuring tape with him when visited the russian state buildings he s probably already thinking about turning the kremlin into a warehouse to store surplus iphones all kidding aside if the world could just get along humanity would enter a golden age all the asinine landgrabs and ego strutting is absurd it s not the 1200s and we can all just barely manage the countries and territories we already have there is so much lost global productivity and genius because all of this state sponsored chaos just play nice fix climate change explore space make art do something worthwhile
tell me lies tell me sweet little liessss
aka ehhh we didn t anticipate russia losing so badly and the world uniting so much against the invasion
master p has entered the negotiations
he s the ambassador and speaks out both sides of his mouth xi more or less reaffirmed that partnership when he visited moscow recently i wouldn t take what the ambassador said at face value the ccp just want to pretend to be neutral to the west imagine the total shitshow with china and russia had the ukraine invasion succeeded last year i imagine the ccp would be positioning to take taiwan right about now this is why people arguing for letting the russians win in ukraine and to stop supplying arms don t really know what they are asking for
china lies all the time and will say what ever benefits them right now
to the west no limit friendship is just rhetoric to russia we totally mean it i finally understand the term talking out of both sides of the mouth
wow he just say the quiet part out loud i mean everyone always new that this no limits friendship was political maneuvering born out of need but for china to come out with a public statement as such while also setting up meetings with other regional asian powers while excluding russia russia keeps complaining that in ukraine they are fighting all of nato things keep going this way they are also going to be fighting china on their eastern flank
wish com version of no limit soliders

trusting anything china says is foolish
beijing has not condemned the invasion he said because it understood russia s claims about a defensive war against nato encroachment and because his government believes the root causes are more complicated than western leaders say basically we aren t friends but we understand why they would want to invade ukraine defensively imagine saying this and still thinking anyone takes you seriously
the relation between russia and china is literally the meme of the guy making half a heart with his fingers and the girl completing it with a thumbs up
no kidding here i was trying to find the legal meaning
i ll buy that for a ruble
that was fast
now that russia is losing we d like to ask everyone to forget our support for their invasion
china i have altered the deal pray that i do not alter it further
russia and china are inexorably tied together by geography and politics china s communism is an old russian export from the early s they were in bed then and i don t trust it is much different now
lol they must think eu leaders are absolute morons if they think that bs lie will work
no limit friendship sounds like nothing but rhetoric this syntagm was heavily used in urss and its satellites like my romania back then everyone in the communist world was limitless friend with other communist friends too bad for putin that he thought he s going to be best buddies with xi lmao
yeah china s behaviour towards russia already made this clear they abstained on those un votes but abstaining instead of outright voting with russia already sent a message and the us says china isn t supplying weapons to russia even if they are worried this might change in the future but there d have to be a reason for it to change and what could that be it s pretty clear that as always china is going to be looking out for china and no one else and yeah you can say that about all countries but china seems even more brazen about it than most others the fact that a chinese diplomat is willing to make this statement openly is one more humiliation for russia though of course but who s counting
typical china s always been a master of empty words and broken promises can t imagine russia is surprised by this one
if you lived right next to russia i would want to be neutral with them too lol how are people not realizing china only cares about china and will say and do anything to advance china only lol
america the enemy of my enemy is my friend until i have no more use for you russia the enemy of my enemy can be my friend as long as they listen to me for now china the enemy of my enemy is also my enemy but not really you ll never know talks major shit behind their back
china has a tradition of lying their strategy is literally to lie so much that it s basically impossible to pin them down on anything faced as always
china s ambassador to russia calls declaration of no limit friendship as nothing but rethoric nothing but rethoric
if i were xi i would forget about taiwan invade the russian east to the urals and steal all of their gas run lng shipments to europe down their incoming oil routes mallaca strait they could even do a direct oil swap and they now own the north pacific it resolves a fair amount of chinese geopolitical issues and wouldn t piss off the west
what a pathetic display of chinese leadership i hope the southern countries china is trying to win over for their glorious new world order are taking note
in reality the partnership between russia and china doesn t make sense in the long term russia occupied large portions of manchuria years ago as part of the century of humiliation which the chinese have still not forgotten russia is blocking china from having a port directly on the sea of japan and most importantly china does not have enough water to feed its growing population long term lake bikal near the chinese border is one of the largest fresh water lakes in the world and the chinese began construction on a pipeline to bring the water to china only for the project to be cancelled by the russian government the vast resources of the russian far east are vitally important to resource poor china and russia will either find themselves in the position of becoming a resource colony of china or find themselves in conflict with the chinese for the resources there
lmao china trying to repair their global soft power with more empty words after realizing their authoritarian buddy is fucked and the world is eyeing them up as the next troublemaker
to save face they d rather openly lie about the meaning of their earlier statement then just admit they fucked up and that russia is an out of control psychopath
note this is china s ambassador to the eu saying this
going to have my cake and eat it too
so no benefits uh
this is my i believe you face
friends without benefits
so they re just telling all parties what they want to hear giving little indication of their actual intentions cool
the ccp excels at nothing but rhetoric second only to north korea
russia china will back us china new phone who s this
also it was just a weather balloon for sure
no limit soldiers making them say uhhh na na na na
china is again pretending it s an accident when they try the wrong hole
we will play both sides so as always take nothing we say seriously it will change based on audience also russia is our little pet now and we re just reminding them that we re not actually friends we can do and say whatever we please because they need us more than we need them china basically
china we think russias gonna get fucked on the counteroffensive and are looking to separate ourselves from embarrassment
that s what xi said
putin but what of all the things that we ve shared what of all the sweet words that you spoke in private xi oh that s just what we call pillow talk baby it didn t mean anything
how about all the other bull shit they speak is that all rhetoric as well
surprise to nobody as if china really cares about russia they do not
china is appeasing its customer base
russia s in good company if their friends love lying just as much as they do
then calls putin and promises no limit friendship
oh no way so even chinese governmental peps came to realize that russia is no good for business or deals simply because they give and then break promises
ouuffffff
i wish china could be the better world leader there on a dark path with russia
more signs china has decided wester friendship is more protective than the russia alliance of incompantant nation s
he also said mr xi is too busy to call
well i do t believe anything russia and china say but this is kinda funny
even in china sold 60b goods to russia and almost 600b goods to us nobody want s to lose their export profits while trade with russia is only of their exports
china may offer to house troops at and defend far eastern russia they will just have their barrels pointed west versus east
ah the ever popular it s just locker room talk defense
china s rhetoric is just for our entertainment like fox news
guess we found the limit of that no limit friendship
in an open relationship
so china just changed their relationship status to it s complicated
i m lying bro trust me
i mean on the one hand considering what a mess russia has made of things and that putin has proven he s less tactical genius and more a reckless gambler who played a bad hand and how it undermines china s attempt to project itself as a fair arbitrator in global politics i can t blame them for taking a step back on the other hand china has also said that it wasn t going to militarize the islands it built in the scs that it was going to give foreign companies equal and fair access to the chinese market how many times i ll believe it when i see it
we re friends but not like friend friends
later today china s ambassador tells russia that the declaration of nothing but rhetoric was nothing but rhetoric
no limit friendship that s when your buddy goes to town and gets two blow jobs comes back and gives you one
but did he say earmuffs to russia before declaring this
friendship is for winners only we thought that was understood at the time
i love having friends but no limit friendship sounds like one hell of a toxic relationship has a very no means yes vibe to it
this guy is surprisingly and refreshingly direct it might just be rhetoric
china is playing some weird games that they always lose it just seems like they don t know what they re doing at a government level it s very strange
oh dear that s a big step back lmfao
any language that comes out of the ccp is nothing but rhetoric
if those words mean nothing then how do we trust the words he just muttered himself
as always watch what countries do not what they say
as if any rational person would believe the words of a communist dictator s sock puppet lol
where is master p when you need him
they re basically the ferengi from star trek most of the rules of acquisition fit that s not meant as an insult we just have to remember their motivations and what rules they play by as it s a different culture with different values from our own
sucks for them russia could really use some no limit soldiers right now
words words are wind
the pedals they also go backwards
classic their own words were apparently not what they meant down with xi down with the ccp
i personally believe it is all hamas s doing from baiting israeli forces into al aqsa by rioting to then launching rockets from both gaza and lebanon probably hoping to force an israeli response and to get hezbollah involved and ignite the entire region

the leadership of hamas and pij are both currently in lebanon lol
all of them even not just a few and it s not just them there are iranian republican guard there as well they re also wording themselves in a way that implies that a lot of the smaller militant groups have representatives present or have committed themselves to a larger command chain as well with attacks from multiple fronts gaza west bank lebanon possible syria the way this is going we might see the biggest escalation in violence in decades
two birds one stone is all i m saying
gantz has already promised the opposition will back whatever is decided in the security meeting being held right now so yeah this might get wild
during her statement lvova belova showed video of ukrainian children in russia then said i want to stress that unlike the ukrainian side we don t use children for propaganda i m sorry ma am but it s terminal
the united states britain albania and malta walked out on russia s envoy for children s rights whom the international criminal court wants to arrest on war crimes charges that s it
i want to stress that unlike the ukrainian side we don t use children for propaganda so says the russian official during a propaganda speech
she should be in jail
she should save her speech for hague
albania and malta as well always good to see others standing up for basic human rights against wanted war criminals
u s ambassador to the u n linda thomas greenfield told reporters that the united states joined britain in blocking the webcast so lvova belova did not have an international podium to spread disinformation and to try to defend her horrible actions that are taking place in ukraine can we do this for rupert murdoch too another international figure whose organization spouts an endless river of bullshit and lies and strives to make life horrible for everyone but him it may not be strictly relevant but the parallels are there
sure they returned children back to ukraine i ll believe that when there s indisputable proof and not before
the un security council is an utterly outdated institution so much control and influence dictated by so few nations none of whom should have any special authority to do the things they do russia is the most egregious example when the ussr dissolved the permanent member seats should have been disbanded there s no way that russia undemocratic and economically small should have any place there is it because they still have nukes well how about replacing them with a nation like canada which not only is economically larger but is peaceful democratic and actively dismantled their nuclear weapons decades ago seems like a much better example to the world than russia
it s falling apart for russia you just document and apply heat right now the focus and energy is the counter offensive and push russia out which they will i guarantee ukraine will hunt her and find her if russian officials don t hand her over after this illegal invasion goes into accountability phase
so russia s argues that they where not signatories of icc to explain why they are not responsible for their war crimes would that not also mean that they are not successor state of soviet union and if we go by that line of though doesn t that mean they are also not permanent member of security council or members in multiple other post wwii agreements could we not give that place to one of the countries that gained independence when the union fell ukraine and russia both where recognized as independent states on same day after official dissolution of the union so i would say they have equal claim for that seat and now russia has denounced their claim right
can t believe i live on this planet lol
it s a shame she didn t show up in person for her arrest
why didn t others walk out actually why was this russian crap even allowed at un in the first place
did reuters run caption this column competition at a special needs school again
televising the revolution is not the way the revolution must not be televised the revolution will be live
if russia didn t murder and kidnap children it wouldn t be used as propaganda

the cognitive dissonance in one sentence alone while using children as propaganda to make the point that they don t russians really are gold medallist world record setters in mental gymnastics
someone put lead in the vodka
this is the unsc not the wider un body two permanent members and two of the rotating members her webcast was blocked by the permanent members and the rotating members are generally less likely to make big demonstrations especially when she s already been muzzled
she wasn t there she was telecasting not sure what more you want them to do edit misunderstood i thought they wanted the us and uk to arrest the tv or something i must need more coffee or more sleep not sure which
it s only a member council and have you seen the other members the only one i m surprised about is france also not walking out everyone else is too in bed with or pressured by russia or china to try make a statement
well france wouldn t walk out on russia neither would china
using children
it would be nice if ukrainians did mossad thing on her and she suddenly somehow appeared in the middle of kyiv tied to a lightpost
removed
rupert murdoch is not representing a group wanted for war crimes
the unsc does exactly what it was designed to do and it does it very well it prevents the major now nuclear armed powers who were victorious after world war from going to war against one another
the un security council is an utterly outdated institution so much control and influence dictated by so few nations none of whom should have any special authority to do the things they do calm down donald
so much control and influence you mean no control and influence at all all they do is talk which is better than not talking at all but it also doesn t change anything ever
the problem is that reforming the unsc takes a decision of the unsc do you see the problem
we never had our own nuclear weapons they were american weapons under american control on canadian soil
because the rotation of who is president of the security council fell upon russia
day old account that spends a lot of time commenting similar viewpoints to russian state media
i was going to the say the same but i think we can all agree that russia is the worlds biggest problem right now and the war crimes they have committed are off the scale insane
to not give a podium to a war criminal justifying a genocidal war against a nation and the kidnapping of children maybe that s okay in your book but i m gonna go out on a limb here and say most of the world would rather not compromise with a nation who explicitly sees no problem with doing so
america bad so it s ok for russia to kill civilians abduct children and invade sovereign countries you bitch about whataboutism while doing it yourself fuck me sideways you re dumb
when did the us or uk kidnap children
care to come with an example
i thought you kiwis are smarter than this
you know about whatsboutism besides that when did the uk or us kidnap children
maybe dont bomb ukraine in the first place then you dont have to kidnap children
it s really not mental gymnastics of any type those words should be used to describe something difficult and impressive an overcoming of one s own cognitive dissonance through an acts of linguistic and pseudological circus tricks modern fascist liars just say wrong things on purpose with full understanding that they are lying and that you know that they are lying it s not difficult and it only works because people continually insist on acting surprised by it
nobody s more humble than me i don t make predictions i never have and i never will
yes and there are other countries on the unsc i would expect to see
unsc russia have no chance against chief
united nations space command with a few mac rounds in atmosphere we could get this war sorted out quite quickly
that s not what i m talking about i m wondering why those were the only four countries that protested
i ll tell you what though arrest the tv or something made my face smile and make sounds nicely done
why not france
arrest the tv that would actually be hilarious years later the tv lady is released and goes on a trip around the world and realizes how psychotic the lies of its government were tv lady falls in love with man on radio and the two raise toasters in the suburbs
actually yours was a fair interpretation that s it was pretty vague
someone has to remain to veto any bullshit that muskovy tries to pass through whilst the unsc is in session
huh i would feel japan not walking is more surprising than france whose leader makes weird statements about how ukraine should be returning to the negotiating tale with russia
i get the feeling that as the war continues the west is going to have to reckon with the actions that the ukrainian sbu their kgb successor takes during the de russification that will likely take place
doesn t have to be a wall just need a good backstop
that sounds like an average russian jail
his news outlets have praised and propped up fascists and war criminals it s his company so he is responsible for giving putin a voice and attempts at white washing his reputation
obviously you ve never watched fox news
that we know of s sort of
is he though gop iraq i m just asking the questions
yet
yeah this is what some fail to understand once all avenues of dialog shut down war is inevitable
war between the perm members would be human extinction period
wort wort wort
the un has done nothing to stop that the only thing that s stopped russia from attacking other countries is knowing that they d be obliterated by stronger nations look at georgia and ukraine as examples they attacked them before they could join nato because they knew they wouldn t be able to do it otherwise meanwhile they are paying bounties to kill people of those nations and funding terrorist activities like shooting down civilian planes as well the only thing stopping full blown war is that cooler heads are prevailing and know they can retaliate through other usually economic means if you can point out time the un stepped in and stopped a war between two of the council members i d like to hear it
russia should be kicked out of the unsc then ww3 can start
i don t think it s necessarily trump esque to consider that the world today is different from and might be even more different in the future are the five countries we agreed were world powers in always going to be the be all end all defining world powers none of them might lose say their vast colonial holdings maybe say around the 1950s or their many subordinate republics around say no other important countries are ever going to emerge
and un allowed that rotation fall to happen
russia ain t the biggest problem at all if there is one it s usa maybe it will sound funny at first but once u start reading the history u will get the answer of modern day conflict has to do something with britain or usa and it s a fact

i agree with you no ones can say that war is the solution but don t forget that ukrainians were bombing people in donbass since not a justification but in this case the point is that those children had the alternative to remain under the bombs or be brought into russia i think they have been lucky to go to russia instead of risking to die that s my human opinion
it s almost as if it s so bad that it s very hard for any well adjusted person to even comprehend such moral deterioration it feels awful to share the planet with these people to accept that they always hold more power than actual good people ever had every moderately sane person keeps hoping that it cannot be that bad and they love taking advantage of that
weather today low humility
lol its un security council but fuck it lets send blue team to donetsk
i m wondering why those were the only four countries that protested because the others are spineless or actively sympathize with russia this is the security council with only members other than russia spineless france switzerland japan uae ecuador ghana russian sympathizers china brazil gabon mozambique
dunno you d have to ask them it s not really a surprise that the us and uk walked though the others i d like to know their reasoning i didn t expect them but then i don t keep up with their internal politics so that may be why
but the council members have to unanimously agree to allow it to be webcast diplomats said it is rare for a broadcast to be blocked from an article that is referenced in the above article uk is supporting us but one has to object in order to block
france are always massive gimps internationally
deleted
the ones that walked out were only the un ambassadors of these countries they left minor officials behind to continue to represent them
absolutely it s not gonna be pretty but necessary
these bastards don t deserve an easy out from this world they need to be in prison for their natural lives forced to live under military guard and trotted out as an example of what happens to fascists who think they can harm people
i have it on good authority that even more war criminals make a good backstop
i think people are advocating them not having a veto not not having you know any diplomats whatsoever i think most of the people making this case are fine with russia being allowed to use the phone if they want to
actually no only usa and russia has capability to end human life other nations there have nukes but only few of them as a detterent able to destroy few cities not to carpet bomb entire continent yes china as well
they re everywhere
if you can point out time the un stepped in not op but i can tell you un has never stepped in because un cant step in un has no authority and its by design its not some sort of a world government its an international forum it cannot stop the council members because the council members and all other members are the un
removed
easy igor your conscrption gonna arrive soon
not many have this system reportedly it can counter iskander and kinzhal type missles no coincidence this story broke alongside nato ascension and deployment of missles to belarus edit not many meaning israel and finland us joint project but not deployed by us
seems like finland is getting ready for some serious air defense better safe than sorry i suppose
i can t wait to hear russian comments
i m surprised russians are not just fed up with putin and fucked him off clearly his actions have seen dead troops run from russia an economy slowly dying nato increase in size and half his generals and millions in military hardware destroyed territory lost in ukraine a failed invasion of ukraine way more ukrainians hating russia than ever before and now a subservient partner to their old enemy china has achieved sweet fuck all in securing russia when it was never under attack in the first place a complete loser if there ever was one
wow finland just dropped a casual million on an air defense system i wonder what kind of protection that will provide

why do these systems have names like this
despite a close competition mary magdalene s dildo came second
i too played with slingshot when i was a kid small boys small toys big boys big toys hell yeah
with all the stockpiling of weapons going on i wonder if there is a non zero chance that there is a bigger world wide conflict which these weapons will actually have to be used for in the near future say years you always expect small regional wars but conflicts where icbms start flying back and forth all throughout europe well i thought we got over that phase
ironic considering the goliath role the technology plays in todays war games
nokia tipped rockets are nothing to mess with
kinzals are hypersonic how can a missile defensive system stop missiles that they have never tested it against
it s a wise investment in a hypothetical scenario it forces russia to either suppress air defenses and fighters to deliver ordinance to finland or use volume in hopes of overwhelming knowing many may be shot down or finally to use their bigger intermediate stuff it exhibits textbook deterrence
the usual right they will destroy them they already have more advanced tech nuclear forces ready what am i missing
the tally was estimated around billion in losses late last summer yet it still pales in comparison to the damage done to their reputation as a premier military force
i feel like people on reddit just underestimate so much the impact of rebellion against an intrenched autocratic leader half the western world provides some kind of support for rebels and even then it s been years hundreds of thousands dead millions displaced and assad has basically just stayed in power the last russian civil war lasted years and ended with million dead there is just no way people are going to go down that road unless things get way worse imo the most similar comparison is the sailors mutiny in germany in ww1 and the situation then was way worse than modern russia
it s complicated putin has systemically undermined arrested gained leverage over anyone who could challenge his power he has been doing this for decades while not all the population of russia support his actions a significant portion do it s very much like the trump supporters in the us they believe what putin is doing is necessary to make russia great again to them the loss of life is acceptable the western style economy is just wrong and basically stopping trade with the west is a good thing it s largely fueled by nostalgia for the soviet era another portion of the population drink the cool aid and willfully believe the propaganda really they just want to keep their heads down and avoid any trouble many of the people who strongly oppose putin have long left russia educated well informed people seen the writing on the wall back in it s unlikely that even if putin was to be taken out tomorrow that things will change putin s likely successors are all of very similar mindsets it is likely that a successor would pull out of ukraine but only to rebuild the military it s unlikely that russia will be friendly with the west any time soon
it mainly provides protection against next generation missles and rockets of medium to long range this includes cruise missles unmanned drones and a variety of baby ballistic missles that don t leave the lower atmosphere it also handles very slow moving targets it s a direct counter to russian kalibr iskander m as well as the old soviet stuff unit cost per missle is about mil development costs are hard to narrow down when factoring the additional funds requests it s shown advanced capabilities and in theory and testing able to handle a barrage of missles it s relatively unproven but that is typical for most advanced missle and rocket defenses
hehe
shit s gonna hit the fan
precaution finland has prepared for russian invasion for years
this has been in the works for quite some time israel hadn t approved the sale until now finland learned preparation lessons the hard way and it appears they haven t forgotten it s a precaution and a deterrent i would be willing to wager there s no specific threat at this time i will say that only one regional adversary has the capabilities this system is designed to intercept there s no doubt who it s designed to send a message too combine this with recent creation of a unified airforce with sweden and norway and its a formidable and comprehensive air defense i guess it does bear pointing out that the system does not protect against ir or icbms
i just cannot see then daring to attack finland in any way not now they can barely make any moves in ukraine let alone start shit elsewhere
it s apparently been in plans to buy this way before the war in ukraine
nah we are just replacing our old aging stuff
yeah it s a heady play curious as to why it s only been sold to finland but that s another rabbit hole i suppose
hmmm i think it rhymes with smusha
goliath of course who else would it be effective against
israel isn t in nato and finland just joined every country needs air defense especially with such nice neighbors weapons are going to sell regardless
it use to be called the magic wand so maybe this is an improvement israel likes it s biblical references in weapon names
because just like a car the manufacturer can name it whatever they want since it came at least partially from israel they re choosing to use some biblical references to the story about david and goliath likely because israel sees itself as david in the middle east up against various forces that want it extinct
why not they could have just called it generic missile mk vii but that s boring
do not underestimate stupidity of the humans
kinzals are basically just shitty repurposed icbms all of which are hypersonic and have been for decades if it can stop an icbm it can probably stop a kinzal
ballistic missiles are usually hypersonic they can reach mach the newer hypersonic missiles that are in the news now only go mach to mach the main difference is ballistic missiles fly a ballistic curve so from the start it s trajectory is known kinzal etc fly way slower but gain maneuverability to better avoid defenses it s a trade off go fast and predictable or go slow and unpredictable russia is going the second path
kinzhal is the plane launched version of the iskander the system is designed to intercept these types of missles which are next generation long range missles it s advertised as a capable counter to missles on similar trajectory and arc to your point the system is relatively untested in a real world environment against these types of missles so some skepticism is warranted that said considering the capabilities of both israeli and us missle defenses it s likely effective
it forces russia to either suppress air defenses one of the things that s amazed me about the war in ukraine is the apparent lack of a cohesive or effective russian sead campaign that s just an entire doctrinal branch for the u s military and the russians are just ad hoc ing it with a few specialized missiles and no specialized aircraft
also they are holding back on thier more advanced weaponry im pretty sure those are defending putins palaces and not being used in ukraine
russophobia
putin has really exposed the russian military strength and capacity has shown how inept it is and how dated it is the numbers and stats look impressive but as we have seen a smaller better trained and motivated army with some modern weapons can hold off russia if not for the nuclear arsenal russia would be ranked about
i will say that only one regional adversary has the capabilities this system is designed to intercept there s no doubt who it s designed to send a message too damn yellow country fun fact throughout history after world wars finnish defense forces used the term yellow to mark the enemy country when doing training and simulations last year after handing in the application for nato it was actually nato which asked finland to stop using the term to avoid confusion now fdf talks about imaginary country called russia
never underestimate the foolishness of a man who fell to paranoia and ideological delusions if the man in the bunker gets told by his advisers that russia s military is the greatest and that finland would fall within days why not invade now why would his advisers tell putin this because the very same man who receives the advice ordered his advisers to only say shit that aligns with his opinion even if it was only indirect i e people who were honest and expressed criticism fell out of windows that s exactly why ukraine got invaded and it absolutely can happen to another country
but why did they wait until after finland was in nato to announce this
finland is the second least corrupt country on the planet so finland might be a reliable nation to give it to as they won t just sell it to china or russia or let them go study it and might also just be good for finland to have so aggression from russia is even more illogical
note that david sling isn t meant to stop icbms but kinzhal also doesn t have the range of an icbm it s a repurposed iskander
it cannot stop icbm
not an icbm it s made out of iskanders which are much smaller slower and shorter ranged and entirely capable of getting shot down
so far kinzal seems to be just a iskander launched from a jet i don t think there s any proof that it has actually the capability to manouver mid hypersonic speeds russia says it does but i m going to take that with a grain of salt
well they approached the entire effort extremely overconfident because of what they thought of as an ad hoc air defense they seemingly didn t account for the proliferation of manpads and other portable systems in general as evidenced by the effectiveness of the javelin nlaw and an old soviet nemesis the stinger now that the fight is condensed i see their limited sorties using helos and multi role aircraft with survivability but in an extremely limited manner which is very unbecoming of the supposed 2nd most fearsome force on the planet the missles are the threat like you said ukraine is unable to stop even basic ballistic missles let alone russias dwindling stocks of advanced missles russia has done its military reputation great harm but i don t want to undersell the determination and resilient manner in which the ukrainians have defended their land such resourcefulness and grit
they don t have much capacity for it because they don t expect to be in any position to be doing it they re either going to have utter air superiority like over chechnya or be totally out matched against nato ukraine is a very strange edge case out of all their possible war opponents
we are very peaceful etc
now fdf talks about imaginary country called russia i m sure the name is coincidental and has no relation to any specific country
this been prepared since in five companies were sent offer requests and in there were two choices left barak mx or david s sling and now it was decided that it s the latter
there s many countries among nato and otherwise who i don t think would sell it to russia or china lack of corruption may be it but i d guess there s more backstory russia claimed through chinese media sources they retrieved an interceptor missle which was launched to intercept a tochka missle originating in syria erroneously believed to be headed for israel the missle reportedly did not detonate
i was responding to the comment that said the system could intercept icbm i may have wound up in the wrong place
well the apartment buildings they ve hit surely tried to dodge but they were out maneuvered
they were the 2nd most fearsome force on the planet and then they invaded ukraine now they re the 2nd most fearsome force in ukraine
if anything it seems like they didn t account for ukraine having s 300s which they know perfectly well are there
exactly it s not like finland is insinuating anything i mean the enemy can come from east but also from the west obviously coming from west means the enemy is just trying to flank us but that s beside the point
they kept hitting those mostly using cruise missles numerous batteries were destroyed early on and then it became a slow trickle over time but many have been lost the other problem with the numerous s300 systems in ukraine are the missles themselves they can t restock them since they are russian in origin

maybe i m just used to the software usage of the word but doesn t an update imply that there s something new or that there s been a change this is just a repeated statement
who had a motive to blow up the pipeline who had the capabilities to blow up the pipeline who benefited after it was blown up
what s the ukraine update no mention of ukraine in this article about swedish investigators updates on sabotage of the gas pipeline between russia and germany
after years of hearing how incompetent and corrupt the russians are at everything we now know for sure they didn t blow up nord stream in perfect secrecy leaving absolutely no trace of their involvement behind because let s face it if even the faintest evidence russia had anything to do with it existed they would be parading it around non stop it would be all over the news and the nyt would have already written articles on why we need to send even more money to ukraine to show russia we won t let them destroy another pipeline etc so at least we know who didn t do it
it s pretty obvious that the united states had the most to gain from this it seems incredibly unlikely that the russians would destroy the one thing that gave them leverage over europe s energy market and as much as the ukrainians would like to have blown it up i doubt they would ve been able to without help from the united states so if that s the case then the united states committed an act of terrorism on civilian infrastructure that was owned in part by their own allies that s not even mentioning the massive gas leak which has caused an ecological disaster in the region i think the only plausible explanation for the russians having committed this would be to frame the united states because it s so blatantly obvious to anyone who isn t completely lost in the sauce that the united states had a hand in this
well just days before blasts happened there were russian army trainings nearby that happened to use ships that have all specific equipment nessesary for such blasts training was conducted using specialists whose area of expertise is underwater explosions and since russians built those pipes they also were those who knew exactly where and how to blast all this info is right on official russian army page

how is that an update we already knew it was unclear
didn t they say it was a pro ukrainian group like a couple months ago likely ukrainians without evidence the country provided any assistance
we d have no problem saying who did it if it were not the us
update breaking news update girls don t pay attention to men on reddit breaking news update
the us
why russia blew up of nordstream pipelines they did the same thing to georgia they did the same thing to turkmenistan they only destroyed their old pipeline while leaving the new one intact false flag to make nato allies suspicious of each other jack up gas prices to fund dirty war in ukraine break contractual obligations to germany so they don t have to pay fines for non delivery germany had already shut the pipeline down for the foreseeable future create energy crisis in europe weaken europe s solidarity and support of ukraine make it difficult for a rival to knock off putin and resume relations with the west frighten russian citizens and make them more subservient to putin the pipelines were a leaky billion dollar boondoggle destroying them takes criticism off the table false flags are putin s trademark starting with the moscow apartment bombings of which he used as a pretense to invade chechnya veiled threat to other countries that putin can blow up their pipelines too russian subs are active in that part of the baltic sea russian warships were in the area days before
russia russia us
outing russia as the culprit invokes article of the nato charter and starts ww3 would you risk it
what purpose would it serve for the russians to blow up a pipeline that wasn t running seriously what benefit is it to them
well yeah children on reddit shouldn t be paying heaps of attention to adult men
spot on
which is probably why everyone is pretending that russia didn t do it at least in political circles
at that point they counted on europe freezing solid during winter those pipes also needed certifications before they could be used but germany paused certifications so they blew out of and just a few days later russian official asked to resume certifications hinting that this one remaining pipe might be the europes only saving grace if something happened to those pipes going through ukraine obviously they counted that since there would be one pipe left the prices would increase even more and europe supposedly be more agreeable to russian s conditions this is just another attempt at gas blackmail
hard to explain anything russia does as they are governed by insane individuals with no plan or strategy that s why they must be stopped any enemy with no plan is worse than an enemy with a plan russian army has no plan just random acts of terror ukraine are fighting a war but russia is just fighting for the hell of it
right it makes more sense that the us or even poland blew it up because germany was sitting in the fence
it wasn t in use they can stop the flow without blowing it up
they have plans you can say they re bad but putin isnt in there dressed like the joker
hard to explain anything the pentagon does as they are governed by insane individuals with no plan or strategy that s why they must be stopped any enemy with no plan is worse than an enemy with a plan pentagon has no plan just random acts of terror ukraine are fighting a war but pentagon is just fighting for the hellish profits of it
they wanted to use it but germany prevented it by not certifying it if someone else wanted to prevent the entire possibility of using the pipes they would have blown up all instead just were damaged but 4th remained untouched there is no reason to leave one pipe in this situation unless there is a plan on using this remaining pipe that is why russians talked about certification again right after the incident if all the pipes were active and russians just stopped the flow it would be seen as a breach of contracts and they could be sued but if there is just one pipe that remains it limits the amount of gas that can be transported thus possibly raising the price if there is a deficit in the market as it was then
they didn t do it lol
nnone else had the means specific knowledge and reason to do it you need to know specific location know material of those pipes have enough explosives and finally have specially trained divers that are extremely rare russian fleet that visited this region mere days before explosions had all this no one else capable of doing this was seen in the area at the moment of explosion and russia benefited from it since gas prices went upwards right after
the us can certainly do it
so you say that us could send a submarine of some sorts all across the ocean to blow up inactive pipe knowing that blowing it up mainly benefits russia not really plausible
yes considering also russia can shut it off without blowing it up
why submarine contractors with an underwater drone loaded with high explosives shaped charges could have done it in one night must be alien then
