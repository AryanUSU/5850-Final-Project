yeah i ve been there
seems like a reasonable response what s this from
if a cashier did this to me i would still be like understandable carry on
can confirm everyday working at a grocery store is like this
if you want them to bag it then you get to shut the fuck up and let them do it if you want it your way the you diy
me at target dealing with trophy wives shopping
organize your shit how you want it on the conveyor they get it no guess work
what show is this
how is that unexpected
not far off from the truth the people who were the most particular about how their stuff is bagged always seem to wait until you re halfway through bagging to mention some ridiculous shit like actually i want them double bagged paper inside plastic or they finally remember their cat piss suspiciously moist reusable bags and insist i unbag what ive already done to use their bags you do all that and still some crazy old lady that definitely didn t pass through your line blames you for putting liquid soap at the bottom of one of her bag and it leaked before you even have a chance to apologize anyways even though it wasn t your fault and offer to go grab a new one for her she scoops up a glob of the soap at the bottom and rubs it on your arm with a vindictive smile while your manager watches all of this and does nothing
that s why i bag my own shit
this is so fucking real
the bottom of the bag is the beat place for eggs the vertical axis of an egg is ridiculously strong thr eggs are safe at the bottom of the bag than balanced on top where they could easily fall
i worked at whole foods in one of the wealthiest zip codes in america and i wanted to do this so many times if you have such specific and fickle instructions then do it your fucking self
do you expect me to bag these myself well obviously you have so much experience that you can so yes
wrong sub that was expected
this is how my everyday goes in my head i m trying to change that so far no success
i ll never forget writing at a grocery store started at one sunday morning a blonde woman with her brunette daughter cane into my line they were probably the most miserable customers i ve ever dwelt with the woman had a full cart claimed that she corker bag because of her bad back i started bagging she through a fit because i wasn t moving fast enough was angry that i wasn t smiling the whole time angry at me because she forgot her store rewards card her and her daughter kept berating me telling me that i was bagging wrong and not scanning her items fast enough amy little inconvenience was a huge problem her coupons were all expired i ended getting the manager my manager was a great woman the mom and daughter told my manager that i was doing my job incorrectly along with other complaints my manager finished checking them out and then walked them out of the store she came back in and told me to take a break manager knew my whole family my siblings had worked there before she knew i was a good worker i never saw the woman or her daughter again pretty sure my manager told her not to come back i ll never forget their faces though been almost years
that would be so incredibly cathartic
coco died and letty doesn t want her around and she wants heroin
my sister used to work at walmart when she was a teenager some karen started spouting off racist shit to her when she wasn t processing her return fast enough my sister did this to her head
how do you not bag your own groceries it d be ridiculously awkward for me to just stand there doing nothing
i mean i bagged groceries in my teens the stuff she was saying wasn t wrong the attitude she conveyed while saying it mixed with the what is it your first day was the reason she s a cunt you don t put chemicals in with food whether it s sealed or not is irrelevant you generally are told to bag eggs and bread separately because of the fragility this was the way i was trained it might ve come from customer complaints but it happened enough that it became company policy
ya she was an ah to start but the food w chemicals and eggs not being in the bottom is common sense i wouldn t have been an ah about it i probably would ve just been like actually i got it and bagged them myself
that was awesome
not really unexpected though it s exactly what we expect having to deal with karens all day
honestly this was expected
wrong sub who didn t see it coming
having worked in grocery stores before i think her response is a good way to express how i felt most days
as an ex grocery store bagger this is too real
we bag our own here this is slavery
bagging for myself is f ing normal in my countrie
that wasn t unexpected
this was expected
dunno this was kind of expected
i ve had that job accurate
what movie is this
yeah that s working front end in retail in a nutshell
that s what michael jackson gets for being bossy
yes you are supposed to bag it yourself
expected
isn t this from the mayans
exactly what i expected because that s what i wouldnt have the balls to do
i can t even remember the last time a cashier bagged my groceries i normally shove all the heavy stuff in my rucksack and the light bits in a reusable carrier bag in the uk we ve been bagging stuff ourselves for decades and having to pay extra for each bag we use hence we reuse bags maybe corner shops in the early 2000s but they re so expensive compared to supermarkets it s just easier to sort the bagging myself also chemicals are safely secure so can go right next to fresh produce for all i care if they were in your basket or trolley together then why the issue at bagging together i m more worried about frozen stuff rubbing condensation onto other things so if i buy a book clothes or toy they are kept separate from the frozen pizza or anything smelly
oh shit i felt that at my core to all who ve been behind the register you re not alone
my bosses niece does this she is a bitch about it
every day
thank god she did that karen bitch was getting on my nerves
what does she scream at the end
everyone complaining about how their groceries are bagged have never seen how these items come off a truck or get stored in the backroom if you think your eggs aren t getting shipped with things piled on them think again you think those chemicals aren t sitting next to and on your food as they wait to be stocked zoned and returned to shelves think again i delivered food for wal mart those strawberries in a plastic shell have absolutely touched the floor before you bought them they are known for exploding open when unloading them oranges apples other produce they roll right out of those cardboard sleeves and need to be picked up that customer in this video and lots of other people would never touch food again if they saw how it was made and handled before they bought it you live in a fantasy world bag your groceries and wash your produce before you eat it
as a cashier i can confirm that this is exactly how it feels sometimes as someone who likes to believe that he is at least hald decent at bagging and constantly gets the you must be really good at tetris remark from customers it is one of the most frustrating things when some middle aged ass hole starts micromanaging every little way i bag and i always just wanna say oh ok so your better than the guy who does nothing bag grocerys for hours a day days a week than fine you can do it also eggs are actually quite sturdy especially on their vertical side and unless your putting heavy items like large cans or milk on top it is typically perfectly safe to put eggs on the bottom
god i love this i love it so much i wish it was mandatory for everyone to work a shitty job at some point in their life learn how it feels
that lady is a great actor she really portrayed that hidden anger inside her you could see the fury without seeing it the scene the environment lighting all of it was very good
that was my first job and i felt like this every single day this wasn t unexpected at all instead of requiring every citizen male to participate in the military for a couple years like some countries do we should make everybody work in retail service industries like this betcha we d achieve world peace by the line between being serviced and being entitled to the service is so effing thin
its sad that people cannot see that the troll won that round so anyway where the hell are the shopping baskets where is the bagging area
who the hell double bags paper plastic sure but paper
the lowest laziest form of life are the scum that stand there with their symbolic thumb up their ass as their crap piles up waiting for the cashier to magically transform into a bagger
i am sorry what did she scream say all i hear is day at the end
don t suck at your job
i never pick the line with the white trash lady with tattoos to avoid situations like this
it s not that deep
she looked unhappy from that jump needs to quit before she gets to that point
not sure how that s unexpected saw that coming
this is bullshit if she can handle the money then she s been trained to bag the groceries properly cold items go together heavy solid things on the bottom eggs bread and chips on top or by themselves customers never had to correct us professionals i hit items per minute there were tricks to boosting your numbers like locking your register quickly after scanning a bunch of stuff and we could swim scan items as fast as we could run them over the scanner scanning then bagging them up quickly 1980s at brunos no in hoover al we had full sized registers that would be customers deep friday nights saturdays and parts of sundays we celebrated when we hit 100k sales in a day soon we hit 200k holidays checks and cash no debit or credit cards i moved into the office to count it all make deposits and balance the books we were open hours a day
customer service has slacked a little since covid
soft
you decide to work there and it s your job to bag the way the customers want it i spent a good part of my life in walmart doing the kind of stuff why so pissed off and taking your anger out on a customer redirect that energy and improve your life sure some may say i have no idea what i m talking about well i have worked at walmart kohls bestbuy tax processing fry s electronic assembly lines and finally got an engineering degree and got out so i got to know many people from different backgrounds along the way and why they did what they did if you don t like your job better get a degree and a better job potentially being miserable every day doing what you don t like is exhausting that s not to say that there are no rude customers asking you to do a backflip for them
this is where the word karen comes from
well that s basically what would have happened if she put the eggs on the bottom with the cleaning chemicals anyway
and that s why their are more self checkouts then cashiers
that was like of eggs
it takes two yes the customer was terrible but the cashier didn t have a clue about how to bag groceries really management s fault for not training their employees these days they expect them to learn on the job by making mistakes that cost the customers money so everybody s angry at the wrong people
not unexpected
still better than the cashiers at aldi
what movie us this from
yup
this is me every day
dude i literally couldn t give a shit how they bag my groceries i m just trynna get home
great actress make her a star
i want the manager
i was hoping she d walk out with a smile i wasn t disappointed
good acting
god bless her
that s how i feel at work sometimes i feel her and sometimes i have asked god for patience
you cant do that nooo whaaa
yup
good for her
this reminds me of working at the postoffice
if i m the manager here you just got yourself a promotion
this is just as predictable as that shoe store return video
fully expected
that was exactly what i expected
why didn t you throw the eggs at her if your gonna get fired for that it least get the other person messy
anyone that s had a service job can relate
love it i was going to suggest boot to the head
so satisfactory wish i could do that sometimes
poor girl be working gif emote free_emotes_pack cry gif emote free_emotes_pack cry
i smiled when she did that i ve worked as a cashier before and in other forms of customer service so i will always understand if a worker gets pushed to the edge and loses it they don t deserve to be treated like garbage especially with how little they get paid on average
she really played that part well those eyes

scroll thru grindr
the woman actor does a great job of just being natural
i know that is comedy but as a straight individual i never really imagined the roles reversed in a family dynamic like that it s really sad to think about anyone being rejected by their own parents flipping it around points out how fucked up it would be regardless of the reason
mom dad i just want to let you guys know that im not comfortable in my own body i feel like i need to let the real me out starting tomorrow i will be transitioning from male to alpha male i will be taking copious amounts of steroids and hgh i would like for you guys to refer to me as sigma or alpha
this would be funnier if the dad was drinking bud light
their acting and comedy was on point this was funny af
the most unexpected thing here is a video using the term pov properly for once
this video literally was made by liberals as a joke and you guys are making it political most of you are the reason comedy is going down and everyone is walking on egg shells to not offend fukin laugh for once and stop taking it seriously
no gay son of mine isn t not gay you either get gay or i ll make you gay https://youtu.be/e5i6bhbuqxe)
we ll sit down together and watch what will we watch h a i r s p r a y
this was hilarious so funny no son of mine and maybe you re just not a bottom hahaha destroyed me
holy shit people it s called satire and it s funny af calm down y all
sort by controversial
what s shocking is that certain goofy orthodox perpetrators will actually believe this is happening and be outraged and share it around as anti human propaganda
this is just epic
this is ironic humor to point out what a bunch of assholes anti lgbtq parents are
maybe you re not a bottom you should try being on top is fking gold
yo she thicker than a bowl of oatmeal gyat

when your father s boyfriend gets back home you are in for it mister
maybe your not a bottom try being a top had be rolling great skit
i would dearly love desmond is amazing to also come out as straight his parents would have a stroke
this would make more sense if the parents were also gay
this is like a joke skit right
mom s acting is awesome

funny and thought provoking
very well acted it seemed so genuine my compliments to the actors
we can as a family just scroll through grindr
i can t believe the dad is so exclusionary not once did he even go for the maybe you re bi copium ssbtqi2s
this is pure comedy they did great
i never get tired of this one they did such a great job with it it s so funny
why s everyone bitchin this is funny
no son of mine could be straight killed me by laughter
regardless of the seriousness maybe you re just not a bottom lol
reminds me of the birdcage great movie btw
this never gets old i love it
i mean it was done better years ago on snl but old jokes are ok i guess https://youtu.be/kcvnklrb84u
i thought the couple were brother and sister and the guy was coming out i need another drink
so good
absolutely love it
frickin hilarious
lol
the best part about this skit is that as a husband and wife they re losing their minds over him being straight
good acting lol
i was literally married to my wife for years and had two children with her when my mom stated that she thought that maybe i was straight after all i relate
u savevideo
genuinely hilarious
ive sent this to everyone i know
i always find this video funny considering the parents are a straight couple
u savevideo
holy shit this was funny
great acting
how i download
don t really care what is going on in the world this is hilarious and i appreciate the laugh
now this is fuckin funny well done
we ll watch hairspray
omg
whats the source on this do they have more videos
friends did this joke in season years ago
thanks for the laugh just what i needed
weird that the parents are straight
i legit lol d at this well done
they got that backsplash at lowes pretty affordable recommend doing a professional install
snl years ago https://youtu.be/kcvnklrb84u
this is sooo cute i love it
i get it s a joke and all but like his parents are straight how can they be mad
mr show did this better over years ago
this video is throwing liberal reddit in an absolute mental blender
i don t know if this is a left wing attempt at pointent self commentary or a right wing attempt at comedy but either way it s a level of cringe i previously thought humans were incapable of
this is the world liberals want
i m aware that this is all a skit but this shit is real a buddy of mine just got told to move out because they realized they were straight after all and his parents got really shitty about it
this is actually terrifying i know a family who s pushing their young boy to wear dresses and to experiment being a girl they said at his age he s not capable of making a decision on his gender the poor kid gets bullied and made fun of constantly because they ve taught him how to tell others that he s non binary he s a boy he wants to be a boy but he s afraid to disappoint his parents it s actually very tragic and sad
millennial parents be like
what every us republican thinks the family unit will turn into if the pronoun people have their way it s chaos
bravo this is hilarious
aren t they a straight couple
i think coming out anymore might actually be admitting your strait to your parents
lol
u savevideobot
that acting was pretty good
gif giphy q7ozwvycr0nyw2rvpw
lock when
but how did they so is he adopted or are the parents bi or pan something like that i probably shoudn t be thinking too hard about it but how
is that brother and sister or husband and wife or is it both
south park did it
but your straight
so very cringe
but the parents are straight

lmao babylon bee tier of amazing fuckin hilarious
i wish her pants would stay in the closet
wait that s actually a thing
why is he so mad a his son being straight isn t that what most liberal parents want
this is so stupid the only people who care about other people sexuality are conservatives not liberals
the dad being the most upset is telling and it honestly never matters if it s a boy or girl child
maybe you just weren t a bottom
mr show did it better
so they basically stole the joke of a very old snl sketch

the fact that it got instant replay is fantastic
dad reflex
lol i watched that being played on tv yesterday while at a bar i had a great laugh about it
what cute unexpected moment
my question is why is that kid there
the better question is golf has instant replay
masters of disasters
oh my that child is a cutie
worst streaker tackle i ve ever seen will they ever recover from such a hit
my daughter was about that age and got away from me at the salvador dali museum she made a beeline hands outstretched right towards hallucinogenic toreador she ran right under the velvet rope but a football player sized guard swooped in plucked her up just like that and put her back down by my side she looked up at him dazed and confused
can somebody make a shooting stars edit on the kid getting picked up because it looks like he s flying away before the cut and i think it d just be neat to see that meme come back for a moment thank you in advance
so cute watching them caddy play the par course
my then toddler stepson went under a rope and almost collided with an enormous focault pendulum in a museum my husband scared the living shit out of his son with a caveman scream so he froze and inhaled to start crying a stranger who was within reach took this moment to scoop him up by the suspenders of his dungaree like a shopping bag crisis averted crying fit activated

are those jordan golf shoes i had no idea they existed lmao in the cherry color way at that
man i love hv3 what a cute kid
sooooooooo close too
how many strokes penalty would it have been
call the cops that kid is a criminal stole my heart
quite a wholesome moment the cute kid just being a kid and the adult gleefully scooping him up and having fun with the moment all for us to enjoy kid will have footage of this to enjoy when they become an adult
jordan has really penetrated golf guy in the pink shirt air jordan low golf copa blue heel guy in red shirt air jordan low golf cherry red
good save
his daddy senses were tingling
the par competition on the wednesday before the masters is one of the best and most wholesome events in all of sports
just in the nick of time
that was close
omg the cutest kid ever and he looks solid
that there is a reliable dad
nice save
i have a year old this clip is me all the time
sad that he went to liv but happy that he s making his money
lol i thought the unexpected part was that he got scooped up by wish brand tiger woods lol tiger mdf out here
such a cute little guy
new rule no toddlers on the greens
yeet him into the pond
imagine if he had then kicked the ball by accident
not all heros wear capes
that s the fastest i ve seen a golfer move
deleted
probably the most interesting footage of the day but that s not saying much i guess
the only interesting thing to happen in golf
that man back there is define having a boner
gopher woods
thats not tiger but dude dressed like tiger wtf
the real unexpected part here is that black people are allowed at the masters
breaking news for the first time ever recorded a parent did not let their child do whatever they want to others in a public place the parent did not need to make a lame excuse like they re just a child or try to deflect the issue with you were a child too as they had successfully watched their child instead of their phone it remains to be seen if this is the start of a new trend or just a unique occurrence
why the hell is a child out there in the first place can we not even have professional sports with people parent jacking them
omg the referee with the huge save most energetic commentry in golf
who the heck let their kid onto the active golf course i don t even like golf but c mon bad parenting

this is a powerful little moment

don t know a lot about golf but didn t realize toddlers were allowed on the course
this reminds me of darren baker and jt snow in the ws darren baker jt snow ws https://youtu.be/wzv7x8wcr4g)
play it where it lays

remember the golden rule always play where the ball lies so golfing on a kid s hand would be dangerous
holy shit reddit fixed the spoiler tags
cute kid i know that they are a child of a well known golfer but why let said child on the course while playing a important game
in my experience the director calls for what goes on the program feed the technical director hits the button on the switcher to actually make that happen and the flow of the control room is highly dependent on the director some are huge dickheads and it s miserable some are awesome af and it doesn t even feel like work but to the original comment about replay ya it s a super tough gig live i do graphics and i have lots of respect for the replay guys
he pulled the eject lever
son in one
i don t watch golf but why was there a toddler in the middle of the game in the first place everybody thinks this is cute but aren t there rules about where spectators stand and if it was the dad who grabbed him as he was reaching for the ball why did the dad let him wander around i m so confused

either allergies or she gonna cry but that looked like a full on skull rattler right there
i guess she didn t know that you re supposed to bow first like you do for hippogriffs
that horse lady is tremendously composed after taking such a hit i just don t understand it
horses can be like people some are dickheads
i know that face the face of fuck that hurt but i can t cry just yet

she can take a punch
honestly she ate that horse headbutt like a champ
nah it s pretty expected horses generally want you to back up
i expected that
nah that was very expected lol
this shouldn t be unexpected to anyone who s been around horses probably why she didn t react horses spook and horse people know if you put your head too close to their head they can knock you tf out
as someone who is around horses none of this is unexpected
she shook that shit off like taylor swift

german tv reminds me the lawless lands my homeland tv was back in the 90s i spent some weeks in berlin last year i was watching some darts competitions at the hotel tv then when it was 12am suddenly porn my wife showed up right at that moment thinking i had subscribed some adult channel lol
that ll do pig that ll do
this needs to become the new rickroll video
normally logs come out of there
a bit much but nice butt
haha german tv is awesome i stayed with this german family for a week like years ago i remember the family all being in the living room as the parents watched tv and there was casual nudity all over the screen while this year boy and his older sister literally played chess they could care less about the nudity as an american i was like wow this is what it s like to not suppress sexuality
man i love the germans
what da dog doin
unexpected one of the judges looks like gordon ramsey
i saw this live on tv also in case it hasnt been done before woman in tge jury shes not gonna put it back there is she gordon ramsey hes not really nooooo she wont and then tge women proceeds to beg the other two to press the red button to make it stop
as a german i stopped watching tv since over years now maybe you can guess why
talk about phoney overreactions the act was bad but their response was so over the top
is that judge one of the singer in modern talking band
that s a nein from me dawg
what a booty i would feed it as well
german porn is something else
one of the first contestants on america s got talent back ehrn jerry springer was the mc was a woman with breasts the size of her own head who smashed them down forcefully on beer cans to crush them seems like we are all equally weird in different ways

germany was like the less prude place i have ever been
so what s her name you know for science
that dog was butt ugly
people that talk about gordon ramsey are so lucky they never heard of dieter bohlen
americans are too prude to allow this
i don t understand german did she win the show

well seems like they re in heaven as of now
the kid will be from heaven for sure
this is exactly why curtains are important
horny for the lord
everyone needs a rest
the guy is in heaven for a minute only
what is that thing they are carrying and why
more bad is the guy started recording them instead of focusing on that
when i read the title i knew it was gonna be somebody fucking i thought they were fucking on the palaton cuz it was moving so much
either way they re fucked
i thought they were rockin the float not all in the window
neither they re going to pound town
why should they go to hell
does anyone happen to know the song playing in the background
https://youtu.be/ok2or73tgp8
heaven at that time
nothing going on here dude is washing his clothes while bathing move along move along
should have thrown a pebble at the window
it s nice to see a priest taking care of the altar boy
she must be screaming oh god i am coming
well they certainly won t be going to valhalla as far as the other two guesses not likely
talk about the second coming of christ

i was expecting a big ass fire or something
one goes down one comes in few minutes and other in 9months
they re now on reddit so both i guess
but why would you record this
depends on if they are gay or not
i m sure they re going to heaven oat least one of them was praying oh god oh god oh god ho my gawd
toma
both are a man made control apparatus
neither cuz they don t exist
given that neither place exists i d say no
they re in heaven but they re going to hell
that s her last supper bwhahhaha
mankind knew they cannot change society so instead of reflecting on themselves they blamed the beasts heaven or hell fight
hellven
is this holy or unholy to do
depends on outcome if they re just entertaining theirselfs and not making a baby then i guess they ll go to hell
just unload them from memory and free up some disk space right now
only god can judge the human but the goat will likely return to the earth
well i m sure that answer will greatly depend to most people on if they are both guys or not i mean it s impossible to tell i personally don t care either way and i don t believe in heaven or hell or any religion for that matter all religion was made up just to make humans feel a sense of relief believing there s an after life i mean the reason mostly everyone is just complete assholes is because they believe even if they act like shit oh god still loves me and will forgive me no matter what
neither exist
heaven or hell is easy i want so them do the hell or hell
i think heaven and hell is a ridiculous notion
i said yes just lead me on
heaven on earth
amen
looks like they might already be in heaven lmao
didn t think this would make it to reddit
dude
maybe they hadn t quite grasped the concept of dogging
well i dont believe in it but im pretty sure theyre already in heaven
haven of course
mardi gras looks way different irl than the movies made it seem
heaven for sure
well did he cum
at least one of them is already in heaven
and here i m expecting them to drop the shrine or something
all into the ground for decomposition for not procreating and idolizing statues
that s why lights out is the best when love making
oookay i was not expecting that
semena santa amirite
it s not the going that they care about it s the cumming
i think they re going to cum
was this the first or second cumming
reminded me of this https://youtube.com/shorts/fohh8dbzfgw?feature=share
am i the only one disturbed by these type of scenes
go forth and multiply god
lol that truly was unexpected
boners for mary
that s why you turn the lights off
it s probably cause of the beasts
not for me to judge
they re in heaven as we speak
not my proudest fap
idk where they are going but i know they re cumming tonight
would have been a fun twist if they turned and swapped positions
are they gay bcs both of them look male
a hole in the ground or into a fire
this was indeed unexpected
yes
i think they ll eventually go to the grave
enjoy themselves a little bit of the last of us cosplay i see

holy backshots lol
so this is the infamous holy f k
he s going to heaven she s going to hell
they are doing some yoga for jesus

ironically although this is a skit the kid probably doesn t know what it is yet anyway and will find out what it was they made him hold when he s older
i liked mr d but thought the advertisements for it were misleading the clips make him seem like he s a rational person in a crazy world when he s a fucking nincompoop if you go into the show knowing he causes all of his problems you ll probably like it

mr d is a great show if you have prime check it out
lol damn rocket ship puts me to shame
i fucking howled when he slapped it away lmaooooo
this is one of the funniest things i ve seen in a while
i missed it who was in drag in that video no one you say yet children were still somehow exposed to something sexual how is that even possible
kid needs to stop smokin
dude is acting like it is covered in fire ants just take it from the kid and let his mom know she probably wants to put it in a different place
what a sick fkd world great idea let s kids involved
oh this is a model of the new spacex rocket
i found my mom s dildo while looking for drugs
why did the class gasp wonder how many of these little kids actually knew what they were seeing
is that templeton from animal control
it s a rocket ship https://imgur.com/gallery/kicdcve)

i literally was thinking the same thing
yeah it s funny but also messed up like this is innocent enough to not harm them mentally but there was probably lots of laughter on set and the kids would definitely like to understand what s so funny but there s no good way to explain that to a child
yeah it s from mr d a canadian comedy series about a teacher
that s the joke yes
at least it probably was recently purchased unopened unused can you imagine having to ask the prop master to add this to your inventory for a kindergarten scene
how did you feel when he got promoted to principal

these post are getting out of control
don t know about the rest of you guys but i help my wife when she does this if i want her to be up there then i gotta lift her booty to help
just sit down and use your hips
i hope this n the 1st that inspired this are the only ones don t ruin a good joke
when she does it she has a body underneath her she s not holding her weight up in a squat position
y all know most of the weight be on our hips and y all grind back and forth stop acting like y all hold up that weight
what is the plausible explanation offered for someone filming you while you re filming not that she s really filiming edit reframed my question
i laughed at the male and female version
how the turn tables
another copycat
i m used to the woman being on her knees straddling me have i been doing sex wrong
gif giphy 5xtdarin81u0kvlnzko
can t wait for the toe fetish version of one of these wiggle them toes harder now if you want me to do that for you you gotta show me you can do it too
bro that s not even the optimal position the best riders drop their knees down thats the lame way
i take a peak of heaven when she does that without sitting on my hips
my wife used to do this for me children later i miss stuff a lot of stuff
just get a diy support lol very cheap and very hot
mans aint got no legs
i think the take away from all these posts is people need to fuck off with effort and time expectations it s sex just have fun
sex ed but awesome
this is why doggy is the best position
that window is a jail window believe me i am an expert this poor cunts in jail

women and men s hips are different but either way i m sure it s still a good workout thanks ladies for all your hard work
alright it s not a comparison both sexes put in work in sex in very different ways however if a man wants his girl to do the same thing for the whole time it s extremely difficult everyone is different but i tap out at around mins but i have extremely long hard oragasms which are physically and mentally exhausting is it more exhausting for my partner idk i m not him all we both know and care about after sex is that we both had fun and we re both exhausted and hopefully we both came but dudes saying women don t move and just lie there isn t true at all and if it is you re likely doing something very wrong lol
lol funny but clearly biased compared to man on top at arms lenght
women s center of gravity is in their hips men s center of gravity is in their chest
nope men have certain roles women have certain roles to or pretend like we don t is nonsense
the whole world has become sex maniac
women hardly move during sex men do most the work you are fine ladies
he doesn t have a dick supporting him inside
well you have a person under you so it s easier
one position cut it out and women don t be riding in a sqaut position like that lmao
there s a missionary one where the girl is gone done in seconds and she s small men usually are better at upper body exercises and women are better at lower body exercises in proportion to their weight that s why most dudes love upper body day most woman overwork lower body and you rarely see women overwork benchpress like men do
so this actually doesn t count cause when i m bussing from the back i m in gorilla mode on my feet sooo they need to come up with another
she has to be under him or it s not the same just sayin
sorry what s unexpected here
i think this is the only pose where your gf fianc stripper idk just whoever you fuck where they actually move around instead of laying there like a sex toy

pretty sure ur supposed to put ur weight on it both disco godfather and dolomite said so

hahahahah it s like that other one but opposite and with emojis turbo radical
make them stop please
i also help this guys wife
exactly and the real reason is you distract urself with the tension in your arms and shoulder so u can last longer
gif giphy dnbtfz1sfy6ro downsized
doesn t feel as good
girls love this but personally as a guy this doesn t feel good at all lol
its easier to sit down and rotate
yes you are in that position you are bouncing your body up down that s lifting your whole body up down in a low squat probably lower than that good for deep penetration grinding is way easier then she s able to sit on her partner moving forward back good for hitting the g spot i m sure there s names to these moves but i don t know what they are
that position specifically gave me thighs of steel when i first started doing it my legs would shake and i would literally collapse we re absolutely holding our weight up in a squat position try it out
tell me you re a man without telling me you re a man you re deffo are holding your own body weight in a squat position try it
also she s been doing it for years
yes it s called assisted squats not that hard actually
lol calling out the grinding instead of bouncing
she is timing him
ha no on the knees is probably more common because it s easier i pop up onto a squat position when i want to show off give him a more interesting view but i can only last like that for maybe one minute before my quads start to give out

gotta love how women being dead fish during sex is still our fault i haven t experienced dead fish syndrome
of all the brain dead bullshit in this thread lmaooo
this guy can t fuck confirmed
um if a woman isn t moving during sex you re doing something wrong
what what are you having sex with as someone who squats and does hip thrusts squatting is more difficult
no way i am here for this trend
no its the healthiest thing ive seen towards sex life men get to see how tiring is sex for women vice versa
no we want more

just being a bro for ya boi rawesome

ya gotta bounce it true dat bro it doesn t
if he had a body underneath him he d be able to have a very quick rest between each stroke comparable to box squats what he s doing here with no body under him is putting constant tension on his muscles more comparable to pulse style metabolite training that builds lactic acid it s usually a bit harder i m not saying it isn t hard for her with him underneath her but this isn t an accurate comparison

we all wish we had abs like that

because it s way more common for one
yes and it s easier once you get rid of the car got to exercise to get to work now the question is do i exercise to eat or eat to exercise
i m not the one asking for abs lol i m just giving the reason i do work out but abs are just too much dedication i m at the point of my life i m happy with just getting rid of this gut you are right though best way to get motivated to work it is to start going i like how one person i heard recently said it even if you just show up and leave that s a start

gender identity is kinda a 1st world problem let people do whatever and let s focus on hunger education and violence
i hate they they need a better pronoun dammit i just did it didn t i
this is stupid children for fux sake are dying from lack of clean water people are dying from hunger disease violence etc and they argue about nothing this is a sign of our decline as humanity
do people suddenly get selective amnesia when they say that you cannot use they about a singular person we have always used they as an ungendered pronoun that person has a nice bag they must really love it so i complimented them on their nice bag
omg who cares
also hottest man alive isn t a pronoun
this is the problem with these types of conversations the person with the problem is being disingenuous when they say stuff like this they are intentionally missing the point just to be able to argue
they them is whatever at this point people still hung up on that are just getting rage baited pronouns do get silly as hell but that s a minority of people who wanna be called zur zim or some shit then it s just so absurd that it s not worth being mad over it s silly but they them is not a big deal man people are weird for being so caught up on that when there s so many other bigger problems in the world and your own life
the fact that this is what s getting discussed and not the mountain of actual fucking problems in our world makes me sad
this man doesn t know what pronouns are
stupid gotcha clip
ah yes the classic spout bullshit at someone until they get flustered and make a mistake that you can use to prove their argument is wrong tactic
just say love call everyone love male and female job done thanks sir ian
christ on a crutch i m losing brain cells listening to this
he doesn t know what pronouns are
pluralizing in reference to a singular person has been very common usage in the english language for centuries for example if you don t know the gender of the person being referenced oh you made a new friend are they nice did you invite them over this weekend or if signifying the gender of the person is irrelevant like as a preferred pronoun when a person walks through this door the first thing they will see is this painting staring back at them it s not a stretch to use it as a standard pronoun this guy s just being a contrarian knob to pander to idiots
its silly is the point here have a nice day
another thing with this is that people against using peoples proper pronouns think it s gonna be too hard sometimes it can be a little difficult when ur unlearning something but also don t be too afraid to mess up if ur genuinely sorry about the mistake and will always try to do better also messing up pronouns once or a few times doesn t invalidate using proper pronouns it s not a gotchya moment and as others have said hottest man alive isn t a pronoun we use singular they them all the time and piers morgan is trash
i have such a problem with this too not only with calling somebody they them but calling what i believe is an obvious male or female based on general visual confirmation the opposite gender in which they dont fit and i m not saying oh don t change your gender you don t fit being a female or something along those lines i m okay with you changing your gender to be happy or to be comfortable in your own skin but my problem like which i stated and further of people get so offended when you call them the wrong gender that they freak out this is like a public service announcement dont believe that people are going to change what they call you overnight and you cant change what people call you who dont even fucking know you there was this guy in my art class in high school last year who s real name was crystal that was the name on the attendance sheet but they went by adrian we had a substitute in class one day so they were doing role call and the first time they called out adrian s real name they were like actually my names adrian in a snarky rude way and the substitute kept on actually calling this student by their real name until adrian literally walked out of the room to go have a talk with the principal because the substitute kept forgetting his name like how how can you think that somebody who has no relation to you at all would know which gender you go by what you wanna be called i just idk like i wanna be polite and i wanna call you what you wanna be called but if you re not gonna be forgiving to somebody who s first experience with this is you how can you expect people to ever call you what you wanna be called i just don t get it this ll probably be severely down voted it s not hate i understand the gist of transgenderism i just don t get the heavy sudden push to get people to accept your gender it s not like you re gonna die tomorrow take it slow if they don t get it the first few time give them fucking time to learn it it s not like they don t want to accept you unless they actually don t want to it s just such a sudden change they probably spent years calling you something so it s odd that they now need to call you something else give them time
i already call him the biggest fuckhead alive isn t that enough
chad
hahaha the mental gymnastics these people have to do to make this work
piers morgan is such an intolerable twunt
does he as a journalist not know what the definition of a pronoun is
anybody who sees all of this nonsense as anything other than a pop star who i never would have heard of otherwise trying to create controversy for attention along with all the other gender politic idiots is dumb as fuck
sam smith was born with a penis so sam smith is a he him change my mind
removed
gotcha b lol
we need another great depression so people can have something to actually be worried about instead of this made up pronoun garbage
this guy is a true and knowledgeable person
everybody talking about piers being so ignorant and incorrect and going on about how easy and normal it is to call people they seem to selectively miss the part where even the person arguing against piers called sam he
okay but piers clearly doesn t know what pronouns are
this idiota don t know what is a pronoum
can we stop giving piers morgan oxygen like why
my pronounce are joseph stalin please respect me
expected clown fireside chat was not disappointed
boom
goddamn someone put that man six feet under what a piece of shit
she made an honest mistake that fuck head piers morgan is intentionally misgendering all the while defending himself like a child throwing a tantrum
this guy is a complete waste of everything that goes into making a human being a complete total utter worthless piece of dogshit
why do jerks always present phrases and clauses as alternatives to pronouns in this case the problem is that the thing that would be acting as the pronoun is the man and the rest is extraneous i suppose he could get people to say i think man is being a stain on man s undershorts just to get a reaction ted cruz claimed his pronoun was kiss my ass which is an independent clause it is like replacing a pizza with a handshake i am not convinced that pronouns are a real issue but there has got to be a better debating strategy
my pronouns are re tard
this guy is most despicable
there is not a single pronoun in hottest man alive is he really that stupid edit i love being downvoted when i m right if you think any of those words are pronouns you re part of the problem in the world
lol the british don t hold back when it comes to pronouns and trans rights etc even though in their culture crossdressing is considered art just as long as it s a he with a penis who is putting on skirts and makeup
piers literally stealing words out of other people s mouths and claiming as his own what a complete twunt
woman in red is a smoke show wow
i don t respect pronouns for this reason not only being grammatically incorrect but also demands respect for people i have no respect for nor have any reason to
hottest man alive would be an adjective pronoun and verb dumbazz pier really sucks at sucking who cares
good argument
pronouns are total bullshit and are what people refer to other s in the third person i e when that person is not even there so it is compelled speech even in your absence it s narcissistic and only shows contempt for others to your face i ll call you want you ask me to your name a nick name a new name fuck it i don t care but to compel my speech even when you are not there fuck you and the horse you rode in in
why can t you use ze fe ye qe re de pe le xe ne ke for referring to transgendered people ze zim or ke kim
pronoun a word that can function as a noun phrase used by itself and that refers either to the participants in the discourse e g i you or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse e g she it this non of these words are pronouns the hottest man alive apache attack helicopter keepconservativesineduation
it s official this talking head is a pos
as my friend says his pronouns are king and lord
totally agree with piers on this it s all a load of ridiculous made up bollocks and should be classed as a mental disorder
here ye here ye from henceforth i decree i shall be called the man with the golden dick or main man or your highness or king dingaling or sgt sexy
they and them plural so sam smith has a multiple personality disorder is what they are saying
i m a hardcore liberal f that pronoun nonsense you re a chick cool you re a dude i m calling you a dude
pronouns are silly i ll call you what you want but overall it s just a cringe trend
hottest man alive has a point haha
he s comparing an opinion or name vs a gender it s sad that he believes that s the same but even worse no one can argue his dumbass statement
i mean if you want me to call you they we probably won t ever speak again don t know who sam smith is but he needs some sleep
originally this argument came from matt walsh but still some common sense from piers morgan
example that person has a funny hat hey leave them alone they aren t bothering anyone they them can in fact refer to a single person you re just a bigot
they is simply grammatically incorrect i have difficulty using it i don t have a problem with people choosing genders and whatever not my problem
that man gave you english so listen to him they is plural
the mental gymnastics of the few outweighs the fucks of the many
my pronoun is who as is who cares
pronouns are a joke because they limit free speech
gif giphy 7zyu1ws6schlrfd4zx downsized
i totally agree with him it makes me uncomfortable to comply with all this pronoun nonsense
they re answer here i fixed the spoiler of the unexpected part
nobody notice op linked the wrong video lol
was in a shop the other day and stay with me cam on over speakers i know the store can not do much about it but it just made me nauseous and i stopped shopping and walked out the door and got in my car
stop it
when can i bring up to hr that i was introduced to a new team this week and got a hey girlllllll from the flamboyantly nail polished vp on the account i refuse to put pronouns beneath my email signature but maybe man guy bruh bruh dude just so that i as a straight white male am appropriately and respectfully addressed or maybe stick to my name
when she says no why does it sound like she s throwing a bunch of other sounds in there
in reality calling someone a name or pronoun they want is just being polite if you want to purposely call them something different you are just impolite not sure why this is such a controversial topic lol this has always been the case with he she getting mad at someone that makes an honest mistake is not a reasonable response either as long as no one is telling me what i have to say i could give a shit less
sam smith has jammed so many wieners in his mouth he calls joey chestnut a rookie
they should go to grammer school
i don t know why this guy still gets air time he s an absolute flog
what people on both sides of the date really cant understand is that if you arent comfortable being called certain pronouns or if you aren t sure what pronouns to use dont want to call people weird pronouns that are literally made up you can simply go by or refer to someone by this magical thing called your name idk why everybody has to overcomplicate this
u savevideobot
i was gonna say something about pronouns but i already know there is gonna be somebody who disagrees this is reddit so i m gonna sit down and keep my mouth shut
this is nonsense and his argument is bad if someone is called bartholomew dickweed and ask you to called him frank because he doesnt like his name for whatever personal reason you can call him whatever you want no one is stopping you but you would be an asshole so the thing is if anyone ask you to call them whatever pronoun just do it and move on why do you care you would call them what they dont want to be called just because you re stubborn and you feel compelled to it everyday you meet new people and learn their names and you call them by those names you dont ask for an id to see if they were actually born with that name what the fuck why people care so much
hottest man alive is not a pronoun
stfu
oops
u savevideo
he beat them at their own game lmao
he him end of story
longest man alive
soon we will get our wish to identify as apache attack helicopters
caring about pronouns is so fucking cringe it s like you don t have enough problems in your life so you create new problems
prolly changed cause he s some smith
sam is a man there for is it him or he he s just sick in the head
omg we all fuck up with pronouns sometimes but we re trying but not all of us are complete asshats about it like piers morgan
here s an idea everybody shut the fuck up

rule number of zombieland is cardio
but i be going hard
lmao i just saw a post about a gurl shaming a guy fir the exact same thing feed refreshed itself and this is the first post
for more realistic results which include the push back he should ask her to wear a strap on and go hard on him
she s doing it wrong so many wasted calories in those thrusts
this isn t really unexpected there s zero twist here
that s just bad technique minuteman
he s like macgyver using science and logic to save the day
we all know stamina ain t the reason
are we born with a natural rhythm cos that was rubbish
i always recognize that guys have to work so hard when doing this and i give them compliments and always say thank you because it is quite a workout
just wait until he has to squat repetively for a minute
cue eye of the tiger show montage of her training in various homemade ways and then how s this eh you want me to go harder peg boy how you like minutes eh
lawyer madam are you sexually active defendant no i just lie there
poor cardio don t make you nut in seconds though my guy
you don t always have to fuck her hard in fact sometimes that not right to do sometimes you have to make some love and fucking give her some smooches too
someone needs to fix that bed
this isn t unexpected
bro that s not even counting having to fight against busting a nut and doing it properly bro she don t even know to have of it
sorry but if thats how you re doing it you re doing it wrong
i dont thik the girl is that bad shes just weak its normal that you feel it is heavy exersise but a real top not necesary male can be a female with a strap on too just ignores muscle fatique and humps till it cramps and you black out if your bottom wants more and harder
but we ain t going hard on air we go hard on them cheeks and it bounce back goddammit
come to think of it its actually amazing that we can do this for more than a minute even though some of us are not even fit
i still only last a minute if she s on top
you think people are kidding where they mean getting physical
minutemen gotta learn to start slow not only causes her to lube up more and be more stimulated but for the guy makes the sensations amazing but not so much that they immediately orgasm both people get to feel amazing and if you know her body well it s going to provide the opportunity for multiple orgasms there s a time and place for the whole jackhammer her brains out but it s not all the time and every place also for the guys cardio and yoga get that flexibility and openness in your legs hips back and have a stronger core
fast learner
i have tried this myself and quickly learned how tiring it is really gives you a new respect for for their hard work
i be going hard does not inspire confidence in his sexual ability
this bed frame is trash
so basically he can go harder and not please her for roughly seconds longer
we only know when we try
rookie mistake fucking is like dancing you re not supposed to put your whole body in motion but rather individual parts of it and independently from each other most of the time hip movement is the most important part
how is this unexpected mods i don t give a shit if it s upvoted probably by bots this has nothing to do with the theme of this sub remove this shit or just shutdown the sub at this point
thats not the only available position
females
the way she s doing it someone s getting bruised thighs
pegging trainings
ok lads now try doing sexy squats for 10mins
everyone is worse off from this exchange the guy the lady and the viewers
wait guys don t last long because of physical exertion i always thought it was because they didn t know how to properly edge
but i be going harder hunny if he kept your pace you would swap him out in a heartbeat
skill issue
that s not what they mean when you only last a minute it s the dick squirt not getting worn out
bad form tho diagonal works better than just up down or just forward back work with the joints not against
females nah you re bad in bed cuz you re a douche
what is the right way
just insert it and get someone to jump on the bed next to you
minus the adrenaline tho
u savevideobot u savevideo
that ain t no hip game right there
i m sorry lmao
not realistic enough he needs to lube his asshole up and let her peg him for real
straight people are cute lmao
that s a bondage bed to start with i doubt she saying much when it s really on
i love her little i m sorry at the end lol
report as spam this is a bot
that form is weak
must be a whole lot going on there if you need a steel frame around your bed
i prefer double tap
it s spot on girlfriend and i have been getting pretty fit over the last months and everything got better i started to include cardio about months ago and sex got way fucking better
rule number when in doubt know your way out
rule number of zombieland is to limber up
fuck me zombie land is everywhere i look
it also feels better when they re a dead corpse
rule enjoy the little things just saw this yesterday on netflix
when karma taught you a life lesson
do it harder make us better do it faster makes us stronger
enjoy the little things
i love all the comments here lol
i prefer fap marathon
this comment made me laugh a little too loud somebody s mad at me now
my zombie apocalypse kit is a handgun and one bullet
it s not even cardio it s the damn glute and hamstring endurance before you get too sore even as a powerlifter nothing gets my ass more sore than sex
i can go harder but when they ask for deeper that s when i tap out
the internet wants you to know that both participants in sex should feel shame also outside of sex just in general shame
link
no babe i be going harder
happy cake day ya filthy animal
shit he s right we need to repeat the expeiment maybe film sessions and average the endurance time just to be safe for science
yea but she don t have the blood flow factor
you re not doing it right if you re not using that trunk as a bounce pad anyway
the ole brad _brace for impact
eh watching a few strapon vids i already knew women don t know how to slam of course they also lack the part of the shaft that s in the crotch so they have to awkwardly push the strapon almost with the belly
that s a lot of work and investment in seconds of disappointment
push back feels more like a dead blow all that extra thrust goes into jiggling thighs none of it helps bounce backwards
naw for realism he should pull her down and cling to her so it s even more exhausting she d last seconds
yeah that s right and send us the video so that we can make sure they are doing it right
my ex literally almost passed out standing up i had to jump up real quick and catch her from falling backwards
you are truly a man of science
for research
only way to get proper resistance yah
it s all in the hips

the look of genuine joy is incredible
kitty is helping
she went from pissed off to laughing her ass off with one meow
damn i ve watched this already i need to go to bed
yo great voices yall

kitty needs to show human how it s done regardless of kitty s success this cute video is fun
her restarting the music is absolutely hilarious

when are they dropping their first album
you re laughing the cat is pouring it s heart and soul out and you re laughing
welp that shits all kinds of adorable
the amount of people that think this isnt staged is sad
u savevideo
stop laughing kelly i m doing my best awesome kat

i love this cat
i love how dumb that cat looks so much cofidence reminds me of myself
beautiful
every time this video pops up i have to watch it times
you gotta be sisters
has the voice of an angel
fire ass music
the unexpected part is the cat actually started the video and the girl hijacked it
amazing
every time i see this it makes me smile lol
that cat is looking at birds
cat is asking us for help
i like how first she got mad at her pussy before it started singing
u savevideo
i used to open my fridge and stare inside while shooing my cat away with my foot eventually he would just come sit next to my foot and stare in with me
r savevideo
that cat was serious that look back like i got this haha
am i the only one that sees the irony of the cat trying as hard as she does or is her unabashed joy at being joined in her activity as marvelous as i think it is my heart is warmed thank you
this reminds me of a book i used to read to my kids called opera cat
see i can do this too
op sent the following text as an explanation on why this is unexpected didnt expect to get sued on the spot for a prank is this an unexpected post with a fitting description then upvote this comment otherwise downvote it look at my source code on github https://github.com/artraxon/unexbot) what is this for https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpected/comments/dnuaju/introducing_unexbot_a_new_bot_to_improve_the/)
is this guy who behaves like this
something smells fishy about this
these pranks are stupid and getting out of hand everyone thinking they need to chase views however the old guys going to be throwing his money away on lawyers attempting to sue him damn hard to prove damages when it s all on tape including them shaking hands after the apology
i mean compared to what a lot of people do on the internet this is a pretty tame prank
whole thing smells staged to me
i thought the old guy was gonna be like gotcha you just got trolled i was wrong
i was waiting for the old man to say gotcha lol after making them sweat for a minute
this is what confuses me why is this old man on the labtop at the start then the kid is seen holding it in seconds in but i cant see the labtop on the table anymore nore can i see it folded down i think that labtop is his labtop and the guy and him are working together in this dumb skit i don t think any of this is real
views on the internet ain t everything words to take to heart which i m pretty sure this lug head didn t
from troll to parole
lmao why would you sit there afterwards and still stay when cops roll up fuckin leave probs staged anyways
agree about the childishness but i gotta say i was really hoping the older man was pranking these guys back with a grandson cop
can t you just let the old man punch the young narcissist solid times square in his dumb face
you all in the replies are so butthurt over a dude shoulder tapping someone jesus christ it s literally the most harmless prank a human being can pull go outside for fucks sake
gif giphy co39srn2euiravqavq
plot twist the old man was chasing views and has a youtube channel called trolling trolls where he sets himself up to get pranked and proceeds to get upset and calls the police on the youtubers who pranked him who s chasing views now society
whole thing smells staged to me
keep your hands and your idea of funny to yourself respect
maybe this guy will learn the lesson of tactically advantageous seating it s one of the worst places to be sitting it may sound paranoid but you can t be too careful these days
it wasnt for views yet they had to record the thing
stop fucking with people
what a snowflake he s going to sue for that
good for gramps these pranks are dumb and annoying
this shit has to be made illegal
i really really want to see one of these little cunts get his face smashed in for pulling that shit sooner or later one of em s gonna win the ptsd lottery and end up in the hospital at best
i love it this stupid generation needs to stop annoying people to get some likes
it was just a shoulder tap prank that children is what s called obfuscation that s when u make ur actions out to be less than what others consider them to be just a prank harassment believe it or not most prank vids are setups fakes for this particular reason
get a real job and don t rely on people to smash that like button and if this video gets i ll poke the same old man to pay your bills
i was waiting for him to punch that kid in the face that shit isn t cool hope that old man follows through
how is this even a prank and isn t this guy in his mid twenties why is he acting like a child
i feel like i have a good sense of humour this was never going to be funny i hope the old guy gets his day and wins
i was kind of hoping that he would get punched
lot of police aren t the greatest but this one speaks the truth
stupid kid vs grumpy old male karen who will win
i really want to hear about this lawsuit
i hope he sued you as well for posting this video
if everyone would respond by politely calling the police and filing a civil suit for this stupid shit public trolling videos tormenting strangers for a laugh would stop pretty quickly in our society stop trying to make money by deliberately making other people suffer for laughs and views and you won t get the cops called on you and sued easy peasy
i hope the judge gives him the death penalty
notice the word sorry never comes out of the d bag s mouth once
why does the cop sound like nick stokes is is that las vegas
i thought the unexpected part was that the aged gentleman called his son or friend to prank the kid i was like that cop is a rrreally good actor
i really wanted the older guy at the end to say gotcha
oye thats some cringe
you guys won t believe this that s the dunk in doughnuts in my town i know that old man he practically lives there this is insane
i feel like these pranks are now outdated and they are stuck in
i d take that case on
honestly that s not worth calling the cops unless it s repeated and it s definitely not worth a lawsuit for harassment and personal injury especially when it s documented that they shook hands and there was no injury that occurred yeah the guy doing the prank is stupid but people who overreact are just as bad imo
an adult yr old
what are you in for kid serial shoulder tapping
pretty stupid prank but legally speaking it will be hard for him to prove any damages
finally a good unexpected ending
leave people the fuck alone
its only a shoulder tap but you really shouldnt place your hands on anybody
guys who are actively chasing views
he looks
agreed this is childish and stupid behaviour i d love to see the whole influencer trend along with this rubbish disappear
i know someone who is in his early 30s and would behave like this but only with close ones
cop allowing the cameraman to walk and film in front of him is your clue
i don t think this guy is trying to win anything in court i think he s just trying to raise them hell or probably using the police report to intimidate them i don t think he would get much in damages if he wins and i don t think he is after anything more than just trying to teach em a lesson
none of them were smart
well right below this in my feed is the story about the youtube pranker getting shot so i think even if the guy loses money it s better than the alternative
he doesn t need an attorney he can do this on his own including asking for the video on that phone and a lot of other stuff in discovery to show a pattern of harassment and their intent they on the other hand would probably need attorneys to get them out of this which i m sure their parents will be thrilled about
maybe they cut it or missed it but i never heard that kid even actually say i m sorry
looks like he knew what he was doing and i think he just wanted the guy s name but the cop essentially told him it was none of his business so instead of fighting with anyone he just says he wants to file a report so then the uni must file an official report which then makes it so the old guy can get the young guys name
that s why this reaction the commenters are having to it doesn t make any sense to me
they staged the police force to come down there makes sense
parole you seriously think this would lead to actual charges
they staged the cops coming down there like they went to the local police station sat down with a couple of cops invited the old guy as well and staged the whole thing around snacks that s your train of thoughts
that sounds like a reasonable reaction to being tapped on the shoulder
to being tapped on the shoulder tf is wrong with you
that would get too many views
yeah people wishing the old guy would have assaulted him really need to get a grip
to the point where you re literally getting downvoted for your comment everyone s weird now loves tesla
maybe just leave people be when they re minding their own business fucking with people especially an old guy like that is stupid let people be in public without having to worry about some asshole fucking around
like the cops could come out with such reasonable points for no reason cause someone wanted to stage a prank
he wants to press charges because he got tapped on the shoulder hes a snowflake
that sounds like a reasonable response to being tapped on the shoulder
if you have the capability of flipping shit on someone for tapping you on the shoulder you honestly shouldn t be out in public additionally since you re looking to shame the kid the prank is in the hiding afterwards if he had just stayed put after tapping him and offered to go refill his drink the tap is all the same and you wouldn t be outraged it s not a crime to tap someone to get their attention and you re certainly have no obligation to stay put after you ve tapped someone
you hope he hires lawyers for a dead case and loses money wtf is he going to follow through with
you need counselling kid
he looks
do you think the cop realized it by the angle it looked like the guy might have been concealing the camera or otherwise not making it obvious he was filming
very true
he s just trolling them back
i really doubt the old man really thought through all of that in that instant i m sure the thought was limited to something more like i m mad as hell by god i m gonna sue had he thought about it at all i m sure he d have realized it s going to cost him a lot of money to raise them hell and intimidate them i m sure he came to that realization when he sat down with the lawyer
he is taking it a bit too far to teach them a lesson in reality he might ruin their future since they will now have a police record
i heard about that only thing surprising is that it hadn t happened sooner
there s generally no discovery in small claims court and this would get tossed in thirty seconds there s no tort no damages
seen it on multiple threads same reactions one guy even compared it to the youtuber who got shot doing a prank and everyone else saying he needs jail like chill it s a trash prank but so was the old guys overreaction calling cops and shit
its a joke because it rhymes
maybe the cop was just an actor in disguise i mean there are tons of staged videos where cops shows up we don t even see his car in this video just some blue light coming from the window and a sheriff car passing by there was this channel doing gold diggers calls police and fake cops shows up all the time
oh come on you don t seriously think every policeman you see on video is real do you david dobrik has entire skits involving fake police officers including the fake imitation police car these guys just had to go to the right halloween and prop store
yes tapped on the shoulder then threatened to sue for personal injury prank was dumb but the old man s overreaction was way overboard especially since the guy owned up and apologized first reevaluate your priorities
yeah this was posted in some other sub too and the majority of the comments were basically the same i feel like i m the crazy one here when i say this really isn t a big deal at all it seems like when he realised the old guy wasn t into it he apologised and stopped unless there is more to the video and he did it multiple times i really don t see the major issue here sure it s annoying but you can just tell the kid to go fuck off wasting police time and threatening to sue is extremely petty and just makes the old man come off as a snowflake
it s a tap on the shoulder good lord you re acting like he fucking murdered the dude holy shit if you wanna be left alone don t go into public if the worst thing that happened to me when i went out was some moron tapping me on the shoulder i d go out a lot more than i already do
you clearly have no concept of what ptsd does to a person
you re a fucking moron i hope you end up with ptsd you ignorant shit
not a dead case it s against the law to harass people and likely to touch them without consent not saying he will make money but fuck these people who get their rocks off on fucking with people society is fucked and we got to do something to right the ship though i don t think that s possible with the number of idiots we have roaming this world

that someone would try to kick a bowling ball thinking it was just any other kind of ball
not sure why you are getting down votes as this video sucks
you expected her to kick the ball and break her foot
i agree this shit is wack
thank you
thanks that was it
oh hilarious
is there more to the video mine cuts out before she kicks
who said she broke her foot
i cant make everyone happy
i think they intentionally cut it there you see her go for the kick and then it abruptly ends that s the trend with videos these days anyway
well son when you kick a bowling ball full force there s a good chance you ll break your foot
the video that s playing for me doesn t even show her kicking it just winding up
was this staged or did she get fucked up
on my phone it cuts off on my computer the rest plats weird
well dad you seem to be assuming a lot for starters the bowling ball is obviously not heavy based on the way it s thrown second i would not consider her kick full force at all and third video cuts out before you see anybody kick anything
you can see her foot turn sideways after making contact and the ball deflecting thats full force and shes got a broken leg foot
same
aktchually
you know what you re right baconreddit s mobile player cut off the last half second or so but it plays all the way on my laptop very interesting

ain t nothing but a heart ache
the video is from eric andre you know that right
snail down
im ready to be penetrated
happy cake day
ranch me bromosexual
is that the cute 90s guy with the fake abs
once you let go and enjoy the ride it s seriously some of the funniest shit ive ever seen
wait no don t do that
i don t know about most extreme but him getting on a stage at the republican national convention to look alex jones in the eyes and say that he wants alex to fuck his own wife was pretty amazing
when the grizzly bear walked in or when he tased people oh and that time he had rats crawling all over the set there s better ones but those are my fav
i can t remember the most extreme off the top of my head but the lauren conrad interview was pretty memorable also hannibal s dad came out with his dick out the whole time i guess another would b when he tortured that one singer while he made her sing lmao
is my dream real
i don t think he needs to be told to get off it sounds like that s about to happen naturally
wait what s wrong with admiring her voice holy shit
i don t know who that is
no you re thinking of eric bana this is guy was a famous guitar playing musician played wonderful tonight great song
yea that was pretty good
let s not forget the actual star hannibal
nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare
admiring with intense passion mmmm nothing
ignore the downvotes go watch his show
i don t get all the downvotes but that s reddit but man if you have time please stream the eric andre show it s comedic gold bro seriously
then dont assume its a random comment
no you re thinking of eric clapton the actual guy is a actor comedian that changed his name to jamie foxx
it has less to do with obsessing over her and more to do with obsessing over sound it s attention to detail if someone said some celebrity is beautiful a painter would be able to explain why in detail their nose curves at this angle with these particular proportions and there s a certain lack of symmetry in this area and so on it s not because that artist is creepy but because it s their job to see with incredible detail to understand facial structure to understand emotional response to highly specific visual stimuli or maybe a dancer analyzing the way someone moves as a musician this is my aim with sound and that s why i m admiring her voice in detail yeah i said it s sexy so fucking what it is it s a sexy voice
will do
no that s eric marlon bishop i figured it out this guy is from that famous family that made all those comedy movies like white chicks
holy shit bro go outside a couple hours a day jesus christ
you need to touch some grass dude
i hope she picks you next freak
yea it s kinda a talk show but incredibly surreal

when is this marvel movie comming out
a flaammaaann
did this guy jus transformed to heat blast without an omnitrix jus by vape strange powers gif emote free_emotes_pack flip_out
gas leak a lot of countries add a smell to gas so you know if there is a leak obviously this is not one of those countries
here ya go mate https://youtu.be/w2kujce9o0q)
i had the same thought run through my mind
i think he accidentally went super sayian
hopefully
if i can recall i remember a redditor saying that they lived i doubt it but just keep that in mind
they always rip my damn paper
do you have a deodorant with you
i have no knowledge of the situation but no
a gas leak this is why we put odorants in gas
booooom
catholic priests
there are some fucked up people out there
yeeeeeaaaahhhhh
unfortunately i believe this was a gas leak everyone including him instantly caught flame
they survived so yeah
supervillain
right some of these comments are hilarious
aight but he lit a cig and it was a gas leak are there videos of vapes destroying whole shops in one flame
what does a room with people in it going up in flames actually look like
no mate
me too xd
why hopefully
id hope to be dead before i hit the floor that shit looks like it was an incredibly painful split second
my son has odorants several in fact
uh i don t know what to think of this
how does one not smell a gas leak didn t realize it was that and it does look like they have vapes there as well definitely something i wouldn t of wanted to experience
he just ruined my morning even though i just watched seconds of it
me three
i think i would prefer that to living with severe burns over of my body that s major constant pain for the rest of your life
deserves more upvotes
because it doesn t have a smell we scent it so people can notice a leak this was not a country that does that
me four
can t say that i don t understand that reasoning sorry i assumed the worse i retract my downvote
thank you kind fellow humanoid you apparently have a son as well
me five
would you like to live while being in pain the entire time with your flesh being in a constant red black color yeah i neither
yes baby odors at this point but i know the rest are coming
me s x
lol you just made the same mistake he learned a lesson from
aaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahaaaa you are in the honeymoon phase of parenting i envy and maybe hate jk you but seriously congratulations and sincerely best of luck to you and your twerp
me seven
thank you he s pretty fun so far but we ll see
ok but i feel like this person isn t old enough to be on reddit just saying

brings back memories when i was younger we had this giant spider we d use for our halloween parties and we kept it in our basement i totally forgot about it for years because we stopped having halloween parties so one year i went downstairs and it was probably around pm my mom asked me to go downstairs and get a milk so when i got downstairs i opened the basement door and my mom had strung up the spider so it fell on a string when i opened the door thanks mom for a memory trauma
me died

who needs a sternum anyway
uoouoiuuuouiiiuoaaauhuhaahuhaaahhhahah
good god those hedges are immaculate
well at least he stopped before he hit the car
i don t know how or when but i know that sound
the must hurt
that looks like a broken fractured rib ramming into a fence at high speeds to the chest how the fat actually did act as a cushion
my man sounded like he was going near the speed of sound gif giphy mafykoepwfwazn2pxc
that fence had something against him
that s not how you ghostride a bike
fucking ow
oh yeah he broke some shit
r therewasanattempt
i ll take collapsed lung for alex
kind of seems like that private gait was extending on to a public sidewalk smells like a lawsuit to meee
what s da87
that will hurt come winter
that s the sound i made after falling story to the basement floor
ouch could be worse didn t hit her head or eat pavement done that at high speed before and it s no fun even with a helmet not wearing a helmet she is really asking for it
noice
coming in hot
omg i could watch this all day
damn he was hauling ass
u redditspeedbot 5x
you re fine walk it off
broken rib cage
certainly hope the fence was not damaged
my question is why did he do that
damn i would have said the same thing
an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by that fence
gif giphy tqa7tpohxe8ja
tis but a scratch
killer tofuuuu
thankfully he didn t hit the hedges and instead aimed for the metal gate

she s been hanging out with ryan to long
she s lively
couldn t contain the intrusive thoughts
ryan s humor is rubbing off on her
emotional damage
who is she she s got great humor
legend
stephanie laughing on the outside but heavily crying on the inside
gif giphy yjdrj3jqfolyo
more like blake deadly
hopefully this persons girl is normal i wouldnt be surprised at some people listening to it because its blake lively
i would totally ditch my girlfriend to fuck ryan reynolds no homo tho
i feel dumb but i don t get it
1d4 psychic damage
she s definitely ryan s person
she let the impulsive thoughts win there ngl i would do it too though
instant regret after she said it
annnnnnd women
lady ryan
all her siblings are actors but her brother played rusty in national lampoons european vacation
for those saying she s like ryan no this is why ryan fell for her
i d say just long enough
i came to say the same thing lmao that s something he would do
she really wrexed him
she s married to the intrusive thought that is ryan reynolds
are we not doing phrasing anymore
oh crap i just realized that s blake lively
gif giphy ro08zmq1meqzypzgdn
deadpools wife
blake lively known mostly for gossip girl
d e d
what do you not understand
same amount as a dad joke
maybe she was just always funny and that s why they ve been together so long
gif giphy 3gbjpj8zw10sq
makes sense
checks out that she d be known for gossiping
wow thank you didn t recognized her there

why she said stephanie should leave him and why did she surprised herself when she said it
also ryan reynolds wife
she was joking it s funnier to some cause she s married to ryan reynolds s and that s very similar to his type of humor
ok i guess i get it i have to ruin a joke by having it explained to me

oh it s a little person thank god
bro i literally just threw my arms in air and yelled what the fuck thank god that was a midget
my buddy used to say he wanted to have sex with a little person because his cock would look huge in their hand
ringa around the rosies
don t care what year it is gonna judge people for weird behaviors
_
the trash can behind a supermarket in el salvador did i just watch
whats the commentator saying
damn that got me was not expecting a midget oh man that s funny
oh definitely judging
would smash and would participate
why can t we call it midget or dwarf anymore
keep it to urself n u won t have anyone judging u if u let people see they re gonna have an opinion
even the girl to the left looks at most they got waaaay different laws in south america weird
that s obviously an adult and not a minor

he s an equal opportunity playa
holy shit that little person scared me for a sec phew it is not a child
serial kissers
i ll give him huge credit for fighting constant strong urge to lift her up for a kiss
never let them know ur next move
i wonder if she will go up on him later
ummmm
scared me for a second
we re not judging but grossed out
i thought the same thing lol
same
a midget woman would think my dick was huuuge
did he succeed or is he still on that quest

because despite all the peas of don t judge judging is all people do anymore
as i understand it dwarf is a medical term that doesn t just mean you are short so you can use it just use it correctly and midget is considered offense by some people because it was used as a buzzword for carnivals and other attractions to be clear not everyone thinks it is offense but it has turned to the corner to not always be appropriate anymore
the entire world used to be different the weird ones are the few that changed and now think they are holy and got everthing right even as they sport the highest rates of teen pregnancy teen motherhood teen death in childbirth teen suicide and teen rape in the developed world
hence why i said little person in the description
there was a moment a very troubling disturbing moment
no she wouldn t her arms and legs are short but the rest is normal size
couldn t tell ya lol
actually it says it s don t judge but you do you boss
you just couldn t let him have that victory could you

the cat is like what man what s wrong
what da cat doin
you might wanna get your cat neutered
gif giphy ki5jqbqokcpjg meow
is that cat semen on your leg can i even say that word on reddit
i have never seen a cat do this before holy shit
and he keeps letting him do it
the first little meow in the beginning he looks confused like i thought we were ready to take things to the next level
i had a male cat who used to do this after fluffing up my comforter he was neutered too he d hump and bite it i didn t know what the hell he was doing until i saw the wet spots
omg he spunked up the trouser leg
i will never unsee this
i like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
my cat used to do this it has something to do with the fuzzy blanket
in all fairness that guy is pretty hot
both cats and especially dogs are known to do this often it s to assert dominance guests yes even a family member can be a favorite target does the animal get sexually aroused in the process of course they do will a male cat or dog ejaculate if given enough time to continue they most certainly will do female cats and dogs do this as well they definitely have the females can sometimes be quite aggressive in asserting dominance although they don t quite have the exact same sexual response as the males does neutering and spaying reduce this sometimes it does not always though
we fixed this in our old cat painter s tape and aluminum foil put strips over attractive spot put a stuffed toy out as an alternative took patience but it eventually worked we used an old pillow case that could just be laid over the area x200b one bit of advice if you try it make sure the offered toy is silent yeah gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm
the cat should be in jail
yeah cats do that when they re not nurtured one of mine constantly did it to a particular slipper
he comes around i come around
that cat knows who the real pussy is
and i my cat jizz in my pants
cause i jizzed on your pants the cat singing a lonely island parody
my bird a cockatoo used to hump my best friend s knuckles when he rested them on the chair arm that was bad enough but i hated the post nut cigarette he lit up okay okay i made up this last part part
every cat should be neutered there are too many cats left in shelters unwanted i cant say the humping will stop but your chavy suit will stay clean xd
feel sorry for your leg bro
he s getting his jollies off usually they also self groom after
his leg
the cat looked really insulted the first time he moved away
i adopted male cats was a large fatass and the other was more in shape i would wake up in the middle of the night as the fat ass cat was making love to my face the more in shape cat always sat on the passenger side of my face and perform oral sexytime to himself as the fat shit was dropping a nut on my face both cats were neutered
yeaah they do that like my cat but he got a schedule of when he needed to do it like 00am 00am he would go to my arm doesn t matter if its left or right if he felt like humping me arms he would i got no right to say no
yeah cats also get horny get that gentleman some p ssy
whoa male cats sct like horny dogs too never have i ever seen or hear of this before lol
why d he let the cat do it tho like he just sat and respectfully waited for the cat to nut
a cousin of mine had a dog like this it was a little wiener dog and it had some issues if it got to exited it would pee on the spot and it was a really horny dog once i was playing fetch with the other dogs and i feel him grab my arm and i look over to see him humping my arm fun experience
light the cat a cigarette please
https://i.redd.it/m3hcdy0ie9sa1.gif what s that little stinker doin
the cats face he s like what brah why you leave tho
my lil female dog with hump her bed to completion moaning louder louder the closer she gets she do over and over until her lil bed is all wet i ll take her bed away she ll try to bite me my fianc had his boss over for dinner so i put the bed in the other room as we are eating she pulled it back in without me noticing then they heard the moaning
before taking the cat to the vet has anybody asked the guy to dial back his animal magnetism seems like he was pitching woo in the yard and the cat just obliged him
i like how we go to his legs pov at the end
mine is neutered he has the habit of following us to the bathroom because he likes to drink from the tub faucet the tub is next to the toilet last week whilst on the bowl i see him backing his ass over towards me he shimmied his butt a few times then sprayed on my bare thighs it was a small amount of liquid but it smelled horrific he never did it before so it shocked me i felt violated
my neutered cat would do that to my arm i thought it was a sign of love the vet told me he was showing his dominance
i had a maine coon that would do this after he was neutered my girlfriend used to give me hell about it asking me shit like when i come home if there are rose petals on the bed barry white playing in the background with candles lit she also offered to buy me a rape whistle
get your cat his own pair of those sweatpants cause he is very much into them lmao this is genuine advice btw
i have never seen this
the cat nut on you disgusting
that right there is an example of a cat turned dog
cats do indeed do this my sister had a female cat that used to do this to me a lot i d be trying to sleep and i d wake up to my leg being molested by this cat and it was only me too she never did it to anyone else
that cat turned and looked at him like what baby i thought you were into this too fine fine alright i ll stop but you don t get to kink shame me bro i ve seen your internet search history
that cat is tryna get his freak on and you keep moving
either get the cat a hooker or cut his balls off
i mean brother in law is kinda fine can t blame the kitty
my cat used to do this to me we got him at months and he was definitely neutered he eventually grew out of trying to hump my leg but still definitely tries to mount my other cat lol
not just the males my cat is female desexed and still does this usually when i ve got a fuzzy blanket on
one day i was cleaning my neighbour s living room and his french bulldog started thrusting his hips while walking basically humping the air then he stopped and he just came on the floor while looking at me the neighbour gave me a half assed apology but i still had to clean that
change the pants color
he s sexy
the cat is kneading it s just that he s kneading with both his front and rear paws he is not molesting you ffs
reach down there and help him out
i d saddle his leg and get my juices all over him every time he came over too
one swift kick and he d never do it again
so cute and the bro in law too
deleted
anything with a dick does this
your cat is drooling relax this is normal
it s only unexpected once that guy was asking for it
stepcat
cat thinking the guy s leg was a pussy
brought to you by bob barker
my neutered cat does this bc we waited too long to fix him it was during the pandemic but nothing is left behind
i would ve launched him off me so fast if it were my cat i wouldn t allow him to climb on ppl if i knew he does that
well his leg is gray and not fighting back
ok but what flavor is green derritos
this is just one reason why people get their cats fixed
that s beazle
i remember one time entering my room and unmounting my cat from it and it had cat cum on it
my cat us neutered and bunches up towels or clothes and humps it even meows like a moan
cats have spiky penises
well the cat really loves him
how does no one know this is a thing it s incredibly common for cats
it seems he enjoy the process d
that cat belong to the streets
i thought he was the cat
he s like what what did i do wrong are we okay still
my grandmother used to have a cat who had a stuffed toy bear and he would fuck that bear all the time i would go up the stairs and he d just be humping away on that plush bear at the top of the steps it was gross but also hilarious he had been neutered for like years at that point so that wasn t the cause
cat s like bro just let me finish
my cat has a fuck blanket that he fucks around 10pm every day
i saw my cat do this once and i had completely forgotten about it until just now i also never saw him do it again i was cuddling with him but also kind of half paying attention he was on a blanket and then he mounded it up and did it it lasted like seconds it took me about half that time to realize what was happening
he would be an outside cat if he kept that up
first dude to complain about getting some pussy
don t blame the cat he is cute but at least get consent first
so is he pregnant yet
sometimes they get a lil humpy especially when kneading even if they re neutered just gently correct the behavior it s not a big deal
i guess the cat doesn t very like him
my cat does this all the time lmao
in soviet house pussy fucks you
just kill the fucking cat
it was the grey sweatpants
like humans if desexed animals can still cum

i was wondering why this was marked as nsfw but then i saw him throbbing
sorry fellas it was hard before monke touched bicep
gave the monkey a stubby
to be fair he only flexed on the monkey because the monkey was already aroused and he was drawn to the monkey
what up just a cool guy looking for other cool guys to hang out with in the party mansion nothing sexual
oh so you gonna flex let me flex
monkey straight up picked vermin off your arm and ate it while his dick was erect and throbbing you may wanna think about that

here we have a fascinating creature in the wild with one of the smallest brains in the animal kingdom just look at how it interacts with this gator
why are they swimming in motor oil
florida
please never feed a gator in the wild the gator associates people with a free handout and starts to approach people looking for the next handout only the next people may not have a handout and suddenly a hungry alligator is coming toward them and is not easily deterred gators in the wild typically avoid people we are not typically their prey in the wild alligators are typically scared of people and attempt to flee except under unusual circumstances
gif giphy nkfxqkxlriehy
plot twist she asked for alimony recently
florida is beautiful
i follow a gator handler not a trainer and what the husband did with his fist below the gators jaw is what they do to control the gator let s him position and move em without harming em
miss me with that one
i d say do trust the husband that was textbook
a fed gator is a dead gator
if this aint the most florida hillbilly thing ive ever seen idk what it is
europeans feed ducks at the pond while dumbass americans are in there tit deep feeding alligators
fucks to the no
that s a cool dog
forbidden dog
alligator is waiting for the next tasty treat to fall off someone or just take it off them yummy
a true florida man
idiots i m sure there are signs posted saying to not feed the wildlife you get minutes of enjoyment and the animal gets to be culled
florida man in his natural habitat
who pissed in the river
only in florida lol
lots of trust i meant a loooooot of trust
if only the world had just a smidge of the understanding us floridians have your community can be better too say what you want about ours but your grandparents still want to retire here
florida
hold my beer nope i m out i ll leave it on shore for you
was waiting for that hand to get spinned off
nothing like that florida man mentality and possibly weed
gator dad can i have a snack man here you are son now go off and play
in the water with a water demon
what happens when the other alligators in the background want a bite
did it like a professional perfect execution dudes a legend
are they listening to smash mouth
is that the guy who wrestled the gator that grabbed his puppy
isnt that the guy who fucked his wife with a fish on a boat video got taken down
this is why the gators have made it through the dinosaur ages and we as a species are fuk n doomed
what an asshole feeding animals in the wild especially predators is dangerous to the animal and humans alligators fed by humans are supposed to be reported to authorities so they can be captured and killed
nope
but why are they sitting in a lake of dehydrated pee
thats call beer flavored human
must be florida
white people i love ya what the hell is wrong with yall
what s up with that water
fucking g status
alligators are just big pussy lizards they are predators of opportunity but kinda stupid don t be dumber then the gator and you ll survive the encounter
dont do that in australia
are they feeding that dog burnt toast
not only was that stupid but it was incredibly cool so i don t know how to feel
the lack of respect people show apex predators is simply remarkable darwin agrees
is this the og florida man
estn loco eso mariguano
florida gators would have ate his ass
why are they swimming in sweet tea
root beer creek
florida man enjoying the river
damn wish they has been eaten
how stupid can you be
average day for a floridian
he s getting laid after that
fuck no nopity nope nope nope
i ll just sit slightly behind you and hold the toast dear
this guy for sure gets offended by rainbow beer cans
say you live in florida without saying you live in florida
oh those are good boys
good old florida
this is why darwin was wrong survival of the fittest there is entirely too much stupid for that theory to be true
lmao
i heard this in a british narrator s voice and it was perfect with that said i m guessing this was anywhere between louisiana and or mississippi to florida which would make this nonsense action make some sense
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackwater\_river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackwater_river)
their are tannins in the water from plant material it s not dirty it s more like tea
it isn t motor oil it s everglades water i ve been to that exact spot just the way fresh water in florida is it s actually clean enough to drink out of i have swam and fished in that exact spot
you never know when diarrhea will strike
they both had diarrhea
blood the alligators are well behaved because they already ate
because they are from mobile
so that both can float on top without sinking
in a nutshell
it look like all russian petting their bear
remember walking a trail here in geneva fl that follows along a small river and a family were all in the river just having a good time i walk no more than feet and there is about a foot gator chilling in the water florida has some crazy fuckers
its actually illegal af to feed a wild gator here
lead paint generation
typically
gators are everywhere in florida i remember one of my friends lived in a subdivision with a pool of water that was probably ft of cross and there was open access from this pool of water to their backyard and gators lived in that pool of water and their kids played in that backyard like it was normal like this was perfectly fine and all you had to do was make sure that you stayed a ways away from the water and you didn t go outside if they were gators out of the water
thank you for saying this this is true of most wild animals predators true but also prey deer when they are uses to free meals from humans can get very angry when you aren t feeding them like they expect horns and hooves hurt
op is not the guy in the video
yeah but florida isn t your typical place
not reading all of that i ll do what i want nerd
think she felt cheated i was absolutely sure i was gonna see a literal redneck get eaten
everglades is something else
tapping its nose too just before feeding to open its mouth
this is why no one will remember your name
fuck to the no no
i heard it in australian mate
interesting thanks
you do realize oil is less dense than water right
i assume this is a joke about them being fat if so i would like to inform you that fat people actually already float better in water than people with less fat floating and sinking isn t purely about your weight it s also about what that weight is made of if you re heavy because you re super muscled i assume you ll have a more didficult time floating but if you re heavy because you re fat you ll float very easily the density of fat is lower than water fat floats source me as a fat person who at first didn t get why my skinny classmates had issues floating during pe swimming lessons being fat is very counterproductive during the excercises where you need to stay underwater next to also being counterproductive for most things in life of course
tldr
true grew up in miami we lived behind a canal and would fish and wade in water there while gators were feet from us never bothered us we even jumped in a different section of the canal to swim across it to keep from backtracking miles around it that particular section dead end the street so you couldn t walk straight thru carol city honey hill 199st if anyone on here is from the area behind the matchbox apartments
do you know the name of the guy in the video

comments like this are about as basic as the videos themselves
what skit
it s amusing how every time people feel the need to tell you
who cares we can t find it funny if it s not real
yeah and that s not a real dick in yer mouth it s a dildo huh
man you ever think something can be acted out and also be funny like maybe sometimes actors are trying to be funny to make you laugh that should be a whole new genre we should call it comedy
nobody claimed it was
sorry can you repeat i was somewhat distracted
not all heroes wear capes or
those girls are too bad for this to be real
heterealistic

hah dude can t even get real dick
just assume most things you see on the internet may not be real and in the case of little comedic skit videos that s totally fine and completley harmless
what pretense though of the times when people claim that a video is pretending to be real they have nothing to base that on there is no claim that it s real just because you decide to assume something is unscripted that doesn t mean the video is intentionally misleading

it s not though
shutter speed
the blade is actually moving slow and the vegetable it s just doing that
why would you wear long sleeves and put your arm near that well see you over on r eyeblech
the forbidden glory hole
every time i see this video it irks me why the fuck are they letting those slices go right onto the ground just get a different container or at least move it to the right spot
r dontputyourdickinthat or there s no going back
definitely a shutter speed thing but still unexpected
that one comment it s because of bla bla bla and bla bla
now do a helicopter
r putyourdickinthat
it would have been unexpected if the slicer was malfunctioning and stuttering around
it s not
i see wheels doing that on the highway
i m not the guy feeling terror right
nb4 someone explains shutter spe nvm
the rotation rate is some multiple of rotations per second a camera frame rate is fps so the blade only has to move rotation or some multiple in each frame and it lets oks like it s standing still
real life lag
i think it s something with the camera
amateur adjust the motor speed so it looks like it s not moving at all
i may be wrong but i think its spinning fast
actually the shutter speed is almost equal to the fans blade if it was equal it would have been appear to stay still
but it s spinning the wrong way the cutting edge is on the right
in the beginning you see how the blades are almost shaking i think that shaking is enough back and forth to slick those extra piece
would that make franks
it s a demonstration in real use the front would be closed and there would be a container to catch it dude is just showing it off it s not that deep

didn t understand why they touched hands glad they cleared that up with a subtitle
thank god they captioned high five i would never have work out what that was
i don t get it
the umbrella is neither straight or queer it s curved and i m wet so now what
i agree shut this place down
wheres the funny
i m pretty sure your mom got wet in order to get you
over acting as if the royal family are there
this is stupid i bet she thinks she s really clever

all the straight people in the comments so mad lmfao
everyone go home nothing mere to see or hear shut it down
all the arguing in the comments still haven t seen anyone explain it is umbrella queer or straight wtf that mean the song using an umbrella is umbrella someone s name
what is queer
i don t get it
that was her and her chins shining moment
must be a new shitty billy eichner movie coming out
the men in the comments o m f g
that s was mildly funny and somewhat clever but no reason to shut this place down as he put it for all of the bullying and trauma you d think the queers would have better comedy
is this comments section full of people who learned about humor for the first time last week the joke was pretty obvious
makes no sense in fact an umbrella has to open up to not make you wet
woke comedy just waiting for amy schumer with the pussy jokes now

i don t get it is she implying that straight men don t make her wet is she a lesbo someone help me out here
deleted
the crimson chin strikes again
this should be on r therewasanattempt
i guess corporations are people so this makes sense
the joke was pretty bad but why is everyone losing their shit in the comments why are y all mad embarrassing for u
makes no sense
did she just assume the umbrella s gender
but i thought the whole premise of being straight was getting it wet
someone get me this lady
i really wasn t that funny
his reaction is the best
her face makes me mad
is that a question that needs answered or is the fact that you re so lonely you ll use a true movement as a cog for you to grade your own value honestly kill yourself fake supporters using the movement as an ad space deserve to be sodomized by a hot chunk of iron
i am straight and only date straight men with a curved expenditure
deleted
using umbrellas isn t gay because you don t get wet
is that a dude
the straights are mad at this
we aren t grading on a curve or dating on one i miss my ex and his little angle
what is wrong with sodomites that s not funny at all everything is always about their weird sexual dysfunctions
we aren t grading on a curve or dating on one i miss my ex and his little angle
she s sexy
this dude is an amalgam of pete holmes and brennan mulligan
stan smiths long lost sister right there
iconic
i believe it is a shot at men for not being able to get women wet not really sure
only lesbians or woman can get her wet
i think we need an umbrella
she is a lesbian she does not get wet by using an umbrella so umbrella is straight
it s because umbrellas don t get you wet which is correct the sex bit doesn t make any sense but they re all laughing because it sounds rude
i have no idea wtf is happening just like everyone else here apparently lol
it s a bad joke stretched out by gay white men trying to be black women whooooaaahhhhhhh ohhh what a whoooaahhh
she shut the whole place down what s to get
it s because men aren t good at getting women off in straight sex google the orgasm gap
ben shapiro is that you
deleted
yall are so dumb its insane
someone got wet bc she s here
didn t understand why they touched hands
this means your non binary pansexual
peyrones disease
i wish i could have free award to give u so goddam inspiring
no we just genuinely don t understand why the guy was acting as if it was so funny hell i didn t get it but i feel as if even if i did it would still just be unfunny
my guess is it s a silly game the mc plays where he gives you a random object to label as gay or straight probably to poke fun at the people who say any inanimate object holds gender sexual representation rainbows are gay pink is gay etc
queer is basically anything that would fit in lgbtq
woke anything that makes me uncomfortable at the existence of lgbt people
what is woke here if you re going to use reddit to vent your little resentments at least direct it in the right place and thanks for the little trip back to randomly complaining about amy schumer she s still taking up space in your head lmao
another boomer who calls everything they don t agree with or like woke
in straight sex there is what we call an orgasm gap basically men in general aren t very good at getting women off in general
to a low quality consumer yes
for people that clap in the cinema
lmao all the people arguing in the comments sleeping on this amazing joke
r onejoke
nobody actually talks like that weirdo
curved expenditure like he pays for more on each date
am i getting old when did people start calling every random woman queen and why does this seem like something some nut job would say to themselves before they stab someone times in the chest like a crazed llama
yes you ve successfully reiterated the joke just even worse congrats
lmao so true it s not the best joke ever but definitely funny and seeing all the hate just makes it even better tbh
it s rude to call women sexy
thats what im assuming too but it just doesn t make much sense does this mean gay men get women wet while straight men don t also does this mean straight women don t get gay women wet while gay women make straight women wet
yeah cause some men like to rush putting their piv we need foreplay people fore fucking play
deleted
deleted
so sad she s never been properly ducked is this a reason why many girls choose the scissoring life
but isnt umbrella a female gender
lmao dude are you serious she is a lesbian she does not become wet hint aroused by straight sex it s also a shot at straight people for not knowing how to get their partners off
i mean all it s saying is that people who have sex with those of the same sex never have issues getting off because guys know guys and woman know woman and their respective bodies better than the opposite sex i m straight yet i got the joke
lmfaoooo
i think she means that straight women don t get wet bc men don t know what to do that s the joke
men do get wet tho
schrodinger s vagina
it s treatable
ahh thanks i honestly didnt know the meaning that
woke anything that makes me uncomfortable at the existence of lgbt people all
having an orgasm and getting wet are different things

you may be drunk but you aren t that drunk
out of all the stupid dart throwing videos this one is my favourite it s like the dart made an instant lobotomy on him
gif giphy ke6xcyoohoxls
where are the other dudes or the three ladies for that matter misleading title still came
in college i had a roommate lodge a dart in the back of my head as i was leaving the room he was mad because i was going to study and according to him i was throwing off the curve joke was i wasn t doing well in the class at all
its in his head yeah sherlock i bet he didn t know
chardee macdennis classic game
i think it hit his last brain cell
immediately thought of its always sunny and chardemcdennis
he was like does anyone else snell cotton candy all of the sudden lmao
way to use ur head
cant harm any brain cells when there aren t any
i felt that
i can t believe youve done this
u savevideobot
just tickles the brain a little
the audacity to throw a dart into someone s head then demand that they take it out
you got a dart in your head you dumb shit old guy from stuck on you
the would have been more impressive
but how many points did i get
bro was unbothered
that s not drunk that s something else
so he threw a sharp object at you that literally could have given permanent damage to either your brain or spine or even could have killed you all because you wanted to study did he get jail time

in high school i got to be a mascot once just one time and for a different school i had basically no affiliation with no one knew me and then no one knew who i was on top of that because of the mascot suit i don t know why but it was one of the most fun things i ve ever done i know these guys are having an awesome time doing this

this was a good post for me to laugh props
breakosaurus rex
this is mascoterry at it s absolute finest bravo

what a rollercoaster of emotions
loveable characters being violent in front of children awesome
americans
staged
i was expecting peter griffin
mascots are the top tier level of funny
plot twist its not scripted
the chicken had been one of the best mascots for years watched him on a baseball show with johnny bench when i was a kid called the baseball bunch
san diego chicken
called
i was chuck e cheese when i was good times
how did it smell
been rough last few years
an extinction level event
these guys are legit pros i forgot i was watching two guys in suit because how well they play these cartoon characters
hello there
it wasn t plush so there was no smell to note it was a black knight so plastic suit of armor basically pretty sweet

what are you doing step frog

alex jones was right the frogs are turning gay run
i love coyote peterson not the same as steve irwin but he absolutely has the spirit
i m ashamed that i d know a cupcakke moan anywhere

kiss the true princess while he s still free
shit caught me so off guard i m nearly pissing myself
agony
the frog was a paid actor
drama queen
i forgor to breathe i genuinely wasn t expecting that
lmao try to hold a frog any other way this is probably the best way to lightly hold a frog without it getting away otherwise you re squishing the poor devil to keep him from getting away i ve had plenty of frogs do this it s scared obviously and they re always fine afterwords y all should go outside more and learn that this is common go coyote peterson though
bro s a sussy
that frog has bdsm kink for sure
he sounds like yoshi up until that fake ass moan they added in
u savevideo
i thought he was gonna eat it for a sec
am i the only one who hears c me here at the beginning
cat sound to dude moan sound i known theres a frog in there somewhere
u savevideo
coyote peterson is actually a moderately okay guy other than harassing insects
touched da dong
this is in fact how we act when in trouble
frog fun fact male frogs groan when they re held or there is pressure on their back cause they think they re being mated with
from a cat to a someone in heat in seconds
the moan is something elementary kids who love using tiktok find funny
the quaks before the moan are fackin adorable
in the nest video licking the colorado river toad
hmm lemme see da frog rq lol
that s the sound shorsey made yer mom make give yer balls a tug
peterson knows how to handle animals i hardly believe that he is hurting this animal
the forest needs to check its smoke alarm battery
the moan is edited in
where did you put your finger
now we ll wait for the babies to hatch to see what a mix of human and frog dna will result
i m dying

frog is like harder daddy
well he did not hurt it whatsoever
i thought coyote was going to be bitten by the animal and i was really tensed up until it moaned

coyote peterson is actually a moderately okay guy other than harassing insects kind of a modern day youtuber steve irwin from the midwest i think really educational and family friendly
yeah to anyone who doesn t know coyote peterson i think that being is the only being that walks this earth that intentionally injures themself in such a manner purposely gets bitten and stung by deadly creatures has been bitten by an alligator yet is an actual genius and they just totally seems like such a great being they re one of the few celebrities i d actually really like to meet and actually know g
damn it i was gonna say that the frog had some crazy kinks damn

same saw the original before this so got disappointed with the moan edit
if i was a god i would make a moanig frog
i tried to sign up but they axolotl questions
ha
shhhh the humons will catch on
coyote is awesome
coyotepeterson is super wholesome and passionate about animals like an american steve irwin he also willingly got stung by a bunch of stinging animals terrifying but interesting
u key_scientis why do you have the same comment as this guy
yup coyote peterson
a lot of his stuff is definitely geared more towards kids nowadays but i ll watch him from time to time with a compelling enough title

so i went down the rabbit hole the guys crazy but very charismatic and i m learning things i never knew his early videos feel very clickbatey but i was still learning stuff hes transitioned into far more educational content and he s so animated and excited on camera i would agree with the steve irwin comment he does do a lot of crazy things sacrificing his own health and safety just to show the viewers something unique not many people are willing to do that anymore

this is the second video i see today where a snake gets thrown at the camera person what gives also move the fucking baby
throw
dude sounds like goofy
the baby is noticeably unconcerned
what a fucking idiot baby s right there didn t move the child didn t call off his dogs instead decides to take a video what a fucking idiot
truly unexpected i expected it to land on the baby
poor snake
r donthelpjustfilm
i hate everything about this poor snake poor baby for having a guardian who clearly sucks and poor dogs because clearly their human is a total asshat
i love how the first dog just noped the fuck out of that snake
serves him right
haha let s film my dogs abusing a lone snake for internet clout haha dude shouldn t be breeding
move the fucking baby gif giphy 3o85xnoixebk3xyx4q
there s a fricking baby beside you clayhead
that person deserved it for putting their dogs and baby at risk and for allowing the dogs to terrorize the snake
poor snake
r cameramanisstupid
at the very fucking least move your baby god damn if i saw my husband do this shit around my kid i would file for full custody that s bare minimum common sense and this guy shouldn t be alone with a child and then he posted it like it s just a haha funny video asshole
let me just put my baby down between me and the snake wcgw
that scream was abundant in pure terror
i expected that
no one who s this stupid should be allowed to have a phone
almost made me through up
worth the clicks i guess
wrong through
downvoted because this should be in kill shoot the cameraman
that boy yeeted that snake good
man commenters on the internet have their themes down to a science on baby and animal videos put babies and animals together in the same video y all go wild major themes include but are not limited to anger the pets are in danger anger the wildlife is in danger anger the baby is in danger a anger the baby is sleeping eating being transported incorrectly some people even managed to get all three into one comment bravo
dont let your shitty dogs harass wildlife like this
this is so stupid leaving baby close to a snake looks like a water moccasin too my dog got bit by one it s my small dogs fault she tried to bite its head had to get her anti venom cost me
hey this one timeat work i fell asleep at break this dude thought it would be funny to slap his dick on my face i made the same sounds
you are responsible for my broken phone screen
everyone saw the baby for what it was a threat
deserves it
this is pure karma lol
baby snakes can t control their venom glands this guy some real crem de la crem
r killedthecameraman
he totally deserve it
the only being in that video who deserves snake karma was in fact the camera operator so the dogs did well why would you let the dogs do that
bro the baby
wrong through or wrong throw
wrong through throw
anybody able to identify the snake species
that man was ready to watch all his dogs die and didn t care he deserved having a snake thrown at him
good dog
imagine before filming you push the baby cart in the view
u r jerk
parents
unconscious people with a baby and they keep recording
thank god he left the baby what an asshole
this here is a perfect example of idiots breeding having clout to these idiots is more important than having their child safe or their dogs videos like this should be auto banned from anywhere this just gives idiots more influence over others
this guy is the worst father and pet owner i think ive seen
fucked around and found out
let me just put my baby here to video those dogs fighting over a snake
that s snake could have easily landed on the baby wtf
how easy would it have been for the snake to land in the bassinet trapped with the baby negligent
lol i should probably take the baby out of harm s way but let me take out my camera and start filming just to see where this goes we are so fucked as a species
f king degenerate placing a child at risk bottom rung of hell
haha this reminds me of my dogs growing up i had a pair of shih tzu and they killed all snakes they found in our yard we commonly found headless snakes wrapped around their necks or half eaten snakes in the yard i once watched them kill a snake and one would be in front barking and distracting the snake while the other would go around the back to bite it behind the head the shake it to kill it once they got a good grip
i laughed my ass off not trying to judge some random hillbilly or his lack of awareness it s just hilarious
a lot of people commenting the cameraman woman is an idiot for leaving the baby in danger to be fair standing feet away from a snake and up high in a stroller seemed pretty safe to me but then again i don t have a lot of experience around dogs attacking snakes maybe it s a thing idk
riki triki dogge
what s the title mean
baby is way too young for blankets
so instead of grabbing the baby and moving it away from the snake he films the dogs attacking it great dad
uh maybe move the baby and then record
what a strange sequence is no one noticing the baby
first move the baby
ah man maybe i m a terrible person but i found this fucking hilarious
this is the funniest thing i ve seen and heard in months
what the baby doin
actually the more i watch it the funnier it gets that looks calculated af by the dog
i just love reddit for this i see a flying snake every day
what does that even mean
who knew what a threw was
lol i dropped my phone
gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm gif emote free_emotes_pack joy
what does the title mean
lol oh shit
omg omg omg no i would die
it was the wrong throw
the dogs were telling the snake
flying snakes aren t real and they can t hurt you this video
i can t breathe haha that s funny af
haha oh shiiut
yeet
my best laugh of the week for sure
why the fuck are they filming inside of movie the baby away from the possibly poisonous snake
shit indeed
new kind of dog attack
f u baby in my kevin hart voice
the guy sounds like goofy
the dogs let s chuck it at that idiot why should we bother with it
hercules lore
what the fuck does your title mean

i get that dogs might fuck with snakes but why would you stand there watching it happen maybe they re the wife s dogs and he hates them

you know what fuck you if you drive with super bright headlights some of that shit should be illegal
always look down and to the right edge of the road to keep your bearings
allways blind back
fortunately they weren t wrecked up like a douche and yea i know that s not the correct lyric
girl needs to clean the inside of her windshield
i will never understand why ppl do this i just flash them back lol
was that a bigfoot
what a ding dong
my father taught me that if you have a binding light in from of you look down and focus on the painted lines on the road worked for me many times
sucks
are we not going to talk about what an idiot that pedestrian was was he walking on the white line to test his level of drunkenness
that car is in high bream
i learned this when i was in driver s ed and it seems not enough people know about this preach it
no that makes it more likely to get you in an accident and dead you flash back a couple times usually those people just need a heads up cause its an accident
i hear wrapped up like douche another rumour in the night
it s giving her dashcam astigmatism
hol on lemme call a squatch
yeah we know you do your dad told us
yes it looks so also headlights have a set screw to adjust the lights up and down you can adjust them up and make low beams look like that furthermore people can buy super bright lights that look like that too most of them are led lights and are either super white or kinda blue if you take part in any of the formentioned duche baggery then please fuck right off

made me feel teeny tiny like a princess
the show was made better for me when i found out those two are actually married
this guy bowls
charlie just clapping in the background slayed me
i love the proud pose he does after too best part
this is from the always sunny episode time s up for the gang hilarious episode
i feel teeny tiny like thumbelina
did he yell i got your corndog
charlie s cackle in the background kills me he was genuinely having a great time
that s called the donald trump it s an old classic
is it getting hot in here
i can t stop laughing what show is this from
this is my favorite episode i rewatched this scene and cried laughing for minutes
lmao that was amazing you got me like a foot off the ground
this really caught me by surprise the first time i saw it
i love its always sunny in philadelphia
what is he yelling when he grabs her
picked her up like a six pack
i got your turtle
that dude is strong as hell omg
grab her by the pussy
kinda curious as to how they made this work wires actually lift her green screen anyone knows
this is what they showed their kids when they asked where they came from
she came at me what
it doesn t hurt everyone says grow a pair of balls to be tough but that s the most sensitive body part there is we should say grow a vagina that tho g can take a pounding and not miss a beat
isn t this what the former leader of the free world said he did
he trumped her
man thats a cool finisher move
i like how rob sent that guy to wales to monitor his team
the actor playing the shocked guy in the suit is now the executive director for wrexham afc
gif giphy qjmp5vkeerpyw daddy trump taught him well
butthurt trumpers commence downvoting all trumps jokes
man might be the next president
nevada
is that british guy the same one who helps rob and ryan run their football team
charlie clapping makes the shot impeccable
what s the name of the show
what show is this
they fucked later
is this what trump meant
not a single bad episode if you re easily offended iasip is not for you some of the funniest shit you ll see anywhere
clips from this show are just cheat codes for this sub
i got your cargo
donald trump would be proud
our president would be proud
as a woman currently suffering from a uti fucking ouch
trump was right you can grap them by the
is that real no movie effects that impressive as hell to lift a person up with one hand so easily i mean if you re going to try that s the best location for it but its still impressive
mac gif giphy cayvza5nrb529kkquc downsized
grab em by the pussy
they call that the trump
so that s what the former president meant
was that the bowling ball grip
they fixed it the spoiler tag doesn t collapse the thread
that s what trump meant when he said grab her by the pussy lmfao
made me feel teeny tiny like thumbalina
what show is this
u savevideobot
ohh snap i did the donald trump move on her
grab her by the trump
donald trump reference
so that s what trump meant when he said grab her by the pussy
donald trump would be proud
i think he s taking the trump grab em by the p ssy comment too far teehehe
all this time trump was teaching us self defense oh how the turns have tabled
the trump maneuver
i thought this was what trump said to do
when donny t did that everyone lost their mind
grab em in the puss
so this is how trump sees himself huh
is it just me or this guys looks like ryan reynolds or is it just ryan reynolds
trumped her lol
donald j trump
what tv show is this
anybody who down votes this extremely funny clip is a douche
dont have a clue what i am watching at but my guy just pulled a donald trump move right there
this is footage of a much younger stronger donald trump
so that is what trump was talking about
the donald trump
man must have been trained by trump
let s see him do that at walmart
like a bowling bowl minus a hole
i got your corndog
wtf loo
are u okay my man she got a sampler and was ready for the entre did u not see the look in her eyes ol girl was bout it
i forgot that he screams i got your cunt
i need to learn how to do that
i am forever regretting my decision to log onto reddit today
rhe fact they re married in real life probably made that scene possible you d struggle to find a female actor willing to let a colleague do that nowadays it used to be quite common in pairs gymnastics and dancing because if you want to lift a woman with one hand that s where her centre of gravity is you don t see it much now because the men are terrified of backlash
down vote just because it s tik tok
is this real
hhahahhahaha you said coochie
hey this is where i know the american auto lawyer guy from
what did he yell when he grabbed her
sunny
the ol lower lip grip works every time
times up times up times up times up
it s like a magnet

the unexpected part would have been if the car came back for the splash anyway
tit for tit don t you mean tat
i see no tit disappointed
tat
staged and i didn t see any tat
this was tit for tat if it was tit for tit you would have flashed the driver note that this would also have worked and avoided the dirty hand
obviously staged a driver who s about to splash someone is particularly not looking at that person
faker than this lady s hair color
for everyone who says this is staged yeah no shit it s a skit and before y all come out like it s because they re pretending it s real no they aren t what do you want them to do stare at the camera before they start and say it s a skit guys it ain t real we ain t tryin to fool you or nothin
r whyweretheyfilming
crazy how after the asian kid holds a brick in this same scenario copycat videos flood the internet
throw the rock at me i throw my car at you
who took the tat
fake staged ass content polluting the internet
i don t think the rock had anything to do with it it was the beautiful women that slowed him down i am quite sure that this ugly middle aged man would have gotten soaked rock or no rock
when you search for the definition of staged this video pops out
she would have paid for my new window
lol
that wasn t unexpected
staged of course kinda funny male driver the brick was extraneous female driver she s drenched
haters will say it s staged
staged as fuck bro
too cringe
idk looks kinda staged to me
not a great attitude for making money
we sure are lucky there was a stranger there to film this incredible scene
the insane reaction time of the car slowing down after also immediately seeing the rock shows this is staged
this seems so authentic
i know this is fake but i still love it love the message behind it
staged but clever imo
but wasn t the driver a boob
r lostregisters
my type of no shit accepted woman
she s my spirit animal
girl walking yeah splash me i dare you
so what happened is this lady saw another person get soaked by a car and thought this is what she would have done in that situation very cringey
poor little rock he was there before she came waiting to cross the street
i recommend you go slow hahaha
s tiktokers
reverses
lol the lone rock on the sidewalk
what did i just watch
i would ve reverse lol
this is garbage wtf lol
yeah yeah they couldn t come with something funny so they copied someone else their skit we get it
u savevideo
work that track
i didn t think people actually splashed you on purpose
tit for tat i m pretty sure i d how it goes
i always carry my angry brick for just such situations
can i get a tit for my tat
slay
well played
most well constructed balkan road
they should have another video with some guy doing the same and then getting splashed
i see no tit me sad me want tit bring tit pls
where is she walking from not from the muddy grass clearly could you at least try to make it look real
should ve slammed in reverse
you wouldn t throw a rock at an slk
yesssss
nice how the rock was nearby
stupid that her car or her mans
i woulda stopped rolled down the windows and rev the car speeding down the street to make sure she was feeling extra salty
that would not happen to me if she picked up that rock and threw it at my car i get out and beat that girl s ass
he did that out of politeness he didn t have time to think that was a brick she was picking up
hahaha love this she bad
no tit but i said goddamn she s a bad one wouldn t put a spec of water on that
staged drama with a cameraman standing feet in front of her
where was she coming from
just drive past fast enough and she cant hit you
now put the reverse
slk55 amg i believe the best thing in this video
taking notes
i ve done this a few times never fails they ve immediately slowed down every time
you can buy foam bricks and just carry them around
this is so stupid
throws rock gets shot
lol she was ready for it
i love women hahaha
hol up lemme reverse
so your advice is when it rains bring a brick for prick drivers
queen of suffolk county
reverse full speed
drive faster she won t have time to throw
so badass year old white guy
well she tossed the rock out of reach deserved
but we expected it so she didn t do it she s parallel universes ahead of us
or if she could actually throw a rock at a speeding car while being drenched like crazy
no we re trading
disapointit
well it says tit for tit so you gotta pay up first
none of that only tits
what staged clearly the woman was walking on the flooded sidewalk earlier with that heels s
its not staged it s stagit i ll get my coat
there is no tat it s all tits round here
do we just call all video skits staged events now
this wasn t staged i was there i was her tits
thank you sherlock
and if i am looking at someone who looks like they might throw a rock at my car i m certainly not slowing down as i go past to give them a good shot i m speeding the fuck up and getting out of there

holy shit that was intense what a race
lila will never live that down
still more exiting than nascar
i was on the edge of my seat that was the best performance in the last few years on that court
everyone has a phone in the hands even me rn disgustang
i love how that one lil baby stopped to jam out after catching the up to the lead
what is this and why isn t it an olympic sport yet
something about all those parents using phones to get their kid to come to them is unsettling to me like damn they don t understand the world at all but they know the little rectangle that alters their brain s development for the sake of sweet sweet corporate profits is worth crawling towards but idk i don t have kids and am a massive over thinker so what do i know still cute tho what a comeback
the first baby s parents after the race gif giphy dkarmjm91xxflalvra
fuck you harley jarvis
all these parents be like the one time you don t want the phone
that lady wanted to kick her kid across that court lmao she was mad
i was in one of these races when i was a baby i won third place and a trophy only trophy i ever won wonder what happened to it
absolutely thrilling and the commentator did a great job he definitely added to the fun
that lady in black gave me anxiety get off the finish line you cheating bitch even her kid ran away from her so i know i m not alone
i think the narrator calling their names is what stopped those two babies from going further confused them distracted them
it s sad they had to use their cell phones to get the babies to move instead of a toy
r kidsarefuckingstupid
that is a helluva finish
now that was an exciting race
come on gary come on
is the baby s name lilah by any chance i didn t quite catch it he hardly said anything
lila
my month old son was in a similar kind of race he decided to walk instead of crawl and was disqualified that was years ago and he is graduating from university next month starting work with pwc in aug
lol waving their phones ffs
ok i like this
reminds me of that sonic chiao minigame
this is now an approved course for athletes at unc since they let regular students participate as well
remember kids don t give up too soon the finish line might just be around the corner
baby who stopped short of the finish line now if i cross the line i stop getting as much wanted attention and you go back to shoving the phone camera in my face so how many snacks are we negotiating to cross this line before the others
i knew i had seen this before https://youtu.be/0avi_0mppt0
it s a baby race r bluey
the smart ones go to dad lol
this is actually a great visitation of kids who peaked in highschool
the baby starting crawling backwards so close to the finish even the announcer was getting agitated then a baby comes out no where for the win they should make a betting game out of this with what i just saw winning is anyone s guess
sports offer some strange cultural rituals
life is a race and i m a racist
watching full grown adults unironically and literally baiting their children with cell phones makes my skin crawl and we wonder what went wrong with the world
holy fuck at least of the moms are using their phones to lure their baby towards them that s such a red flag for shitty parenting hell even the baby that wins is clearly crawling directly to the phone not the parent
that is bad parenting
not the parents enticing the babies with mobile phones
shut that guy up please
way more exciting than soccer
america is just completely screwed as a country why the hell is this even a spectacle for people
i cant believe i used to be one of these useless creatures
they re all telling on themselves
is this cruel hilarious or both both
babies are sooooo dumb
gif giphy koutwnva3ty7c
god that was so much fun congratulations
are they trying to lure in babies with their phones i would have thought to grab something very colorful but are modern babies really into phones like that
all the moms are showing mobiles that indicates something no
the saddest thing all the parents use the phone to entice them that s how you have under developed children and other issues growing up they need to be bored and you need to pay attention to them
most intelligent life form on the planet right there
get those babies some knee pads
no that was completely predictable
some of these kids are gonna get put up for adoption
using phones this makes me uncomfortable
wow i would never let my baby on that disgusting gym floor
am i the only one who thinks it s bat shit insane to not only think about doing this but to get parents to agree to this let s watch babies crawl on the floor of a gym and act like lunatics while we try and bait them to the finish line
bro if i put my phone out there my baby gonna find a way ain t no stopping if that don t work i m setting out my laptop and acting like i m working ez win
not really unexpected it s a race you don t usually know who or what wins until the finish line is crossed fun event though
why do i hate this with every breath of my being it repulsed me to watch it
gross babies are so weird and stupid i somehow find it incredibly annoying to watch
u savevideo
tellement beau
phrasing
if you aint first yer last
it s like that episode of spongebob all over again with the snail race patrick beats them with a rock
awwww too cute lol
this was amazing what a race
this race was clutch
i find this oddly terrifying
this was interesting
well they already won the race of conception so guess that makes them all the winner lol
you could ve cut the first minutes off and we d still have gotten the point
i love animals
is this on the espn channel

absolutely fantastic xx
that s a pretty good sports bet ad
to finish first first you have to finish
r maybemaybemaybe
i need a jomboy breakdown
and now parents will have their toddlers fight to the death for a chance to win a partial college scholarship heyyy
if the sole purpose of procreation in humans was to race babies i might reconsider my anti natalism
aesop s tortoise and the hare
dumbest thing i ve seen today middle class people are really bored
tempted over the line by a phone
dad didn t immediately pick up the baby after the race concluded you disappointed me son
somehow i lost bucks on that and someone vomited all over my stuff
boy if mailo was my kid he d ged some worth of thashing as home
if one of them breaks their leg do you shoot it
if lila doesn t win best baby of the year i m going to kill myself on live tv
life is a race that s true
lilah pleaaaase
deleted
just like baseball the integrity of the sport has been ruined by steroid use we need to make two leagues all natural and juiced to the gills it s time we see what a fully roided up baby can really do make baby racing great again
the beauty of iphones

this is just a comedian what is unexpected about this
it s rob mceltiny
except brad is a piece of shit bragged about sexual assault on a podcast
is that wee man from jackass
the entire bit is predicated on baby gates not having a latch to open them unless he s implying that he s too dumb to work that out terrible
he and carlos mencia raped a woman on a tourbus youtube it
r lostredditors
he seems a little angry
guys can build bridges to stay up but they can t undo a baby gate
he sounds like gilbert gottfried
brad williams face going from smiling to deep concern when he realized he admitted to raping a woman when he was trying to tell a story about a crazy tour bus moment was the funniest thing he ll ever do
what the only reason anyone laughed is bc he said the m word
i hope it boosts his career even more this video i mean
cos he s a little midget fella
no one expected him to admit to rape on a podcast
i mean making a distasteful joke isn t really bragging about actually doing
no this is brad williams
thats not wee man i fucked wee man and thats not him
no this is patrick
you are not wee man i slept with wee man from jackass nope she did not she had sex with another midget some hilarious story about a golf tournament
with all this access to information that the internet provides you d think you d be able to get your facts together a bit better
telling a poorly thought out joke in an effort to try and fit in and actually raping are entirely different things though he did fuck up though
midget
dafuq
brad williams is funny as fuck
migger
midgets have been funny since the dawn of time nothing unexpected about this
is the dude above saying that a joke sexual assault
no it s becky
idk about anyone else but i d like to hear that story
rape apologist
it didn t seem like he put any thought into it and it was entirely recall
yeah but all i heard were crickets until he said it
no he was on doug benson s podcast and told a story about how was in the bus with another comedian who was going to hook up with a woman in the room on the comedy bus so instead he snuck in and slept with her all the while she thought it was the other comedian she intended to sleep with sounds fake as obviously someone would recognize the size difference but still a weird thing to say about as that is rape
the way he tells the story doesn t sound like a joke whatsoever also after it came out he tried to have the clip scrubbed from the internet and blocks anyone who mentions it on social media weird thing ro do over a joke no
i thought it was patrick
its a brad williams bit from like albums ago
look up wee man golf tournament story it s amazing
i mean if he never did it in the first place which he didn t he shouldn t be treated like he did simple concept really
you require to think to lie like you could put me on the spot and i could come up with a thorough lie for you
yeah that it was a fake story
i mean are there a ton of midget comedians because i feel like even drunk id know i m having sex with someone the size of a year old and not a full sized adult clearly i know midgets or little people whatever the appropriate name is exist and honestly wouldn t be opposed it just has to be different having sex when one partner is small
i feel dumb lmaooo
you were there
i don t believe you you sound like someone who is terrible at lying
that s why i think it s fake but still a weird story to spread as he isn t being overly sarcastic so it doesn t come off as a blatantly fake story even doug benson gets quiet and and just kinda has a thousand yard stare like what in the fuck is he saying right now look it up on youtube i don t sense any sarcasm i think he just made something up as comedians make up stories for a laugh but that one was a big swing and a miss if he was making it up on the spot i m not against dark comedy but there wasn t even a joke lmao he literally just tells a story about how he raped someone but i do think it is fake and he just missed the mark
nah i have a super tool called the internet it s full of information and facts the best part of it is you can find out if a story you heard happened or not
the only person who is in a position to know exactly what happened admitted to raping a groupie
that s fine you don t have to believe me doesn t change the fact that lying doesn t require rehearsals before ya tell it
https://youtu.be/zmou-uiua2s
telling the truth doesn t require any rehearsals that s why it sounds so natural the first time
oh well there it is fact it happened no other citations needed folks
my god it s like i m arguing with a year old k fine believe what you want but it s shitheads like you that make fake news happen
arguing that s what you were trying to do holy fuck get a grip they guy bragged about raping someone there s no good way to attempt to defend that not even if you try to claim its just fake news
you clearly haven t seen me brag about murdering your mom which happened i can get high and do a podcast all about it if you d like after all that s seemingly your criteria to factual evidence despite having evidence that contradicts it if it was said by someone while high that means they did it right

they must live in texas
why were they working out at the start
now all i need to see is a tetris mini game for placing dirt
i was expecting a casting couch room or like sex dungeon
brother and sister got this on lock down
someone had to animate that i hope they got paid
he bunkers so good
first time seeing a mobile game ad
looked pretty cool
there s gotta be some superhero chad video game developer out there who could slap these games together they look like great time wasters but they are almost never what the ad shows
nah their electrical grid can t handle that bunker
because it s bait
its the healthy thing to do
i wouldn t be surprised if the game was just candy crush variant in the end and all of this is just bait and a setup for it

whats unexpected about this hes simply sharing history on the various way the japanese would take themselves out during ww2
would it not be better to be captured and be a burden of the enemy eating his food and shit then making his job easy
i would love to check out dragon man s war museum someday i ve only seen it on youtube he s got some really interesting historical pieces plus you can rent and shoot machine guns there after
here s the family size
yes please i ll take the family pack my ex wife is thristy
i have gone to his shooting ranges he runs them like a marine corp range his paintball park is insane as you drive into his compound he has shot up manikins and cars with signs saying this customer gave me lip this customer was rude funny his wife has the weapons licenses not him lol
this man s name is dragon man he has a wwii museum down in colorado springs the way he describes it the museum is legally necessary so that he can keep all of his crazy war stuff
probably reffering to it as the family pack like he s ordering from taco bell lol
you re not wrong

that s not how this works if it s not real we have to be outraged that anyone on the internet would dare make a skit act joke or anything else and if we collectively decide it s real we have to dogpile on the person who destroyed such a tender heartwarming video game moment we have to hunt them down and tell them to kill themselves that noone will love them that they make them lose faith in humanity itself why because reddit is filled with people who have spent their lives internalizing their feelings of inadequacy who haven t given themselves enough love so they spend their time commenting online about things that make them feel smart to distract from their self loathing they want to see the upvotes go up and feel the justification they don t get from real friends they are people who need to let things go to love themselves and continue forward

if this is an actual cadaver this is super disrespectful im in medical school and spent many many hours dissecting and working with my assigned donor patient i always called him by his first name and said thank you after every anatomy class for allowing me to use his body to help me learn as a physician in training so i can one day go and help other people he didn t donate his body to be posted on social media now there is no context to the video but it doesn t matter really its just gross behavior on the part of the person who posted the video unless the person who donated their body explicitly said that they were cool with it to be displayed and even then i m pretty sure posting a video clip on reddit isn t what the donor had in mind if i had posted this clip and my school found out i would have been expelled on the spot

that is the most repulsive sauce i have ever seen
man the sauce was taking the skin from the pork
i laughed so hard

what s unexpected about this seems more like mildy inconveniencing but nothing a little warm water or a fork can t fix
im sorry shldnt the sauce be cooked together with the pork or is this some dumb american thing
it is squeezed by the chopsticks so hard that it can t hold any sauce
no pork for you pork is not kosher

their n word sketch im watching that shit rn
it s aged a little but mostly good stuff
about years ago i m always surprised more people don t know it it s brilliant heaping doses of classic onion hilarity absurdity and satire
such a great movie my wife and i quote it all the time show me your nuts bla blah bla wooo wooo wooo
it costs
link it i can t find it
yeah when the bank robber was black i thought man this must be a really old clip
i have to strenuously disagree this is nothing more than vulgar low brow potty humor thinly disguised as satire it saddens me that the onion has stooped to this lowest common denominator pandering to the masses
i need to show my wife this movie this and i m gonna get you sucka
guys see it s because nowadays black people are only the good guys white people are oppressed anyway stfu
welcome masses

staged click look at the way he detached them pliers so elegantly and smooth because that s how he tied them on the shark had to suffer much longer for internet clout than necessary i m a professional reddit situational expert this is merely my opinion but not factional
i had a similar experience probably two decades ago we were out fishing on a dock when my mother dropped her clip on shades in the water probably thirty minutes later we caught the shades
crazy stuff like that happens i was fishing the river with my uncle once and he broke off his brand new bladed jig after about minutes i hit a snag but was able to get it free when i reeled in i had his jig hooked on my line
insane
i d really like to stick a hook in their mouths and drag them beneath my boat for a while keelhaul them and then see if they want to sport fish eat it or don t do it edit people don t eat sharks because they have the highest levels of mercury in them iirc the outrage that this vid triggered is the way the shark is being towed around by its mouth for fake internet points
he easily could have flung them right into the line and it slid down and attached themselves what s odd is how shallow plied retrievers line was when he went to pull up his line to get the pliers he also noticed them so fast for having a sharks mouth so close to his hand but hey still possible hope it was real real until proven fake for me on this one i wannaaa believeeee
this could be easily faked but i hope this is real even if you would try this you d have more chance winning the lottery
o ya no way bro no way hah they can t even attempt to pretend
the only in a million thing i see is this dude trying to get a hook out of a shark s mouth everyone else cuts the line like an intelligent person
send this video to r theydidthemath stat
top comment stfu you probably never been fishing before sharks get caught sometimes when fishing for fish not like the fisherman was like i want that shark
i bet they went overboard again and did not come back up
uhh oh i lost my pliers again
what that s fucking nuts
the odds on that are are way beyond a million that s just inconceivable of how that was even possible think it s lotto ticket time

i imagine telling this to my wife her reaction would be oh thats cool i imagine telling this to the boys lets have some beers
similar thing happened to my friend he was using a jet ski off the bay of where our friend lives on the lake friend on jet ski loses ray bands couple days later our friend on the lake was fishing off the dock and caught the ray bands
the sea is a fickle mistress
when you ask you shall receive
the only thing that would have made this better is if he went back in to get the hook out and dropped them again
removed
one time i was fishing with my old man we were trolling a lake for trout and having quite a bit of success at one point he hooked one but his line was wrapped around his reel and broke off he lost his fish and his favorite lure a few hours later he hooked another fish but once he reeled in it was just a tangle of line we went to pull it off but as we grabbed it he felt the familiar tug of a fish on the other end we pulled up the tangle and found a little rainbow with his lure in its mouth here s the craziest part there were probably a hundred people fishing that lake and there were several boats not far from us additionally there were five guys in our boat all fishing and somehow the guy who broke the line ended up hooking the same fish in the same day i was there when it happened and i m still not sure i believe it
no evidence in video that they were fishing for sharks he s clearly trying to get the hook out instead of just cutting the line you have to keep a shark moving or they will drown yes they all went out fishing just for fake internet points s
some sharks also urinate through their skin
it isn t being dragged around by it s mouth or under the boat see the black line lassoed behind its pectoral fins on the side of the boat and who said they were shark fishing
or they had it on the line already and threw a cheaper pair overboard to make a fake video
ok this bot was actually helpful because theres a bug with reddit on android where if you tap links or spoilers it minimizes the comment so i can t see spoilers until they patch it otherwise this is a terrible bot edit the update to fix it is out now this bot just sucks check for updates manually if you still have the problem
shut up bot
bad bot go fuck yourself
thats awesome man makes you wonder sometimes lol always makes fishing a little more interesting especially when the odds of such things happening are next to none
welcome to reddit where evidence and logic don t matter only feelings
this
you can actually swipe right on the spoiler text and they ll show up without it minimising the comment not a total fix but it does the trick
i believe the bug you re on about got fixed 1day ago for android users now available version https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/12br6n0/now_available_version_2023130/) scroll to other updates make sure your app got this update and it works fine for me now anyhow

fuck me you fucking coward
that
oh yeah it does work thanks
yep going in and manually updating it fixed it thanks for letting me know
are you not a bot
angery electric fly killer sounds
nah i was to tired to make a comment on how to get around the bug
isn t copy pasting instructions on how to fix the bug easier than copying the comment but without the spoiler because you look like a bot at a glance
my other account just got unbaned for threatening violence lol i should have learnt to use s

reminds me of that bathroom scene in american psycho lol
alt you might just meet a close friend
if they are chocking you from the front you either pull their pinkys backwards or hit their crotch with your knee that may also work just depends on who s chocking you
comedy is all about subverting expectations so jokes are unexpected almost by default and there s no such thing as an original joke so lets not be pretentious
sir you are on reddit right now
