the team of canaries we sent into the mine to test for a gas leak have all died before reporting their findings so i guess there s still no evidence of a gas leak
sulfolk should be forced to buy the property at s assessed values of anyone who wants to leave the area
why the fuck wasn t that team wearing ppe did they think people were lying about their symptoms
feels like the show chernobyl but in slow motion sad that more people will get sick
good they now have firsthand evidence when s fbi going to raid the corporate offices to collect evidence for criminal liability for the crime that has clearly been committed
meanwhile cities in america are like can we drink this water yet
either that particular team was incompetent or current science regarding the health effects of those spilled chemicals may need some additional revisions and updates along with newly commissioned studies because it looks like the older toxicology studies aren t fully accurate big yikes if that s true cdc and fda will have a lot of explaining to do to congress if that is the case
yup cough shit s toxic alright
this whole town needs to be evacuated and relocated as soon as possible
well sadly the team couldn t finish their investigation due to illnesses it s probably fine though
does this mean the results are inconclusive
ya don t say
i feel like this is the one issue that we can get both those on the left and those on the right to band together to make as much noise as possible for accountability and change but for some reason we can t
the smoke kept growing in that giant column we still don t know the extant of the problem and somehow i m not sure we ever will it ain t us said the ceo of norfolk southern ain t us either said the government musta been god or luck that ain t so good it ain t us said the people of east ohio no one to blame and all the while east palestine s a poisoned neighborhood east palestine ohio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfchikpfxau) conorryanhennessy
the residents environmental workers and all involved will be royally fucked with health problems for the foreseeable future corporate profits over citizen health goes against the basic principles of sovereignty which insures order and safety ns wont pay shit so don t hold your breath they even have the audacity to start targeting veterans to hire to fill their staff shortages rant over thanks for reading
why is this group not wearing ppe do they think people are lying about their symptoms
so now it s cool to doubt public health officials got it
whats going to happen the more this happens ghost towns on the rise
right so lets maybe not send chris into the field where the other team reported symptoms of the chemical spill not long after they went in to investigate the chemical spill
well looks like biden lied but i m sure the chinese balloon is more dangerous to some hypocrites than the health of our people
can t wait until hbo makes a miniseries about this
bruh they probably going to get cancer too just like all the residents this whole thing is nuts
the second team of canaries we re sending in should get to the bottom of it
and they ll say everything is fine
the good news is that the entrance to the mine is now clogged with canary corpses so we don t even have to worry about backfilling it with concrete
right but the canaries are dead so they can t tell us anything about the gas leak we need to figure out another way to test for a gas leak man i keep yawning i m getting really tired down here s
sounds like havana syndrome
and pay for the medical bills for any medical issues for the rest of their lives due to not being evacuated immediately
they ruined the land they should pay for that and let the people keep their rights to the property i don t want to see people having toxic waste spilled on their property turned into an opportunity for the monopolies to snatch it all up i know that isn t how it works but i know i d be wanting damages paid out and my land to stay in my name
suffolk should be surrendered to the state and their board of trustees should be loved
why the fuck wasn t that team wearing ppe probably because they weren t dealing with the spill itself the team that got sick here is a health registry team and they were tasked with going door to door asking people questions so i d imagine there was some public reception decision to not go fully suited to people s houses while also telling people it s not an evacuation zone
at this point i think a lack of competence is to be expected
well in the beginning they were saying its not a big deal https://www.npr.org/2023/02/08/1155570564/east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment some residents have said they were worried about returning even if authorities say it s ok to go home
also why was this story reported a week ago and then again today not trying to detract from the original breaking news but we seem to have an echo echo echo in here
ppe isn t a magic spell
cause masks are a hoax remember
i mean it s the cdc since when have they acted competently
with the severity of it especially with the claims that it was chernobyl levels would ppe even matter lol also no fema hhs funds were approved so shows how much was put into it
that show is an incredible couple hours of tv
this
i mean this is also about a city in america
who said they weren t wearing ppe
their county sits around fully vaxxed trusting public health officials feds probably not one of their strong suits before this happened
this is the public health team themselves getting sick shit is absolutely fucked and the toxicity around those spilled chemicals are definitely not fully comprehensively known utter failure of the fda s own studies if the currently known safe exposure limit is turning out to not be safe enough
from free falling to the bottom
did you guys even watch the video the workers symptoms resolved within hours and they went back to work
robert bilott has been trying to get dupont to do that very thing since
that land is now a cancer factory there are plenty of places to put your name on some cheap land without the health risks
all railroads should be surrendered to the state shit should be nationalized
ahh yes because the sate is doing so much for these people now
and now they ve proven the exact opposite
even if authorities say it s ok to go home the smart ones you have to be a special breed of stupid to have just lived through covid and still trust the government to do whats best for you
i didn t see it last week i m probably not the only one
this and afroman are the big stories reddit has latched onto they re both important but yea they ll be upvoted even if there s nothing new
it s not magic but it s still armor
i just recently rewatched it and now i have to tell myself not to watch it cause it can t just be the only thing i watch forever everything else i watch feels like it s just a way of delaying watching it again
please stop this trend you ve added nothing to the conversation even if you posted this i agree for the following additional reasons you could make the statement with this
oh damn i shouldn t be laughing at this
free falling to the bottom i thought this was gonna be some crazy dark comedy about mining am dissapoint
so you don t think it s a problem that after a toxic chemical spill that the company lied about being safe folk got sick a cdc team no less that must have alerted them to the fact that no the site is not safe
no i got bored halfway through the title of the post
yeah but it s cheap who gives a shit about health risks when you can get a good bargain by ignoring health and safety standards and nevermind
by the same people who run the dmv awesome
you right it should be employee owned norfolk southern should pay all of these people for their land pay all medical bills and then the company should be surrendered to the employees so that it can be run democratically by the people who know how the business works
couldn t tell ya there s not a lot of info on it omg cover up which is annoying though it s noted that it was suspicious that all the members that got sick got sick at the same time and then were fine a day later supposing that were true that would seem odd for any sort of exposure illness you d expect some variation even if everyone got the same dosage
as far as covid whenever the government said be careful about it people got mad didn t trust it and didn t want to listen whenever the government said okay do what you re going to do people got mad for it not protecting them from themselves so i don t know if comparing to covid is a great example for government ineptitude any more than it is an example of the public s ineptitude
east palestine is a poor rural community they had no options
a disappointing reality is the government doesn t know what is best because they are only human they are just doing what they know best ideally smart people but there s no guarantee since many are voted in and not chosen by their merits
do you believe they were wearing zero ppe
irradiated helicopter blades disintegrating in midair on loop so terrifyingly mesmerizing great cgi

the overwhelming data shows that privatizations private industry is not more efficient whatsoever and leads to even larger bureaucratic structures than publicly run shit the only reason people push for it is to privatize profits not because it is in any way better read bullshit jobs by david graeber also the best explanation for the dmvs issues stems precisely from the fact it s funded at the bare minimum not that it s a state run thing
and the post office the military the cops etc
like they all drank some weird water from a restaurant that didn t wipe the bleach from it s glasses properly team goes to sizzler half the cups at sizzler have chemical residue from cleaning half the team gets sick
i have no idea what you re talking about i was making a simple statement
if they did a good job but were slow that would make sense but they are both bad at their job and they are slow
i know you re just using it as a potential example but modern restaurants don t use bleach as a sanitizing agent anymore
and yet privatizing it would be worse shit runs better when there s enough money invested to both modernize it and hire enough staff we just don t do that because the propaganda against publicly run stuff is so strong that despite all the overwhelming evidence people like you still exist and politicians get to sell you the shitty idea back to you in elections so these services are shit so you complain so they make more cuts so you complain some more and eventually if enough people are tricked it gets privatized and we all lose except for the senators daughter s boyfriends company who gets the contract
modern restaurants also don t have food safety violations on paper
but how many operating restaurants aren t modern

i have seen this video probably times over the years and never read that
they don t make em like that anymore i got to see judas priest earlier this year in concert rob halford looks like big glittery santa these days but holy shit can he still hit those notes i bet dio still could today too if he were still around
this guy was so metal that even the lyrics are written using medieval font
dio actually broke the studio s mic and ended up using his own that he brought specifically because he knew a studio mic won t handle his voice sauce https://www.metalcastle.net/jack-black-recalls-how-ronnie-james-dio-toasted-the-mic-with-his-voice/)
gentle badass legend love dio so much
in the city of fallen angels where the ocean meets the saaaaaaaaaaaand
he has to bring his own microphone because his voice is so power ful
aw jack is fanboying hard dream come true for sure what a wholesome video should send in to r moviedetails
funny thing is i bet this was a huge day for both jack and kyle i mean holy shit right there is dio singing lyrics you wrote this is great thanks for sharing
has jb ever come out and said dio is his vocal inspiration after watching this it seemed pretty obvious
i ve always loved the headphone impressions left in his hair when he takes them off at the end
i still believe dio is one of the best male singers we ve ever had definitely top of the metal singers
goosebumps every single time i m so glad i got to see him with heaven hell it was a beautiful sunny day and when they came on lightning and rain appeared so magical
so awesome
the guy in the cap s reaction at has me in stitches
dio was my very first concert at poplar creek in the chicago burbs twisted sister opened
great artist
ahh man it took just one take remember seeing this year s ago dio was the man and what a great fn movie
im sure they filmed this whole movie just to hear dio singing in their studio
i see dio i upvote dio i m simple that way
was that jack black in there with him
he who is groovy must be in my movie

switching to pick of d for my gym workout now
dio meatloaf killed it in this movie
rip dio on another note tenacious d and the pick of destiny is such an awesome comedy always hated how they didn t do commercially well to warrant a sequel
what a coincidence that you re posting this tomorrow paul gilbert releases the dio album on which he covers dio songs from the different bands he s been in with guitar as vocals i m very much looking forward to it
when you realize dio did this in a single take because he s that good
does anyone know if that was rob schrab in the background
za warudo
that was fucking rad thank you for posting this
love that album
his ability to enunciate so well while singing is really impressive
i can only imagine the goose bumps jb had when dio nails it
did they just record that album in jack black s living room
last in line
now i see where jack black s style is inspired from
it s crazy i hear so much of jack black s td singing style in dio s voice that my ignorant ass thought for a spilt second that dio was totally mocking jb s sound
i always thought that was jb hah
the most powerful voice in metal
goosebumps
i finally got to see the priest in and even if neither of the original guitar players are there my life is still better for it
i agree i saw him when he toured with tony and geezer from black sabbath as heaven and hell the osbornes wouldn t let let them use black sabbath from what i understand probably about years ago and let me tell you his voice hadn t lost anything i was blown away i can t think of another rock metal vocalist whose voice and range had such longevity but then again i haven t seen judas priest live rip to the best there ever was
faster than a bullet terrifying scream
saw iron maiden last year and bruce dickinson still has insane pipes too
i was a stage guard at summerfest in milwaukee when i was in i was sitting on the front of the stage when judas priest was playing i got kicked in the back by the lead guitarist while he was doing an awesome solo he apologized up and down to me he was so nice about it
i do not need he does not need a microphone a microphone my voice is fuckin powerfuuuul
interesting note in order to withstand his voice dio s mic was was wrought from the sound of a cat s footsteps the beard of a woman the roots of mountains the breath of a fish and the spittle of a bird
you hear stuff like that about artists with powerful voices but the fact is modern mics are rated for spl levels as high as db sometimes that s as loud as a jet engine taking off maybe they were using some vintage neumann relic that s still a super doubtful as those mics are routinely used inside bass drums i just don t know who to believe the legends or the science i want to believe
that doesn t make any sense you can t break a mic with your voice
epic
dio has rocked for a long long time
his voice hits like a road roller
just stop it s a myth
first thing i noticed jables was just in awe and jack is a pretty damn good singer himself dio was just in a whole other world though he kinda gets clowned on a bit because his kind of metal is very dramatic gods and devils angels and demons fire and beasts type fantasy stuff but god damn was he good at it
i think he like myself just cannot believe they got ronnie james fucking dio for this silly stupid but amazing movie they put together really speaks to dio s appreciation of the art more than anything
yeah he might have said a couple of things about him https://youtu.be/jroiex0a2ho
i heard an interview where he talked about bobby mcferrin being a big inspiration
different genre but brian mcknight https://youtu.be/h38png7cmci) has entered the chat
ditto i managed to grab one single center orchestra ticket to their radio city music hall show the only time i ve ever been to a concert by myself and never felt alone for a single second i ll never forget the energy he brought into that room
that was liam lynch of early internet fame he directed the tenacious d movie they were recording this for
this is the way
yeah this is from pick of destiny if you haven t seen it i suggest it it s so good it was on us netflix last i checked
dio has rocked for a long long time now it s time for him to pass the torch
you see the smile on jbs face dreams can come true
definitely looks like him
percent sure that s him he was on the lynchland podcast as well
i was lucky enough to see them in as well it was fucking nuts at the end of their set their guitarist richie faulkner suffered an aortic aneurysm in his heart https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/judas-priest-guitarist-richie-faulkner-suffered-major-heart-issue-festival-gig-9641177/) while performing painkiller and had to be rushed to the hospital after the gig for a hour open heart surgery the thing is nobody even knew it at the time he was absolutely shredding perfectly while his heart was failing and finished the song what a legend
fyi alice cooper still sounds fuckin awesome very jealous you got to see h h btw
i saw that tour when they came to nz was amazing to see dio live
fwiw and i m not sure if true but i recently read tommy iommi chose to use the name heaven and hell because only dio era songs would be played he didn t want to mislead fans to think that ozzy era songs would be played on the heaven and hell tour i know that wording completely sucks but it was something like that
you got kk d but did you go downing
uhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sorry
i know that reference
guiness book of records says loudest human scream is db loudest signers are in the opera and can do db think all neumann s mics are all rated db and above i put these claims under highly doubtful
if you ever get the chance to hear an opera singer at full volume up close it will boggle your mind that a human can be that loud idk if this story is made up to add some glamor to a rock icon who had just died or not but humans in general are almost always capable of a lot more than we think we are
i hate to break it to you but there is a chance he broke the mic with a powerful voice the mic could have been broken some other way or he may have just had his own preferred mic for his vocals but there is not one iota of a chance that his singing broke a microphone
probably broke the amplifier inside it not the mechanical bit
a microphone is built with a diaphragm it s possible in theory to break it i e cause a minor tear that distorts the input through application of enough volume in the diaphragm s own harmonic resonant frequency
you re thinking of a different dio
i wasn t aware of that jack black and others there during the tenacious d movie confirmed it on set they talk about it in his documentary
it is indeed a myth because actually he does not need he does not need a microphone a microphone his voice is fuckin fuckin powerfuuuuull
so we spread myths about people all the time that destroy lives and hurt countless people a myth about one of the greatest rockers ever having a voice so powerful that it destroys regular microphones hurts literally nobody and adds fun to a cruel and shitty world
he does that s the coolest metal though
i m not convinced
whatever
its amazing how many amazing musicians are part of that movie ronnie james dio meatloaf dave grohl along with some great music the movie is underrated as hell funny with good music what more can you ask for
unfortunately it is not on netflix anymore
you must give your cape and scepter to me and a smaller one for kg
dio has rocked for a long long time now it s time for him to pass the torch he has songs of wildebeests and angels
now it s time for him to pass the torch
i love me some alice but he never pushed real hard it was tone and the sneer in his voice
no i m a big guy it would take more than a platform shoe to the back to take me out
i m the man on the silver mountain
data i thought you were dead
i ve worked with quite a few opera singers a very loud projecting vocal can be as loud as maybe db mind you the decibel scale is logarithmic so every db is double the energy so a microphone rated at spl can withstand nearly times the energy levels of a very loud singer
there is a great story about dave grohl bending the rims of drum kits while drumming for the first queens of the stone age album
sure and that s still nowhere near 140db
i was just being polite
like a blown out speaker
i could see this maybe in a ribbon condenser or similarly delicate mic i d love to see a dynamic mic break because of too much spl just won t happen
woah that went from zero to yelling rapist real fast edit literally seconds
what intensely reprehensible behavior by tesla employees i hope this video gets more exposure
i know it s supposed to be a serious point but when he started yelling about them having a rapist mentality out nowhere i lost it i just did not see that coming
so eu have pretty strict gdpr laws how is this playing into that the fines are pretty hefty
so glad there s not a video in here with me jerking off while driving
this guy is so off putting
wait until they shut off you car for wrong think internet connected cars are such a bad fucking idea
i don t think there needs to be a spooky caption as the giant floating head isn t at all subtle
i have two friends and one co worker who all used to work at a tesla plant they said its a fuckin circus they pretty much hire anyone none of the machines or equipment is taken care of and even the manager at one warehouse was openly selling hard drugs i am not all suprised by this video especially considering how their ceo acts on a daily basis i can also say as someone who worked at amazon for over three years it is exactly the same there as well
lol at yt comments bringing up right to repair the fuck
so where are they posting the tesla porn
oh it s the racoon looking whine about apple all day youtuber
this fat fuck on the couch needs an actual job flip those burgers five head
that escalated quickly
i started the video for information stayed for the rapist piece of shit
immediately turned the video off normally like his commentary but this was very off putting
literally but close enough
the employees laughing about the customers isn t really the problem the problem is the tesla spying i m reminded of the norm mcdonald joke patton oswalt he told me i think the worst part of the cosby thing was the hypocrisy and i disagree i thought it was the raping
yeah i get the parallel but the way he got to it was kind of off putting by using a tesla agreeing to the tos they should have known we d be passing around their naked photos by passing out at a party they should have known we d be passing around their naked photos
because of this comment i ll always think twice before whacking it on my drive to work
he has certainly gotten much more old man yells at pigeon over the years
yes he is
i say this all the time and i get downvoted all the time dudes a creep i don t trust ellen degeneres or anyone with those eyes something about them makes me suspicious of them
i started tuning out of his channel when it became a soapbox for his problems with new york state and city governments dude you have an international audience talk to me about right to repair not problems navigating your state s tax bureaucracy
wait until they shut off you car for wrong think internet connected cars are such a bad fucking idea internet connected cars isn t a bad idea not having regulations that prevent mfg s from using and selling your location data and camera imagery being able to restrict your access to features and being able to shut down your vehicle remotely without a warrant that has to go through a public oversight authorization that s a bad idea
sounds like a regular auto plant then but with less drugs
sounds like the average manufacturing plant that s the way manufacturing plants work in america today hire whoever everyone is replaceable work as much as possible and high turnover
the guy in the video louis rossman is one of the most influential leaders spearheading the right to repair movement yes it s out of context for this video but not for of the content this guy puts out there he s been fighting against big tech companies and publicizing the shady stuff they ve been up to planned obsolescence anti small business practices locking vendors from selling chips to third parties etc so they can sell more hardware and force consumers to come to them for repairs instead of local shops for over a decade now
i have companies nonprofits and a full time job barely have time left to yell at a camera anymore
so you don t understand at all why he said that tesla employees in the company were logging in to peoples cars accounts and going over the videos the cars recorded they d share funny embarrassing erotic whatever videos of customers on the company internal messaging board if the videos were entertaining awesome those people tended to get promoted one of the people was quoted as saying people signed up and waved away all expectation of privacy so the tesla people didn t feel bad they were spying on their customers he was calling those employees rapists for doing that and not feeling bad but ya louis shouldn t be so off pudding it adds pounds
i don t understand that downvotes i also left that video within seconds of him screaming rapist about something that had nothing to do with any kind of sexual assault i don t have any idea who this person is
soft
louis rossman tried to use the government to force right to repair and then threw a bitch fit and moved to texas claiming to be a libertarian when it didn t work he s done good work in the past but the dude is an insufferable prick pivoting from apple repair videos to political commentary just revealed it
there s video of that norm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgx1bk2jcy)
that s the best part
the man started out posting clips of him fixing things in his shop the focus on apple s bullshit started as advertising for that shop that content never stopped amidst the right to repair stuff and in fact predates his right to repair stuff i don t watch it but it never started to become that it always was
the whole disabling your car remotely or having it self drive off your property for a late payment is kinda bad
agree with all of what you say but it will never happen legitimately in favor of the consumer tax payer
louis you re the man
yell fanspin at me daddy
in what way is right to repair bad
tried to use the government wat is trying to get a bill passed is considered using the government
force right to repair does not compute
louis rossman tried to use the government to force right to repair i don t know anything about the rest of your comment but this sentence is drenched in negative spin holy shit
making seinfeld laugh
i mean technically that s what it s for
now it lives in the roof with the scorpions
i ve watched these videos for years half envisioning myself living a simple life off the land until now it lives in the roof with the scorpions nah
only primitive channel that s not fake and had great information
so he s freeze drying fire
i love this dude just silent concentration hes australian right i remember reading that somewhere
reminder turn on closed captions for an explanation of what he s doing and why
centipede and scorpions he should burn that whole area
love his channel
primitive technology one of the best channels on youtube
this is like the fifth video of him making charcoal time to put that charcoal to use
repost
deleted
that thing looked massive it s probably eating the scorpions i bet that fumigation from the second method cleared em out
in the comment section he said he got bit by a scorpion before made his hand turned tingly for hours
simply make charcoal every day to get rid of them
absolutely he is the og he did it first and everyone else copied the style did you ever see the excavator tracks in one of those others vid the guys who make pools they claim to dig with sticks but you can clearly see the track marks from digging equipment and why do they always throw in a meal at random and eat like absolute slobs
if wood is burned in an oxygen touch environment it turns to ass in this video he plugs the holes to create an oxygenless environment no oxygen means the wood doesn t burn but gets turned into a chunk of carbon that chunk of carbon burns hot and really only releases heat and co2 making it good for the metal smelting he s gonna be doing
yeah i believe his property is in queensland
his name is something like john hand
what do you think all the charcoal is for
in the comments he says his next vid is using the charcoal to do more smelting and using snail shells as flux
i noticed that by the time of the third method that all the charcoal from the previous two seems to have disappeared so i wonder if this was shot between some of the other metalworking videos
this is the original guy that all those other channels copied he s legit
not primitive tech but i know the channels you re talking about
dude knows what he s doing for sure
i used to watch the pool videos those were obviously faked surprised it took a whistle blower to actually be noticed by the gp has anyone ever tried to dig a hole deeper than a foot it s damn hard without the right tools or machinery primitive technology never tried to flashy stuff but i m glad he s got the attention he deserves
i ve always hated when my wood turns to ass
john plant
ah gotcha my bad
i don t like it when my oxygen touch environment
especially in an oxygen touch environment
drag queens are not trans people
there is a lot to unpack for much more serious things but is anyone else pissed he tucks his ears inside his hat
i am outoftheloop can someone fill me in on why the fuck he just did that edit i m getting downvoted for asking seriously can y all not gatekeep and just help me understand
thank god i was wondering what kid rock thought about the situation
kid rock should be tried for what he did to werewolves of london
kid rock used to be loved in the juggalo community and has since been ostracized you know you re an asshole when the juggalos want nothing to do with you
is that an automatic weapon
oh the trans thing scared away most good old boy rednecks who drink that crap that is the good news the bad news their real constituents are good old boy rednecks and well looks like miller wins the war
young ladies young ladies i like em underage see some say it s statutory but i say it s mandatory kidd rock in his song from osmosis jones
wow he looks fucking awful i hadn t seen the clip before but jesus nobody even wants you around here joe dirt
you d think just one of these cultists would feel a twinge of reluctance when they re being so obviously manipulated by hate based dog whistles yet somehow down to the last one they never are
i think kid rock was afraid of his waning popularity as he s aging so he jumped into culture war stuff to get an instant magat fanbase if kid rock wasn t shooting bud light cans would we be talking about kid rock right now is his next show going to be full to the brim with magats
that was before kid rock realized that he wasn t relevant anymore and only rednecks still buy cds
so he bought beer to shoot it
drag queen trans
but he already bought the bud light he hates so much he s just wasting beer and showing ppl how terrible a person he is
it s almost like before people didn t care about any of this wokeism that they care about today social media the msm has done a number on a large portion of the population
is that actually kid rock i thought it was just dad
seeing the image and the video side by side is the first time i realized that was kid rock in the video just thought it was some redneck
he didn t always hate black people either just ask his kid but maga has a strong influence on weak minds
i mean i m all for supporting lgbt rights but companies choosing to elevate dylan mulvaney as a face of the trans movement is objectively absurd mulvaney should outrage women and the women i know who aren t right wingers despise mulvaney the schtick mulvaney portrays is like a caricature of acting like women are dumb ditzy mindless bimbos in my world women are strong serious educated equals not people who prance around like anorexic airheads if tucker carlson were to design a manchurian transgender weirdo to ostracize the trans movement it would be dylan mulvaney dylan mulvaney is to women what blackface is to african americans
so are drag queens trans or not because i keep hearing both that they aren t trans and it s just a costume but also that you re transphobic if you don t like it which is it
what will be hilarious is when smith and wesson or colt adds rainbows to their firearms you will see a lot of conflicted rednecks when that happens
right wing icon kid rock
i don t get it the guy grew up wealthy and decided he wanted to cosplay as an inbred hillbilly and even after gaining his own wealth and likely setting up the next couple of generations he still insists on being a sister fucker who the fuck would choose to live like that
has his old drummer ever spoke out about him
i don t think his point was ever that he hated trans people i think his point was bud light should be marketing to its main and large customer base i think he just felt if they don t know who their main customer is then maybe they don t deserve that customer s business
who gives a shit what that trumper says
aging and fading rock star begging for attention
a lot of this of this trans hate seems to be stemming from washed up famous people trying to rebuild their fan base
this is nothing more than just a pr stunt his name has dropped off the media so he is just reminding everyone that he is still a pos
bud does suck taste like garbage but i thought that way before being woke wink
damn he really is the millennial generation s ted nugent sings about liking them underage in cool daddy cool pro gun loony republicunt
kid who he s still alive
kid rock is nothing but a shill that panders to his demographic if his demographic decide to be a group of bigoted anti lgbt shit sacks then kid rock will be a bigoted anti lgbt shit sack as well
all publicity is good publicity anheuser busch thanks you kid rock
so if i don t buy bud light does that make me transphobic
child stone
i think he is cool with them as people but is against sexual shit being shown and done to kids
he looks like he uses the same make up artist that trump uses that orange face looks exactly the same
playing to his base now
wasn t so much a community back then as it was a bit of fun circus if you will
it looks like theres someone off screen shooting a roman candle too
kid rock is the definition of a phoney lol didn t he start out trying to be a rapper perfect maga template
oh man get over it it was a funny video of him shooting beer everything has to be turned into this protracted political battle fuck off
so
this was before the drag community was dead set on including our children in their drag shows
my name is kiiiiiiiiiid suuuuuuuuck
deleted
yeah but hes got a coors hat on and is that a bud light i cant tell
why does he look like caucasian snoop dogg now
that wasn t deranged at all no sir
did anybody ever actually like kid rock
first how is this guy still alive and are there really people that give a shit about what kid rock thinks
groomer
random photo taken of kid rock in the vicinity of a drag queen at some large event the left ha we caught you in a web of life long lies muahahahaha
bud light didn t always hate of their consumer base
kind of funny all the outrage at kid rock like you d expect anything from a guy who s entire life career and persona is built on a lie
it just illustrates the radicalisation he s undergone he s thrown out his own beliefs and taken on those from someone else
yeah i want to keep all guns legal i love that unhinged people can get guns like that easier than getting cough medicine i don t know any sane gun owner who just has one or two guns and who went to a lot of classes and know exactly how to be safe they all just collect them obsessively trying to get the biggest baddest ones and i never see someone use a gun for a legit reason except for the few people that i know who go hunting but the crazy people i know far outnumber the hunters
bobby is ok with drag
kid rock doesn t give a fuck what people wear but he loves publicity because that turns into record sales nothing to think about here
did he rlly spend on bud light for that video
i ve never been this angry in my life and it s a rainbow that did it
did he shoot this on his fathers estate
the us is so political that at this point for him this is like a business decision his fan base is likely mostly republicans so if he had a tolerant opinion like most normal people would have and be ok with it they would basically cancel him even if that side of the political spectrum says they don t do that they do
funny for a guy i saw in reno maybe he was sponsored by budweiser and had this giant bud airstream thing on stage one of those things your customer asks if you d want to go not my thing but let s get drunk
that could be the origin story for his whole deal say that drag queen broke his heart and now he has resentment for bud and of the gender spectrum
it s always been funny to me how the gop are supposed to be the outdoorsey types but have you ever noticed they re always the ones littering and not respecting the environment bro just shot a whole bunch of cans and shrapnel into that lake bothers me more than it should i guess
it s objectively weird this trans person suddenly got thrust into mainstream media became a white house liaison and now suddenly has multiple corporate sponsorships
psst it s because this specific brand of extreme conservatism is a symptom of a developed mental illness
i d like to hear him say exactly what his problem with ab is just put it into words instead of tip toeing around it
we only got room for one cheetoh man
when your music stops selling you can always become master of the dog whistle
kid rock needs to crawl back into whatever cave he stumbled out of i ll listen to him and his opinions just before never
who cares what kid rock thinks
kid rock is irrelevant and a joke who cares what he thinks
no talent her off either way
when i first saw this video i didn t know it was kid rock i just thought it was another backwardass closeted redneck getting mad for jesus i m sorry to tell you if you drink bud light you re already queer
das jus what happens when grandpa gets a lil frisky
this is woman face
really funny watching people fumble over this lol
yeah darcelle was really no fan of trans activism he was a really proud gay man and didn t like being lumped in with trans people at all
i was curious about that when i saw the thumbnail for the video i went through the thought process is that person trans if they are are they also a drag queen if the answer is no to both of those questions then we have a drag queen who isn t trans this could potentially confuse some people who aren t that familiar with the intersection of trans drag performers so i ll explain trans drag performers can do whatever kind of drag they they want technically anyone can because of how diverse drag as an art form is i ve seen trans women doing woman drag i ve seen trans men doing woman drag and man drag because drag often entails an exaggeration of fashion make up and often times gender expression i could do a separate comment on gender expression and drag even people who aren t trans can do drag performance in accordance with their gender
one is gender dysphoria and one is entertainment edited to appease fragile feelings because spelling mistakes are a sin
republican lawmakers are doing their damndest to make them both illegal though
it wouldn t matter if they were gay in drag or trans the issue is that all of the above are primary targets for the republican party if we sit idly by while they come after one marginalized group another group is next and then another and so on fascism
that s a subtlety that s probably lost on kid rock
i swear its like the majority of reddit can t tell this and instantly fall back on the transphobic virtue signal if there is any criticism drag is strangely enough almost exclusively a straight male thing
who cares
right they re just people who like to twerk in front of little kids
i am now
shit happens when you grow up raising horses on your family s estate
bud light did some pro lgbt ad campaign and the conservative snowflakes are big mad and they re all swearing off bud light the ironic thing is he probably went out and bought all that bud light to do this video lmao
imagine getting to the point in society that if you re not in the know the default answer is go fking google it i feel for you op jesus
he is obviously a miller high life man oh and hates trans drag and probably minorities
because he s a reta republican
if you re genuinely asking for info google is a good friend in the future this is about right wing backlash to bud light doing an ad campaign with a trans influencer and some weird and possibly insecure people are mad about it for some reason https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/bud-light-partnership-trans-influencer-dylan-mulvaney-prompts-rightwin-rcna78295](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/bud-light-partnership-trans-influencer-dylan-mulvaney-prompts-rightwin-rcna78295) not clear why this particular unhinged individual decided that the best way to address his feelings about a commercial that has nothing to do with him is to shoot a machine gun at a few cases of beer missing most of them but maybe he can answer that
where is ja
yes
there s a reason he s in the passenger seat
dear dodge for once make an ad that answers the question on everyone s mind how many filthy tables can you haul in the bed of that truck
this seems like a cash grab it s a cash grab tim
i wonder if any of those fuckers in his inflatable mansion ever just like run around nude and you see like one of their fuckin big old hairy nuts
he has no good car ideas
robinson is this one of those new electric trucks driver it s an electric ram announcer introducing a lineup of electric trucks is it an electric truck or an electric ram make up your mind dodge i m getting very mixed messages here
supply of new ev models is always too low to obtain doubles let alone triples i ll have to wait
i was just watching corncob tv and saw this ad come on
i ve got triples of the electric ram
i think i will wait for the limited edition dan flashes interior model to hit the showrooms
the fact they didn t have him do that voice shows the ram had no idea what they were doing with this ad
still prefer the hot dog car
the mansion knows he used to be a piece of shit
pretty sure this ad was created by cramblin duvet
my lifted dodge ram truck has blinding white led headlights positioned exactly at eye level i am currently tailgating you in the right lane even though you re going twenty miles an hour over the speed limit and the left lane is open there are monster energy and fox racing stickers on the rear windshield of my lifted dodge ram truck there are perfectly clean mud tires and massive chrome rims on my lifted dodge ram truck i make thirty one thousand dollars a year and thought that that was a wise financial decision i bring cases of bud light to girls at high school parties while my wife and children are at home my lifted dodge ram truck has a gun rack which holds the ar that i bought at walmart yeti coolers kick ass
i will always watch anything with tim robinson but since it s still a very funny truck ad and yesterday i just happened to see this exceptionally well researched video on the usa s tragically blind obsession with suvs and pickups https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7msxmrueo), i feel obliged to share it somewhere along the way it comments on how even when electric they still aren t an ethical practical or efficient option for most buyers even those who don t care about other drivers cyclists or pedestrians
you gotta give back
a ram like the animal
i wouldn t of picked up that stranger he must be a real piece of shit with that slicked back hair
state trooper pulled me over after he tagged me going mph past the weigh station as i was hauling lbs of steel beams i roll down the window he asks me sir is this the dodge ram that won jd power associate awards and is 2019s motor trend truck of the year i said yes sir plus it also has a star safety rating is the most fuel efficient truck in america he let me off the hook immediately sped off to his local dodge dealer to buy a dodge ram during ram truck month so he could get cash back bluelivesmatter
it s a cash grab it s for jocks
it s allright could ve used a few coffin fails
tim s a genius so i feel like part of this ad has something in it that he convinced them was totally innocuous but still part of his humor right now i m leaning on him getting the guy to do that fuckin look and say it s an electric ram hahaha like wow that has to be a joke right
im a dead maaan
leave it the fuck alone
i have an electric ram in the parking lot right now i drove it around the world but it s battery is dying tell him tell him it s dying but it s gonna get better
plastic
how many screen panels do we need
geez that is one ugly ass dash
i m so glad he s no longer a piece of shit
tell them it s the ugly inflatable mansion on kenmore the one where you can see the kfc through the front window
ngl that line some like to get there first some like to get it right is a delicious dig at tesla and their increasingly unappealing cars
i hope he got his bag but this ad was shit the whole concept is don t jump on new tech because its usually shit but get ours because its gonna be perfect fuck off
our babysitter bought one of these trucks and then we were late yeah she really fucked us i fuckin hate her it was like a hit and run but it doesnt matter like at all
i love this guy but had no idea what his name actually was so i read this as tim robbins and was thoroughly confused when someone else showed up in the actual truck
thats funny because buying a car like that is the equivalent of everything else he was doing in the ad
i know it s because companies wanna charge for electric pitstops but i feel like pickup trucks would be a fantastic candidate for placing solar panels on you could put them on the bed of the truck or on the little flap thing you put over the bed i know there are a bunch of other logistical reasons why this wouldn t work as a complete solution to energy and cars seeing as how people have garages solar can t generate that much power trees etc but i d love to see if someone can make a sustainable truck with solar as an experiment
this is literally just an ad
tim is the best as always but the pandering ads are disgusting don t be a guinea pig be a ram please tell me how to be a man truck commercial that s what my life has been missing
let s show a bunch of products failing then show our product in the same commercial
this is just a post of an ad wtf
it s an ev all is forgiven
nice this guys awesome
this interior shot of the truck i i hate the concept because i hate trucks most people who have them don t need them but i can t deny i appreciate the execution
guess i m buying a ram now
who
and i had to look up who tim robinson is some snl guy why does this matter
instant classic this should of been a super bowl commercial
is all you need to make your first downpayment on the new dodge ram crewcab 4x4 featuring autolift tailgate and star iihs safety crash rating including small passenger overlap welcome to man country son you want a truck that can tow a skyscraper uphill before you even start the nuclear powerplant of an engine then look no more grab some keys at your local ram dealer today so you can overtake that piss collecting f garbage mobile on the left lane while towing your whole farm in reverse this is no joke this damn truck was forged in a firepit of red white and blue
no idea who this is
tim robinson rules commercials suck fucking ass
sorry we re the last domestic automaker to bring a no brainer to market we kind of f d around on ev development and literally had to start from the ground up here but trust us our brand new untested product is going to be way better than the other guys that s uh that s a bold marketing strategy there dodge as a truck owner i m seeing a bunch of unnecessary gimmicky shit in that cab that s just going to be an excuse to bump the price and incentivise purchasing the overpriced extended warranty why is it so hard for car companies to just give us a solid vehicle in a familiar package but with the benefits of an ev powertrain we don t need a dash full of screens or stupid over designed overly plastic interiors and exteriors hell if i could drop a crate ev motor into my f without spending so much i may as well just buy a new ev i d be thrilled truck owners care about two things performance and price give me comparable performance to what i have no range limitations i can live with and a price i can afford and i will preorder today it s not complicated so stop trying to make it so because shit like this applies to idiots who just buy trucks as some kind of status symbol and then bitch about parking
they actually disguised an ad as a reddit post
i read it as tim robins and saw the ad
why did they have to fake drag that ottoman at the end are they saying this ram is not capable of dragging an ottoman without cgi
uh oh this will trigger the the trucks are too damn big guys
tim robinson might be the least funny person on the planet
later maybe d
it s weird that it is the ram do we get to skip next year
cash grab
they said they wanted something spooky
i love tim robinson so much for his style of comedy it s not all laugh out loud funny but it just feels so real i imagine this being his true self in everyday life
i won t buy this truck i want a car that s too small so there is no space for mother in law
he just wants complicated designs on his shirts
the other guy in this was in my student film in small fucking world
it s gonna be hilarious when they get recalled for their steering wheels flying out the window
oof
his real car that he drives every day is a semi truck and he also owns a dump truck
gee i wonder who took part in writing this commercial
funny
he s in it because it was done at cramblin duvet obviously
why is it so fucking big why does someone need this
it would be a good car if when you re driving the steering wheel does not fall off in your hand
that steering wheel looked like it was gonna fly off while he was driving
does it come in any other styles
this is such bs in an industry like that people who aren t first don t get the patents on the best designs and methods so they re product is going to be alot less effective trust me i work for a company who is 3rd in the industry coming from the 1st in the industry and everything is years behind and shittier because the guys got patents on all the good stuff we are better only when it comes to things that are 3rd party and not patented within the industry sort of like speaker brands for car companies this dodge will have better speakers than a ford but the function part of the vehicle won t be as good
why couldn t he have been the cool guy like the kids want him to hang out but he can t because its teens only
damn that truck looks awesome
this is terrible we need smaller trucks not bigger trucks
betcha electric rams will still lead in driver dui rate
til that i don t know who tim robinson is
i don t know who tom robinson is but i want to know a lot more about this electric truck if dodge came through with an electric basic model cargo van with manual windows and dutch doors with a mile charge i d bust a nut
i had to google who tim robinson is out of the loop i guess
there s far too much room for hauling a mother in law in my opinion plus that steering wheel looks like it s gonna wiff off and fly out the window at any second looks like they let paul design this one
i hope it has self driving capability that way when the driver is too drunk as fuck as all ram drivers statistically are it can safely drive the owner home
astroturfed with trending you should leave videos posted last month on r videos but this guy rules so i m ok with it
the guys at dodge think i m just some dumb hick they said that to me at a dinner
i don t know what any of this shit is and i m fucking scared
how does he know this truck doesn t have a good steering wheel that doesn t fly out of his hands while he s driving
don t you know how to fuckin drive
he doesn t know everything driving isn t the only thing
the electric ram knows that he used to be a real piece of shit
and that the steering wheel didn t come off while they were driving
yeah because he can afford one
just don t ask about the tables in the back
i can t know how to hear any more about tables
what s your job
see thats your problem you dont know how to treat the crypt keeper
what is her job
it doesn t matter what job the driver has seriously you don t want to know what the driver does because it s likely they have absolutely no reason to drive such a large vehicle with a bed they ll never get close to utilizing
the response of silence is gold you can see the realization on the hosts face as he decides his only choice is to double down end the call and hope by attempting to demonizing the lumber industry no one will notice how dumb he just looked
that other guy was a real idiot
can t stand these people i don t want to talk to them pretty sure the feeling is mutual you dipshit
i clicked hoping to learn how to grow concrete was both disappointed and not
fun fact concrete production typically involves heating limestone to produce a precursor to cement carbon dioxide is both a direct byproduct of this process and comes from methods used to generate the heat such as burning coal as a result around of the world s carbon dioxide emissions come from the production of concrete
trees are sustainable because we can make more trees ok then concrete is sustainable because we can make more concrete no we can t yes we can
technically you can grow concrete not cement concrete but some other concrete could technically be grown and farmed i mean yea it would take a few millennia but it can be done
well concrete is sourced from natural materials
deleted
he apparently doubled down yet again on another show saying that he meant that concrete expands as it sets
literally all he needed was of humility and say something like sorry i misspoke and he is in the clear but no he doubled down and kept trying to find ways in which he is right after this none of which made sense as a response to this man showing quite clearly he had nothing in mind during this interview
yeah he couldn t even respond when the host check mated him talk about a huge shut down
haha you and me both i was totally prepared to watch a section of sidewalk burble up before my very eyes
be careful this concrete doesn t grow on trees
growing more trees is good for the environment while making more concrete is bad for the environment that s like saying we can make more gasoline if you don t understand the concept of sustainability then that is your own fault https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a39880899/earth-is-running-out-of-sand/
see ya cameron
aka carbon sequestration
it is but you can t grow it back that s what makes it sustainable or not
the sand used for concrete is actually a limited resource and the word is beginning to run out of readily available concrete grade sand
it generates massive amounts of greenhouse gasses and current supplies of aggregate are running thin so they are resorting to destroying many ecological sites to get the necessary aggregate
everything is naturally sourced on this planer we don t pick polyethylene unnaturally elsewhere

curious do you have a source for that
growing sand
so does making electric batteries to put in massive hummers
planet
limited resource and the word is beginning to run out of readily available concrete grade sand https://news.stanford.edu/2022/07/26/four-questions-eric-lambin-sand-shortage/
what does that have to do with concrete and trees
are you the gammon in the video
yes what s your point
hummers can go to home depot and buy stuff
it s like felix colgrave but horror
this looks fantastic
looks like it s just a concept right now very little info on it
reminds me of that one music video of the high school kids swimming in the school gym pool at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qfwo57wkwg)
looks really cool digging the sound design on that as well the character design color scheme looks really ten hundred inspired
supremely surprised to not see felix colgrave in the credits looks very cool
what nightmares are made of can t wait
reminds me a little bit of the men in black cartoon esthetic
akira vibes
looks incredible like a blend of tekkonkinkreet paprika and chainsaw man
music sounds like something from aphex twin
i m very excited for this where can i watch it when does it comes out
the music and visuals look and sound amazing reminds me of little nightmares
damn this was really well made both animation and music design are top notch they also mix eally well together
hope one day they can make the series seems really cool
i face worse every night
yo that guy does amazing work
saw this sentiment in a few comments and was not familiar w colgrave so i just checked out some works i understand the comparison but am so happy this isn t derivative
i came here to ask if it was him the monster face looks so familiar
also sounds fantastic
i think it might just be one guy s work but it looks so good it would be cool for it to get traction and get picked up
me as well at there is a very similar image
well if that ain t the poppiest eldritch shit i ve ever happened across
glad to see someone else seeing the major tk art style resemblance the human characters in particular look so damn similar to the ones in tk
check out felix colgrave i m surprised not to see him in the credits
i think is one guys passion project not sure if there s a whole series
you not
double king is so weird but great
it is not a series at all it is a trailer i did for a potential horror mini serie i would like to create emphasis is mine but yeah he hasn t made it or started it it sounds like need to get people to encourage him to start a kickstarter or something i d fund it if it made it slightly more possible to be made
lol whoops needs an edit
man this kind of put a lump in my throat i ve always considered astronauts some real heroes i was pretty upset when they retired the space shuttle and i m looking forward to our future in space it may be our only hope one day
they will be wearing the same clothes for days you can just imagine the steam and odour that will be released when the hatch is opened after they land
i feel like i m watching for all mankind this is so cool
hello my name is artemis
so exciting i can t wait for more progress
exciting stuff
we better get back to the moon before china does and takes all the good lunar water ice sources
i m excited for mankind to walk on the moon for the first time however i have a bet they ll miss the deadline

you an me both they are in great physical condition super intelligent charismatic and willing to do things that are extremely stressful to the human body and mind for the betterment of all mankind and after all that they are humble closest thing we have to superheroes
related fun fact scott petitt we have supplies on station sufficient to change our underwear perhaps once every to days so i figured there might be a few nutrients in there as well an old pair of underwear was folded into a sphere and held in place with a few well placed stitches using needle and thread from our sewing kit for the outside of the planter he sewed some russian space toilet paper to the outer surface of the underwear after pettit solved a problem that was causing the seeds to stay too cold to germinate the seeds sprouted in the underwear toilet paper planter within days https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/livinginspace/astronaut_laundry.html
they won t be sweating though so what does it matter
i ve heard the smell described as burnt steak
for their sake i hope things go a bit more smoothly for them than most of those missions
they have but not with this mission
trying to globalize space exploration and what better place to start than our neighbors to the north they discussed it
would they don t they exercise to keep their muscles from atrophying i d imagine more than once every days otherwise they don t really exert themselves unless you sweat in the eva suit that doesn t happen too frequently though does it
if you re lucky
why would you there is no gravity which causes muscle exertion in turn causing perspiration astronauts don t just sweat for no reason those four people are in top physical shape they might have some rags and they for sure have genital cleansing cloths and they re only going to be up there for ten days anyhow
you still need to use your muscles in zero gravity you also did not acknowledge what that person said about exercising also you don t sweat because of muscle exertion you sweat because of heat
don t the exercise bikes have resistance
you have a misunderstanding of biology sweat is fundamentally a cooling response water absorbs energy as it changes phase that can be triggered by a multitude of factors including but not limited to physical exertion yes it does require muscles to move in zero g temperature and bunch different mental states not to mention that your skin is a respiratory organ you are constantly absorbing and expelling various gasses and organic molecules through your pores the question is not why would you but why wouldn t you sweat when locked in a capsule with other humans shit is stressful dude i m gonna expel some gasses liquids and solids whether you want to understand it or not
perspiration has little to do with gravity
fair enough
i appreciate your acknowledgement space travel is super fascinating and the environment needed to sustain living humans for multiple days in sealed containers is a huge topic

i thought of this song exactly when seeing the footage today
prince sued them for the sample it was supposed to be replaced by one of them saying tennessee but it got forgotten somewhere along the way
still slaps
what s dionne farris been up to these days she really made this song soar

i love innovative thinkers who are testing out new ideas
that s clutch
this one s definitely about the journey and not the destination he ll go on to invent something so obviously missing and head smacking simple that the world will wonder why the rest of us were so stupid that were missed the obvious decades earlier
watches video oo i bet that disk gets really hot dude pulls out his infrared camera i fucking knew it oo
would it not be possible to add an alternator on the pedal side somehow i m just curious as i watched a video of someone who added an alternator and a battery maybe it d be possible to store some of that excess energy i have no clue as i don t know what i am talking about but i ve seen alternators added on to bicycles and now this
it s not quite as strong as a regular brake as he coasts like feet before stopping lol
i m looking at two gears right now
i can t believe he explains lenz s law without calling it lenz s law
this looks like a fixie with extra steps the idea of touchless braking is cool but good gravy the heat will wear out the parts
i bet it is losing efficiency as the system heats up need to find a way to send heat into the atmosphere efficiently
i see two gears
what about the frictions
what did he just call aluminum
is there a new way of saying aluminum
cool video and creative at first i thought wtf is this then i had to watch the whole thing
i can clearly see a large gear in the thumbnail s
it s nteresting to imagine how there would be strong resistance against your pushing but no feeling of a physical connection i could also imagine how an electronic system that brings magnets toward and apart from the disc could create a frictionless braking system made me wonder if there s an equivalent of wear in which the parts might lose efficacy over time hadn t anticipated how much heat there would be also have zero faith that the plastic sprocket can last longer than it took to film this
he literally says this in the video
he has a bunch of other bike prototyping concept videos i always enjoy seeing them
well in this case the energy is being wasted as heat in the disc if you added an alternator it would steal some of the energy from pedalling before it ever got to the clutch to be very inefficiently converted to torque on the back wheel if you then ran that power to a motor it would move the bike more efficiently than putting the same energy through the clutch but in that case it would be more efficient to just ditch the whole thing and just make the bike one of those pedal generator converter motor bikes i can t remember the proper name of edit if you re talking about a literal alternator like one from a car i ve no clue how efficient they are compared to generators with permanent magnets that clutch might well be more efficient but they do make bikes like i described above and they are efficient enough to be practical so i m drawing from that
yes cyclists sometimes add alternators to their bikes normally to power lights but you could also do a battery just look up bicycle dynamo of course any power generated this way is just added resistance to your pedalling so it wouldn t really be any benefit in terms of efficiency you could make a regenerative braking type system for when you go downhill or want to brake but for the tiny amounts of energy you d gain it would be a large pointless cost to make manufacture install
see the difference between this and other brakes is that those are brakes
i can t believe you are the only person to bring that up this seems like a normal bike with extra complications
watch the video it s a experiment not a product
aluminium
the way it was originally pronounced for years before an american butchered it and the way it s pronounced in most countries except the us and canada
bri ish innit
if you re in the uk there is
if you re in the uk or australia it s spelt aluminium and pronounced that way too
right it s alumunimium ffs get it right
the heat can hurt the magnetic performance
strong resistance against your pushing but no feeling of a physical connection that s called dating
go to any cheap gym and use their exercise bikes they have magnetic resistance just like this and would basically feel exactly the same no connection to anything hard to get a rhythm but if you turn it up tons of resistance that will wear you out quickly
he said it feels like pedeling through sand in the video
magnetic braking is already in use in other applications i work at a gravity driven mountain coaster where the riders control their own speed as they roll downhill on a track part of its safety features is a magnetic brake system to help reduce speed at the speedier sections of track under each sled is a large magnet and running down the middle of the track are fins of aluminum of varying height as the sled moves the aluminum fins pass between the magnet and depending on the height of the fin produce more or less resistance the sleds are attached to the track by a series of wheels so everything maintains proper alignment it s pretty neat
i know
i think you re replying to a joke comment or at least a pedantic one on the other hand i think you might have missed the point of the video this isn t a demonstration of an improved product or something like that it s just a video about bicycle enthusiast doing an experiment inspired by the other videos shown at the start
does the performance come back when they cool i could envision a disc where the outer ring is copper but the core is some more heat stable material maybe with integrated cooking design like fins or drilled holes
i believe one of the braking systems on elevators is magnetic
to be fair i sped through the video at work so there was no sound or captions it s possible that i misinterpreted something but the title says gearless and then the bike has a normal crank arm attached to a gear that pulls a chain attached to another gear the other gear isn t directly driving the wheel but it is there
yes and no it s reversible to a point but beyond a certain temperature it s irreversible but you d have much bigger problems than magnetic performance loss if the rear wheel of your bike was degrees celsius
the bigger problem is it s all wasted energy doesn t really matter if the heat damages the bike if it s a bike nobody would ever want in the first place
yeah if the magnets get hot but for the copper it would be fully reversible right
here s the opening paragraph of his review the purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh and there is a moment in dumb and dumber that made me laugh so loudly i embarrassed myself i just couldn t stop it s the moment involving the kid who gets the parakeet but because i know that the first sentence of this review is likely to be lifted out and reprinted in an ad i hasten to add that i did not laugh as loudly again or very often it s just as well if the whole movie had been as funny as that moment i would have required hospitalization
i love that later on in the movie they go back to this with the news story
the entire scene with the motorcycle cop drinking the bottle of pee made me laugh so hard i wet my pants everything from pull over no it s a cardigan but thanks for noticing to tic tac sir is comedy gold
when harry is pissed that llyod had a second pair of gloves the entire time and starts choking lloyd out only for lloyd to say harry your hands are freezing slays me everytime
that john denver is full of shit man
hey guys oh big gulps huh alright well see ya later
the scene with traded the van for it straight up
the delivery on i took care of it is flawless also note that not only is billy blind he s also apparently in a wheelchair two things that don t inherently go together
the making of short documentary is a fun watch https://youtu.be/t-ipx-xfnsi
i still use the line our pets heads are falling off when i m having a day where everything seems to be going shitty
you ve had this pair of extra gloves this whole time
growing up i always thought the kids name was billy enforcee or something like that wasn t till i was older and watched the credits that i saw the character s name is billy in 4c
the scene where he s at the bar and as he exists notices the framed newspaper from the moon landing and proclaims hey everybody we landed on the moon was all improvised that was just a random prop used on set and cast said it took everything to save the scene and not burst out laughing
the snowball blast to the face had me in tears
kick his ass sea bass
my grandfather didn t care for movies he d watch an old western every great once in a while however the scene where jeff daniels shits his guts out had him red faced and howling wherever ya are pop i hope you have a cold beer and fire to tend to
that snowball fight scene where he nails her in the face from like feet away always kills me
the hardest i ever laughed in a movie was that scene in something about mary where matt dillon is trying to impress cameron diaz by telling her he s an architect but then reveals his true passion
extra gloves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sodxz77-lag) is my favorite scene in the movie just so perfectly executed line by line
it s jim carrey s face as he delivers the harry i took care of it line that does it for me he s almost incredulous that harry would ask him why he would give a kid in a wheelchair a bird with no head
for me it was samsonite
i embarrassed myself watching ace ventura during the scene where he came out of the rhino s ass ive never laughed so hard in my life could not pull it together either that movie was so ridiculous it was hilarious
for me it was the dream sequence he has and fights the chef especially the moment when he does the somersault and makes all the funny noises hardest i ve ever laughed during a movie
holy shit look at the butt on that
according to the map we ve only gone about three inches
she sent me a john deer letter gets me every time
harry you re alive and you re a horrible shot
my embarrassing jim carrey movie theater moment was pet detective when he was in a battle and asked his sidekick for a spear threw the spear but pierced him in his thigh asked him for another spear and got it pierced in his other thigh lol i simply could not get my year old shit together after that scene i was literally crying in the theater long after everyone stopped laughing
hardest roger ebert had laughed and he even said he almostt had to be hospitalized yet he couldn t give it the thumbs up because the movie was sloppy and felt like they rushed to put it together dude tough crowd
for my money the scene in the toilet is much funnier
i m no ebert but the hardest i have ever laughed and was asked to keep it down was for wayne s world that juvenile sense of comedy just hit the right spot for me when wayne s world came out my girlfriend warned me to keep it down remembering the embarrassment from the 1st movie glad to report i did not comply and we re not together anymore
this film has loads of classic lines like what was all that one in a million talk and i desperately want to make love to a schoolboy however there s also a ton of throwaway lines that you notice more on rewatches fell off the jet way again and tell her i m good looking and i have a rapists wit
wow funniest scene he ever saw really
i just recently lost my job and had to put my cat down one of the things that came to mind after i stopped crying was we got no food we got no jobs our pets heads are falling off my humor is only getting darker as i age
i have never had a movie make me laugh so hard in a theater that i slid out of my seat and this one was it it s a stupid movie but man the first time i saw it i was in stitches
i used to think his name was billian forsee
those your skis both of em no lie i used a variant of this line to get laid edit ok it s and the fkn pandemic hits meet girl on tinder invite over to apt i ask for her to take off shoes sorry not sorry my apt has carpet k notice she s apprehensive because she has mismatched socks she tells me she s self conscious so i make fun those your socks her yea me both of em her sploosh edit no homo i love jim carrey grew up on his humor while i was in the orphanage i pray he s doing well since i saw his jim and andy netflix thing his initials are j c just saying p i really hope he make more material
the gibberish scene in bruce almighty https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiew1jclzta) was that for me i had to leave the theater because i couldn t stop laughing
in a bar in my town there is a hall of fame plaque for bar trivia teams the winningest team in history is named harry i took care of it
my favorite comedy of all time the way jeff daniels inflects the b s on bird and blind kid is burned in my brain
this isn t even the funniest scene in the film but which is time to rewatch it for the millionth time and find out
the part that always breaks me is when loyd says we got no food no jobs our pet s heads are falling off
i love the scene when they get stuck in the middle of nowhere and they break up and jim carrey is on the verge of tears and says i guess i forgot that you never ever make a mistake and delivers that line in such a melodramatic way with the climax of the music https://youtu.be/ihzeb7bj9d8
dumb dumber is the best comedy to ever be made and i will die on that hill
this movie is masterpiece of comedy and easily jim carrey s best performance there will never be a time i don t laugh when i watch this movie you ll notice something new in the background everytime you watch it personally one the most quotable movies of all time
ngl i read this way too quickly and read this scene from dumb dumber made film critic roger ebert so hard he embarrassed himself in the cinema
the guy must be a sociopath that s the darkest comedy of the whole movie great movie though
i ve always maintained that dumb and dumber is funnier than it has any right to be
man it s been too long since i last watched dumb dumber we used to watch it all the time when we were kids it still gets quoted all the time in my family
the second funniest part of this movie is towards the end when they re at their destination and a newspaper is briefly shown about the blind kid with the headline reading monster sells blind boy dead parrot or something none of the characters talk about it and the audience is only shown it quickly i laughed hard
my dad took us to see the mask i think and there was a preview for dumb and dumber he was laughing so hard during the preview we thought he was going to need to leave everyone around us saw what was going on and pretty soon our whole section was laughing uncontrollably when we got home we told our mom and she informed us that this also happened on one of their first dates when they went to go see blazing saddles
so you re saying there s a chance still one of my favorite quotes from any movie
lloyd what s wrong harry did a young philly break your heart harry no it was a girl
this was the funniest movie i ever saw until the first borat came out so many one liners and zingers even to this day everytime i see a samsonite suitcase i think of this stupid movie
roger ebert was a national treasure such a great critic because he could love and analyze the oscar bait movies just as easily as he could acknowledge that sometimes you have to shut your brain off and just have a good time at the movies love that man
i feel sad that i didn t even chuckle while watching this clip it just didn t come across as funny
so many better scenes in the movie than this one lol
i saw this in the theater and was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes and couldn t talk probably shouldn t have decided on that movie for a first date
the hardest i ve ever laughed in a theater was watching this is the end when danny mcbride james franco were arguing over mcbride masturbating to franco s magazines i watched it during the afternoon with maybe less than people and had a couple rows behind me i had to stifle my laughter because the scene just kept going on for too long and you could see seth rogen trying to hold it in the entire time
i remember being unusually stoked for a year old that the bear song green jelly was on the soundtrack
i guess you had to be there funniest scene i ve ever watched was the scene in which michael palin s character with a stutter is trying to tell john cleese s barrister where kevin kline has abducted jamie lee curtis in a fish called wanda the ca the ca the ca no hurry
went to dinner with a girl some of the conversation was about movies said she hated dumb and dumber and thought it was stupid never saw her again
i thought i was going to have to call when my mom and aunt were watching this movie together they kept needing to use their inhalers from laughing so hard they were antagonizing their asthma barely breathing at times and cry laughing we still quote it to this day
thanks for this was trying to find something regarding the review instead of the movie quotes haha
which is such a shame because there are so many hilarious scenes in that movie
i m a little confused about why he found this so funny it s amusing but not laugh out loud embarrassingly hilarious
i just thought he was really quiet
https://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sick_people_dumb_dumber.gif
who are these sick people
yeah right before harry obliterates the toilet while shaving
not any news story a current affair
gimme that booze you little pumpkin pie haircutted freak
you fellas been doin some boozin have ya suckin back on grandpa s old cough medicine
i laughed so hard at that scene i thought it broke me the way he twitches after taking a drink still kills me even though i ve seen it dozens of times
killer boots man line from jim did it for me
i forgot how funny harland williams was until his new podcast started popping up on my youtube algorithm hes just extremely silly and always has some sort of whacky bit prepared for the guests like promoting their new autobiography and asking if he can read an excerpt that he liked but then he starts reading something that he wrote and it s slowly gets more insane the guests crack up it s one of the funniest podcasts i ve seen in a long time
same it s also an exemplar as to why the original worked but its sequel and prequel didn t those movies were all dumb all the time the original knew when it would be funnier to make them a little smarter in this scene lloyd was smart enough to know that the rocky mountains would be cold af and it would be a good idea to bring an extra set of gloves but dumb enough not to think that harry might need a pair too that s hilarious showing us harry changing lloyd s diapers like five times over the course of years is not
the delivery of yeah we re in the rockies is my favorite part of that scene
i m only human harry
anytime i go anywhere that isn t as advertised i break out this line if people don t get it i don t need them in my life
i worked for a couple months with a contractor who had a nice blue tooth speaker and his music mix had a lot of john denver every time a jd song came on i uttered this line and every time the contractor felt obligated to defend him i had to continually remind him it s a line from dumb dumber rip jeff
this exact line reminds me so much of my best friends dad during my high school years
that s one of my favorite lines ever
that line was improvised as well
anytime i see people drinking big gulps outside a gas station ill say this line i usually am met with the same stares i just walk away smiling and laughing to my self like a crazy person
welp see you later right
skiis huh they yours both of them ahh cool
that scene was actually improvised and those dudes were randos chillin nearby spectating when i believe the director asked if they wanted to be in the movie or something of the like
harry s butt crack hanging out sitting on the ground in disgust
just when i think you couldn t possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this and totally redeem yourself
days ago we were stopped at a stoplight and a lady on a little bike like that pulled up across from us i turned to my wife and said she can get miles to the gallon on that hog
the real trick of this film is how well all of the other characters are played minus harry and lloyd there s a pretty serious crime caper here just a straight drama watching the two straight faced criminals try and unpack the absolute nonesense that h l is what makes it all so hilarious
probably didn t look both ways before crossing the street
boy they don t make em like they used to
tis a fine barn english but it is no pool
homer is never shearing a wrist watch in this whole scene but at the end there is one on a board
this funny clip is one of my favourite simpsons moments
they sure don t
do heth
looks like he caught it
biggest poor decision was storm chasing in a prius seems like a good choice no power to try and even get away and alternatively no ability to go off road if needed
i imagine it was panicky decisions but he should have never turned down the dirt road in the first place his second turn which lead him right back to the tornado was even dumber
he was extremely lucky turning around at the end was the big mistake there and a prius just insanely bad choices all around
there are bad decisions like dating a stripper and then there is what this moron did
i mean glad he s ok but what an idiot
absolutely fucking mental to go storm chasing in any sedan let alone a prius genuinely people like this are the epitome of darwinism i remember quite a few years back a dude in a chevy cobalt getting himself killed like this
i like how he starts whining like a little bitch when his stupidity finally catches up to him
feckin eejit
it almost seems like he wanted to get hit by the tornado on purpose to get the shot at the end of the video he says i didn t even get it on video i just can t believe someone could be so stupid to head back in the same direction the tornado was coming from
r titlegore
i d really like to see a map of the path of the tornado and his path because damn it seems like the effectiveness of the escape route he chose was close to zero i m forced to wonder if this was an el reno situation in which the tornado moved in a non traditional direction e g southeasterly and the chaser had only planned a traditional escape e g south east and ended up being impacted because he was ill prepared in addition to being ill equipped with a prius
tornados are notoriously poor decision makers was bound to happen eventually
i think he talks too much i would have tried to record wind sounds what would have happened if he had stayed in one place in his original location it looked like there was nothing like a grain silo that might fall on him was there more than one person in the car if so you would have one person drive and one person record the video looked kind of like the driver was recording
tornados are perfect for ice engines what else are they but roaming forced induction
with a traditional car the storm will hear you coming times out of in a prius you keep it nice and slow so the engine doesn t kick on and you can creep up on the tornadoes and catch them unawares
i came here to say this i wouldn t even want to experience rush hour traffic in a prius let alone attempt to chase a storm there s a reason why 4wd trucks exist
the hybrid system allows surprising acceleration the prius does in 1s only slightly slower than most half ton pickups and is even faster than some some sports cars are even going hybrid and getting better acceleration times than ever
yeah the minute he took that first right on to the dirt road he was cooked positioning himself directly in the path of the oncoming tornado it s good to see him openly confessing to his fuck ups and sharing the hard lessons you can learn stormchasing nature gives no fucks about you ever
definitely panic i think at first he want to get out ahead of it and keep getting shots of it coming toward him but it was moving faster than he could on the dirt road in the rain some days i ve seen tornadoes just meander their way along a nice slow 30mph easy to keep distance other days they re racing by at 70mph
well he probably does a lot of driving to get to where the storms are and if you have half a brain cell and a sense of self preservation you don t need to go off road
pretty sure pecos hank drives a rav4 or something which isn t even a true suv and he does fine positioning matters more than anything and knowing what roads are around you matters a lot
the prius is silent if he keeps it under miles per hour he deserves the win
in isn t even spritely
i learned this the hard way i was in an awd minivan in north central oklahoma i was waiting for the storms to come to me when i see a promising cell on the radar i head to get north of it so it can safely pass to my south the storms that hit before the tornado were dumping tons of rain the dirt road is suddenly not dirt at all but pure red clay mud i get stuck quickly jump out to see and i m nearly up to my knees storm is heading for us tow company says they won t leave pavement i say to my buddies we are going to get sloppy and nasty but we re going to get out of this before this tornado gets here i put the smallest guy in the driver seat me and of my friends get to pushing we dig the tires out with the floor mats we rock the thing we put rocks and logs under the tires and we inch our way back the way came any way we can think of and manage to get back on the highway and away from the now rapidly rotating wall cloud pressing down on us
about as fast as most trucks you don t take a sports car into a hail storm gas milage is surprisingly relevant too if you spend a whole day chasing there s a good chance you re driving all across the state trying to get to storms more likely to produce tornadoes
since i was a kid at this time i realized that guy must be the voice actor of vinny from disney s atlantis which had a remarkable cast list by the way
i loved his segments i remember one being about that the church was going to assign dollar values for sins so you could pay off your sins before dying so big things like murder was a million dollars and thievery was grand and there is a sliding scale to money value the punchline was we made masturbation a quarter for each time which should be fine for some of you but a few of you may be having some issues
piece of cake piece of crumb cake
another religious ripoff
a video popped up on my youtube feed recently that reminded me of guido it featured a burger place in chicago that inspired the hamburger cheeseburger diner sketch on classic snl no fries chip turns out that don novello guido was a regular patron there and was inspired to adapt it into a sketch
he s talked to people he s seen the videos he s got this https://youtu.be/o94lscznlmy)
this shark has seen some shit
i think that s the first time i ve ever heard jerry seinfeld cuss
i made it to the mark
when you could really just sit for hours watching attractive people dance
disappointed there s no eric nies
i had the simpsons sing the blues on cd which has this song on it
that is so
i owned the cassette for this
i like it when he says doh
amazing picture quality finally thanks
it wasn t an elementary school roller skating party if this song wasn t requested and played at least times
steve bartman got run out of town for doing the bartman at that baseball game
i liked look at all these idiots
nice i had it on cassett
right that was in the original title but then i looked up the date
they ai upscaled the framerate as well and it s fucking atrocious some of the artwork blends into other pieces of the image in most of the frames it s disgusting
very cool project you are a nice looking man thanks for sharing
imagine spending years doing this shit just for a video that has been done a thousand times
not my project just sharing it takes a lot of dedication to do this every day for years
it s cool no matter how many times it s been done just like a good photo of the moon
the entire interview is a great watch
i saw rush on the permanent waves tour it was a great show
s test for echo for me i was late to the band and worried i d miss my chance to see them so made sure to hit two shows that tour who knew that they would end up touring for another years
that big is a fuckin legend mate
is this supposed to be the most annoying video ever
you must be one precious snowflake to get annoyed so easily dang how you even get around each day being so fragile
hot take but i call this my choice for best edited scene of all time it s so weird rapid unnerving and bizarre great part of a great movie
wanna see helicoptuz
if i m driving and see a helicopter i start acting like this and it really pisses off the uber passengers
this movie came out when i was or i think this was the first scene in a movie that made me go woah i get it now all that other stuff i ve been watching is garbage
what do you mean you flushed it kaaaarennnnn
the most shocking thing about this scene is the doctor giving medical treatment and pills for free
i really like the homage jeremy clarkson did on clarkson s farm you can tell they were fans of these scene https://youtu.be/_1dafhggu_o
to me this is one of the more forgettable scenes in the movie
everytime i hear an airplane flying low
the music choices themselves are a fucking marvel as it surrounds the edits perfectly to tune you into the characters heads scorsese shows henry leaving the house as harry nilsson s jittery narcotic fueled jump into the fire plays after leaving jimmy s the mood switches to mick jagger s memo from turner interesting in he uses the first version that was exclusively jagger being backed by steve winwood and jim capaldi from traffic instead of the stones gives a more slow hard luck vibe since henry cant sell his silencers as henry drives to his next destination that fades into the who s live at leeds version of magic bus as henry jams on the brakes to avoid crashing into a stopped car jump into the fire then returns as henry drives michael home and begins prepping dinner the rolling stones monkey man plays as henry and karen head to her parents house the couple gets the all clear to the opening strains of muddy waters mannish boy a small reprieve as his paranoia slows which quickly transitions to george harrison s what is life introspection through harrison flowing guitars with a quick zoom on henry s face as he takes a hit mannish boy returns feeling good and locked in the hill family eats in silence but when lois protests that she needs her hat the drum break from jump into the fire starts up again trouble brewing and the natives are restless with the song s bass line starting as a cop points a gun at henry and tells him to turn off the car it s all hard throbbing beats from deep cuts of some awesome s rock classics scorsese absolutely nails the crazed paranoia that the habitual cocaine junkie looks feels hears and probably because he was one back in the day talk about self reflection in your film
up there with the dinner long cut one of my favorite movie scene all time
you should work for lyft guy in helicopter probably
henry was wealthy and connected they have a completely different healthcare experience than the average american and it s why they don t want it to change
for pretty much any other movie that would suggest it s not a great scene
i disliked this scene immensely it was anxiety inducing and didn t really match the feeling of the rest of the movie maybe it is supposed to be that way to bring you down the spiral with him and have that same anxiety but it doesn t mean i have to like it
love this movie but when it s notably weaker from when they get hooked on coke
beautiful write up mate also you know the films coming to an end so you can feel he s gonna get busted soon which makes it more tense
the music editing and choices throughout the whole film might be my favourite aspect of goodfellas feels more like a score than a soundtrack
lyft is the refuge of all the scum bags banned from uber
indeed the whole of the scene is an exercise in exquisite detail in motion i mean look at liotta as hill just a fucking mess of a rider on a colombian rollercoaster and nailing every nuance sweating like a pig hair a fucking mess eyes red ringed and darting like crazy coasting on lows and being electrified by a big bump teetering on full blown mania and or a heart attack this was the same guy who was looking dashing in an impeccably tailored sharkskin suit earlier in the story and now is an utter wreck hell he even has the vo showing a unique perspective of him going right at blaming lois for her phone call as some kind of pivot point while simultaneously ignoring all the other shit happening before and during the day to show he was gonna be busted whether he stayed in bed or not yea lois is a right bitch and i could see it as such but you can t even depend on henry s story since he is flying so even his view we are staring at may be hijacked by the coke to make it worse than it was scorsese is a master at flow i still watch goodfellas to this day and am still discovering shit that blows my mind you could do an entire course on his work in this film alone for a film school college course and probably not even scratch the surface
the way the movie regularly skips ahead months if not years at a time the fact that he s narrating a detailed description of a normal day tells you a lot
also known as undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenics with no insight into their disease when someone says i have implants in my body to be remote controlled they are mentally ill it must be awful i feel bad for them
the conversation with the stranger while the dogs shrieked was fucking eerie lol
the illuminati cancelled all the flights to spain
very fascinating how delusional people find each other on the internet and enhance each other s delusions
check out r gangstalking for a wild ride
that is indeed a wild ride holy shit
it s not saying that in response to the scratches it s saying that to get them lol
mine would say come here bird when he was lonely if ignored he d start screaming comeere comeeere comeeeere
this is one of my favorite onions ever the tonation and delivery is so good
in reference to help lmao
how come theonion don t make videos like these anymore the ones from years ago were quite good
i can t think of a single the onion video that hasn t aged like fine wine and i love that there s an entire generation discovering them for the first time as if they re brand new
r gangstalking
i am here filling in for clifford banes who is currently acting as one of donald trump s lawyers
wait i don t get the color red reference is that a thing people believe
if i spent four to six years of my life studying cs to make g9 pay for stalking schizos rambling to themselves i d kill myself haha imagine being in that program day in and day out it s no wonder the nsa don t get service weapons let alone safety scissors
both sides are always looking for a way to harm or discredit the other and they do use proxies which most times have no idea that they are being used to achieve some other goal side plate of corruption anyone you do realize that they are creating the conditions to prove they are right by allowing these poisons to be imported bought and sold in a chemical warfare that targets you destabilizations begins with individuals being targeted and they are going after their mental conditions to not only discredit but to infringe on their lives and rights as well n shadows
i really like this
or just put a personal computer in their pockets that listens to them constantly watches them when used tracks their online activity reads their emails and messages monitors their phone conversations tracks their location with gps recommends news for them in order to better help them sort of like a smartphone
conservatives another word for people who live in fear of everyone who isn t conservative
i love this one my other favorite is the news segment about sony s new stupid piece of shit that doesn t do the goddamn thing it s fucking supposed to
my favorite still has to be the organ donor
in the know was such a great segment https://youtu.be/pwom49awrkg)
budget cuts changes to how youtube distributes revenue undermining the production of this sort of content
they were initially getting money from youtube grants trying to jumpstart the platform and that blossomed into ifc ordering a couple seasons to broadcast that funding spearheaded their ability to make this content then around the onion had a bunch of setbacks their print media division essentially completely collapsed as the world moved online for satire their writers room had accusations of unfair compensation and time crunch ifc canceled the television series and a pivot to amazon fell through when the dust settled from all that and without money coming in from print what was left was a skeleton staff and nowhere near the same kind of budget for video content
beacause this one was too close to the truth and the government closed it down
i d imagine something to do with the ifc they made higher budget content for ifc but after their show died they pretty much stopped making these kind of videos
changes of ownership and the best writers getting better jobs
the world has become more ridiculous than the jokes they can come up with
the absurdity of trump s presidency basically collapsed the onion imo
that is one of the more depressing subs i ve been to those people really need help and instead everyone there is egging them on and making their paranoia worse i m surprised reddit hasn t done something about it considering their general position on mental health awareness
what the fuck
fuck me this internet thing really was a mistake wasn t it
it s because good people like you don t take these jobs that the actual gangstalking positions are filled with power hungry sadists
you fucking signed your comment somehow that s even more inane than your ramblings
haha you re pretending to be someone who doesn t realize this is satire and you re reacting as if this was a genuine piece of news media that s really clever oh wait you re serious backs away slowly
i love the autistic reported segments
i disagree with who
not to mention facebook lied about their video metrics to get everyone to produce video content for the platform then once companies were bought into using facebook they throttled their views fully gutted a lot of local news outlets even more than they had been
i just fell down a dark rabbit hole following the link to that subreddit
there are real cases of gangstalking but by police the most famous example i can think of is the fbi harassing mlk jr https://www.npr.org/2021/01/18/956741992/documentary-exposes-how-the-fbi-tried-to-destroy-mlk-with-wiretaps-blackmail
how would it make someone feel powerful to walk by someone s house or drive around their block or something lol that doesn t make any sense it s literally schizophrenia which is what this video is joking about
yeah the average joe times isn t being gangstalked unless they ve had involvement with a cult a family member in a gang government agency have snitched or other similar things
lol that s pretty much the argument of every schizo on r gangstalking
you ll have to ask the schizophrenics over at r gangstalking who very frequently talk about how their gangstalkers do it for the sense of power and generally get their kicks i m very very aware of what this video is joking about lol
i dunno man people try making themselves feel tough muttering or yelling from a distance all the time humans are cowardly creatures and have a tough time controlling their behavior not a very convincing argument edit you telling me the out of shape pencil pushers at the cia didn t feel tough or powerful when they ran mkultra thinking they were going to shape the world naw man
times way less than that way way less than that the vast majority of cases of stalking are going to be a single person or small group of people that someone has personally pissed off it would only get to true gangstalking if a large organization was behind it paying people and most of the time that would be a huge waste of resources
made a compliant about the police
oh yeah i know i m agreeing that they re all just schizophrenics unfortunately part of that disease is not believing authority figures so they start thinking their therapists are in on it also
yes true and most actual gangstalking cases like the ebay case https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/09/29/former-ebay-executives-given-jail-time-for-cyberstalking-scheme.html are probably just powerful sociopathic assholes not the actual illuminati
oh it s all very sad and i had to stop lurking that sub pretty quick
is this an actual current event i m out of the loop and if so how is anything kid rock is doing making headlines in
here s a link to a picture of kid rock drinking a bud light hanging out with a drag queen at his house in https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/12cx3q7/kid_rock_chilling_with_a_drag_queen_he_invited_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
kid rock is about years late to everything also he s a rich kid
kid rock doesn t care it s performative outrage as a way of virtue signaling to certain groups sadly while we all get bogged down about distracting nonsense like this the class warfare continues the continues to amass wealth and power at your expense
now that nobody cares about him he has to up his appeal to the white trash crowd he tried to pioneer in the late s
it s funny that people can t understand the nuance between ironically dressing up and dressing up because its a deeply rooted belief of yours one is to be ironically funny the other is because of mental and emotional issues
although i see where people are coming from with kid rock it doesn t change the fact that dylan mulvaney or whatever her name is is a grifter trans for one year and now she has all these sponsorships as well as white house spokesman role
the wildest thing about this is the insinuation that guys are better at pool than women as if it s a sport similar to football or hockey which is dominated by men due in large part to them being physical contests
you missed the mark on this one this is making fun of trans people this is an exact model of the right wing fantasyland but on the plus side it s nice to know that the gop is about years behind
based on the right wing garbage responses i see in this thread i gotta say that reddit has really changed
i can already imagine how many people would be triggered in if this came on tv
these people don t even know why they re upset about anything it s just because the tv people radio people and everyone on their social media feeds tells them to be upset at _ _ _ _ and so they are what a life
years ago i listened to kid rock and ted nugent even went to a few shows of theirs now seeing what pieces of shit they are they will never get so much as a dime from me
i for one won t be buying any bud light s with some dude dressed as a little girl on them fuckin weird
lol the irony of this ad this is exactly how womens sports is going right now edit dont pretend its not
why would he be upset over that it s making fun of trans people and trans people in sports it s not making trans people ambassadors of their beer you don t even have a single brain cell do you
damn bud lights been pro trans longer than i thought
if he doesn t like that this is going to melt his tiny mind https://youtu.be/hcosejs1ssy
wait that was kid rock getting upset over bud light i just assumed it was some rich jerk
u savevideobot
totally the same thing can you believe racists are okay with white guys with shoepolish on their faces but not actual black people x200b fucking idiot
mr galewickitz
nah this is more sexist than anything it s just bud trying to say their beer is so good guys will dress up like women to enter tournaments and win free beer
kid rock has been a full on maga gop russia qanon nra cultist for a long time now he can always be counted on to be manipulated into some tacky or hate related right wing stunt this one is driven by the fact bud lite sent a promotional custom can to a transsexual celebrity the cult saw that as their latest opportunity to follow the chreestian teachings they claim to believe in by doing performative stunts of hatred and violence you know just as jesus taught it s kind of a shame he s chosen such a gutless and sde identity rock stars used to be about rocking the boat and empowering counter culture instead he s acting like a hypnotized child who does any self debasing stunt his elderly white establishment controllers tell him to
i think bud light released some new can that celebrates diversity has all that he she them stuff on it rednecks are mad cause they drink that garbage and it was clearly an attack on them from the woke something something something i dont pay too close attention cause the whole thing is stupid fake outrage nonsense
he said joy bearheart is a bitch
yeah saw that earlier it s what reminded me of the commercial
someone called him the human equivalent of an above ground pool in the comments of a yt video a couple years ago and now that s the first thing i think of when i see anything about him
kid rock very much does care he s a useful idiot he s not in on it
whether that s true or not the much more powerful mental illness is being so easily subjected to broadcast senseless hate and violence just because a rich white billionaire s cult blows a whistle and tells you to
https://matchroompool.com/world-rankings/ wait til you hear about chess
losing your alcoholic ass as a customer will surely tank the company while you get tanked on some other shitty american beer hey guy what do bud light s as you call them and sex in a canoe have in common they are both fucking near water if you can t get a life at least try and get some taste you are the saddest cowboys fan you chose their kicker as you username
you are over reacting this is not exactly how women s sports are right now there is definitely major issues with a few instances of this happening though and the people downvoting you are clowns for trying to pretend this isn t an issue at all
yes it s already happened in of women s sports i guess that justifies all the dog whistle hate based panic and threats s
if only sports had governing bodies to handle these issues at the local level no we must use the might of small government tm to crush any possibility of this statistically very rare situation asshat edit i m sorry i said asshat i meant fascist this is fascist rhetoric and i don t want anyone to accidentally mistake that by reading my insult
that is not a pro trans video it s making fun of trans
still true
i see where you re coming from but kid rock is a headline punchline and that s about the end of his relevance why is anything he does for better or for worse something i have to hear about
stupid fake outrage nonsense i m so bored with that shit people need other hobbies or find more creative and positive ways to get attention
he s not straight outta compton he s straight outta daddy s car dealerships
missing the cess
why are you bringing whiteness into this discussion please stop being racist the whiteness of someone s skin does not matter or would you rather i point out every time someone that s black does something instead of saying this man is an idiot should i say this black man is an idiot you re a racist please stop
woah woah woah are you okay man
why do people clutch their pearls about women s sports when most of them have zero interest in even watching women s sports in the first place must be nice having so few problems in your life that this is a big deal for you
what do you mean it s trans athletes whoopin women in a women s sport league classic
trans people can do whatever they want do you think trans people shouldn t be able to have a mustache bud light has been woke longer than you ve been alive now go buy a pack of beer you bigot
apparently we want to dig him up just long enough to cancel him but i m onboard with just ignoring him
on the right it s because of their incessant dog whistling on the left it s a misguided urge to constantly show how overly fair and open minded they can be to find a potential speck of silver in a mountain of manure resulting in self destructive both sides are the same mythology
does he even know anything about being country
the clueless irony of you calling other people racist i m shocked that your post history is packed with maga disinfo and conspiracy hoaxes s
nobody likes you
so you ve never watched read a story about something you weren t really into and formed an opinion on it i don t believe you actually believe what your saying as much as you are saying it because you think it aligns with the stance you re supposed to have
when you re a fascist but you just think you re edgy
everyone hates whiny lil losers like y all lmao
coming from the person who s hating on women s sports your words hold no weight
bruh you re a loser who hangs out on bpt lol your hatred flatters me
i hang out in a community for black ppl that welcomes all ppl you re hating on women s sports are you okay
idgaf about any sports y all get triggered over pronouns don t worry about me buddy i m doing great
you sure about that you brought them up unprovoked
i think the third episode took an unexpected turn the cg is still on point but a very different vibe
i m so confused as to whether i m supposed to want to see this movie or not also this is now the official trailer in my mind well done
so how old is senior
yes it s such a colossal missed opportunity they haven t licensed this song for this movie and featured it heavily in their promotion they basically should have made the exact trailer you did as it would have capitalized on a huge amount of 90s nostalgia
i mean mattel hates aqua and aqua hates mattel sooooooo i don t think we re going to see the song in the movie
senior editor sounds like the title they give you when they don t want to pay for the raise ex avid editor here
this is sooooooo good
ryan gosling has no ken face he looks very weird like this
this is perfect
better much better music selection you even removed all the innuendo from the song a really
i love how ken waves off the other ken cute
if they don t get this song in the movie it will be a huge missed opportunity it is a win win since that band is not making much money now and the song is perfect for the movie
you should join us on r editors
you could have told me that s the official trailer and i wouldn t have blinked
wait there is a real life barbie movie coming out and non of the women spending tenthousands of dollars in cosmetic surgery only to look like barbie got the role shocking
mike pence is ken
this trailer made me so excited lol
rarely do we see such perfection
this had to be done
it s a huge disappointment that they won t ever officially use that song
low key this movie could actually be hilarious if they fully commit to the satire angle
well done kudos
amazing
you crushed it amazing and perfect if this were the movie i d see it
how it was always meant to be
amazing
if i was granted one wish where i could erase anything out of existence it would be this godawful song
this makes me want to watch the movie excellent work
way better than the original trailer
who s the audience for this it looks like it could be funny because they aren t showing the best parts in the trailer or it s simplistic and horrible
what does being a senior editor have to do with anything lol makes it sound like you re looking for work you could be i guess
had no interest in this film prior to this trailer right here it looks stupid funnny they end up in the real world will ferrell out of nowhere yeah i ll see this film maybe not in the theater but its now in my to watch list
i ve already bought tickets to see this movie but this trailer made me buy more
good grief the marketing department is pushing the hell out of this turd it s flooding reddit
try this one next https://youtu.be/wgufvmay0lw
i think we are nearing the exhaustion of western culture
deleted
why would you add the song but cut the hi barbie hi ken that kicks off the official trailer and is an homage to the song
senior video editor does that mean you re over
great job
https://youtu.be/3mbbbfh9fag
would of been so much better if that song was in the trailers movies
this is so good but you missed the only thing that completely made the original trailer michael cera
you mean they don t use this track for the movie how am i going to avoid it then
still don t want to see it
i was going to go watch it i still am but also i m definitely going to go watch this
they work for free
i m an ultra mega senior commentator and i m not sure why i d state that part on the easiest edit job of my life
this thread paid for by mattel looks at all these fake shits
now thats what i m talking about dude i can understand studios not wanting to use that aqua song in the trailer for a myriad of reasons but god damn we the people need it yours is the official un official trailer for this i ve been real interested in seeing it regardless of the trailers just the juxtaposition of knowing how particular mattel can be versus the talent making this gerta gerwig like yeah bring it on
yeah great job it s crazy that i kinda want to see this movie it looks like an acid trip
pretty good but what was the reason for editing out one of the best jokes in the original trailer where she takes off her high heeled shoes to show that her feet are just always shaped like that
that s really the only appropriate song
that song is never not fun
i have a feeling this is going to be a cult film in years
either this movie will be amazing as seen through the eyes of a kid or absolutely terrible i tried my best to channel that with a pg version of aquas barbie girl
simu said it has one the the best script he has ever read he said this may of given the director and casts i would assume it will be super good
starring oscar nominees margot robbie and ryan gosling directed by oscar nominee gerta gerwig and written by oscar nominees gerwig and noah baumbach with cinematography by oscar nominee rodrigo preito and music by oscar winner alexandre desplat there is a hodgepodge of talent behind this movie i m going to see it opening weekend for sure
yeah i have no idea who this movie is for is it for adults kids is it serious is it satire
it s greta gerwig why not
i have not seen the official trailer but am now hyped for this movie
you want to see this movie if not for margot robbie but definitely for ryan gosling
the answer would be a resounding no but they cast margot robbie as barbie which makes it more tempting
nothing on this planet makes me want to see this movie that said op s version made this abomination seem a little better
i just can t help but sense some sinister undertone to the whole thing i think it s going to be interesting either way
it s going to be a toys go to the real world and grapple with the fucked up subtext of what they are both literally as toys and also as symbols in the context of various injustices that exist how the movie actually provides a plot for that and what they do with it could be interesting in conjunction with what looks to be a completely straight playing of barbie tropes and the fact that they re toys
knows to not use a sec cross dissolve transition between every scene
google tells me it also says it s a retires citizen or i think google doesn t know but op must be over
years in field
i d guess late 30s https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewhytt/
senior is a rank not an age bracket
that s what i was thinking too i made sure to remove any of the suggestive lyrics to keep it pg for a wider audience and keep the nostalgia alive
the people behind barbie reportedly hate the song and don t want it associated with their products
i m a barbie girl switches to epic movie announcer voice in a barbie world
there s no need to license it they ll make some edgy remixed cover version slowed down and recorded by lana del rey that will play in the opening credits or a pivotal moment in the movie to catch your attention mark my words
mattel tried to sue aqua for their song so there s bad blood between them
it s because mattel absolutely hates the aqua song
i hear what you re saying but that feels a little too on the nose for my taste
why missed opportunity x200b why pay the licensing fee when you can let some random joe no offense op make it themselves and upload it and have it go viral
i don t think it s a missed opportunity at all i think the internet only knows one thing about barbie and can t think beyond that it s why reddit is plagued with the same jokes over and over again the trailer is getting millions of views per day
it would have been too predictable
mattel used the music in commercials
former senior producer for a production company here laughing my ass off at how true this is
it s true but being self employed changes that dynamic of being underpaid as an editor
yeah weird flex imo particularly in this context but
thank you i appreciate it
he looks like stewart https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.5kaqswuiuzjvzqhd3ffrg--/yxbwawq9aglnagxhbmrlcjt3pty0mdtoptm2ma--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/best_life_342/9e28216b222e1c7ec319e6aa7780e404) from madtv
that s the idea though margie robbie is similarly no barbie making two unique and attractive people look as plastic and generic as possible puts it into uncanny valley territory adding to the unsettling surrealism of things it s like a hint of david lynch
thank you
thanks for noticing the little details i used ai to isolate the vocal tracks from the original trailer and synced the instrumental version of aquas barbie girl for dialogue sequences i used only the pg version of the vocals to make the trailer acceptable for audience and please the mattel corporate overlords
i will thanks for the suggestion
thank you that means a lot
incoming deepfakes
woooooooooooooo
haha that means a lot thank you
thanks warlizard
i felt the same way when i was first attempting to edit in the song i was like this just works lol
i m glad you enjoyed it
thanks
fans of greta gerwig works women men who grow up with barbie family with daughter s people who are tired of blockbuster movies people who just want to see it for the meme men women thirsty for ryan gosling and simu liu
definitely not looking for work just wanted to give some context as to who i am
idk bro this aint it
lol what a legend paul was
ironically the lady trying to get mindy to say mom ends up becoming the voice actress for mom in futurama i guess after years she lost her patience
animaniacs had a reboot series with the original voice actors pinky the brain included
for years any time my gps has given me directions i give it a nice okay lady in response but for the life of me i could not remember where i had picked that up from glad to finally know
forgotten by who this was standard kids viewing mid 90s itv had it in the uk iirc
forgotten how dare you sir brain doing orson welles frozen peas bit is my favorite and an absolute classic you have to know the reference i guess but that s true of so much of the animaniacs
nobody knows what i reference when i say water go down the hoooole either i know that was tiny tunes but still
it wasn t a saturday morning cartoon it was part of the fox and wb kids after school block of animated programming that included tiny toons and batman a new version with mostly the same voice actors came out and has been running since the 3rd and final season of that came out this year me and my grown kids can still recite all the state capitals thanks to animaniacs
mommy has to go to a better parenting conference leaves baby tied to a tree gold

i was watching terminalmontage latest video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7pjruyr9s) and at https://youtu.be/jr7pjruyr9s?t=228) he uses the okay i love you bye bye clip and i just couldn t remember where that clip was from
my cousin had a vhs tape of this when we were kids used to watch it all the time one day though it cut out half way through because my uncle taped over it with the rocky horror picture show led to an interesting morning for a bunch of and year old
helllllooo nurse
wheel of morality turn turn turn tell us the lesson we should learn
mostly forgotten cartoons don t get reboots and a thousand emmys
i still call my mom lady
i used to say this to my mom as a kid because i loved that damn cartoon and i still use okay baby i love you buh bye to my husband as a joke
i miss the old animaniacs mindy and buttons slappy squirrel dr scratchnsniff and helloooooo nurse the reboot really sucked
going to be inside admiring my conch shell https://youtu.be/xzpzxn-c5tm?t=183)
i m having the hardest time finding clips of katy kaboom the teenage girl who would explode at the drop of a hat
i m glad this came up on the internet because i quote mindy a lot and funny enough i always thought it was a little boy and i always quoted it as okay pretty lady i love you bubhbye i also remember the one animanianc movie where they were all chasing the shooting star to wish in and mindy wished to say mom just the one time
mindy from aniamaniacs this seems to be a mostly forgotten saturday morning cartoon well it wasn t a saturday morning cartoon it was part of fox s after school block and i m honestly not quite sure what i d call animaniacs https://animaniacs.fandom.com/wiki/main_page), really it was like some kind of variety show or something tons of different characters and bits that might only show up once might re occur a few dozen times or might even get their own spin off show thinking of the buttons and mindy https://animaniacs.fandom.com/wiki/buttons_and_mindy) segments specifically it looks like there were only of those the rest of mindy s appearances would ve just been cameos or bit parts in other segments she certainly wasn t a main or even supporting character i mean i liked animaniacs it was one of my favorite shows as a kid and i do get the reference but i guess i m not surprised that more folks don t get a reference to a character that had maybe two hours of airtime spread across episodes of a cartoon from years ago
interesting i could ve read that line and heard those exact words in my head as if they were playing on my tv right now yet in no way would ve been able to tell you it was from animaniacs childhood memories are weird like that i guess
i use it all the time similar blank looks also hello mr man whatcha doing why why ok i love you buhbye
i used to love the animaniacs game on sega genesis when i was a kid played that and bubsy religiously when it s all i had well besides ecco but that got old after a while
hello nurse
every time i leave my mums house lol
i ve stopped making that reference back in the s it s an old favorite but it still checks out
one of our songs for worship reminds me of the anvilania song every time
r 90s_kid
i say okay lady to my wife all the time when the kids just straight up ignore what we say lol
i m going to be inside admiring my conch shell no way i would have caught that as a kid
haha i say this to my wife all the time when she leaves
silly puppy
core memory unlocked
not your ellelator my ellelator i love you space lady bye bye
my sister and i say that to each other all the time
katy kaboom is more obscure
goodnight everybody
still remember a ton of jokes from that show my favourite being this one https://imgur.com/a/pvqixto totally went over my head as a kid
i ve been trying to figure out why this line is in my brain for years
truly an amazing show
maybe because animaniacs was not a saturday morning cartoon it was a weekday after school cartoon
because of this i end all of my phone calls with okay i love you buh bye no matter who it is family friends telemarkers scammers etc
my brother and i used to say this to each other every time we parted company ugh right in the feels
ellalator go down the hole
my wife s name is mindy and when we first met she was living alone in a new city so she got a rescue dog for some comfort and security the dog s name was lady she never saw animaniacs so the irony was lost on her we had to put lady down last august just shy of her 17th birthday so when mindy says ok lady i love you buh bye it literally brings a tear to my eye i grew up with this show it s hard to believe that the catchphrase brings sweet sadness now
the real ones remember okay i love you buh bye
it wasn t a saturday morning cartoon
i feel your pain for many a year i used to tell the max joke and no one would get it then one day i told it to a large group of my classmates and finally one person laughed because they got the reference ever since then i ve never felt the need to tell the joke anymore
i grew up in the 90s and all my friends still remember animaniacs it was a staple
way ahead of their time genius
helloooooo nurse
good idea bad idea love that shit
mainly forgotten and by that you mean legendary right
ugh but there was always the one kid who would tell everybody about the things i did live your own life you blue hatted weirdo
i shortened it when i was a kid but i still say k love ya buhbye used to say it to my mom and now my wife lol
i remember this buhbye
i love to end phone conversations this way
if you said okay lady i love you buhbye in a cute little sing song voice i would probably have recognized it from somewhere but probably would not have been able to recall that it was animaniacs i did see that show sometimes but it wasn t in my core show list
i still say this i get weird looks
my daughters and i quote animaniacs all the time the best cartoon ever
nostalgia activated
i get it
lol we would totally be friends you d only get the words ok lady i love you out of your mouth and i would totes interject and go buhbye this show was is a gem i actually need to go online now and find some good tshirts for it that only a handful of people will appreciate and understand
buttons silly puppy
i always call my mom lady and now i m wondering if my child mind stole this bit
love mindy poor buttons
hellloooo nurse
this unlocked some really deep memories thanks for the nostalgia post
i used to say this to my ex all the time
call me mom
this is why i end phone calls from coworkers as okay i love you bye followed by immediately hanging up before they realize what i said i m pretty sure nobody has gotten the reference but that won t stop me
i think about this cartoon all the damn time i would ve gotten your reference
i always loved the mindy skits
animaniacs was a syndicated _weekday_ cartoon that was an also ran on saturdays as a rerun same for batman the animated series the 1980s and 1990s featured over years of independent stations broadcasting cartoons from 5am 9am and 30pm 5pm mon fri many became fox cw wb upn and even big affiliates saturday morning cartoons are even older and were primarily but not exclusively the big abc cbs nbc later all wb cw airing dedicated specific cartoons from 6am noon each saturday unless interrupted by sports
mostly forgotten cartoon that got revived in due to popular demand
mandela effect i could have sworn she called buttons mom at one point
my sister and i still use the luv you buh bye line with each other more than years later
wasn t saturday morning for us that i remember it s was evening or late afternoon
i always say that to my wife
just cause people don t memorize every line for decades doesn t mean they forgot the entire show existed
shit that lives rent free in your head
wasn t her dog named buttons when i was much much younger my friends from school who were also avid watchers of animaniacs named their dog buttons after the show but in my older years i swear it was mindy s dog
honestly i can t remember a single thing about this show except the intro song which just popped into my head when seeing the word animaniacs
why
i say that to my wife all the time animaniacs was the best cartoon in years
i say this all the time and nobody seems to get the reference either
i definitely haven t thought of this in many years thanks for reawakening a long dormant memory
core memory unlocked
thanks for reminding me that this exists
i cant remember does mindy ever say mom
el la la vator go down the hole
freaking loved animaniacs as a kid would probably still appreciate it as an adult too
my wife and i say all the time you no push button i push button
i quite recently learned that this song is a cover of an sr song i always believed that bfs had made it here is the original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sy8ulwexfy)

if that 70s show released today it would be set in
it feels like the years between the mid 80s and the mid 00s was a lot more of a radical change than the mid 00s to now
with no cgi
this man is now charles entertainment cheese and that scares me
god i miss
i have a theory francis fukuyama s end of history didn t happen but culturally it did we hit some sort of plateau where things are changing way more slowly i was watching arrested development yesterday it s going to be years old this november it doesn t seem dated at all besides no one having smart phones compare with way way way different you can t confuse a tv show with a tv show it s why there are no 90s nostalgia programs we re still in the late 90s early 2000s we never left you could never do the wonder years today because is too much like now
he sings about this fact in their newest album it s a decent song https://youtu.be/6enmix39ox0 the album itself has a few songs about them getting old and some comedy songs still i wanna be brad pitt https://youtu.be/lad5ss9_kqe i found killing them with kindness https://youtu.be/ni2t581pyt0 and getting old sucks but everybody s doing it to be a little funny https://youtu.be/n4e_izfwtfm
it was a cover song too originally by sr they had that song right now she clings to me like cellophane fake plastic submarine
i love the way they parody robert palmer s addicted to love video https://youtu.be/-t6lsvbifoa)
don t spend your life reminiscing enjoy the present this song has a clear message
i feel personally attacked by this post
so who s going to come out with a song called
very honest question to those who care to answer do you ever just feel like personally you re still young like i still talk to all the people from college almost daily it s like our personalities didn t change and that was years ago i graduated i m much different than high school but i still laugh and have fun just like i did before when i grew up all the parents around me were depressed and made adulthood look seem like the worst thing ever but i m enjoying life nostalgia like this just makes me really think sometimes
reminiscing the old song about reminiscing the old song
motley crue isn t even considered classic rock anymore it may as well have been played by the greeks at the pantheon

i like the robert palmer redo
ran into these guys while in line for superman ride of steel at six flags darien lake when i was like it was the summer of or and they must have been playing a show at the concert venue on site as soon as a saw the big dude i knew it was them
but don t forget their biggest contribution the theme song to phineas and ferb
bob seger sang about old time rock and roll years ago the music he was singing about was only around to years old at that time
the first time i heard this song it made me cry it just hit too close to home aside from being a man in my late 40s not a woman the song may as well have been about me
thanks for reminding me how fucking old i am
if summer of was written today it d be called summer of
they did an up to date version of girl all the bad guys want on a bbc live lounge a couple years back and it slapped
that reminds of the time years ago in when the smashing pumpkins released a song called that romanticized a time period years earlier
shut the fuck up
i had to afk and share an existential crisis with my flatmate after reading this title
can y all believe years ago was years ago
and it still sucks
r barbarawalters4scale
saw these guy play at a bar in tyler tx before they became big and never understood how they got so popular
where is the fat guy today
they didn t come out with it
all this pop punk crap is garbage smelly shitty garbage
they were shite their music was shite their fans were shite and op is shite for having posted this
i used to play scrabble online with their gutarist great guy
so i used to work for a concert promoter booker and we had hundreds of acts come through and play a venue hands down these were some of the nicest people we worked with the whole team was just really chill and good people i liked their songs good enough but that night the crowd was thin at the club and they were just really chill and fun to be around before during and after hours
i can t remember half the stuff i need to know for my job but seeing this image the whole chorus to this song has been saved in my brain and i started singing it no googling the lyrics
if the cards are driving you nuts at the end of the video inspect the page elements search for this ytp ce element then right click each element and select hide element
haha holy shit
they should release a song called
here is a parody version called where lyrics have been replaced to fit era https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvycsbjo8za
yea i was when this came out and the 80s felt like a long time ago that was so different from the 2000s weirdly besides the tech and a few other things doesn t feel like it was a radically different time from everyone was pissed at each other back then too i m nostalgic for being young but not for the era it s just like it is now just our computers we re worse and we didn t have social media which was nice
no it s not because i m order for that to be right then i have to be almost ah damn
ouch the suvs are black now
rocking track
anyone remember the brickfilm set to this song no just me
well i wanna die
i hate time
i graduated in and let me tell you this song hits completely different now than it did back then
weird how bowling for soup never became classic rock still hear kickstart my heart or girls girls girls in regular rotation on classic rock radio you might get lucky to hear this song once in a while on bob fm
i heard that norfolk is using one of their song now mainly for the lyrics there is nothing wrong with ohio ohio https://youtu.be/wbwngg8cclc?t=12s)
hey can you fucking not
i don t know what i m more annoyed about that the song came out in or that was years ago please stop the world i want to get off
i was just thinking about this song yesterday maybe it s time to make
you been waiting years to post this
need a song that s the american idiot summer if i remember correctly i graduated high school and saw green day live in concert for the first live gig i had been to but unlike gen x we aren t married with children we i are over educated and unemployed underemployed
fun fact so did the manic street preachers
i have a batch of bowling for soup posters
love the music video nods in this addicted to love for example has become so iconic that it s unmistakable
when did they start playing outkast on oldies stations
the sr lead singer is the guy walking by at in the bowling for soup video that gives them the disgusted look pretty funny lol if you have no idea who sr is you have probably heard this song https://youtu.be/atbacezjfja) if you were born before
stacy s mom by fountains of wayne is was often misattributed to bfs because of that bfs made a cover in as a reaction to fans thinking they made the song
god damn i used to love sr back in the day right now was so good
i learned that here about a year ago prefer the sr version because i prefer she knows all the classics she knows every line breakfast club pretty in pink fast times at ridgemont high over bfs breakfast club pretty in pink even st elmos fire
basically exactly the same song hope they got good royalties from bfs
while we re at it set your goals basically paid homage to that song with their own one product of the s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bnf\_8zwyk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bnf_8zwyk4)
i always thought the sr version was a cover this is a great dinner party fact
that whole sr album is fun the hidden track is one of my favorite guilty pleasure songs
the sr song is from just a couple months earlier than the bfs one and the lead singer of sr if i recall correctly does backing vocals for the bfs version
i think the cover version first to eleven did is the best version https://youtu.be/keesedwxpnu
whhhat it took me years to realize torn by natalie imbruglia is a cover mind blown
i prefer sr much more pop punk and if you re going that way dialing up the pop is cheesy but so so good
and itunes sold you mp3s ackchyually https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png), itunes sold you drm d aacs they never sold mp3s
glorious
yes somebody please pick up those lyrics and give us an updated version
they did that it s that s 90s show and it s on netflix
no shut up t t
why would you say this
i think it s because we are kinda stagnant on our technological advancements computers and smart phones have changed very little in what they have revolutionized now the next years though are going to be magical with ai as long as we can avoid ww3
smart phones and the internet changed every facet of life
as a millennial born in the late 80s i both hate and love how much this sub caters to my nostalgia
im gonna try again make phil proud
ya i wanted a hit post man wtf
ah yes the mouse who ended covid with music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zajnffzpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zajnffzpack)
same i was in 10th grade my band played in front of our high school and that was the year i went from a nobody with friend to pretty popular crazy how one night changed the trajectory of my life such that out of high school i gained friends that i still see regularly almost years later
was a great year for emo punk music gaming
it s not that things haven t changed it s that so little settles in as culturally impactful nowadays you re viewing history retrospectively which gives you the benefit of remembering the most significant events within a time frame take away significant and you re left with a couple decades where the only thing that changes is the rate at which things are changing
this makes sense i had something similar in mind but i couldn t help believe that it was just cope because us 90s kids are getting older i know most people are clammoring for a new gta game but after replaying the first few hours of the game i don t think much has changed from to make it feel completely different
from a fashion perspective this kind of makes sense one of the major things that differentiates the decades are what people were wearing fabric was going through technological changes as well as people learned how to manipulate plastics and create new materials a lot of insane fashion trends come from new technologies in materials all the simple plastic and early polyester in the 60s and 70s spandex and latex in the 80s by the 90s things are just improving so the crazy distinctive trends of previous decades are less distinctive i feel like most things have been this way we get slight improvements on everything over time but there s nothing outright new and no significant innovations on existing technologies that completely change how we use them
people for some reason expect things to follow polynomial or even exponential paths but reality much much more often follows a sigmoid moore s law is a perfect example it was stated as transistor density not computing power doubling in every shorter spans of time but transistor density has basically peaked and the exponential has become the sigmoid there s no reason culture couldn t be the same
we hit some sort of plateau where things are changing way more slowly here s a video of the band the descendents playing a show in https://youtu.be/cqr-sqcflkm the descendents are a punk band that started in the underground punk scene in the early 80s they re pretty much the reason why pop punk emo and nerd culture exists op s track is very generic commercialized pop punk talking about the very commercialized pop era between when grunge went mainstream with nirvana here s dave grohl talking about the descendents https://youtu.be/8r7hkpuvf00 corporations aren t creative they re businessmen who steal culture from outsider cultures then resell it to the mass consumer public https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recuperation_(politics) there s a cultural stagnation because years ago the corporate giants stole organic youth culture and wiped out the communities these kids thrived in where they could innovate and make stuff on their own real emo was just melodic punk rock there was no fashion style no one was depressed or cut themselves the fabricated image was created to sell accessories to young people with self esteem issues the real punk scene supported each other and you didn t need to buy shit this is what real emo was like https://youtu.be/8mthajzrpgo since the 90s corporate influence took over indie youth culture including all the places where kids hang out since no one is really making anything unique there hasn t been new trends to rip off instead they just recirculate trends from the 60s to 90s and give them a little flip here and there to make it seem new
mark fisher talks about this in the slow cancellation of the future
i was thinking the same thing but we have supercomputers in our pockets work many jobs from home electric cars are everywhere tiktok bs and everything costs a ton though the fashion music and other cultural norms are similar to the 2000s today would look very different to someone walking down the street
just saw this oops yeah love that song i just found out he passed away in i am getting old
what
that s a good one
wanna box for your leftovers i e punch punch
i guess i m not awake enough to watch stupid internet videos i wooshed pretty hard on that

is this another ai narrator
uninstalled
too bad it s not the original version with van halen s beautiful girls https://vimeo.com/169759649) playing
i remember my mind being blown when i first saw this fake ad live years ago the same year i became old enough to legally drink beer it was absolutely hilarious and amazing this was years before there were any tv shows starring gay characters and where most tv storylines about gay characters if they had them at all were about depressing subjects such as coming out problems discrimination and or hiv aids any depiction of same sex physical affection such as an on screen kiss was considered adult content and not mainstream to have a whole pool full of hot actors including two major comic stars joyfully and fairly faithfully in the context of a beer ad depicting a fun gay pool party was a sharp departure from the timid steps other tv shows had taken up to that point it was also great social commentary https://psyne.co/schmitts-gay/) cutting to the bone of how normalized selling sex was if the sex being sold was women but how ridiculous it would be if men were sold in the same way i had only come out of the closet to friends and family a few months before it came out seeing this joke ad made me feel so much more comfortable that i could just have fun with my identity instead of having to manage it i m so grateful to sandler and farley for this important cultural gift
bud lights newest ad
look out for kid rock
when you re thirsty and you re gay
the van halen music made it 100times better that beginning riff while bass line answers then kicks of with great beat with and dave s singing great build up
now this guy https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/12ckbsw/dude_triggered_over_bud_lights_support_of_blm_and/) is going to have to throw out all his schmitt s gay
this was the best era of snl
life imitates art
the context here is that the plot to a lot of beer commercials at the time this came out was hetero young guys and t a when this aired everyone immediately saw the humor in juxtaposing the standard uniform hetero imagery with gay imagery
i love this add so much hahaha when the marketing was class
always appreciate the reminder of this unbelievably genius sketch
imagine if a beer company actually tried this it would be so ridiculous
is that steve carell at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcosejs1ssy&t=81s)?
and what was once a joke is made reality lmao
so i guess snl was always not funny
ah the s see the punchline is homosexuals that s it that s the whole bit see it s funny because they are men who like men otherwise this is basically just a regular beer advert if they did this bit as m f combo it s not outrageous enough to be funny it d have to be sexy girl washing car while both in pool absurdities to really turn it into a joke if it was m f then it would be making more fun of beer adverts than anything else if you swapped gender roles you might get a bit of a s laugh because ha ha men being sexy for women is weird otherwise this is just a beer advert for gays laugh track
same as this https://youtu.be/gyy15jkkg2a)
amen came here for this in high school mid s we ironically self deprecatingly made beautiful girls our intro music whenever we d pull into a parking lot because nothing says i m cool and here to party like beautiful girls
why was it changed did vh sue
an absolute travesty
that s amazing hahahaha
https://vimeo.com/169759649 is here original
hahaha awesome comment there s a few songs that as soon as i hear them i begin to laugh based on being featured in an snl skit this is one of them also working for the weekend by loverboy comes to mind barney when it comes down to it adrian s body is just much much better than yours
thats the whole point
i was like and in nebraska so i was naturally not yet much of an ally to lgbtq folks yet it wasn t real hate so much as the default setting for straight midwestern boys in the 80s movies and tv said that gays were the butt of jokes and you didn t know any so far as you knew so i guess that was that this obviously incredible commercial struck me at the time since the expected punchlines never arrived this skit treated gays like they were people that s not funny is it but the skit itself is funny but not at their expense huh it sounds quaint in i imagine but this thing had a huge effect on breaking the ice of at least one generation questioning why we didn t like or really to be honest if we didn t like gay people
exactly why i opened the comments i was hoping someone in your position had chimed in thanks for sharing it really is fascinating belongs in a queer culture museum
thanks for sharing
i saw that that lifted truck and was like oh well of course
it s funny remembering how everyone talked about how horrible it was at that time and how much better the classic snl eps from the 70s were it s a show that s only good in retrospect
not enough hair
are you upset
i posted this because there s currently an absurd amount of conservatives up in arms over budweiser announcing that they support lgbqt rights again and in you have two of the world s most famous people writing out and acting in a commercial lambasting the idea that gay people might need a special beer to drink as if they re not the same as other human beings with lives and feelings our current culture is insane and you re part of the problem not seeing the poignancy in this snl skit from years ago
yeah it s almost as if the s were a different time than it is currently now here in
yeah i get that it was a different time and it could have been funny then but just aged super poorly comedy in the 70s to 90s was filled with shit like this even monty python wasn t completely above it sometimes
i appreciate you explaining this by the end of the vid while i was surprised to see those two playing it straight so to speak in a totally gay ad in the 90s but i didn t really get what the joke was supposed to be to justify it being on snl i guess the whole joke was essentially that it s a normal beer ad but totally gay you guys what a fucking weak era of humor
and yet coke outsold pepsi in this sample
removed
probably too expensive to justify paying in syndication it happens a lot as i learned from the recent post on r videos about the drew carey show since all the popular music it featured made it difficult to syndicate
thanks but i already linked that in my original comment
i feel embarrassed being from a generation that used gay and or fag as a pejorative to teens being gay was still something people should be ashamed of when we were the ones who should have been shamed especially now that i know that some of my good friends came out of the closet eventually how hard must it have been for them this is why i m such an ally of the lgbtqi community now i can look back and see what is going to be the right and wrong side of history any time you make fun of or restrict the happiness of others you re in the wrong it s really just that easy
the best era of snl was the one when you were
it s funny cause this is making fun of commercials that at the time were so overly macho that they look like gaybaiting today it s really funny how everyone used to pretend to be straight to the point of being homoerotic
i agree it can be difficult to imagine how groundbreaking this ad was years ago strange as it may seem no tv show had ever put such production values into depicting gay men having fun at a pool party before seriously or not if you compare this skit to previous uses of homosexuality in tv humor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwk30kngeo) you can see how while it did absolutely take advantage of the shock value it also went deeper to force viewers to question how we were valuing both women and gay men in our society and commerce it was around this time that real beer companies were experimenting with openly sponsoring gay venues and gay causes even while their owners were spending money on anti gay causes https://publicseminar.org/essays/taking-on-the-coors-brewing-company-and-the-conservative-family-behind-it/). breaking social taboos in this fake ad helped accelerate the ability to break them in real life
yeah it also held a mirror up at the bizarre heteronormative beer ads of the time
and in you have two of the world s most famous people writing out and acting in a commercial lambasting the idea that gay people might need a special beer to drink as if they re not the same as other human beings with lives and feelings in they were not that lgbt friendly it would be another years before ellen comes out on her show which was quickly cancelled the joke is that they are homosexuals the first laugh is that men come out of the water there is no beer at that point the second laugh is men s bulges and butts in bikini bottoms moments after the beer is revealed the beer shot didn t get a direct laugh go look for yourself if you d like after that it gets a continuous low chuckle applause that is hard to tie to any specific scene the beer tagline at the end got applause not laughs because the skit was wrapping up all snl skits end with that behavior so it s hard to directly relate it to anything other than transition noise the punch line as it was quite often in the s is clearly homosexuals not gay beer the gay beer scenes did not get the laughs that the sexy men got your response and rose colored glasses about a past i lived in is more of the problem than anything i ve said so far
big if true
every time some naive gen z person starts talking about how the tv show friends or something else from the 1990s is problematic or whatever you just have to roll you eyes that was years ago comparing today to the 1990s especially for those of us who grew up in the 1990s is like comparing the 1990s to the 1960s none of us in the 1990s were going around claiming that leave it to beaver was problematic because of the gender roles it portrayed we understood it was from a different era
and got more screen time
in the early 2010s as streaming was gaining popularity it would be common to find televisions series missing episodes i tried watching quantum leap on netflix and it was missing the very first episode but i had no idea and the first episode i watched felt off for a first episode since then a lot of these issues have been resolved but the drew carey show is one of the more painful ones additionally it s really only worth it if they can make their money back
i bet they regretted doing that
f you and what your implying i just aspire and am impressed by the musculature of a combat ready alpha man if a battle broke out you need passion for understanding anatomy for combat wrestling in all conditions is for combat even nude and what s a brojob among real american men you want to get a blowjob from a girl what are you a pansy girls are as efeminine as it gets and getting one that s weak submissive behavior be a man don t take it dish it out be dominant be alpha give out those blowjobs to other combat ready muscle men
is that david prowse in the benny hill skit edit it sure is darth vader himself
i ll give you that the punchline is mostly two dudes who would be interested in woman actually are in some gay commercial is weak the parts i think are hilarious is chris farley with his sunglasses being flipped up adam sandler having the camera being re directed by farley and phil hartman s voice over it could have just been a normal commercial and i would have thought it was funny for how over the top and heavy handed it was i like it as a parody first and then the gay part is more attention grabbing for the audience at the time
there s a good chance you re wrong on this one bud sorry
ugh it s hurt so much cool stuff th state was a sketch show on mtv i the 90s that used tons of popular music at the time and they couldn t get the rights to any of it completely ruined lots of sketches that s just capitalism though it could be the worst idea that no one wants but if it makes money we re doing it
in the age of andrew tate you may need an s
the over the topness was somewhat exaggerated but not too far out it would only be years later when we d get the famous nutrigrain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6re0eakhg8&ab_channel=psychotophatcat) ad which is equally over the top this was an era of where s the beef leggo my eggo and the koolaid man kids had their heads turning into edible gushers things were clean yes germ no folgers was sending suspiciously incestuous brothers into homes on christmas morning and mentos was dubbing itself the freshmaker snl is not subtle people not liking my statement have responded largely with some idea that snl was snidely being pro lgbt they tend to be about as subtle as a hammer to the face this was an era where gay was a punchline in and of itself that s so gay was very popular friends couldn t help but make constant reference to homosexuality all for huge laughs as contrast here s more modern snl on a take something and make it gay advert linkie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdcnuaaxaq&ab_channel=saturdaynightlive) as you can see it s about as subtle as a wrecking ball it explains the joke and why they re making it to excess
the state was great it s sad that not many know about it i wanna dip my balls in it
this puts me in mind of the american phrase that makes me nuts i m making eggs i think you ll find the hen made the eggs they were already eggs before you got to them you re just cooking them
this is fucking depressing
just skip over the chick culling part https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chick_culling) then huh
what about i m making my bed
it s fucking incredible the amount of sheer ingenuity in every part of that allowing so many people to be fed so well and so cheaply is extraordinary
subscribed   
pretty sure that ended in snow crash
this was so adorable and also so hilarious
dude s grandma is precious
psa watch the whole sound city documentary its the reason this song exists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krexk5svjq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krexk5svjq4)
i feel like they all respected eachother too much like no one wanted to outshine the other so they were all so casual would have been fun to see them try to give it some shit and out do one another as friendly competition
when you hire dave grohl to be a drum machine
man add jack white on guitar and julian casablancas on vocals and you got yourself a super group
its amazing how they managed to make this song more boring than any foo fighters nine inch nails queens of the stone age or nirvana song i kept waiting for the intro to be over and the song to start and then minutes later the video ended how
i like the song but considering the talent involved i was underwhelmed when i first heard it
sounds very radiohead but without thom s vocals
i respect them all as musicians but this song is trash if an underground rock band would release this nobody would care
frazier was half blind when he defeated muhammad ali he came incredibly close to winning their third fight as well ali said that the thriller in manila was the closest i ever came to dying it is often sage that although ali won the third match the beating he took in the process was a large part of the parkinson s that set him into decline
this might be the most one sided fight since when ali faced an foot tall mechanical joe fraizer my memory is not what it used to be but i think the entire earth was destroyed
i was only when this fight took place i didn t know anything about boxing and none of my family or friends were really boxing fans either and yet even at that young age i got a sense that the interest and hype surrounding this fight seemed otherworldly i m not sure it s been matched since and i m including super bowls
same effect as thoughts and prayers

return to the chambers was on repeat from my late teens until late 20s that s just what my drunk ass was hearing i think its called a mondegreen
this made me curious so i asked bing so in the thread wu tang s ol dirty bastard s response to what will you give back to the community is gold he responds nothing don t get me wrong i ll send you love however later the news from another thread revealed til ol dirty bastard from the wu tang clan helped lift a ford mustang off of a year old girl who was just in a car accident using a false name he visited the girl frequently until he was spotted by members of the media how would you descibe this type of person ol dirty bastard was a famous american rapper who was one of the founding members of the wu tang clan he was known for his unique and eccentric style of rapping and his unpredictable behavior he also had a troubled life involving addiction legal issues mental illness and death at a young age based on the information you provided i would describe this type of person as someone who was complex talented generous rebellious and misunderstood he had a lot of potential and influence but also faced a lot of challenges and obstacles he may have been reluctant to show his softer side to the public but he cared about his family and community he was a human being with flaws and virtues like anyone else
everyone at school was talking about it the next day
stealing welfare lol yep
just saying it happened he brought his whole family and recorded himself committing welfare fraud lol
good work enough people must have seen this and reported it as i reported it and by the time it had refreshed the user was already deleted and giving me
oh i don t doubt that but i do like putting perspective entertainers net worth s usually aren t as big as you think they are
these bots are completely out of hand some of the subs i m on the bots are literally of posts all reposting from the top it s killed a lot of what makes reddit special the joke used to be that everyone on reddit except you is a bot but that s almost a reality at this point
a lot of the bots eventually switch to posting porn once they have they right amount of numbers i believe a lot of them are linked to exploration or smuggling in all honesty that or things like right wing think tanks or authoritarian state actors could be completely wrong i ve absolutely nothing but a suspicion and i m only about sure of it myself but something just doesn t sit right with me about it i m actually probably wrong but there s something negative about it more than just annoyance it s just there s something nefarious about them
i ve never caught one of these accounts at their end game i ve seen hundreds of these make to comments to farm enough comment karma then make a few huge reposts to farm post karma there are a bunch of merch spam accounts that will make a post to some drop shipping item like a shirt or mug then will provide their shady link i don t think these bots are related i always assumed these bots are intended to wait a few months farm easy karma then someone sells the account i m not sure the worth of an active reddit account these days but any number of scammers would find use of such accounts and the bots setting them up are all so easily automated it s no problem if some of them are lost i m fascinated at knowing more about the back end of how they operate but i wish the reddit admins would do something to help the affected subreddits
i m still hoping we get a big ole house of fun season
classic
a fantastic song i listen to at least once a year my friend group will recognize every line in this song if i reference it they re real rough blokes

interesting thanks
oh no they are strong in many countries
i saw the trailer when it came out and forgot about it until this post too lazy to find the name and shit
vpn to aus server and abc iview should do the trick
sail the high seas and buy their merch in exchange
i ve seen them live twice so fucking funny i won t forget though the only time they actually dropped the act at all was near the end in both shows they were talking about how they would be outside for signing meet and greet etc and please don t touch them they re like yes we know our comedy is physical but we don t want you to touch us a handshake sure a hug maybe but please ask but please don t use our butt as a drum or grab our crotch or anything like that clearly came from a place of we re sick of this shit happening and made me realize how dumb people are that they would have to have a disclaimer this was years ago now i wouldn t be surprised if they don t even do the meet and greets anymore now that they re bigger
i let you drum on my penis
it s fine i think they know you couldn t get me cause i m small and italian

kwh kilowatt per hour it s kilowatt hour kwh i m not going to trust a documentary that can t write or describe units correctly if they ve mucked that up what else are they doing poorly
ending line of the video made me laugh at its stupidity investors were looking for the next tesla and the next elon musk and trevor with nikola seemed like the right fit but maybe just maybe it was too good to be true what do you think well uh given the fact that he was convicted of fraud and as the video outlines none of the things nikola said they built and could do actually were real seems like a pointless question there s zero maybe about it why fake hedge x200b a better ending would have been to state emphatically that it was clearly all too good to be true maybe pose a question about what this says about the ipo system hype and the stock market flaws in due diligence and the promises made by alternative energy and vehicles that s how you could promote discussion in the youtube comments not just maybe it was all too good to be true
yea sorry for typo lol
killowat hour is literally the same as killowat per hour
no it isn t https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilowatt-hour#misuse_of_watts_per_hour watts per hour w h is a unit of a change of power per hour i e an acceleration in the delivery of energy
killowat hour means one kilowat output for one hour one killowat per hour means the derivative at the best intepretation because kilowat is a rate not a quantity it s like saying you re going 60miles per hour per hour
that is pretty fantastic
holy shit that was awesome
i love their covers including this awesome one but california dreamin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glg-vn8i9qc)has been by far my fav
gladys will always be the greatest
i remember my dad blasting this song on our boat back in the early 80s and since then it has always been a favorite i think these kids did an amazing job and the lead singer has an amazing voice for a teenager
adam sandler used to be so funny what happened
don t care
i see him as an honorable fellow who enables a lot of people in the industry his movies are watchable too
wealth and complacency i don t blame him he spent his s and s hustling his ass off and then did exactly what i d do if i hit it big which is kick back and take it easy i think he s actually a pretty good actor when he tries but he d rather make movies with his friends in comfortable locations and i say good for him
man you just got older his comedy has always been immature i m not going to lie here either i thought murder mystery on netflix was funny
uncut gems is an incredible film there were some duds over the years but adam sandler s career is far from over and he has a strong legacy from the 90s i wouldn t be surprised if his best film is yet to come tbh
his most recent stand up on netflix fresh is in my opinion some of his funniest stuff to date
he s still funny the comedies he makes are just very mediocre on talk shows podcasts etc he still gets a lot of laughs and his netflix special was very funny
was it sometime before this video
kewl
edgy
you cared enough to comment
hustle is such a i wanna make a movie for me now example he gets to act with nba stars and make a movie about scouting for talent and its a banger of a film
that s careing about letting people know he doesn t care two separate species
yeah that movie was actually better than i expected the acting was only so good but what can you expect from a bunch of comedians and professional sports players for what it was it did it great
this is definitely one of the curling shots i have seen
can someone explain wtf that device is to measure the relative distances from the radii between the two why a spring with a gauge how fine are we talking here mm nm
madness
wow you betcha
could someone please explain to a layman what makes this shot amazing
i still remember being in utter disbelief that this was an actual sport after buying n64 nagano olympics we loved to give it a go though
you betcha x200b after that no wonder he needed to drink water the man has to stay hydrated after that effort
absolutely heart wrenching
can someone explain to me why they were measuring the far yellow stone instead of the one closer to red that is clearly closer to the bullseye i m assuming that the goal is to have a stone closest to the bullseye
it s up there with one of the curling shots ever recorded
that s why this guy is who he is
they are called dial gauges they are very practical as they can measure relative differences in distances travel without moving the tool itself and the spring ensures that the tool doesn t move whatever it s measuring
i can t tell you just how minor the measurements are basically what it is is a piece of metal that is on a fine spring you pick one rock and set a small amount of pressure against it enough that you can register a small amount of force but not enough to move the rock then you spin it and the same thing is done to the other rock whichever rock is closer will produce more force i would suspect that these measurements are within mm because anything over a cm or two you could likely see with the naked eye
the gauge numbers are actually irrelevant here it indicates whether it touches the stone or not and by how much if it touches one stone but not the other the one it touched is closer if it touches both stones the one it touched more is closer how much more is not important
the insane amount of spin edin put on the rock it makes it virtually impossible to throw accurately and makes it take a really unnatural path extremely straight out of his hands with a ton of curvature at the end throwing like that was the only way he could possibly make the shot it needed to curl more than a regular shot could to hit the target red rock and also needed to transfer more energy than a normal shot could to move it far enough away from the centre to score the points he needed because it was spinning so fast his stone kicked the red rock firmly despite the fact that it was moving quite slowly in the curling world this was something like a basketball player chucking up a full court sidearm shot at the buzzer to send the game into overtime
so typically when you hit a rock the markers in curling of the time the rock will push another rock forwards due to momentum somehow the swedish team who is down points on the last frame of the game and on their last shot somehow managed to spin their rock and hit the opposing teams at the perfect angle allowing both their rocks to wind up closer and send the game to overtime someone with a better understanding of physics would probably be able to break it down a little more accurately but that s the best i can do a couple wobbly pops deep
also trying to figure this out
you re receiving some wrong responses usually curling shots just bump the other rocks in a direction this one used the sliding rock to actually impart rotational spin from one rock to another that is the part that s never done he used the spinning yellow rock to make the red rock spin away from the center all while not knocking the pre existing yellow rock too far away usually the curl or twist that a shooter uses will be a half a turn on the handle not the wild spinning motion seen here before the shot the red team was about to score after the shot yellow team scored so it was effectively a point play the textbook shot would have let yellow score so a point play would have been trivial everyone is saying the shot is amazing perfection but it could certainly have been better if the shooting rock hadn t traveled so far requiring the precision measurement to see if it had gone too far also the game situation was such that the yellow team had nothing to lose by making a wild attempt a textbook regular shot would have still seen them lose the match
simply put the more stones you have closer to the middle the more points you get since you could tell that at least one was closer you didn t need to measure it it was a debate whether or not the team got two points or one
takes a fair bit to move those stones as well much much heavier than most people think
each small line on the meter is one thou one thousandth of an inch or about microns
to add to this this shot was the only actual chance swe had to score two points to push the game to extra ends the red rock is positioned to be sitting against the yellow nearly perfectly such that you can t hit the red forward or sideways with a traditional delivery without losing the shooter rock being delivered or losing the yellow already in the house not acceptable as he needed to score to use the spin of your rock to spin out the opposing team s rock is absolutely stunning and the skill needed to have any chance to make this shot is world beating there is a reason edin has represented swe on the world stage for what feels like an eternity any other curler making this shot and id chalk it up to luck but not edin and his team
nice one thank you
so typically when you hit a rock the markers in curling of the time the rock will push another rock forwards due to momentum so why is it called curling and not straighting
who ended up winning the match game
it essentially made the red rock travel backwards because the rotational energy imparted was a bit stronger than the impact energy that would have driven it forward that was assisted by a rebound bump against the yellow rock it was touching
that s great thank you
are they seriously not using metric as a standard
name would be too homophobic
how they use the brushes to help melt the ice in front of the stone is what allows the stones to curl
it s a scottish game originally so it tracks lots of places use yards as a standard in golf
i see norway and sweden threw me off
dude could have had an adult swim show
oscar for best editing
we still hatin on dicky for his colab with chris brown
this is the only episode my wife decided to sit down and watch with me after minutes she was like you have really weird taste in tv shows x200b it s like the equivalent of your wife always walking in the room during game of thrones when there is naked women having sex on screen
i sure am
lil dicky eh a chris brown collab isn t that bad in and of itself but lil dicky going hello there my white male audience i ve written a song that s intensely racist but i paid a black guy to act as me so we can all enjoy the racism without feeling bad oh and here s some racist stereotypes about asians too and i ve got some celebrities known for stealing black musician s music to make a cameo too oh and i ve given chris brown some lines in the song that sympathise with him about domestic violence yeah we hatin that was awful even by standards imagine if the collab was reversed and it was chris brown doing digital jewface throwing around antisemitic slurs and getting a kanye post holocaust denial cameo in wonder how that would have gone
nah man lil d doesn t deserve any hate he s a legit good dude
i m hatin on him because his i m so white but i have black friends shitck got old quick and he clearly doesn t know how to do anything else
firstly fuck chris brown also dicky has a bunch of black fans too the racist parts were written by chris and no they didn t steal other people s music don t need to bring race into that either but again fuck chris brown imagine if the collab was reversed so lil dicky would be making jewish jokes that would be funny he s done it before
if the planet is really destroyed would you really want to survive
i worked here shot a reality tv show there called happily ever after on bet weird spot
vaulttec s early startup

depends solar flare knocks out the entire grid and all electronics sure if you can make it months to a year to the rebuilding phase after all the crazies kill one another and the unprepared starve out it could be a very interesting pleasant post apocalyptic do over of society nuclear holocaust kicks off yeah fuck that i d rather cook
fun fact the tetris company enforces guidelines in licenced games most versions of tetris since will follow these rules one of these is the random generator which essentially works like pulling pieces from a bag you ll get one of each piece before the bag is refilled this basically means that in every set of pieces you ll get exactly one straight and getting any piece multiple times in a row is only possible at the end of one bag and start of the next i e three in a row is impossible this generator coupled with piece hold and at least three pieces worth of preview mean a skilled player can theoretically play forever https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/playing_forever).
