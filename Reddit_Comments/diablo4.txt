sounds like they are looking for someone who is already a content creator bummer
guess we can expect some clickbait content soon
no chat gpt capable
job posting typically describe the perfect applicant but most hiring managers realize they are not going to get someone that can do everything a good rule of thumb is that you should apply to jobs if you can meet of the requirements do not lie on your application instead show how your experience lines up with the job description and express a willingness to learn
having experience with content creation is a plus but not a requirement whatsoever
yep and i m gonna try my luck this is like a perfect role for me not gonna miss the chance
do not lie on your application nah fake it till you make it i put so much bs on my resume and landed a cushy job with no actual experience beforehand
me too
good old midnight launch huh sounds like an obvious call to go sleep early and start in the morning instead of getting fucked by immediate launch queue
june now and sweet right when i get out of work taking days off happy dance
i will wait until i get home from work to start playing but i ll probably have my husband put me in queue an hour or two before i get home lol the real question is do i take friday off as unpaid time off or not my vacation days are all spoken for
so jun 1st midnight jun 2nd turn for englando folks right as with every game even after years wait for launch and try to get in and play have servers be shit and moan like clockwork gotta keep traditions alive
sweet spot for oz s at 10am taking weeks off to play as much as i can
i think it s only early access if you pre purchased the digital deluxe and ultimate editions standard edition purchasers will still not be able to access until june 4th
ayyyye happy early access 37th birthday to me wow classic came out on my daughter s 10th birthday as well that s for blizz thanks
sweet right when i get off work on early release taking off work days gonna be awesome
puts in for a week of vacation
turn on 7pm put kid to bed 8pm do a bunch of other bullshit till about 10pm and hopefully will be logged in
june 1st wth lol hell ya more days to game
man no one ever cares about africa
well at least they made it june 1st in the evening afternoon probably anticipating and planning for any initial server load issues or serious bugs that may happen so by the next day which is the technically official launch date they will have a response patch
can t wait taking off so i can dive right in
great news i have the 2nd and 3rd off so if there are any issues they ll definitely be resolved by then
yay they didn t fuck over est this time
wow raid night into d4 marathon that thursday raid night is gonna be painful lmao
am for europe is really fucking good
you say early access i hear one week qa before the not pre ordered ones play
someone s going to fall ill on june 1st so they can play the game and then realize the release is 7pm est and say they could ve worked and wasted whole a day off
aka just get a normal night sleep cause the servers gonna be fucked lol
why does asia have such sht time for release really 8am people working or have something to do at day time and youll release it for 8am
the doubt i have is regarding what will happen with the progress we had during the early access and the time before season start we will lost all of it when season starts if so the pre season only purpose would be to try things out
what about central usa time some of us play diablo too
you left out some time zones what about mountain standard time i know i can google it
won t be able to play for like two days people still never learn lol
thank you everyone who will be beta testing the pre release and creating maps of altars of lillith for us joining in after the weekend
7pm est i guess i will just take the evening off and try for 8am
8pm not thaaaat bad
and servers up june d day again
looks at the release times great just when i m starting work such sweet torment
10am
good to know i don t need to take any time off doubt il get much playtime the first few days anyway see yall there
it s not even may yet damn it
wow and a half days of ea that s nice
cool by the time i wake up queue catastrophes will hopefully be done
my life is fully ready to enter no life mode
i have early access bought but i m taking monday off to play from work chose to work friday so i m surprised it s coming out thursday 4pm
nice early access queue here i come
might also be the release of the memes
i expected june 2nd and now happy af it s june 1st original plan to take the 2nd off will be perfect if they fix server issues as fast as they did in the beta
africa
when do they cut off purchasing of early access as in if i buy the game may will i still get early access
is this the standard and you get a few early days if you have the nicer pack or is this the early release
i didn t want to buy the deluxe for the early access but june 2nd is national holiday in italy so now i kinda have to
it will be a difficult friday at work after a 1am release shit i know i should just go to sleep and wake up early but i will not resist it d
just add another to hours on this for when you actually get in and you re good
i took friday and monday off looks like i ll be getting thursday night too
midnight launch let s goooo
perfect timing for me i ll just be getting home at 30pm pst on may 1st which is also my work friday so i ll go into my weekend waiting in queue friday hopefully the queue isn t too bad so i can get days of playtime before work on sunday
us d4 early access the night of my birthday
the anxiety and excitement at the same time
early access who bought in pre sale
have a backup plan activity or other game people the odds you actually get to play are not good expect to not be able to play get booted and wait in long ques and you won t be devastated by the reality
that s a small mercy i ve been looking forward to june 2nd then the spouse told me june 3rd and june 4th are packed to the gills i looked like the meme dog caught looking at cupcakes with an impossible crisis at least i get june 1st june 2nd
am in eu oh fuck
it s been a long time since i ve taken off from work for a game launch i think skyrim was the last time my body is ready
oh man early access 10am on a friday here in australia i couldn t have asked for better
seriously 1am in europe no need early access then if im asleep when its live
just in case launch day will be another disaster i pto d the 8th and 9th of june
thank you for posting this great remind to schedule my pto days
can t come soon enough
june 4pm ps more like 8pm pst due to login queues and server issues
me man i can t wait to play this game shame this time around i m a grownass man with a full time job and i can t play hours launch week wait a minute what s stopping me from taking my vacation that week and that s why my vacation plans for this year are play video games until my eyes fall out of my head x200b yes i remember error shutup p
i preordered the regular version is it possible to pay the difference and get the version which includes early access
aedt ended last weekend we re on aest now so it should be 9am for all of aus
a mental health day on june 6th so i can jump in at 10am is very tempting
pacific daylight time pdt 4pm june so not june 6th
noice i have that week off for vacation may so that thursday will be glorious
7am in asia for me i ll boot it up hit the gym get some breakfast and coffee and see where we re at in the queue
that s my actual birth day yeah baby
9am friday for qld nice
june 5th i thought it was june 6th everywhere
i wouldn t mind playing days early but i have seen enough blizzard launches to know what s nightmare the first hours are going to be
can this get added to the weekly faq i can see this getting asked a lot between now and release
i m going to be on vacation until june 3rd so i guess i m not that upset about not getting the early launch package
thanks so much for this i would ve been up at 2am looking crazy
6pm on a saturday my body has never been readier
10am for me in australia that s awesome its usually like 3am for big releases here in australia so 10am is a nice change
so game officially launches june 5th now interesting
glad i waited to put in my time off requests
am my alarm clock gaming days are over blizz
i was looking forward to cross play with a friend who has a switch but nothing about that release yet
can someone tell me the time for early access for germany i dont get it lmao
a m launch thx
daaaaaaang thought i could work on friday and instead it looks like i will have some cough and a bit of fever the 2nd of june too bad
do they still not understand how daylight saving time works the stated us launch times are at 11pm gmt which makes no sense i am sure they meant 5pm pdt 8pm edt since that is midnight june 6th gmt
i see you ve been down this road before
as i get older i begin to follow roger murtaugh s lead on thing i enjoyed as a younger man midnight release only to get stiffed by server issues or ddos i m getting too old for this crap i ll wake up at 6am make some coffee and play uninhibited
wake up at 4am join queue go back to sleep wake up a few hours later and play hahah that s my plan
naaa time to enter hell immediately by trying to login immediately at launch
can t wait to read about all the people taking the day off from work and complaining about being stuck in queues
god 12am for midnight is so dumb why is it so hard to say this am pm stuff is so unecessary
that s such a smart thing to think about instead of being annoyed at the time just sleep
don t worry when you wake up the servers will be down hours for emergency maintenance to patch something awful
i work 2nds and took friday monday off so ill be hopefully up during the us off peak hours
i ll attempt to play thursday then go to bed for work and once i m in friday i ll stay in until sunday night when i sleep for work again lol
sounds like save bucks and wait for days till it all settles
i will just work that friday and take the following weeks off the whole first day might be fucked up and the difference between starting at 6am or pm whatever
first time i m safe 20h for me
your technique is flawed
with d4 being a live service game i m hoping they ll eventually have the most classes compared to any previous diablo even if it takes years i m hopeful
man that art style looks terrible now
man you know they re just holding classes back to release as dlc
i assume it will be dlc
this is the class i picked out of the gate on d3 release buddies and i got together to play for the weekend on launch they were huge blizzard fans and much better at videogames this was the first time getting back into it since the n64 i ll never forget soloing belial with the monk after my buddies died at the end of his first stage pure nostalgia for this class that weekend got me back into videogames fuck the haters this model looked like a chad when it came out and it still looks like a chad today
i loved the witch doctor in d3 because the voice acting was on point i created a black druid in d4 and the voice acting was so off i almost shed a tear
i m really excited for what the future classes will be and i m guessing monk will be one of them
yeah but rogue is fucking epic maybe they will add the monk as dlc i d pay to have the monk
me too monk and wiz have been my two main classes in d3 for years
i ll miss the way u can dodge from diablo the right joystick was the way to go
isn t there a theorie that we get paladin amazon as one combined class called valkyrie i actually would like to see new versions of old classes imagine something like a priest nun with a path in the light monk and a path in the dark witchdoctor or something i mean in the end call it what you want but i would like to see some new ideas archetypes
me with crusader lol maybe they ll be dlc
refuse to play anything but monk on d3 they will be missed
same played monk since launch for hours
exploding palm and gungdo gear
i very much hope the monk or something close to it makes it to d4 i stopped playing it when the meta builds shifted towards bells but i loved the class and mained it in a lot of early seasons fists of thunder static field was peak enjoyment and i loved uliana set minus the snapshotting
i really hope they add some sort of holy knight imo paladin or crusader super excited for the druid though they did absolutely perfect with the character and cosmetics
i m gonna miss the crusader i love holy aesthetics
i feel like it s just the norm for diablo releases i was sad there was no necro or paladin at d3 launch and i m missing paladin in d4 now too but at least necro is there because of the way they spread classes out across expansions i think most people aren t fully satisfied with the launch lineup but it can lead you to play stuff you might not otherwise i really enjoyed wizard on d3 release and it pushed me to play arcane classes in diablo games more than ever before so don t worry you ll find something new to love
dont worry its gonna come out as dlc just gonna have to pay for it in a year
the look of the sweeping wind skill with the cyclone rune has always been my favorite animation of this whole game
man am i not going to miss the monk in diablo by far my least played class
not me d3 class design really didn t sit well with me i did play the monk for hours on release and recently only the necro
me with crusader lol maybe they ll be dlc
bro is that a unicorn i m rocking the goat with the club atm
looks fun on paper but it was my least played class on d3 most viable builds felt horrible to play
world of diablocraft
inhad fun with mine in season and demon hunter multishot
i never liked them the playstyle never gelled with me playing since launch and i could never really make a monk or barb i liked
monk was trash didnt fit the diablo universe at all
monk was my least favorite class well maybe tied for worst with witch doctor
same i hope they add monk and crusader paladin
my least favorite class in d3 played it one season that s it
my monk was my favorite guy but i switched to other characters when they nerfed him
ewww
they said that theyll not add new classes but thats a lie for sure battlepass exists
i m not lmfao fuck that class
deleted
who knows it may come to d4 later down the line
who let jar jar binks post
the monk in diablo was the weakest shittest character
not me d3 is dead and buried for me after this season im tired of it plain and simple and im worried for the people that still say they wanna play the rotated seasons why how many times do you wanna kick a dead horse game has been out since
dude didnt even reach paragon and u are sad to leave a class with less than a hours played gif giphy kgfhb3ojjrqhlkgkso downsized
graphically good for
it s whatever man i have never liked the monk
that is a minute old character if you aren t getting power leveled please hit atleast lol
phone graphics suck
d3 monk is one of my favourite video game experiences he was also super fun in heroes of the storm
don t worry mate it will come as an exp for usd next year
i was playing every season only monk every time i am really sad to not see monk in d4 have high hopes of dlc
i miss crusader
same i played assassin in the beta was melee until i got a sick bow then didn t get any good melee weapon drops the rest of my play through but the melee didn t live up to what the monk in d3 did hopefully we ll get it in a later patch dlc we can avenge our fallen brothers laying all over sanctuary dead monks every where in that game
betting monk will release on season
naaah man d4 is a live service game i am absolutely sure something like monk will come sooner or later
rah rah rasputin lover of the russian queen
crusader pala gang where
same bro
i m hoping the monk will come back
i do love me some exploding palm action even before all the set items uniques came into support it when my group of friends was pushing torment levels ep pulled it s weight
i never really played the monk in d3 but wouldn t mind if it showed up in d4 just as long as a paladin class comes first or at the same time as the monk bring it
i still remember when i cleared inferno diablo with my monk i m gonna miss the skill rune system and the crazy spell effects
it s just dated graphics i used to think the games back on my atari looked outstanding at the time go look at them now and be like wtf is this trash
most boring class imo
just play barb with no weapons 4head
he ll probably be back eventually if it s any consolation i ll miss the hell out of witch doctor and i wouldn t be all that surprised if the doc either doesn t come back or it takes a few years
paladin monk
don t worry i am sure they stripped it out for a dlc they will release next year
dont worry he s coming back in a season source trust me
this is bizarre but the wolf druid felt like a monk to me
i really liked the monk i think it was one of the better classes overall before ros there was a sledge fist monk build and it was so good it was truly valuable in multiplayer as a barb main i always wanted a monk for the buffs and cc they provided
every time i see this class i always think hey look it s kratos
there will be expansion s im sure theyll have something new to play
you gonna look back fondly on the journey to lvl eh
monk was the only reason to play d3
hopefully they add the class later on it is a good class one of my favorite as well
started a new character after the d4 beta and went with whith doctor always been my favorite farmed a bunch got some sets started farming greater rifts and decided to start a monk my other favorite my monk does everything faster and with less effort my one wish is that both of those classes get added to d4 at some point
my monk was hardcore
inna monk has been my goto every season thankfully d3 will still be here for us to play to scratch the itch that d4 won t scratch
why s that horse so small lol it s like he s riding a pony
i m not
druid saves it for me but i do wish monk and especially crusader make it to
i ve been playing d1 and it looks better than this lol for the record have sunk countl3ss hours on d3 i think of d3 as advanced gaunlent
i was very underwhelmed by the monks skill set just really meh
i foresee all the classic classes as dlc however i highly doubt they will add in any new classes before the release
they could of called d3 a wow arpg
nobody would complain then lol
that s how i feel about my beloved witch doctor r i p the truth burns you
favorite character i was hoping he would be in the next one
dw you re going to be paying for it in the future
dlc
monks in both this game and wow just don t click for me i m not sure why but i bet there s a good chance they offer monk as dlc later
coming as dlc like paladin
i can guarantee they will be selling characters in the future crusader monk being top of the list
atleast you ve got those blue skellies with the necro
your flaws are revealed will always be classic hopefully once it returns they ll find a similar get the same voice actor just a fantastic arpg character in general
i won t miss that mobile looking art style it looked like shit at launch and it looks even worse now
i like to pretend diablo didn t happen
use the rog very simular if u go mellee
i bet it comes back for in the cash shop
i ve locked this post all it will bring is bickering attacks against one another let s be real the game isn t out people are getting anxious tired waiting for something so they are putting forth the most quality shit posts they can find to make their way into upvotes i won t remove your thread because there s some truth behind it but not much
well it s reddit absolutely normal people wouldn t follow reddit if they have nothing to complain for if they are happy with d4 they just wait for the release and only browse out of curiosity haters however think reddit is sort of blizzard s report channel and are delusional thinking that someone actually cares about what they think we basically use this as chat nonsense to fill our spare time i am pretty sure all the gaming companies have more than enough sources of critical feedback and they wouldn t ever rely on sub reddit complains to guide them how to make a game
sounds like reddit in general
let s not forget a bunch of posts just like yours commenting on it
so in other words just a regular reddit sub
diablo satan hate what do you expect if you want to find love follow jesus jesus is the answer to peace and love it sounds like you need to leave this sub and find jesus
also i don t think you meant it but saying this sub is a field of hatred in a diablo4 sub is kind of amusing
new release drinking game posts about why it s good post about why it s bad posts about why good posts are bad posts and out why bad posts are bad posts about how op is waiting to form an opinion posts about how op doesn t like the posts about why posts about why it s good are bad
this https://www.reddit.com/user/me/) person is causing the most drama
yeah ngl i unsubbed today because i dont want to risk random people s shitty opinions tainting my own view of a game i m excited about
gif giphy y2i2oqwgzh5iorp4qa downsized
stop crying bud it s the internet
i made this comment on another thread are you trying to steal my updoots s
you forgot usd for a game
damn well said
nice
it s fine when this game comes out and i m playing it i won t care about all these butthurt people
i m very much looking forward to the game had a blast with the beta sticking with my usual barbarian i did get the necro to but i think when i need a break from my barb i m going with the druid even though i didn t test him out
welcome to reddit
people warm up for pvp
r literally
if i haven t had at least one intense fight with someone who is just as stubborn on a completely unimportant issue as me it was a slow day
i would just stay away and enjoy the game
the game isn t even out yet

yup or this post adds nothing without even attempting to discuss the topic broached or angry mocking trolls who took something way out of context personally and chase you across the next three threads just post what s on your mind about the game in a reasonable fashion without regard for the trolls and bullshit you ll often generate discussion much of it useful and pertinent try to not re hash something that the post thread created an hour beforehand is already doing don t post something for votes post to meet those criteria and you ll be fine
welcome to reddit
lol yeah sounds about right reddit in a nutshell
tons of subs are much more normal than this place
the overwhelming najority of gamers do not follow gaming news with any level of regularity most never care enough about these issues to make a deal out of them however big or small
chat nonsense to fill our spare time kills sooooo much time for me
this is the way
spot on i feel like every fandom right now looks at reddit as a support channel to get companies or people to do what they want out of negativity and pressure maybe its always been like this though
your argument would be valid if blizzard wouldn t allow to comment on the forums only for the people with preorders
lol i just like to listen to what people are saying and add my two sence
agreed i think that blizzard does eventually peek at reddit just to gauge general community feedback even though it s reddit and this sub that is full of hatred
we can go deeper we re now waiting for the posts about people posting about the sub
if you don t like r diablo4 then goto church and never comeback lmao
that was intentional not sure if you know but the pvp zone in d4 is named fields of hatred
unpopular opinion
shit it s me sorry everyone
i m a drama queen
you haven t purified your updoots pke d
not gaming subs almost all are neckbeard nests filled with professional developers who know exactly how to make the best game of all time
every sub goes through the same cycle leading up to release and for the first months after release it s basically a large group of people who wanted a different experience venting and then people who like the game defending it the larger the appeal of the game the more polarized it gets none of this is useful but it s just the natural way technically it s best to avoid these subs anyway
yeah exactly this is why a lot of games fail they simply just only get feedback from of their total player base and usually those who will to give it is because their own reasons take for example content creators feedback for games they simply put whatever feedback they want personally while using the weight of their channel community as to be marked as channel community feedback but the reality is viewership of those people are just bored people or just wanna check up on a research resume that they don t wanna do themselves meanwhile the creators themselves are using the viewers to apply additional pressure to gaming industry stating that not one but people have signed up for this feedback
yeah sadly is exactly like this ever since content creator era has began more often than not our beloved content creators which also think we agree with them at no we don t you fools we watch your stuff because we are lazy to do the research of x thing ourselves for couple of hours instead we wait you to research and make short 15min video about it content creators and influencers often use their channel community growth to apply additional weight to their personal feedback with things they personally want changed the sad part is that some companies are actually listening to them blindly because they have 50k followers channel with 20k subs or something huge gaming industry mistake to take feedback with additional weight based on the fact it was given by a guy with 20k twitch viewers when are gaming developers going to realize that content creators simply give their own personal feedback using their channel growth to this feedback is from my entire community not just me we all want this no fools we don t we watch your sht because we don t wanna spend hours researching for something we know you going to do anyways and just put up a resume on youtube
lol that is their official diablo forum why would they let random people who haven t played the game to comment on feedback forums about their game it makes absolute sense to have d4 forums restricted for pre orders they know which account has what access they also had invitational closed beta i am pretty sure there was specific closed beta d4 forum section only accessible for d4 closed beta invited testers i completely agree with their decision the d4 forums to be only accessible from players who own the game no reason feedback to be exposed to random comments from people who have no clue what the game looks like and probably haven t played it open beta s exists for completely different reason than getting gameplay feedback
i would not say it s full of hatred but in general when you want a critical feedback you generally speak to players who actually have played the full game not just a fraction of it i am pretty sure during closed beta they have taken their feedback open beta s are for totally different purpose than taking feedback for balancing yeah they probably do their research within communities like this one but it s definitely not for important feedback may be for ideas sometimes or just overall acceptance of the game
how about a comment about my comment and how it s a comment on other people s comments and i ve gone crosseyed
i actually did not know that is great
hands over an ear
ehh i wouldn t say all metroidvania subs tend to be chill niche games tend to be pretty chill only really big series and online games have super toxic communities from my experiences
almost all
that s still not even close to accurate
these two commenters are reddit and what op was on about lmao
i don t think either of us attacked each other or were even rude to each other but eh alright
its back people i need extra stash space to collect all the ears
you should watch the rogue reveal trailer
stay a while and listen
that s a really big ear
diablo reference when in pvp you used to get ears from other players you killed
this really emphasizes the space that gems and ears take up now
good old days when you could steal their gold and gear and lob off an for good measure
ear level confimed
what bothers me in that inventory image is that theres is a tab for consumable quest wtf and aspects the aspect is fine by itsleelf quest i means when will you have like quest item in your inventory xd whats lacking is a misc tabs they could put gems ear and whatnot that would be a good qol change or juste make the inventory less like d3 and more like other arpg where armor and shield takes up to spots while an ear would take only
diablo pk s and pkk s and even pkkkkkkkkkkk s
how does a gem take up as much space a dang tower sheild that jazz always bothered me with d3 and now it s in d4 is it a design choice to make inventory management easy
i miss when items weren t the same size
god the ui of the inventory is ugly to have this as pinnacle of a 25yo game franchise of a aaa studio is a bit sad
what drew my attention was the graphics of the sockets of socketable items in this image if you compare them to how they looked at the beta they are very different the ones in the beta looked dirty and thicker and not as slick and clean as these ones we knew that the beta build was from last december so not the latest combined with the fact that some of the scenes in that new trailer were already in the rogue announce trailer from years ago e g andariel at in endgame overview gameplay trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uswf-y5ecqm&t=8s) and at at rogue announce trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvrlz4yethi&t=209s)), i think that this image is way older then we all think and so maybe it s content too
what i noticed was a pvp currency that requires purification to use and of them being turned into a blue item
the pvp zones in hc mode will be intense af lol
lol this goes to show people here have very little experience with gaming in general its from pvp come on buddy
does anyone else think the inventory looks quite awkward when the items have art at totally different scales like those gems are huge is that the ear of a giant its bigger than the entire helmet next to it that ear is bigger than someone s head sigh its pretty silly at this point how bad the ui is i miss d2 more scale consistent item art dearly you can t seriously tell me the above item art looks better than this https://www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21083121/diablo-2-inventory.jpg?w=1200). it just doesn t there s noone that can convince me d4 has nt objectively gone backwards on item presentation
god i hate the art of the items
seen it before on data mined stuff interesting also that seems they increased the size of the sockets didn t seen no one complaining about that but it s true sockets were very small was even difficult to see if items were socket or not
inventory management is a travesty this time round x200b ears the size of chipped gems and battle scythes
wow it s as big as a battle axe
it is not a quest item what possibly an ear has to do to a gear dont tell you can fuse rings with ears
zomg to much like diablo let the diablo fans are crying diablo sucks go play d2r references begin
if i remember correctly even in the first game from you could collect ears from other players you killed it had their name on it and everything the quickly clogged up limited inventory space though so it s not like eve online where you can have a menagerie of corpses just sitting there not that i ever did that of course p
i already have two why would i need more
why is it located in the equipment inventory
michelangelos lost ear
devs we heard you loud and clear
it means they are listening
what i m more interest about is why there are common quality items in his inventory many questions is this an old build one they still had runewords in what lvl is the character and if he s max level why do common items drop why
i was curious how these would come into play after the revealed trailer and not seeing them in the beta
for those wondering why it s in the equipment slot it s because you can equip it and throw it at players
it was teased during the rogue reveal
ah the famous ear of jordan or was it wirt s stones
anyone else notice this dude running around with 8m gold
meats back on the menu boys
eye see what you did there
it belongs to pezradar
they said ears were back in the rogue announcement
everyone is going to be hunting for the ears of famous streamers
the fact that gems and ears take up the same amount of inventory space as a handed pole arm is just dumb
i got excited in the stat tab at the bottom said pvp with like dmg reduction
the old way of pvp love it
they really need to make gems rings and ears take half the slots it should be 1x1 not 1x2
damm i didn t notice it was pretty earsy to miss with all the loot arround
this brings me back to when i was a kid and played diablo on battlenet at least we are finally getting some pvp action
string of ears
we need a string to put all our ears on a string of ears if you will
ahh the ear of the giant the same size as a full halberd
i can hear this image
lady yorshika
the game interface makes me vomit
wow it s been more than years since i thought about people s ears in diablo
poor wirt first his leg now his ear
i want a trophy cabinet in my room a trophy cabinet for ears
is that you coooley
i sure did is this a known info if yes i somehow missed it
i mean the trailer was full of ears yeah but i did not know you can collect them
why act like you know something
agree
i have no ears and i must listen
i can see the threads now i can only kill players before needing to go to town i keep having to buy stash tabs to fit all these enormous ears i will literally die if blizzard doesn t reduce ear sizes as someone with big ears i feel personally attacked by the size of ears in this game
looks as big as the dang tower sheild
a diablo reference in diablo wha
this really emphasizes the lack of space armor takes up now y all are always looking at something to complain about but in fact with this system we have way more slots for armors than d2 ever had
lmao remember when you kill a guy like times and the guy popped all his gear
indeed it would be a good change
honestly they should just go to the consumable tab and stack based on element type and allow you to expand and see which level of gem you have and let you interact or click drag that specific gem to whatever item you need to socket
gif giphy f8nd8ql8ccbem
it s for console players
inventory tetris is much less fun than it sounds
no its bad for the accessibility of the inventory makes it a lot harder to spot at a glance when they re all the same shape and size even worse for people with cognitive disabilities i really mess diverse sized items it really bothers me that the art is all at different scales too
gotta make the game as easy as possible
better than backpack jenga
so the icon size is immersion ruining but stuffing chest armors in your bag is fine
go play resident evil then
i m not sure why people are downvoting you the ui definitely leaevs something to be desired and i say that as someone who is incredibly excited about the game and has already pre ordered it i certainly wish they would spruce it up a bit although i doubt they will and i m not sure why they strayed from the d3 pattern of having gems take up one square and regular items take up two runes and gems taking up two squares really doesn t make much sense
yeah agree art at all those different scales squashed into a single card shaped slot for art is super sad visual unity of the ui goes out the window
agree i really hope they look at all the meaningful ui comments after beta and improve it for the release
is this true that the beta build was from last december do you have a source for this i had heard rumors that it was an old build but had not seen anything concrete from blizz confirming this
zoomers that are saying d2 sucked
rings are the same size as an ogre axe in diablo full suit of ancient plate armor is stacks of javelins a tome is actually just scrolls big but it can fit your immersion never made sense
it s a keepsake earned by defeating other players a trophy of sorts not an item to be used
diablo is basically d2r they ve added items but the classes play the same you sound ignorant of what d2r and d2 actually are
isk for mittens corpse
think you re confusing your artists yo
that s probably a very low number compared to what an actual player will have i had millions of gold in the beta at level this is a developer clip they aren t farming for gear for multiple hours they re testing out different game systems and putting together clips i don t think respec costs are going to be an issue at all as long as we don t expect to respec multiple times per day
i want them to show up on the amulet i have equipped
sounds like a nice extra crispy cash for blizzard
proof of a concord kept
diablo you get ears of the players you defeat in pvp don t know about diablo
pretty sure they announcednthis being a thing along with the rogue
it s the same size as a ring both are the same size as a chest plate crazy
gif giphy dxfkduolylli8gq6cl downsized
i hear you
or maybe the shield is as big as an ear no way to know whitout a banana for scale
yeah true it just bothers me if i take up a whole row of slots with of each gem and multiple sizes would be kinda cool if they made an extra half size row just for those small items
i would say it s more like tetris but ok didn t know items fell down when you moved items below them
shut up fool who said anything about immersion ruining

can you add a donation button to the apps would love to help you out for your time
op you have paypal i would like to contribute to your preorder since you did a good job
very nice perhaps a website as well
amazing would be nice if it had all legendary aspects for each class and the paragon board
this is so cool is there any option to pay and get rid of ads
i was told there is only skill points since apparently you don t get one at level or level will this be adjusted to that
i ve been using this app since beginning and i love it you can read all skills very clearly without having to zoom in and out and put points into them accordinly can t wait for paragon to be implemented in the app it will be awesome
brilliant work searching for ios version now thanks
great app any option to purchase to get rid of the ads
ooooo this is great thank you
great job
left or right option
well well well i know what i m doing for the next months now i just need a full list of legendary s but i also don t because i don t want to be spoiled
i would like to donate some bitcoin if you are accepting
just downloaded and gave it a try i really like it and think a desktop version would be nice however my only suggestion is could you make it so if we refund say hydra on sorcerer it would also refund the perks within it and everything picked after even if we did that with the initial skills for any class edit unsure if known but when saving a photo of a finished build it creates a massive grey strip and is also shown in the builder at the end

thank you very much https://www.paypal.me/likelove98
i think we have enough websites already all we re missing now is someone to make a desktop version
considered for security reasons
considering in app payment
sites like maxroll mention renown rewarding skill points per zone but fractured peaks in the beta only gave maybe something changed since earlier info or there is another way to get the third so guess we ll have to see if it s or total at launch
renown rewards grant skill points
i dont know to use bitcoin thank you very much https://www.paypal.me/likelove98

people will say they want whatever the game doesn t have
this is exactly the intended purpose of paragon boards vs skill trees vs aspects though they are supposed to do different things all of them can impact gameplay style to some degree for example if we call paragon boards vertical progression boosting it s power by certain conditions e g applied modifiers corpse proximity resource meter levels etc impacts gameplay significantly
the paragon boards seemed to basically buff stats and have a couple legendary perks that buff damage nothing gameplay changing ok but not exciting i think i read that future seasons could change paragon boards so maybe we ll see some interesting things in there for future seasons
my hope for where paragon eventually lands after updates don t forget they can update things and this is just the start is a place where customisation that is ultimately too weak to be a full item power or too niche but is good to have the one example i have in my head that i think would be an excellent paragon node for rogue dash skill does not apply or consume imbue effects this is a great node because it s not strong enough to want on an item but it does help a playstyle you might want it and another player might really want to avoid it despite running the same build with the same legendaries so it becomes a really good on your build and play style you pick something that defines how you personally interact with the ability they have already shown us legendary nodes giving us power and horizontal adjustments so i think the board can and will be dual purpose
pretty much exactly op paragon is the exclamation point of your build the crazy abilities people want are on items whether people hate the item grind or not is an entirely separate issue but the complete ability altering play style is in items if people want to choose their abilities completely by leveling up then i would strongly recommend poe cause d4 just isn t that same genre made for different hardcore audiences
and yet it will still come down to of the population using the same cookie cutter builds from maxroll the guide will tell you exactly what to choose at every stage what gear to use what aspect to use what glyphs to use and where in the world to go to find it all the diversity of builds will be a non factor there will be s tier for every class and everything else will be vitually ignored the open world will be a non factor the guide will tell you exactly where to go to farm everything certain activities will prove to be the most profitable some activities will be requirements to get what you need all other activities might as well not even exist that will be the meta same as d3 same as d2 same as every arpg and rpg out there unless you as an individual decide not to give a shit about that you can do your own thing in your own little bubble and be blissful provided you stick to pve but you won t you know you won t the temptation to wield massive power will get you you will succomb
in my experience i have really enjoyed the paragon system
my take on the paragon board is could it be deeper than it is absolutely but it s trillion times deeper than anything we ve gotten in previous diablo games and with the current plan for seasons this is only the beginning
i d imagine most people want some additional layers of depth and complexity rather than the paint by numbers approach some people prefer a this or that decision tree rather than an if this then that route blizzard has chosen with their skill and paragon trees i suspect this video just further dispelled any hope those people had that the paragon tree would open up some different build pathways when in fact it so far appears to just reinforce the simplistic design they have chosen
i think paragon should fill in the needs of existing builds or help them branch out into different variants of the same build no reason why diversity should only come from one aspect of the build
i would like more skill choices and customization within character design not randomized item drops myself i want the drops to be able to enhance my chosen playstyle not dictate it for me
the problem is nothing is for that people want more significant choices or build options there s barely any skills per class and aspects don t really change skills in significant ways i played flurry rogue mostly on the beta and every aspect i got was essentially just more damage which is ok but it s definitely boring i m looking forward to d4 as much as anyone but there s no harm in criticizing blizzards lazy design choices there are indie arpg games now with far more depth and far more interesting itemization than diablo these days which is pretty sad what i can t wrap my head around is people who claim they just want to enjoy the game but also don t want anyone else to provide feedback to encourage them to make it better
paragon board is a bit of both horizontal and vertical stat bonuses are vertical legendary slots and glyphs probably enhance or allow alternate builds but it does seem more vert than horizontal but that s fine diablo is also more vertical than horizontal
the board is fine and exactly what i was expecting
i m excited to play and explore forget all the whiners who won t enjoy a game i ve been waiting more than years for
i mean it s fine i d just prefer to ability to choose increases to attributes from the get go
i don t think people actually hate paragon system the problem is them presenting it as endgame which it really isn t and also them presenting it so badly that video was atrcious
paragon board looks awesome i was looking at the necro board and there are boards for all kinds of playstyles there are abilities thst make your armies ever stronger as well as the parts of the board leading to it that increase your minions attack defense resists etc there are boards thst focus on no minion builds thst help beef up your necromancer and all the skills you have there s a lot of room for variation to further strengthen your build and then there are glyphs thst you can insert in various parts of the boards to amplify a certain number of slots on the paragon boards
paragon board seems fine to me obviously you are going to have stats on travel nodes and it also a way to not have all your power stats coming from items it s the same in poe yet people tend to ignore that with their rose tinted glasses and a general dislike for blizzard to boot
builds every class that s about it i don t see how they can make builds look unique every season i d like to be proven wrong though im up for the story and cinematics anyways and a few months of gameplay until they show they can do something new with builds class we ll see plus i m not looking forward to an old class the paladin i was hoping we d get a new class something unique but oh well
honestly i think the paragon board is fine as is the legendary nodes do provide some changes to how you play could be better but no qualms what i kind of miss though is the skill rune modifiers from d3 where you could change how skills work completely in different ways that was fantastic
i agree paragon is the vertical progression layer because it is built based around your skill and gear choices you will entirely ignore the paragon boards that don t support your skill gear choices unique gear and many legendary aspects that can drastically change your build or play style fall into the category of horizontal progression skill trees are an even mix of both horizontal and vertical progression due to the wide variety of ways you can spend points it s also probably why the skill trees depicted in a branching vertical layout there is some overlap between the three systems but taken as a whole they offer a substantial amount of depth no matter which direction you look
which was your favourite node dex or int
the way i see it the main purpose of the paragon is to bridges the gap between the massive potential power creep given by unique gears making it so that even if you aren t super lucky with gear drops in general you can still clear content by investing into what you can instead of i can t progress this game until i get this miraculous aspect drop with a drop rate
the only thing that change your playstyle and build is the aspect and skill tree paragon board and the glyphs enhanced your build further to sustain yoir dmg and survivability on the scaling enemies as you continue to level up
dex dex dex dex
paragon has never in any game offered anything other than minor power increases it s always just been something to work towards after your character has hit max level
the horizontal progression different skill effects different play styles comes from farming aspects and uniques yeah really love the idea of turning an arpg into a gacha game and trading simulator the trading is the most annoying part about poe d2 never really liked it why can we not have more power in our choice of substats skills etc this is what made d2 so nice uniques were the cherry on top not the foundation of your build
who said that the paragon is horizontal or was supposed to be horizontal prog
while i m not a big fan of the board design i really hope you can hold a key to mark the way you want to path and then press apply to spec into the nodes because right now it looks like you ll have to click each node which will drive me nuts
why do paragon boards exist in the first place why can t leveling up still be a thing where you add stats to your character everytime you level there is literally no difference between this and the paragon board
the argument is paragon is old and we want something new doesn t matter if it s paragon on steroids and it slaps it s old that s the point every diablo has been something new until d4 no one complained before d1 came out same with d2 people are fed up with the direction of diablo since d3 and blizzard continues to go downhill at terminal velocity on a angle with gameplay quality the devs don t care about reddit feedback their days are numbered with the microsoft buyout all they have time for at this point is fixing bugs and server issues any future updates or add ons are just scheduled rollouts of unreleased game already finished before closed beta
if the paragon board functions to lock in choices then there s no true choices to make with the board what is the point of having a system that is effectively automated
they talk about how the board is enabling unique playstyles thats absolutely not the case for all these shitty stat nodes armour nodes and legendary nodes like increased damage per crowed controlled nearby enemy up to thats just completely boring and lackluster heck even simple notable nodes in poe are much better designed and there i dont need to spend points to reach some trashtier legendary node
man if people are mad at this they should never look at elder scrolls online s legendary points they go into the thousands would rather something managable with impact than increases also idk why people are hyping up poe unless they changed it last time i played poe it was literally like additional nodes with about half of those being non impactful
in time it will all be upgraded and most likely better
its very clear if blizzard made the best diablo game or game in the history of games that was ever thought up through the past present and future people would still non stop whine about it
people are really just upset cuz in d2 you could see low resolution boobies and you can t anymore
people are just mad because they used the word deep when it not that deep because they failed to show the glyphs the rare and legendary one at least the one with different bonus then just i also keep losing braincell everytime i see people posting about it like if you did not participated in the beta back in november or early and did not level at least level people should stfu the system is fine how it is there many way to play with it
just go read the datamined legendary and stop with this on cc go read and made your real opinion
small nitpick but horiztonal progression refers to content that does not impact your player power which the paragon board absolutely does having said that the whole point of the paragon board is to improve on d3 s system and introduce a new system where players can mix and match different themed boards to suit their build it complements whatever you set up in the skill tree and with gear and is designed with the intention to add new boards in the future it opens up a lot of design space for future builds while also not being the sole source of power for your character it helps balance the various sources of power your character is built on and is really a brilliant reboot of the paragon system
makes me want to see the druid boards to stack willpower for some insane overpower numbers i think extra basic stat can really help certain builds
in a literal sense it is both horizontal and vertical so i agree
if anything it s vertical progression also idk who the fuck is calling for more horizontal prog in an arpg but that s not really what the genre is about
i didn t know how stats worked in d4 so when i saw what the paragon board did months ago i was a bit skeptical about it realizing it wasn t going to be better first for your play style but more about finding the core stat and just getting all of those but after playing the beta i realized there isn t a core stat every stat helps every class so now i m feeling better about the paragon bored
i was mad because they made it seem like it wasn t just stat and it was on that video i ll play the game for hundreds of hours regardless long as the end game remains interesting
it seems that a minority of fans of this game and its predecessors want to nitpick and bitch about anything everything they can get their hands on
you sound right to me
okay but can we talk about the conscientious choice to not include a fishing mini game skyrim has it wow has it ocarina of time had it even hades allowed you to fish in hell i m dropping my ultra deluxe edition over this bs what are the devs even thinking frfr though the progression looks good imo the described endgame options sound like they re adding in sound like refreshing takes on the endless grind and lots of foundation to build on
ya he double standard we hold blizzard to is insane when another game does it it s great when blizzard does it it s boring what power progression system isn t boring literally ever system ever is just numbers having the paragon board isnt the problem the problem is a lack of skills and options in a build people like myself was hoping the board would add a little something to address the lack of skills
i just want more health regen or health on hit where s those nodes
main stat
do you mean vertical progression
paragon is vertical
i think it s even simpler than that in d2 after you reached level ish it s very difficult to gain levels and progression comes to a halt you ll really have to hone your gear to have any meaningful progression and really depends on your build since different builds have vastly different ceilings also better gear isn t always better there s a lot of dilemmas included in d3 it s clearer how you progress more with paragon levels and ancient or primal ancient gear so it s a one to one swap out basically advancing without needing to fuss over gear choices with the paragon board it s really just a huge huge source of stats it takes the stat system from d2 and just places it at the endgame which tbh is a much better design asking me to place points when i barely know anything about the game is just ridiculous the way the board is built will also guide you in what stats to have instead of just free form speculation so players won t make really big mistakes
some people just hate diablo nothing pleases them
getting main stats and increased to damage for x second is not character customization the aspects are mosty generic damage as well people are upset because its just d3 all over again and we know how that turned out
look d4 is meant for non arpg player to appeal to a much larger player base so they are keeping it neat and simple if these type of games was my first or something i would love d4 but after playing games like last epoch and chronicon d4 is shit the only place d4 is better than them is the legendary tier cinematics and top quality graphics
agree to this its never enough on the same note to op you are limited with a max amount of slots and that s probably why the paragon board solidifies your build by pushing stats of your skills also horizonal progression does not mean expanding the skill tree it just means power comes from different sources skilltree items paragon stats etc the more sources the more horizontal it is getting more skills and passives to skills in the skill tree would be deeper progressin
i agree with the op but think there are a lot of people here obsessed with doom saying
this game is garbage because it doesn t have a dragon mount allowing me to fly around raining fire from the sky complete deal breaker in my opinion
it s almost as if they should just go and make their own game
this comment here is all you need from this thread
if you put status effects behind rng and then vague conditianals on top of it thats bad and boring conditional game design hey let me first move in more step then gain more fury before pressing this attack and then hopefully enemies are stunned to gain increased damage because with this skill i cant hit all enemies at once so the damage from my legendary node only gives power etc so my next attack does more damage imagine playing like this every monster pack the worst thing is i easily can see blizzard designing and balancing around that lol wtf you call this good
some of the nodes are nuts there s a barb one with chance to be invulnerable for seconds with a slashing weapon on a high attack speed build that s basically godmode but again what you re looking for is in the aspects
items should enhance a character a character shouldn t enhance the item
i agree except i love playing off meta builds and wiping the floor with the meta slaves fields of hate meet my ice rogue
agree with everything except bubble in d2 and even d3 we had a bubble d4 destroys all bubbles with a forced mmo open world you can still ignore maxroll but will constantly see facerolling builds while struggling with a single pack this is a little overexaggerated but you got the point
same
exactly my feelings
well for all the build complexity poe has to offer i haven t played a single minute last epoch a bit more than that hours but i ve gotten bored quite quickly complexity isn t necessarily a good thing i think that s the message here
i think paragon should fill in the needs of existing builds or help them branch out into different variants of the same build but why you already have the skill tree and aspects for that also no one said it wouldn t happen further down the line they will probably keep expanding the paragon boards
we simply won t get more skills to choose from or upgrades tied to them untill a few seasons or the first expansion in what we will get is new items to play around with that can change skills or atleast have you customize your character in any way your also not dicated by anything nothing forces you to use certain legendaries or unique s but i m sure that if you find some interesting ones you probably want to play around with that which the current system provides and is not locked behind being a certain paragon level
the skill tree paragon boards and aspects already do that i want to try to make a shepherd druid work so my skill choices will focus on companion skills and my aspect and paragon choices will buff those skills since i can look up which dungeons drop which aspects i can target the aspects i want for my build that is me choosing my playstyle imprinting an aspect gives the lowest version it so i will be looking for those same aspects with better rolls on gear yes i m sure i will see strong gear drop for elemental and shapeshifting skills but so what probably by midgame most of my gear will have buffs for companion skills even if i find a weapon that has a huge buff to a werewolf skill why would i use it when the rest of my gear is focused on a completely different build an item may buff a single skill by a ton but it doesn t make sense to use it if it doesn t synergize with the rest of my skills and gear plus gear drops will be tuned to the class i m playing so the odds of finding an item that buffs the skills i m using is much higher than they were in d2 i could easily find a strong companion item minutes after finding the strong werewolf item even if respecs are free i don t want to spend the time respecing the whole tree and maybe paragon board just to change it back when i find that companion item i want i can t imagine this being an issue by the time you re far enough in the game where item power really matters you ll be far too invested in your build to change because of even a few item drops i would love to see a poll here at least one month after launch asking players how many times they felt like they were pressured to change their build just because of one strong item i bet the majority of answers will be times
i think this is how poe le spoiled people traditionally arpgs were always about the rng loot to me that s what s fun
this is what the codex is for it s basically the skill tree but with a specific quest attached instead of being part of leveling basically think of it as the den of evil with a skill point you can only spend on one specific skill being changed
i mean it doesn t really dictate your playstyle unless you want it to just because i get shape shifting legendaries doesn t mean i have to play a shape shifter druid i can just keep farming for the legendaries i want for my preferred playstyle
the drops don t dictate your chosen playstyle though if you get a drop that enhances your chosen playstyle great if you get a drop that doesn t you don t have to change your playstyle to accommodate it
i completely agree with you the rpg element of this game is almost non existent it s very d3 you get the character you re given with very little actual choice i don t mind paragon being what it is what i don t like is that a ton of people touted it as a solution to the limited skill tree which it clearly isn t you can like the way it is but please don t try say well don t worry about the limited skill tree we have paragon board to customize your character as we suspected it s not what people claimed rather just as op said more enhancements for what you already have
skills being ties to items was a huge success in path of exile so personally i m fairly certain it ll work well with d4 as well
okay but you won t find that with d4 and i like this
people like you make me realize how little thought people have put into the skill and gear systems
there are indie arpg games now with far more depth and far more interesting itemization than diablo these days which is pretty sad what i can t wrap my head around is people who claim they just want to enjoy the game but also don t want anyone else to provide feedback to encourage them to make it better yes there are such games but they usually offer any depth in other departments i have hours in last epoch and while it s a good game it s not addictive to me grim dawn same and depth isn t necessarily a good thing either if it lacks in other more important areas for example le doesn t have a good endgame currently and its world building is garbage it also doesn t have any visual customization and the characters look like inbred experiments on the character select screen people use the word feedback but they really mean venting some less politely than others feedback to completely redesign a core system months before release is useless feedback but i guess it s good venting for people that s all it is people seem to forget that the best feedback is to simply not buy the game
exactly
same
this really says a lot about the anti feedback propaganda on this sub we re not allowed to want to change the thing you waited years for because otherwise you might ve been crazy for waiting for a game that didn t even exist or was announced until a few years ago and wasn t publicly played until like late last year
fanboyism
that s a good interpretation
aspects and uniques also change playstyle but yes
parangon in d3 minor power increases m okay you probably never played the game
this game and d3 are about characters complement gear vs gear complementing characters the more i see and read the more likely i m going to give it a pass will wait a few months to see what this game actually is before buying blizzard already took my d3 cash at launch and didn t give me my moneys worth
why can we not have more power in our choice of substats skills etc i don t know man we didn t design the game i m just saying that s not how they wanted it i will say that i m not playing poe and last epoch but i m still playing d3 and d2r so maybe it s the better formula i have all the choice i want in last epoch yet i m bored of the game
if you want every item to be a stat stick d2 and poe exist and are there for you and you can go back to those games asap games where of character power comes from clicking a node on a skill tree like d2 and poe are utterly braindead and have atrocious balance d2 sorc can clear the game naked and poe is a button spam cookie clicker
all the complainers are you reading the sub they want more skill diversity from the paragon board
i think it s meant to further customize and deepen your chosen builds did you see the legendary nodes in the leaks they are very meaningful more than just additional stats
i know you don t actually care about the answer but here it is because if you add them while leveling you have no idea what you re adding them for which is breakpoints on the paragon board in your scenario you add stat points how you think you should add them then you unlock the paragon board and see you ve been adding stats that don t make sense to hit breakpoints in the paragon board and you brick your character it s not like diablo where you only need str and dex to wear your gear and all the rest go into vit
because someone thought that adding stats to a character and having items have stat requirements is too hard so they added a basic arpg function of leveling a character to the endgame when it used to be part of the game portion of a game
you realize the paragon board does more than just give you stats right what would you do with the magic rare legendary nodes and glyphs from the paragon board if people could just allocate stats as they pleased plus if people could just add stats like d2 i don t see how it wouldn t turn into the same add as much str dex as you need to use your gear then cap vit but whatever is the best for d4 stats are not complex so it s often pretty easy to break it down to a very simple do this it s the best and then you ve invalidated the entire system
d4 s paragon isn t the same as d3 s though there was no choices to be made in d3 because progression never ended the legendary nodes in d4 are extremely powerful although they don t change your build they just further deepen it and the grind has an end so you can t just select everything like in d3 have to make a choice the devs don t care about reddit feedback their days are numbered with the microsoft buyout honestly i am glad and microsoft acquisition is probably a good thing because blizzard s upper management is pretty rotten
the truth hurts on this sub
if they have arthas black war horse meh forget its name as a mount then i m sold edit invincible thank you
in the last interview the devs said the same thing
if they could avoid putting anything and everything cartoon animoo related that d be great
always to each their own frankly people s names always break immersion for me more than their cosmetics seeing a sorcerer run around in a bikini i guess a little immersion breaking seeing a barbarian named bigballz running around with their druid friend cocksucker breaks it for me more
well d3 had whimsyshire and whimsydale which dropped stuff like a rainbow sword so be prepared for everything even though blizzard is usually very conservative my immersion usually get broken the moment a random player appears on screen i don t really care what they are wearing
i mean in lost ark there is a techno future world with mechs and stuff it s not really out of place in that game when you think about everything in their world i m not sure a stuffed bear would be out of place in diablo it s just some fabric sewn together and stuffed i m sure parents would make small trinkets and toys for their children i agree with not providing modern stuff that is clearly against the theme of sanctuary and they just don t have the technology around in that world to make many things i think their return to darkness pillar should help keep things like disco outfits out of the game diablo leans heavily on being an arpg with some optional mmo elements keeping a consistent theme is fairly important to that they need to make a game that players want to return to every season for a new character and with the pull of the game being a dark arpg they are probably going to try avoid things that are too flashy in d3 they gave out wings as back attachments but in d4 so far they ve only shown us a wing emote that temporarily provides wings but when you run around are not on i suspect they might do more things like this where they ll sell stuff that is a bit silly when you activate it but when you walk around you don t seem out of place
seconded
yeah i hope they don t go full ubisoft with the cosmetics
i think they have already gone on record saying no cosmetics will be immersion breaking
i already emailed blizz and said i d drop 2k if i can get a d3 rainblw cow pet
would love an option to not show cosmetics on anyone that way both parties can be happy immersion crowd vs rainbow dust crowd
i don t give a fuck about cosmetics and i will be avoiding all other players as much as possible i m not purchasing this game to play an mmo
yes please i don t want to see a bunch of people running around in diapers wearing horse heads and wielding giant purple fire hydrants please let s keep the cosmetics in theme or allow us to auto exclude people with silly themed cosmetics from appearing in our games
it s a blizzard game expect to see exclusive cosmetics related to presales of other games which will undoubtedly look out of place in sanctuary
strong agree and i m worried even about cosmetics getting way too flashy sometimes less is more subtlety and detail lend to a believable and immersive gothic medieval setting luckily i think blizz seem to be saying the right things about this so far from what i hear
i was thinking about a possible solution as there are people who might be serious about wearing plushy costumes and rainbow stuff or laser effects to their characters i think it won t make sense for blizzard to sell and then let us hide all the cosmetics from other people this way they could argue that their purchase would be less impactful but what about having skins spell effects arranged in categories where people could use settings to hide only some minor not fitting the theme categories for example main one the most common skins type in the shop diablo dark fantasy theme can t be hidden then the minor themes holiday theme can be hidden optional exception for guildies friends or party members modern future theme can be hidden optional exception for guildies friends or party members fun theme can be hidden optional exception for guildies friends or party members
i cannot stand when games have cosmetics that aren t in universe friendly i am big on immersion and it just takes me right out if i see someone looking like they re from a different game entirely
i can not upvote this enough it would be pretty gamebreaking
at the bare minimum i hope we can disable locally seeing cosmetics on other players sell things to those who want it but don t force it on others as well
yeah i hear that assassin s creed valhalla has a military camo armor cosmetic and ita so out of place and ridiculous
absolutely agree please keep butterfly wings and teddy bear pets out of the game
i want a leather jacket and a harley davidson mount and some sweet bright pink aviators
i can t wait to ride my shiny white rainbow farting unicorn
hey as long as we still get our comical array of personal little treasure goblin critters who follows us around picking up all our gold i don t need anything else
cosmetics are a make it or break it deal for me if people start running around looking like gaia online characters i m out
agreed it has to be lore friendly also they could always add spell effects that could help you make a good looking matching build kinda like poe had at the start those dont hurt the immersion at all
this is just like people saying d2 game design sucks as long as they don t stray completely away from the dark lore theme i think it s fine as that is what brings in money more people spend money on cutesy cool cosmetics then something dark just really hope if they do that they don t overflood it where it changes the whole theme of the game it all depends on what they offer an easy counter would be something sick like a duriel mount vs a unicorn
just because you said this i want a flossing teddy bear who does tik tok songs
you can always just not use cosmetics that you don t like i can understand not loving to see someone in something gaudy or not setting appropriate but if another player has more fun when their barbarian has butterfly wings then whatever doesn t really have to affect your experience unless you choose to let it and if you just can t tolerate the way others look when they enter your line of sight there are plenty of single player games diablo isn t actually dark and serious all the time and never has been the cow level did exist after all
i am pretty hyped for the game but if they put christmas tree mtx in the shop i will likely quit i played la for a while and still have no clue why a grown man would have fun running around in a purple teddy bear suit it is just super weird one can just hope blizzard doesn t destroy the atmosphere with such junk
more more moar more pink more fluffy more sparkly more unicorns and more rainbows
at launch diablo iv will have a gritty and grounded world a cow level wings or pets take away from that groundedness as they go down the line things will loosen up yeah i really hope they won t ever add wings or silly pets
no pjs please keep it immersive
strong disagree i hope they add silly fun stuff in bp being serious all the time is boring
i m certainly with you i don t think any of these new additions are something that will be inherently good for the game gameplay cosmetic or otherwise but modern day games man it is what it is i know at the least i ll enjoy getting through the campaign see how it starts to play out but i don t have much hope for it we already unlocked a cute wolf pup to strap to our back in the beta this is the starting point and to push those sales they have to outshine themselves each season adorable kittens and cat ears season you know it s coming
no diablo and lost ark stuff please keep the game dark and grim
could not agree more
shelly said no wings at launch slightly bummed but hoping we do get them later i want mean epic wings will grind or pay
how about no cosmetics at all and they focus on creating quality content for all players i would rather have a subscription fee then allow for micro transactions
wings everywhere
after seeing the necro skeletons i expect people to be riding about on unicorns with rainbow rabbit ears on
the hamburger weapon siriusly
i m hoping for sexy cosmetics
i want both
give us a mix of both let there be dark harrowing stuff for those who want it let there be brightly colored goofy stuff for those who want it hell slap some anime girl decalls on a saddle for those who want it if its in the store and you don t like it dont get it on a similar note doom eternal had some fantastic macabe skins but the rainbow unicorn skin in my opinion was just as fun worth the devs time as all the other stuff
i hope it does because it doesn t bother me but it clear does bother you
there is a good chance we will see the teddy bears and unicorns from diablo
i get only wanting lore themed cosmetics but i can guarantee you that by like season they will have literal clown costumes to buy
i ll take a coin sniffing teddy bear with the ability to eat leftover corps when bored or harass other non active players pets fuck that would be funny
if they sell maid costume i will buy
i d like to share another perspective teddybears suits smoking costumes and asian waifu costumes are all realistic actually in we have fursuits combat roleplayers gothic outfits retro 80s 70s 60s 50s 40s 30s 20s outfitters and enjoyers this rampant individualism is due to the growth of our progressive culture and this isn t a modern situation people throughout history obviously did this as much as society would allow so yeah bring on the zany cosmetics
sadly where cash cosmetics are concerned it s a question of when and not if
gif giphy xzsq4z8ehopbofpsmk
what about a bear cub hanging from a hook off my belt
i want wings
gaudy crap sells best ofc its gonna be in there literally the more artstyle breaking cosmetics are the more whales will pay
nah personally i hope cosmetics directly give us ways to make our characters more attractive even diablo was significantly better i don t think i ll end up paying for anything bland edgy fantasy has never been conservative or prudish monster hunter is a great example of being able to do this while keeping a consistent fantasy theme
op is one of those if i don t like something then you shouldn t also blizz had no problem with adding modern or even fanservice cosmetics in hots so be ready for everything if blizz wants to earn money via d4 if they put random swimsuit or some cute costumes as seasonal reward then amount of female sorc and rogues will increase drastically rip female necro fanservice cosmetics tho unless you are into anorectic flat as plank chicks with tourette syndrome shame they gutted female necro design and d4 character character creator is very bland and limited
my hope for cosmetics is that people decide to not spend money on them so blizz is forced to just scrap the real money shop altogether paid cosmetics fucking suck ass and take away creative energy from earn able cosmetics but gamers these days can t wait to open their wallets for cosmetics every week can t escape micros
i m super confused why cosmetics are a thing with this game like the view is way too zoomed out to make out any detail on a character so what is there to really see
i d be fine with no particular cosmetics but of course it will be a big deal because the product has to generate a steady income stream somehow anyway i won t be spending a time on cosmetics no matter what they introduce
i just want a chicken skin for raven cucco
i bet they ll have a wide range
after i heard that i won t be able to pet my wolf pup that i ll be getting for taking part in beta lvl char i m not so sure i want to buy the game anymore
i give it at best seasons until they run out of thematic cosmetics and start with the silly stuff or one festival whatever comes first
i was also hoping for no cutesy stuff and then the first cosmetic item they put out was a wolf cub in a backpack we don t stand a chance money talks
i think they should add a turn off cosmetics system i dont like to see modern or cute or other ips ingame but its activision
seriously why tf do ppl keep bringing up lost ark it s a korean mmo that just happens to use the isometric view angle it has absolutely nothing to do with diablo series isometric arpgs
i think they will preserve the tone of the game i hope at least until season or something
you are getting a wolf backpack it s already happening
i don t mind it personally but i can see why some people don t it can make an otherwise good looking scene look out of place
no i want a necromancer with a cow custom and rainbow sword and my cute wolf backpack
i hope i can fullass reskin my rogue into a protoss
they got alot of room to work with now that we can get mounts
i want all manner of things i m usually into things that aren t overstated but man some of those helms on the druid were sooooo dope i hope it s a bunch of different types wearing nothing but a bone necklace had me feeling cool af
the older the game gets the more variety of cosmetics i hope they keep things on theme for as long as possible and i don t have to see a bunch of teletubbies running around with no way to turn them off
the wolf pup backpack has me kinda concerned this is basically on the border of what i consider acceptable for diablo cosmetics while diablo appropriate it is a bit too cute for me i d probably be fine with it as a lone cutesy item in a sea of dark grisly cosmetics hopefully that s how it turns out this being the first example of a premium cosmetic has me nervous though i don t want the game full of cutesy stuff whether it s lore appropriate or not
i really don t think it s going to go the lost ark route lol that game has that because it fits the bright japanese style of lost ark
the cosmetics ive seen so far looked mostly ok from lore perspective the necromancer one bit too glowy perhaps still i don t see any reason to buy cosmetics in a game with seasonal resets but that s just me
what you didn t like the bikini swimsuits slutty armor dresses the mokoko outfits and teddybear suits i also didn t pay for that stuff myself while i played la last year hopefully they stay mostly diablo themed although i don t know how they will with stuff like easter christmas etc themed stuff reindeer and santa doesn t really fit with the sanctuary theme
i agree but i ve got to admit i d pay an embarrassing amount of money for conan red sonja inspired barbarian outfits
what u mean lore like think just cuz demons or taking over that ppl will be less furry npcs demon kinks will come out in the minds of npc stories maids dungeon mistresses etc let npcs live with freedom of choice of their styles freedom for all
with a game that has a more sinister graphic style i ll just pray that if when they go down the fortnite skin route they at least add a toggle to turn off other people s cosmetics
it will happen eventually dota cosmetics started out very minimal but over the games lifespan just got progressively more extreme and flashy in order to keep people buying cosmetics they basically have to keep one upping themselves otherwise players will just say this is less cool than my current cosmetics hopefully we ll eventually get a setting to hide other players cosmetics
i think they really want to stick with a dark diablo theme for this game they don t even want to have wings as a cosmetic only perhaps as an emote maybe one day for some cross promotional event they ll have a dark diablo looking zombie murloc pet
meh having a serious tone for years will get boring at the start sure keep things realistic but after a few seasons get crazy
plz no
the obvious emphasis on going back to grim and dark is your concern i don t think we will be seeing lost ark style fruit suits running around
invincible that would be bad ass
design philosophies change guild wars for example was nice on launch albeit the occasional clown who was dyed fully pink there wasn t a lot of obnoxious cosmetics but now it s just pure particle and glow vomit anywhere you go that s populated and existing in the game feels like you re having a bad trip while somebody flicks a flashlight on and off directly into your eyes
it s very interesting which visuals distract people more
i wish we could hide names
rng for all my names
i m pretty sure whimsyshire was just created out of spite because the players called d3 too colorful and some developer went all hold my beer
my immersion gets also broken when i go outside and see other people f real life
the difference is d3 you never see other players unless you choose to i really don t want to see a rainbow colored bear costumes that just goes against the amazing setting and atmosphere that i saw in the beta
interesting my immersion is broken when i play a single player open world rpg because i run around and never see a soul running into random players makes the world feel alittle more alive to me
i don t really care what they are wearing oh i care and it matters a lot as long as d4 cosmetics are in line with d4 lore and world i am ok with it but if d4 starts to add kpop dance emotes or some tiktok emotes hell no the game is ruined immediately same with butterfly wings on barbarian someone mentioned below hell no keep it grim keep it dark make it match the game
i loved that place such a trip bloody bears and flowers yes please
very conservative he is delusional
i m glad people are able to play updated versions of the games i had when i was young and still find them entertaining
the music is fucking awesome act music is the best
honestly i think most of the negative noise about d2 is from people who want to minimize the fact that d2 was so revolutionary and amazing it makes the new games really look not so great in comparison
i m playing right now atmosphere pacing visuals and even story telling are way better than d3 which i m also playing in s28 i m having a blast the combat however is fucking atrocious that s where the game s age blatantly shows and i don t understand how people can play it for hundreds thousands of hours nostalgia is the only rational reason it makes me appreciate d3 s buttery smooth combat and how d4 evolves the formula by slowing the pacing down
i might be a minority but i love the old school mechanics modern games all try to force players into a certain playstyle that s intended otherwise it just doesn t work at all i m not talking about ultra end game meta builds but even just decent builds that can do p8 hell example is modern arpg with the fixation on player s personal engagement in combat all your buffs and stuff last like seconds and has this and that limit or method to get it stronger you can t be lazy and just cast burst of speed or thunderstorm and let it do its thing or mercs d3 mercs were so weak they specifically said because they don t want them stealing the light for the player character well what if i want to in d2 you can give your merc op gear and watch them run around killing everything or otherwise at least they can be a crucial part of your build that helps you deal with monsters you can t personally or like what game now allows me to put on a aura and just walk around without doing any input and just burn entire screens to death passively well in d2 you have the dragonfire paladin
so many people say d2 aged poorly but i really don t see it maybe it s just from spending an ungodly amount of time playing as a kid burned my love for it into my core but when i booted up d2r when it released it really showed how good of a game it was it held up to time and really puts most modern games to shame i tried d3 again after getting my fix of d2r and i was blown away of just how worse of an arpg it was to me to be fair d3 nailed many aspects like the combat minus doing 10billion damage and an indistinguishable blob of spells and monsters flying everywhere late game but the earlier game combat is perfecto and is an enjoyable game on itself but as a sequel to d2 i feel it missed the mark the amount of fun i had with d2r eclipsed d3 so many times over any time i feel a diablo itch i go back to d2r or diablo diablo also held up excellently considering its age the beezelbub mod which puts the game at modern aspect ratio really kills it and i would also recommend that to any diablo fan i know nostalgia is a hell of a drug but compared to other remastered games of my past that i ve played d2 probably held up the best and from what i ve seen of d4 i m actually really pumped for the release and really hope it hits a similar level
normal difficulty is a bit of a sludge but nightmare and especially hell that s when d2r really gets juicy the main thing i miss about d2 versus most arpg is that certain items between still hold weight in the endgame stats aren t uselessly inflated which all together allows the combat to stay slower which makes skills have more feel whereas d3 or poe are like hey you re gonna need increased damage crit minimum and at very least critical multiplier around on d3 that s a pretty endgame character on poe that ll get you through the first few tiers of maps
yeah i actually installed diablo the other day i m playing through all of that then i ll play through d2r then i ll play through d3 again for like the time and that should take me to right around the diablo release i heard s28 in d3 isn t too bad so i m kinda hyped to play that after the other games i ve been really enjoying the trip
it s great i m having fun it s just really punishing and literally doesn t explain shit game is also played with one button of the time
d2 s main problem is the end game i ve been playing since the day it launched my whole childhood and now i have a lvl sorc and pally in that time i ve never found any items of real value and at my richest i was able to afford one single good item i ve played a few hundred hours of d2r and i ve been farming with mf gear on my sorc for ages and i can t even afford budget gear the only reason she s even slightly viable in hell is that i got lucky and found pieces of tal rashas unless you put unreasonable amounts of time into farming the same enemies or spend all your time trading and not actually playing the game you will never be able to afford good gear things like infinity are just so far out of reach for most people it s crazy some high runes have drop rates of like
i really debated buying it but ultimately decided not to i prefer to keep the memories of the way i think it was back in combat aged mercilessly in years and remaster didn t update that
d2r will never be bested not with blizzard at least
d2 probably have one of the smoothest game play in an arpg because skills are spamable and nothing is more satisfying than telestomp and blow monsters away
i only played the d2r beta but spent thousands of hours on the original d2 and lod expansion absolutely my favorite game of all time i need to bite the bullet but i was a bit soured on blizzard when it released and never gave it due course
i picked it back up once it was stable i played way back in the day and playing again has been great rebuilding all the builds i enjoyed playing was great and i chose a mosaic assassin which is a lot of fun to play this ladder season to be completely honestly this game will probably be like wow where i always come back every now and again to play for a little while it still scratches an itch for me that not many other games have at this point
d2 is the reason why people hate d4 and d3 it was also the inspiration for path of exile d2 is the greatest not to mention the story is phenomenal keep on rocking it man
back into it now too just about that dark gothic horror atmosphere for me and i just think the item art is so gorgeous and that much more compelling compared to any other diablo game and we ll never get that back with a single slot ui rather than the tetris inventory ui honestly
d2 is arguably one of the greatest game ever made
hating on the graphics of d2 or the combat is like hating on tetris for the graphics and pace diablo created and perfected this genre of game it is the foundation of this game type and all that come after it are copies of it and pay homage to it
i love the visual and atmosphere but i really can t get into it i tried several times but it s so slow that i felt bored while playing it
play last epoch
d2r is the best vibe for all the games and i count d4 beta in that
it was the online multi player game in its time for a reason literally was in guinness book of world records for its player size blizzard broke the mold with d2 that s why even after years it has a huge following and active player count
i played og d2 in internet cafes back in early 2000s when i didn t have internet access at home seems unreal nowadays lol must have sunk all of my pocket money and hundreds of hours back then it was an outstanding game with top tier online feel tristruns until tombruns until cows until resurrected had me relive my younger years briefly but the modern day thinking is blatantly obvious instant gratification it s where it s at i don t want to farm diablo or baal for 6hrs a day for a chance that he drops what i need i ve had my play through with a few characters enjoyed and haven t played it in months total play time maybe hours and that s fine it s a great game little outdated with its mechanics but hopefully d4 will spark my interest in arpgs again
bro d2r d3 or d4 glad you made it to the party although pretty late
totally agree
welcome to the dark side
im loving d2 but the grid movement with mouse is fucking horrendous
i bought it last night very nice feeling to play but i m completely lost lol i feel like i m just wandering blind without a world map and without a way to teleport to and from places i think i accidentally wasted my town portal too lol also the skill bar is weird you have to manually press buttons to attach your attacks to your mouse clicks seems weird wish it was like d4 where it s just a bar and you click your number key to cast the spells
i played it way back near launch on pc and hated it i thought about giving it another shot on console but never committed
d2 is good don t get me wrong but nostalgia makes everyone think it s way better than it actually is
if you think d2r is good you should play the poe league that starts tomorrow
what is the online functionality like with d2r also the merc system really bothers me i don t like having an npc running beside me that can die and that i need to gear
yeah i tried playing it for hours total i couldn t find a single redeeming quality the game is shit compared to the fun i had in d3 d4 i m surprised anyone born after the s could enjoy that game without any nostalgia for it maybe amazon is just a boring class but i was tired of pressing buttons stabbing enemies that have zero interaction outside of running up to you
what d2 is really really not complex at all compared to d3 lol
try a dragondin you d likely need to spend real money to even amass enough gear for it before d4 drops it s literally a build to walk around and let your fire aura just passively kill shit you can use zeal if you want but it isn t super important it s a walking loot clock simulator lots of things to love about d2 combat ain t one of them
yea played it first time after playing d4 beta and i have to admit i kinda like the early game better than d4s
the original diablo was on pc only i think and no co op etc all solo
it s garbage imho
d2 is an almost perfect game with the only thing i hate about it is monster immunities on hell whoever came up with the concept that some builds just can t kill certain monsters had a weird concept of fun
just a nit picky semantic issue nostalgia isn t logical it s emotional it s the only feeling worth connecting with connecting with would be a better description
d2r is a great game but starting from hell difficulty it becomes too unfun and tedious maybe they ll fix it in the future
probably didn t play d2 back when d2r should have been a free upgrade for owners of d2 it feels like a blatant cash grab i had my fun back in the days with d2 but i ve seen things and done things already the arpg scene has been a desolate wasteland for so long d3 is over years old too so i m not surprised people jumped on d2r d4 will probably suck up everybody and they won t even look back at d2r or d3 after a few months
went back to play it to catch up on the story and lore having a blast playing a pally since there isn t one in d4 yet
it looks great plays great and you have mods to make up for most of its deficiencies the d4 beta is the only reason i bought d2r as i had written it off on release because of the price
how u kill duriel thou what class and specc plz
as a player that enjoyed d2 d3 and the d4 beta i m glad to hear that you re able to enjoy not just the new games but also the old ones even with a new coat of paint the old mechanics can be difficult to get used to goes to show that d2 is a solid game
i played d2r when it first launched for months straight and got bored same map same mobs same routine everyday there s really nothing else to do but that then you reset and do it over and over again
funny i went the other way started playing diablo instead of diablo haha
i m really thinking abut buying it on this sale but i m not sure i would get around to playing it at all before d4 releases d
for me the combat is a game breaker atmosphere is great but the combat it s just to old for me and in a game where you fight of the time if the combat is garbage then why would i bother playing it s my opinion you guys can enjoy it lol
can you believe the game came out years ago teenage me was crazy addicted
easiest way to test the theory get a group of friends that have never played d2 before to try d2r and then d4 see which one they prefer make sure you tell them the combat doesn t really change past level i was a massive diablo player always told d3 was dogshit and diablo was godly i remember playing diablo for a few days back in x200b played d2r without nostalgia story line was ok but basically i had all my skills druid summon build at level and i just stayed off screen while my pets solod the game that everyone told me was really hard and complex ended up getting bored with nothing major to look forward to
with the terror zones they added you don t really have to trade anymore you can get everything in the game with enough farming just some of the super rare items or runes might still evade you but it s nothing like it used to be
well if d3 had the more mature dark atmosphere of d2 and d1 it would be almost fucking perfect
honestly i think all the diablo games are good in their own way d1 has such a great atmosphere and the story feels so grounded since it s focused on one town and how this tragedy is affecting the people in it d2 has such a satisfying level progression and you can really feel your character grow with better items and levels even the black sheep d3 has satisfying abilities combo rotations and they really smoothed out the grind to not feel as tedious i understand that each of the games have their issues but none of them are as horrible as some are making them out to be lol
for anyone who doesn t understand why d2 s combat aged poorly try hitting monsters with blizzard in d2
such as the complexity and reliance on trading i play almost exclusively hc and selffound not counting the occasional gift from another player when they happen to drop something useful in an open game it s also not that complex imho statwise you dump everything in vit you don t need for gear barring a couple exceptions like bow amazon or going maxblock which is also just putting points into dex until you hit bock chance skills are basically max your mainskills and synergies maybe a couple go to utilities granted there are a couple more in depth things like ias or fcr breakpoints but they re only really needed for some builds and if you decide to minmax
i m old school gg player not bot user advice to trade up gems are valuable to trade for runes
you re glad other people can enjoy things excuse me sir but this is the internet you re not allowed to let others be happy only your opinion matters s
its really fun too playing something like d2 or baldurs gate for the first time after playing its successors like poe or dragons age its amazing to see how influential those older titles were and how familiar they feel despite it being a 1st playthrough
true i use them in my dnd campaign

thats a long way of saying d3 fans who cant accept that they are playing a massively inferior game
it s not only nostalgia but that is a big part of it finding a big item still triggers my monkey brain even years later
you don t think chugging mana pots and spamming right click is peak arpg
i just actually like d2 s better simple as not saying that diablo is a bad game far from it just a matter of taste
once you have a full build in d2 you get why people like to put in all the time and by the time you get said items you re hooked on that dopamine rush of what s gonna drop next lol
i ve tried but i just can t get into d2r guess i ve just played too much d3 to go back to this combat potion chugging
this is exactly my thoughts about d2 while it s good it simply makes any modern game feel god like
i wonder if the combat is smoother with a controller vs pc i find it a bit dated sure but overall i quite like it
for me the combat may not be great but as far as the overall atmosphere etc that you mention in your first paragraph the game nailed those so i treat it as more of a jaunt through the past i also tend to play a minion heavy necromancer when doing so helps a bit with the combat
i hope mounts will speed up the pace again since all that running around wasn t a peak experience honestly
that s the thing for me i instantly downloaded d2r once i saw the sale definitely loving the lore main story so far but it s just so janky makes it hard to want to keep playing sometimes plus i loved d4 mini map d2r i m always lost or going the wrong way lol
i do prefer the combat of the later games very very much but the game design and mechanics and customization offering of most things in d2 works better than most later games i personally enjoy trying to find and collect trophy item rares whether it be from mfing or trading aside from that i stopped playing d2r because i already mastered all of it s content and did all the achievements that the general would have i do however often go back to private server of d2 which still runs on the original d2 gfx which is highly frustrating but the many many many new content that it provides outweighs the graphics which is normally not the case people are able to play hundreds and thousands of hours because mfing and trading is addicting when you think you found one good item which you get massively happy about you later find something even better high runes are just so rare so when you find one it s like hitting the lottery as for those uniques sets that are high demand it s just another make your day type find overally mfing is very very addicting even though it is repetitive and boring if you were to think about it when you try to grind to max level every playtime will have hours passed before you realize it but you are still motivated to go grind out that achievement
the combat is not atrocious your take is atrocious the combat is not meant to be overly complex it s more about efficiency killing things as fast as possible playing hardcore also heightens the sense of dread lurking around every corner because you need to take engagements seriously which makes the game more about spacing and positioning more than anything
early game is a slog once you can hit lvl and start farming hell the game picks up the pase it s definitely a far cry from d3 where they give you a free start for every class d2 is not something you can pick up drop hours in and finish up with full sets a gear it s slower experience the game is basically harder
speak for yourself i prefer d2 melee combat to d3 i am shocked by posts every day to the point that i doubt they are not troll posts omg the game d2 that is widely regarded as the best arpg ever created the whole genre and has every arpg for the last years compared to it is actually good
yeah i can t do it because of the combat i m playing d3 now
yeah when they said this game was coming out for console my first thoughts were how the fuck is anybody going to play this on a controller that being said the combat is still a bit dated for me where it shines is the pacing once you reach best tier gear especially when it comes to pvp when everybody is wearing an enigma and has stacked faster cast rates you step into the blood moor and it turns into a dragon ball z speed battle teleporting around at lightning speeds trying to land a hit on one another for what will likely be a one hit kill it gets my heart pumping and there s nothing i ve ever played in my life like it i m really excited for diablo pvp the rogue has so much mobility i am really hoping it can scratch that itch for me
playing on console
yeah it doesn t hold up gameplay or options wise against modern arpg but the game is fun and the plot is good it s a good jaunt through history
nobody plays it for the combat people still play it because they re addicted to the dopamine rush they get when an ultra rare item rune drops don t get me wrong it s a great game and i ve put many hours into it but yeah nobody is playing d2 for the combat it s the loot that keeps people hooked
i d like to get into d2r but god my wind druid is boring af to play i was lvl 50ish and while i could go through the game two more times to get to the real endgame of spamming tornados at bosses for loot there s a lot of other things i d rather do
there s something to be said for player choice i appreciate games nowadays that give you the option of handholding or just going in blind and figuring it out
i feel like new arpgs have false progress baked into them so people won t quit d3 you can get max lvl in a hour or and they drop a full set in your lap around the same time legendary items rain from the sky so the build you want is only another couple hours of farming away idk d3 was super fun and i m stoked about d4 but i feel the hate given to d2 is basically because the game is hard and you have to actually spend time trying to build a character when new games just give you the shit
d2 did not age poorly the strong player base over the course of the past years disproves that immediately that is an objective observation people that think the game aged poorly have zoomer brain and probably don t appreciate any game that doesn t cater to their need for instant gratification
thinking d2 aged poorly is a completely moronic take i dare people to go play a bunch of other games that came out in and then tell me what makes d2 so bad
never heard that it aged poor its considered a legendary game after all
it s hard to explain but d2r feels kind of tidy and satisfying d3 i do love don t get me wrong but it s so much more to take in and sometimes my brain just doesn t want all that maybe i m autistic
it s because when a franchise is new the devs are all passionate and gamers as the franchise gains success and investor eyeballs it starts losing its charm to appeal to a wider and more casual audience
diablo is one of the smoothest gaming experiences of all time zero people have ever said it aged poorly lmao it is one of the most replayed year old games of all time by a long margin
i don t like d4 but i updated your take of d2 personally i don t like d4 because i feel it s put too much reliance on mmorpg mechanics which i don t like i ve played wow i wasn t a fan i m not saying it should be d2 i m just saying i wish it didn t have mmorpg mechanics
poe has this really weird meta where every season the devs introduce a convoluted game mechanic they haven t thought through very well and then someone figures a way to abuse it to a totally broken state and there goes your fotm poe build with millions of dps actually intended builds are much more tame with numbers still reasonable for human brains
that s what gave me the push the other night to hang up d3 for now i was levelling up my dh alt which admittedly i geared up and i had it on torment v and everything was still just melting within seconds i could have kept bumping up the difficulty but i kind of got tired of that and just wanted a fresh start on something new with an organic challenge to it
this comment makes no sense in regards to poe poe builds are in the millions of dps and d3 builds are in the trillions the difference between the average poe build and the average d3 build is trillions of dps
why do so many people lie about poe on this sub
diablo is still unbeatable unique in many gameplay designs so it is good to experience
i still have my old diablo cd but my computer dont have a cd reader anymore
it s just really punishing and literally doesn t explain shit yeah i think the difficulty for newcomers to d2 comes from lack of knowledge the game itself is certainly not the most challenging game ever made it s just that the game doesn t hold your hand and introduce every single mechanic it was made in a time where players were rewarded for exploring unlike today s games that guide you through everything so most new players don t even know about some of the most basic things and often struggle with mechanics such as stamina being chilled hit recovery etc all of which are trivial for anyone that has played the game since there aren t really any tutorials in the game many community websites were created to help people the primary strategy guide is here https://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/ game is also played with one button of the time well is a bit high but yes many builds have ability that deals damage and others are for support though i m not sure if you mean this as a negative maybe you prefer mashing many buttons over button however there are also many builds which use several buttons a couple of which are fire druid and basically any martial arts assassin
amen brother look forward to follow ur diary here
never understood why anyone cares what some random on the internet thinks even if they have millions of followers their opinion on what s fun is as worthless to me as any other persons opinion i know what i like and that s enough
d4 drought bringing out all sorts of post
i m i hear you one of the reasons i stopped datamining about new wow x pacs and reading everything as much as possible it destroyed a lot of fun for me including all the flames what changed this i try to keep dumb don t read up about patches till they hit up no beta no ptr i go dumb into an xpac and simply enjoy what i see and can discover no addons until later like rarefinder makes it a lot more exciting and most important i have a chance to fail or do something wrong not the perfect skillset not the perfect enchant or whatever i just play the way i like and think it s right and the same goes for diablo and hell did it help myself to enjoy playing again even with a lot less time and more stress today
don t let an often toxic reddit crowd distract you from the game this is a small small subset of the overall population who plays the game the most vocal of the vocal poor information is often disseminated it was a very pleasant beta experience and the end game can only be better you ll have fun
well said and reasonable i ll def be doing something similar as misinformation and bad faith abound
i m excited i can t wait to explore and take everything in for the first time and enjoy something i ve been waiting so long for
i just watch and read what blizzard puts out its from the source i don t need to look up videos of other people playing or reviewing the game i don t care about their opinions i ve been keeping up with it i ve played it i love it i m ready for it the betas were such a tease
fuck these idiots who do nothing in life but shit on stuff
op makes a drunken stream of consciousness post saying he should avoid toxic redditors meanwhile somewhere else on this page a toxic redditor appears
i feel like i stumbled onto someone s personal blog or something
the first sentence sounds like the intro to a slim shady song
a person may change people do not
well think about it this way when you were a kid and into video games you went to local blockbuster or hollywood and picked whatever games had a cool cover to rent or you had demo disc and just tried every game on it you never looked at a guide or even heard your friends mention some of the games but you tried it and either liked or disliked it if you want that pure discovery untainted by others opinions then yes stay away from social media even if its the hypest shit sometimes that takes away from seeing stuff yourself for the first time and all these channels do is post leaks for any game or if a trailer comes out people criticize what they saw and then comes the oh man these guys haven t seen the leaks you guys are overreacting then there s a battle back n forth skip that shit go dark mode and enjoy the game as it comes out if you already enjoyed the beta man
i ve only been subscribed to this subreddit since right before the early access weekend i ve never seen such a toxic lot to be honest people on both sides i ve every argument need to chill the hell out but that s how all video game subreddits are no it s absolutely not factorio subreddit is extremely welcoming and kind satisfactory and valheim subs are great as well classicwow had some drama over the years for sure but it was never ever like this just relax people stop insulting people who disagree with you stop being surprised that not everyone likes the same things stop attacking the developers grow up and be an adult
you know what they say the best way to ignore criticism and toxicity is visiting and posting on a subreddit
ha what mr mcconaughey is that you please step out of the lincoln
say change again
how are you going to type a novella to say nothing at all the posts on this sub lmao
i fucking hate hate these posts
wtf it was so long and weird that i didn t even read is there a tldr
you took a lot of words to basically say form your own opinions on things the rest of us have been doing that and the posts you see on reddit are people s opinions not toxic redditors you are your own problem and you basically just added to the noise what an idiot
man i m not excited about this game but that doesn t mean you can t be
ok boomer
note i played the beta and enjoyed it loved the story gameplay environment didn t love the lag and queues but hey it s beta solve the functional stuff first and let us enjoy the game my main gripe is likely going to be that part of the collectors ultimate edition is early access we all know that the first days of early access is going to be a shit show just like the betas were i d like to know what the devs are going to do for the people that get scammed by the early access lies a credit free skins if i sold tickets to people for early access to take things out of my home but only let people in and then made everyone else wait hours i d be sued for false advertising if they say ea can t be guaranteed bullshit lie that it is then ea shouldn t be a part of any pre bought game or edition
sir this is reddit
it s not that big of a deal maybe stay off social and just play the game nobody else s opinions matter
kinda ironic saying your gonna stay away while posting on reddit
i m actually thinking about making a youtube channel aimed at people like us no clickbait mostly informational it probably won t go anywhere because said types mostly try and ignore information but oh well
i played the beta and loved it i didn t have a single negative thought about it no complaints until i joined this subreddit and started watching videos i never thought dungeons were repetitive until i heard someone else say it i never thought the pargone board looked lacking until someone else said it i still don t think any of those things but when you hear someone else say it it starts putting the question in the back of your head so i agree i m tired of people tainting my experience and putting opinions in my head that i wouldnt have ever thought on my own this has happened to many games for me the past decade or so i get excited about a game try to join a community to share the enjoyment with and then subject myself to a lot of people s negativity that honestly tarnishes my experience to some degree
oh fresh pasta is served delectable drivel delivered from the deepest of caves a bait from the heavens to lure the mightiest of trolls brothers and sisters today we shall feed
bro is the one who knocks
did this really need a post can you not abstain from reading posts and watching videos on your own we all need to know about it
i engage in a lot of the shit flinging because i do have some strong opinions about the genre and about game design in general i work in the industry and have been to a lot of game industry conferences but at the end of the day its just a game and you might read what i write and think i m seething at my desk but i genuinely don t give much of a damn i ll play it have plenty of fun i bet and still have plenty of areas i think could ve been better that s just how it is its a game you can have strong opinions about game design and yet still just think it will be mostly just good fun in the end see you all in sanctuary where i will never stop complaining about the inventory design yet will still enjoy it just fine
blizzard fanboys have always been notorious for being extremely hostile towards anyone who doesn t like the same game anyone not on their skill level anyone with a different opinion and especially towards blizzard they remaun spoiled children well into adulthood i came here because i was impressed with the beta i preordered it and will play with of my friends a lot of people on this subreddit are pure garbage best to play the game for your own enjoyment and ignore them
too long reading is hard
blizzard don t deserve your hope or respect and will continue taking your money while you give them credit for things they did years ago that company no longer exists if you have still not realised that then i m afraid to say there s no hope for you either also it s incredibly ironic to make a post about diablo via internet social media about not reading or listening to any internet social media concerning diablo lol it s all too much oh you poor thing but you made sure to put out your sentimental little piece though lol if it s all too flooded and sooo overwhelming for you why are you also contributing to it as well hmmm do i sense some insincerity perhaps blizzard did great things blizzard did terrible things what you conveniently leave out here is they did great things at the start and terrible things in the second half of their timeline it s not like an equal spread it s a very clear downward trend to mediocrity and money grubbing behaviour all the shit started with activision blizzard you very much try to obfuscate that fact though keep blindly trusting and hoping in blizzard while they re pounding you in the ass for decades yeah no thanks i m not stupid maybe you are though
i try to explain the problem is not the single opinion from an influencer of any kind the problem is the reach influence of his opinion that s why we call them like that sure if his mental care is at least average nothing to worry about but just look around you you will see unhealthy influence praised like the cuming of jesus i know what i like and that s enough that s actually great but you are the minority many ppl are for many reason not confident enough to rely on their own thinking that s not the end of the world but we should look after each other and call out bullshit
i know for myself i would come here to see what new info is being shared and the excitement i feel about the game i feel like the backseat game designers that haven t made or done anything constructive really want to be heard because that s as close to being involved with game development as they will get i wonder how many of the people shitting on the game so much are just wanting more attention towards the arpg they play rather than d4 at this point i just need to chuckle at how mad the toxic doomers are getting and carry on with my day
one of the few fair takes in the sub
and yet you are here because we are all social pattern seeking monkeys that s what we do giving out opinions is part of the experience it s when the opinions are offensive or insane that problems start he wanted to share doesn t necessarily mean he cares that much tho either you cared enough to read it
underrated comment right here the collective frustration is palpable i can feel it oozing out of my monitor lmao source from a diablo fan that s counting down the days till d4 release fighting the urge to pay another just to access the game that much sooner
man i knew people who play world of warcraft would love d4 personally i hate world of warcraft but hey man you do you
completely agree i m actively blocking any channels that has best class to play this build or that build trying to figure out your build and fail is where the fun lies without some streamer going hey guys today imma be showing you the best way to play xyz class and build
i agree and that s part of the concern i shared the most vocal of the vocal began to influence decisions that affect everyone maybe it s time to be less silent i believe it was that line of thought which inspired me to share this post i m actually positively surprised by having people coming out and express their own thoughts in a very civilized manner
bunbun blocked for following me around in this thread and others being aggro af i m not here to fulfill wishes for flame wars or engage with angry people who take posts uber personally if you don t like me block me
i think it s fair to say some people didn t enjoy the experience and calling those people toxic is such a stupid and fanboyish thing to do
i ve got a question and it s not meant to throw shade at you for any reason i m just curious did you play and like world of warcraft
i guess you did this was a deep thought probably poorly written to express my personal opinion about the subject i did flag it as opinion
thanks for sharing most of the games you mention i enjoyed them over these last years and i agree that those communities are indeed very welcoming i feel that you voiced effectively what i was trying to in the original post
this is standard fair for bliz stuff gods the wow forums were nothing but whining bitching and flame wars it might have calmed a bit but for the years i played from bc up to shadowlands the game was dead x class is insert vile adjective of your choice and generally everyone hated everyone and everything they especially hated wow not saying it s right just that i am really really not the slightest bit shocked by how most of the posts on this reddit go
linnnnnnnncolnnnnnnnnn rolls booger
i double dog dare you
yeah i thought there would be a point too at the end some people just post to post i guess
deleted
i m not sure what you mean i believe the point is there if you don t feel it or agree with it it s ok opinions are subjective you can post yours or move to a sub that you feel you can relate to
upvoted
i m not sure why you seek out to be so aggressive people form opinions and sometimes decide to share them i just shared mine you didn t like this post that s fine the energy you invested in calling me an idiot should have been used elsewhere doing something you actually enjoy
wow you gonna be ok sweetheart
no you don t know that untrue no you can t say it s a scam untrue man these posts bring out the fury
i dont think cuming of jesus is what the saying is
happy cake day yeah i agree with everything you said i worded my thoughts poorly bottom line is i want the op to remember that he decides what he likes andn o one else
happy cake day
nearly every video game subreddit is just like this especially upon release i ve seen it time and time again negativity people complaining then months to a year after release the subreddit start to chill out and the people who remain are the ones who truly enjoy the game and want to share positive experiences
true
i wasn t being negative to him at least didn t want to come across as such and i do enjoy reading opinions wouldn t be on reddit otherwise but as op said there are so many negative people out there that take away enjoyment from people and make them feel like they should not enjoy the game i think it s a good reminder that fun is very subjective i don t really care for the opinions of others when it comes to what is fun doesn t mean i cannot enjoy or interact with other subjects
not even that it s that there are two emotionally charged groups d2 fans and d3 fans that like very different games and hope for very different things from d4 a d2 fan says d3 sucks a d3 fan says d2 is a one skill game anyway and combat sucks we value our respective likes and our monkey brains get emotionally charged when someone attacks things that are a part of our identity so things can get heated
i must agree with you this is my first post in reddit and it was the first time i felt the need to voice my thoughts to complete strangers in a community i d like to thrive by having a game we actually enjoy playing the ones that do and the people that may not like the game i respect you and your opinion it s also ok to move on and try the next one that maybe you ll enjoy
agreed the 2nd sentence upsets me too hive mind downvotes shit posting all of it is kinda dumb i don t think it s a realistic expectation to think all posts will be reasonable but i think you can learn a lot here about d4 enjoy a lot of funny posts and converse with some very smart people you just need to filter and learn when to engage not you personally enjoy the ride friend days
i had some dude dm me after i told him he was jumping to conclusions on another comment then people spew bullshit like this as if there is no toxicity on this subreddit only valid criticism
sooooo everyone who disagrees offers perfect measured and accurate feedback really
i tried wow but it was not something i cared for too much it was for several reasons the big one being i had to pay monthly to even play it the graphics were not to my liking it s just not my preferred style no offense to people who do like it i only played for a trial period but overall i wasn t impressed by the game play i had a friend compare d4 to wow at least what wow used to be in the early stages i don t necessarily see it but i also didn t play the trial period for very long either way not too worried about it i played both betas in march and i can t wait to see more content
just like this one
same to you your post and this one now is just as bad
yeah i spend a lot of time calling people idiots it s my problem and i should be better about it i could have left it off and still gotten my point across i apologize for needlessly adding an insult
i m fine are you gonna be ok i triggered you enough to elicit a response this idiot triggered me enough to elicit a response good job adding to the pile
no you don t know that untrue no you can t say it s a scam welp ya go me never mind that every single launch they ve ever had has had hours long queue times or severe server instability during ea let alone actual launch day no you can t say it s a scam let s see scam of verb scammed scamming scams transitive verb to deceive and defraud someone to obtain something such as money by a scam so let s see they obtain money but they deceive people by saying it will include early access but in all their launches the servers are instable and not every one can log in sure seems like the very definition of scam to me do your lips and other downvoters get chapped kissing the asses of billion dollar companies blizzard isn t the only company guilty of this crap nearly every other big developer does the same thing feel free to come back here and admonish me if it goes smoothly i m sure i won t receive a sorry from you when it s a full shitshow as most people expect it to be
i think it should it has a nice ring to it
cake day is birthday on reddit good to know thanks
didn t say you were and not attempting to be confrontational you were just stating your opinion you cleared it all up thanks for your time
you didn t come across as negative towards me at all i actually agree with you and i don t usually mind other people s opinion on the other hand i have seen games that i enjoyed failing while trying to pursue a minor representation of the community that plays it just because they are able to voice their opinion and create a sort of snowball effect the intention of my post was only to vent out my thoughts on it and maybe reach out to someone out there who feels the same way
i misunderstood wolf at first for one thing i m fine with people being emotionally charged i just want logical feedback and for it to relate to the topic i want people to base their opinion on facts or good rationale for their opinion not poop flinging no one should be tying their identity to a game at all
i liked both d2 and d3 for different reasons i think it s still fair i didn t enjoy the experience of d4 but that s because i hate skinnerbox mechanics that mmorpgs are designed around i ve said a hundred times that i may not enjoy d4 but my little brother who plays world of warcraft will absolutely love what d4 has to offer i think it s fair to say that each person has their own definition of fun and they should see for themselves whether they like something or not
exactly you can see them coming a mile away their first post will be wildly confrontational and it goes downhill from there if the timing is right and they get some upvotes then they get more validation and become even more aggressive if you really struck a nerve they will follow you around downvoting and angrily denouncing you across multiple threads i don t engage anymore it s annoying people take things personally didn t understand you are having a bad day etc not worth it to explain every time or win a debate you really have to actively filter and block
i never said that but that s the conclusion you jumped to because you want the world to be black and white
interesting i too am also claiming it is similar to wow more of a mmorpg rather than a arpg but i ve seen so many people who like wow and also love d4 that s why i was curious to be honest i also did not care for wow do you know that d4 with have battlepasses essentially making it a monthly payment for content i wonder what will be excluded from the game to fill those battle passes honestly
good then you won t mind the block bye
that realization is very refreshing and i hope you may use it in the days to come no harm done we part ways in peace
bad day
no you won t coz you re just gonna get blocked bye
it actually isn t though imo it should be your cake day is the first day you made your reddit account not really sure why that s worth celebrating but whatever
sometimes i wished reddit had voice messages i find it always so hard to understand intentions from written text thanks for the talk
tying their identity to a game at all yep also shouldn t be tying their identity to a particular political party but to some one side is full of crooks and liars and the other side can do no wrong and holding an opposing view may open you up to verbal assault
it sounded to me like he was saying ignore the toxicity not everyone who hates the game is toxic
the battle passes are just for cosmetics it s not going to be a pay to win game it s not going to be like immortals they have already addressed that issue i won t be buying a battle pass because i don t care about cosmetics that much and yeah diablo reminds me of baldurs gate elder scrolls skyrim and eso and d2 and d3 it s like they took different genres of games and created their own it s like a mmorpg and arpg had a baby lol i think d4 is about to be one of the most popular games out there because of this it s graphically amazing the game play is unique
oh look another fragile manchild neckbeard who is physically incapable of anyone saying anything negative about poor old blizzard activision lmao
yeah it comes from dealing with assholes all day at my job i ve gotten so jaded i just add an insult anytime i disagree with someone
that s why it s called cake day cake is pretty stupid
it s a tightrope and i ve fallen from it many times still do from time to time lol you too man
a good assessment of both sides more than that i shan t add be well
bit of armchair psychology but i genuinely think it s a mix of excitement and expectation seriously it s like when you re fan of a sports team but you shit all over them and they ruin your day if they lose a match the diablo franchise means a lot to a great deal of people and i think this time around you cannot dodge the recent controversy around blizzard as a company either to be a bit of spice on top my thing is that i find people lack a ton of perspective when they are evaluating how good and complete this game will be on launch and i say launch because i think we are very far away from seeing a final rendition of what d4 will look like once the devs can incorporate feedback and have the time to make the changes that they wish to make people seem in denial on this point but this game will launch with a ton of ready content for end game grinds albeit needing some polish over time can anyone in their right mind detail how amazing lost ark was on launch day how much content and systems did path of exile have does anyone remember poe is an amazing game today due to the changes they ve made to a solid core system over time i find the engine and groundwork for d4 to be of really good quality like seriously it slaps d3 around it s a lot harder to change the foundations of a game than system specific mechanics i actually agree with a lot of the worries around itemization but i can also tell that this game come june will not have all the changes i want in it but i do think over time they can do some really amazing things with this game
entitled nerds
you are right that at launch there will be a good chunk of content for us to do however what we have seen is very shallow compared to multiple other arpgs given that they would have been watching the success of other arpg endgame systems i would have hoped that a strong endgame loop was baked into launch it is very important to look at the games competition not as a contest but as a a rising tide floats all ships we all want the blizzard ship to float up with the rest all the people upset will have a great first month or two but we want a game we will be playing a year from now because there is no strong endgame at launch we are counting on seasons fingers crossed however blizzard has a bad history with providing good seasonal changes especially if they hold the good stuff in reserve for expansions that being said i do acknowledge the additional monetization gives them more incentive to continue development but if season just add sets and no gameplay mechanic then i m going to play something else before anyone says this game is for casuals or non elitist gamers please realize there are plenty of games that are designed to be enjoyable for both types of gamers a game can have depth and be accessible gamer demographics are not mutually exclusive
i think people are over estimating blizzard look at the track record over the last several years
because the average person that decides to dedicate time to respond to basically anything is usually driven by negativity rather than the opposite
i think the real question is why are all there more posts in this sub complaining about the haters than getting excited about anything they ve just announced
i think it seems fine but was badly presented for example pretty much all they showed of paragon was willpower etc so it looks boring there seem to be better nodes boosts on there why not show them they promoted the pvp stuff how exciting it will be trying to get your gems back to town safe to then use to roll on blue gloves yay dungeon affixes dev says his favorite is hell gates that spawn mobs from other dungeons meh plus they showed it spawning two mobs content seems fine especially for launch presentation talking heads were dire
i m seeing more posts talking about the negativity on this sub compared to actual negativity is it just me is the reddit algorithm doing a good job filtering those out
the content of the video was decent but holy shit everyone in the video looked like they were being held hostage
high guys would you like dex or str or hp on your next paragon level
because it s awful
because it s blizzard entertainment the level of trust between the consumer and the company is very low coming off diablo immortal players expect the worst and will approach diablo with heightened levels of caution it s really the company s fault they ve gone from most beloved to most loathed
blizzard doesn t do a great job explaining the paragon system likely because the intended audience for their promotional materials isn t a power gamer here s a more in depth look https://youtu.be/3bbrsstwitq
from what i read on here mostly because it felt like a marketing video and not an in depth preview with the developers as far as i m aware all the stuff we saw was already known in more detail through leaks and datamines people just expected more details or entirely new infos but got kinda shallow marketing talk
wasn t this video a trailer teaser of end game so they purposely didn t show a lot
i have no criticisms to throw at the game from the video they put out but the video itself was just fluff and not interesting i don t think i learned one new thing in it
because it was a shallow marketing talk showing it was nothing in depth and most of the people talking did not seem genuine at all it was just so cringe
its okay to dislike what the video showed regardless of what might be the endgame case the fact is that video showed barely anything so people have the right to be mad or least the right to dislike the video if they have all these amazing systems then show it there s no underestimating or anything like that the video was just not that good and you judge a game based off what is presented not what you don t officially know about the game especially in the case of leaks diablo is marketed towards casuals and guess what they don t deep dive into leaked docs and all the stuff that s opposite of casual mentality they only watch launch trailers and official videos and then buy the game based off that or reviews
kinda funny how you re claiming that people are upset but most people aren t lol some people being upset is quite normal expectations are high d3 exists and people expect d4 to be an upgrade over current d3 not launch d3 so yeah the video itself was pretty slim on actual information given mostly marketing speech and empty phrases i would have loved a more in depth view into endgame but given how empty most previous video were i wasn t expecting that
i m not upset any piece of footage makes me even more hyped can t wait don t fall into the misery trap it s ok to like d4 lol and yes d4 will be bigger than d2 or d3 at launch
why are people upset huh i don t know maybe because what was shown in this video was massively disappointing to anyone who s been playing other hns than diablo these past years and thus has higher standards the paragon board looks extremely poor in content and the end game seems really bad in comparaison to the end game of most other hns out there
the recent video has gotten me so hyped that i pulled the trigger and pre ordered the deluxe edition
having someone say decisions that matter or words to that effect juxtaposed over a video of someone repeatedly adding stat is comically bad marketing and inevitably going to cause backlash blizzard are either completely tone death or just straight up trolling people
gaming subreddit s are the worst kind of echo chambers where nerds like to circlejerk about literally everything
you want the truth i expect more from multi billion company like they showed nightmare mod on dungeon which is basically beyond from poe beyond was league in poe that was released in august and it is removed from poe cause it is too old and obsolete it is ok when poe on start copied d2 when le copies d2 or poe but blizzard have such resources that we should expect something never seen before
why do you even care
some pretty bad takes here the game seems super shallow but with a glossy coat of paint to make it seem deep great there s this super awesome paragon board that will allow you to customize your character except all it has is strength and the like
idk why i was mad mostly because i thought they made it instead of doing the live stream part of me hoped the paragon board was more exciting part of me is just mad i have to wait till june to play again
most people are irritated that it was a pr video that revealed absolutely nothing that wasn t already known not only did they not mention anything knew what they did mention lacked any detail whatsoever you can literally learn 10x more about the end game by reading this sub than watching that pointless video
maybe this is a different take to the usual while i was watching it i m not really upset with it by the way but just thoughts i couldn t help but think are we almost too close to games and the devs these days about halfway through i just kinda started thinking to myself do i really want or need to know all of this stuff before i go and enjoy it myself in game literally like this is really just a peak about how they make it go forever took me out of it a bit i guess cause it all felt a bit meh like i was just spoiling it briefing me on my next job instead of experiencing it and having fun with it as a surprise in game i know fmvs can get people riled up as not gameplay or whatever but to juxtapose this just the intro vid to the beta was all the hype i needed to get me interested in the story tone and setting for the game beta was great i know this is something i want to check out but peeking behind the curtain like this is kinda dull i guess it s informative and i don t have to watch it obviously but it presented like a training video for the flipping burgers part of diablo i was about to partake in
so i understand it showed nothing really about endgame for people on edge to buy the game it did nothing for us i m waiting until we actually see the end game to buy it
blizzard sort of reminds of that heavily autistic kid who s a maths wizard but has the social grace of a year old potato
because it is a trail of crumbs there is like zero new information
the better question is why are people so upset over everything
why are you so upset and concerned you need to make a post about other opinions weird
people are upset because they showcased end game content with seemingly no end game content
those people mocking it are never going to be happy just cry they re still gonna buy it though
not upset over it because i know what to expect from the game datamining played endgame beta etc but they kinda shot themselves in the foot with this video by showing random travel nodes on the paragon board instead of the glyphs and legendary nodes the travel nodes are the least interesting part
because they made a big deal about it like oh were gonna have this sick video about endgame after the beta people were expecting to see somthing new or have what we already know explained more in depth but instead its just some dog shit that namedrops in the most vague way possible the systems we already know of and already know way more about than they showed in the video essentially the video wasn t aimed at anyone who is already following the game
this game is so fucking half baked years to spit out this slightly better version of d3 what a joke
d4 advertised to the masses never under estimate stupid people in large numbers a few thoughts other than that poe fan bois tryharding to make the evil blizzard game look bad lotta poor folks right now can t afford bucks for a game possibly hating on the game to self convince into not buying i don t understand tikzoomers at all game was super fun and ran great
because it s just rehashed renamed junk from d3 dungeons greater rifts which got boring quick just like dungeons probably will as they were boring more concerning is dungeons seem to be the main focus of the end game tree of whispers bounties it s setting up as well to be focused around stupid dailies i imagine as well do x dungeons do x bounties which will kill the fun real quick and become a chore
if only it wasn t an mmo
as a casual player who doesn t have all the time in the world anymore due to life i am already satisfied that i will be able to get my diablo fix and not have to play hours there is such a thing as finishing a game and being content and putting it aside and revisiting it in the future but i also understand that s the appeal to some players and i respect that
if you are basing your entire view of endgame on the short snippet of the paragon board they showed in this video i get why you could be upset the little bit they showed was pretty boring looking minor stat upgrades that dont live up to the hype for that specific mechanic in my opinion it seems more robust than we got from diablo iii which is exciting but im gonna admit i was hoping for something a little bit more impactful on my play i thought that the aspect system was pretty interesting though and im excited to see how the endgame stuff develops as the community gets there
gif giphy szkvf9c0o4uyo
i mean there are still plenty of things people seem to be forgetting they re not forgetting they re purposefully leaving those out when you point out that build customization comes from aspects uniques skill trees and class mechanics all combined they just move the goalposts and that s because they re not interested in providing feedback or having a discussion they just want to shit on the game because they re miserable and they can t fathom refunding and ignoring a game they don t like imagine if diablo fans would go on the poe sub and spam comments with the gameplay sucks it s just two buttons and the graphics are shit it would be pretty unhinged behavior
some people are upset some are happy such is life you could equally have asked why are people so happy over recent video i ve seen plenty of hyped comments
as we will have points of course not every1 can be a huuuuge increase in power else we would have such a big difference between lvl and there need to be travel nodes which are minor the rare tiles legendary tiles and the glpyh slots will be the main factors of yourse x200b i think overall it is good else you would be in the millions of damage again shortly which no1 wants
i think people are really underestimating the amount of content that is coming out on release x200b my concern is that most of diablo4 depth is ctrl c ctrl v i get it this game is going to receive endgame updates and i bet before first ladder starts we will already get first end game expansion so there s really no reason to cry but i think it s clear diablo4 is not what poe is in in terms of sheer amount of end game content but more like poe in no reason to cry about it if the game is supposed to be played weeks ladder it s completely fine to keep it in library and returning to see what they added the real important stuff is how fast and how good is the content they are going to add in the future whether their studio deals well with players feedback and new stuff is making the game more interesting and increasing this weeks period to etc i think having huge expectations is going to make people disappointed and imo if d4 isn t perfect day1 that doesn t mean anything tbh my expectations are that i will have fun for weeks after the release if i ll get bored before that sucks then i want ladder to bring some freshness and make those another weeks more fun than the previous one
can t ever please anyone these days
is paragon where truly power scaling begins like everything autoscales with you so gaining levels doesn t really matter if i get a paragon point do monsters still get stronger in some way also if we re going to have autoscaling and levels don t matter why can t i get more abilities sooner it s pretty boring running around for minutes with abilities not a criticism just a thought i m not huge into diablo so if you come at me with that energy it will just be misplaced
ya played this game a couple weeks ago no endgame content max level was couldn t go to areas really buggy wouldn t recommend
posts like this always sound like they re coming straight from the pr team why did you even feel the need to post this why do you think you need to act as the game s personal defender do you not realize that people complaining about the game can only result in improvements to the game it s like you re worried about the development team getting their feelings hurt or something
i m not invested in whether this game sucks or not everything is pointing to it sucking blizzard has nothing to show and the game looks terribly uninspired the video showed nothing you re upset because you re emotionally invested you care other people noticing that the game is bland is making you notice so you ve come here in search of answer to cope with the power of a circle jerk maybe you can reassure yourself
why peopel are upset are you from other dimension blizzards fan base has dried up i was one of blizz fans after diablo there are like million dissapointed players in last years blizzard has not produced anything good all talent is gone
for me the mocking of the paragon is mostly from them also making it sound super complicated and will change your build to an extreme kind of way and you get stat x200b same sht how food is advertise and how you get it ate some food where the packaging is like amazing after i open it well lets just say its not even close to the packaging picture
people don t realize that d2 and d3 didn t have an actual end game during release d4 has open world events nightmare dungeons pvp yes it is fun helltide world bosses tree of whispers seasons that is more than what d3 even has now the paragon board is great for min maxing builds the limited points you have makes you plan how you will spend your points and the path you will take between boards the stats are just normal nodes you pick up along the way the legendary nodes are like additional aspects that enhance the theme of the board so many armchair designers here think they can do better when what they want will actually make the game worse
coz hating on blizzard is the meta
because we can t have nice things without someone whose lives are an empty void covered in layers of bad decisions coming along and taking a crap on it instead of realizing they don t like it and just moving on with their existence https://youtu.be/tjrrisx33hy i recently tried to post my appreciation for the game in a discord server only to have someone in their 30s write a blog about all the things they didn t like about it it s incredible to me how grown people can t seem to appreciate anything especially things as objectively mostly polished and simply enjoyable as d4 beta was especially when it was free no one is forcing you to buy the game attitudes like that just wreak of someone s baseline headspace and perception of reality being so tainted by however their life is going that they couldn t appreciate anything no matter how good it is i d play diablo for the soundtrack sound design alone as well as the general perfect gritty and gothic vibe of it but the gameplay was great too for me maybe classes other than sorc weren t as polished idk but rolling through places with frozen orb and popping hydra and ice swords was incredibly satisfying i had zero problems with the supposed repetitiveness of dungeons i only got to see like of the ones in act i don t know if they re repetitive they re themed similarly but they kinda should be that s how d2 dungeons felt and there s very little i d change about d2 to make it a perfect game other than some evolution of the skill trees more skills on tap and upgrading audio visuals which is exactly what this felt like to me for all i know it s like vanguard and there s a handful of premier dungeons per act that are truly unique alongside a bunch of more common and similar dungeons the scale of the world felt great i got to and felt like i only touched about of the map in act i happily threw my money at blizzard after beta who knows maybe it s a value thing maybe to the people who feel like is a lot of money they expect absolute over the top perfection but that s not a lot of money to me and i don t expect utter perfection especially for what essentially is a mmo at launch so idk maybe people need to spend more time getting their lives in order so that they can actually enjoy things instead of wasting it criticizing a game they don t deserve most mmos were kinda janky at launch compared to where they ended up but i happily played most of the big ones from beta day and don t regret doing so
it s a terrible system that isn t needed and could of been expanded on with much more interesting features why not just have stats tied to leveling up and placing stats where you see fit they are continuing to break apart systems in the game just for the sake of making it look bigger than it actually is aspects with skills changing effects you farm why not just have that in the original skill tree instead of having two options like it is now in the tree and then the aspects being a power boost extension to farm why break apart stats that cost 53k per node refund with nodes making it cost over mil if you want to reroll lol just to burn gold idfk the person in the video only had mil so if they fucked up their paragon board pathing they wouldn t even be able to refund the entire board lmao funny af an analogy i used before was it s like they had a whole piece of glass and broke it apart just so you can play with it and put it back together
it s very interesting that people are capable of having a full opinion about game just from few general videos hmm
the video wasn t made for the people who have subbed to this subreddit it s not made for those who are spending their days obsessing over developer leaks or speculating with others on whether the ui will be changed to give a more readable flow to the item powers it s not made for the kind of people who will pause and zoom in on a youtube clip so they can read the fine print it was made for the occasional gamer and former gamer turned salaried professional family man woman who will remember the diablo franchise name and remember they enjoyed it a couple decades back and will be pumped to hear there is a new version coming out that they can enjoy this summer after the kids go to bed most potential future diablo gamers aren t here they aren t on discord channels for diablo either or in the blizzard forums it would be poor business for blizzard to cater to a small portion of their market base only we ll get some developer interview type videos that are many minutes or over an hour long and they will get into the weeds a bit further i am sure but this wasn t that naive of people to demand more out of a short youtube clip but reddit will be reddit and some people think this is their game and it has to be how they demand it to be
it s like that meme with the bell curve where middle joe average guy is always unhappy a toddler is super excited and happy about shiny new stuff so much so that they never see downsides an angsty teen hits the santa isn t real phase where those illusions are shattered suddenly magic and fun are lies to manipulate them and they are always self victimizing even worse is when they still get hyped up on a fantasy but it never meets that imaginary expectation in reality then we circle back around to adult enjoying a hobby they don t get overexcited as easy they understand that hype is marketing and games are a for profit job but they realize there is still fun to be had and enjoyed suddenly marketing isn t lying to them personally it s just showing a best light version and as long as the entertainment value is reasonable they are back to having a good time with a good product
entitled fucks that s who they are people dying of hunger diseases and getting blown to pieces in wars all over the world but that s nothing compared to did you see how this video game that nobody forces me to buy is not perfectly tailored to my exquisite taste
the diablo community is full of self proclaimed god tier veteran og players that think they need a neckbeard breakdown of complex endgame systems at this stage in the game from the devs instead of this kind of simplified video if they would have released that kind of video they would have complained that the systems aren t complex enough and there was no need to break down the system anyway there is no winning bro we all just need to wait for the game and enjoy it as much as we can
serious answer new gens got fucked deep up the ass with how the world is run and what kind of future is projected concerning new gens the most of any gens the thing is when you face the fact that no matter how much you mald you can t change stuff or influence the big fish you put all the effort into changing what you can this is the era of review bombing for that sole reason but distilled into different sub reasons
paragon boards seem a little underwhelming everything else seems great do want to hear more about the modifiers in these nightmare dungeons
mostly sick of blizzard bragging about how their lack of innovation and creativity is going to make a killing on sales diablo were all very different and unique from each other and d4 looks good but i m sick of the goddamn paragon crap it got old fast in d3
way more fun interesting to build you char this time around
i like the paragon system but the art used to create it is so ugly
i guess i don t understand some of the hate for the paragon board and more particularly the stat points there are other paragon points and features in the game at least shown previously that would only apply after reaching a breaking point of your char main stat i m not sure what these stat numbers look like at end game but it seems getting here and there from paragon board while building your way to a rare or legendary point would be pretty useful especially if you don t want to waste a gear affix solely searching for a specific attribute
there will always be people mad whenever a big game releases any information it s just the way it is learn to ignore them
spoiled brats
people would be upset if they gave them everything they wanted pay no attention to it the best thing you can do with reddit is basically ignore everything on here we re all morons d
there was a woman in the video
that trailer made d4 s end game look so bad cant believe anyone is defending it
gamers are some of the dumbest people i interact with they fall for hype marketing etc the rationalize buying skins like it matters they bitch and moan about everything too much info not enough wrong gender can t see sorc under boobs and it s generally the loudest about it thar are the dumbest then it s all amplified by the youtubers streamers et all who make money on controversy clicks and hot takes then thr dumb gamers who glorify these people speak as if it s all law now streamerx22 said this streamerdiapherboy said that streamermanchild prefers d2 who cares most of us had the opportunity to play the beta ourselves form our own opinion of the game why do you seek validation
some people are never happy we gave you extra talents and more skill points oh that s too many makes it too easy it s human nature and love of drama
because people are crybabies and moaners spend a lomg time reading thos reddit before the beta a lot of ugly things coming from the disaster of diablo was expecting the worst played the beta and found it very entertaining to say the least in comparison with what was being said really this reddit is full of moaners that follow what the idiots on youtube spill instead of having their own judgement the game was fine
because it was marketing bs presumably aimed at people with very limited knowledge of game systems people don t expect it to be the most complex or deep game ever but the mainstat clicks on repeat infer the game is for complete droolers even if there actually is a bit more depth than they showed
i m not the one who made the post or had any comment on the content my comment is simply on a person whose immediate reaction is to drop a karmafarming word like entitled into a toxic sub and watch the upvotes come on when it s not even relevant lol
cause they can t play and are bored and have no control over their own issues
i think it looks awesome i can t wait for this game
poe was still deeper at release thats why
this sub seems to be filled with really spiteful people i d wager even some joke stuff is constantly downvoted for some reason i think the multiplayer stuff has attracted all the cod players so this is being a very toxic place right now p
this latest video was like a teaser trailer it gives you a small overview of a lot of the end game without going into detail which is what they will no doubt do later in the month for their stream on the 20th which is the equivalent of the official trailer this has pissed a lot of people off though since they see things like stat nodes in the paragon board and think that s shit this is what they said would change the late game for us i would assume most people don t keep up to date or even look at the leaks so they don t know there is more to the system than that blizzard should have just added a line at the end of the video that said we look forward to showing these systems to you later in the month in more detail what you ve seen right now is just a part of the end game puzzle though if you ask me i m not sure why they even released this at all they could have just announced the stream date and left it at that also if you are going to have people talk to a camera can you find people who look excited or happy to chat about it some of the people on camera looked like they just got a note that said we have your family read the lines
i m pumped people who are really upset need to find some grass and chill out my family can t wait to play and explore the game
getting upset over parts of the paragon board is pointless the boring nodes exists as a part of a mini game where the player has to minimise points spent on the bad nodes in order to get as many points left to spend on the good ones as possible i guess blizzard could have made that clearer its a bit like complaining about there being a last place in a racing game cant have the good stuff without some bad stuff
people also thought beta was the final release it was a stress test with very limited features sooooo i ignore anything to do with negative feedback about obvious things in the d4 community now i enjoyed beta but it was beta for a reason i laughed at the testing of maps but people thought that was legit wowww i gave up hope for people s common sense
yep for a launch the content and clarity of vision is excellent post launch it could be fucking amazing
just like the d2 purists have specific thoughts about itemization d3 purists have toxic demands about endgame even though d3 didn t itself launch with an endgame lol
the content is what i expected for an arpg style game so people getting mad over that is stupid i could of missed this they did not show a single interesting talent on the paragon board there are some but they are not shown i can understand the presentation being off putting a bunch of different people reading a script feels disjointed and awkward to watch just compare the new zelda presentation to this one i still feel that overall it is a bunch of people hating a game just because they want to hate
honestly i don t get it either i saw the uproar on reddit first then watched the video and i felt the content was fine they did show a legendary node in the video too and it s just an overview video not even an in depth one they can just wait for the in depth one later and i am sure there will be one
it seems to me a lot of people interested in d4 or commentating on d4 are not actually fans of arpgs as a genre some of the takes and sentiments on this sub are ignorant and low class bs one doesn t have to have played every iterative arpg out there to enjoy d4 however those claiming the d4 endgame is just grind probably should
they should ve presented better some of the board are filled with a x white tiles made me think those people didn t even design the game is only the spokesmen
if you take the nodes i bet they total up on average to a similar amount of stat points per level like in the older series
because we already known all that from previous data that was either shown or datamined they also shot themselves in the foot because there is more to the paragon boards then what they showed off a video for casuals where never going to be enough of a deepdive for hardcore players cant really make a video for people that think getting hours worth of gameplay is great and then show the same video to people that have killed a single monster in previous games far longer then hours to use anorher game no matter how much de try to make the new player experience better in warframe it still wont do much to me as a player with over hours in that game blizzard could have saved thenselves a lot of negativity by not calling that video a deep dive because if there where any depth there it fit in a puddle
i was kinda let down they didn t show the paragon system really only to stats
do you have a link to the video that isn t some youtube turd trying to breakdown everything
hey folks
should be a good time
weird i played d3 for the first time in like years while listening to rhykkers lore videos then i killed a mob named rhykker
hey
ryhkker i ll be watching
sweet
i hope rhykker ask hard questions to the devs
thank god they re not getting llama that dude is huffing the d2 copium like there s no tomorrow
rhykker let s go hopefully he asks questions based on the community s concerns he s always been aware of them
lets hope well get a more in depth explanation of end game system paragon glyph etc cuz by the yesterdays trailer it seems like they don t know how to promote their game
please for the love of god ask the correct questions aha love you rhykker
would be awesome if they added kripperian
i wish they had invited kripparian as well
i ve never liked rhykker personally but i hope he asks actual questions and not fluffy softballs that said he s way more tolerable than llama
rhykker is what new character
sweet thanks for the birthday present blizzard
praise it
i am happy for rykker but i am hoping for someone like kripp raxx that can ask hard questions help improve the game hopefully rykker can ask some good questions like when is crafting coming are will stash space or other pay for convience be in d4 or strictly cosmetics
time
remindme days
hopefully someone does a good recap as much as i don t care to watch streamers and content creators i d much prefer a condensed version of this that focuses only on the stuff we don t already know i have a feeling a lot of this will be spent covering down on stuff we have known for months now and trying to hype all of the systems up for folks just tuning in from after the open beta
really wish devs would stop having streamers and youtubers on these things and no that s nothing against rhykker
rhykker yikes
should do developer liver stream where they just talk about the effects of years of drinking on the liver
enjoy the shards and hauling them back to maine vendor in order to roll on a cache potential p2w bs
explains why the man has almost never got a bad thing to say about d4
i m willing to burn a comment love this game but this sub blows god forbid someone have a different opinion than diablo is amazing too many people investing themselves in what other people think about the game there s hardly any room to discuss the game if it s not strictly positive i ve literally never had this issue with any other game subreddit let the downvotes commence
biased as hell live stream with rhykker yay blizzard and comfort zone nothing unusual
can this comment get to down doots
rhykket should surprise them with lama taking over mid way through
sup
edit ooops wrong thread
getting high and watch some diablo is shaping up to be a good one this year
why rhykker why not mrllamasc
why does his name have k s
ughhk
i ll watch if i got nothing better to do i just hope they talk about certain ways they would be looking to improve the game seasonally as that s a big question mark and is what could make or break this game in the long run imo
as long as they don t ask of their allotted questions about cosmetic puppies or is d4 fun to play then i ll be content
stream gonna get high af boi
this is going to be exciting endgame really needs to be good fingers crossed that they deliver
ready for this
deleted
what is rhykker
hope they bring up stuff they can actually talk about this time
oh cool
if the game only looked like some of the artwork
they honestly couldn t have picked a more level headed objective individual good for him
oh boy can t wait for the most uninteresting and mundane questions from rhyker
lol
give him the staff and the snake while he is streaming and i will pony up fifty for his channel haha
this is rhykkerrrrrrr
this is rhykker
i gotta say rhykker s been buggin me lately with his blizzard bootlicking i mean the guy clearly wants to be diablo s golden boy so he s always giving blizzard a pass on their screw ups the dungeons in the beta were about as deep as a kiddie pool and you could tell they were churned out by some algorithm instead of crafted with love and care blizzard s just being cheap and lazy pushing out a finished game that s anything but and yet rhykker s all like oh but maybe the rest of the game s dungeons will be better end game beta testers have already confirmed that they re all cut from the same cloth rhykker keeps being blizzard s lapdog instead of standing up for his fans i just see him as a blizzard marketing tool rather than a voice of the community i know i might sound like a salty hater but i ve been watching rhykker for nearly a decade and i m sick of his rose tinted glasses and delusional copium
i m under the impression he was the only content creator that was making high quality vids for diablo way after the general public kind of abandoned it no clue when they decided to add that mob though i personally didn t discover rhykker till 2016ish but if i never did i doubt i would ve kept playing d3 anyway blizzard has been naming things in the game since diablo after content creators a lot of the writers for diabloii net have mercenaries named after them in d2
there s several streamers that have monsters named after them there s even a monster named quin
foaks
ryhkker i hardly know her
not a big fan of content creators nowadays but rhyker is definitely an exception his content is top notch and he has the best diablo lore videos out there
rykker is a youtuber who specializes in gaming news and videos on diablo and others
i m predicting the first season will be nice
never understood why people want youtubers streamers to ask hard questions they only serve as a gotcha question and the devs will skip over it or just give a vague answer
given rhykkers track record that is surely going to happen copium
yes he absolutely will ask them hard questions such as hey guys what is your favorite color forget it if they knew rhykker was going to ask hard questions they weren t going to invite him
wtf does this mean
fact i love his content for what it is and i respect his knowledge but whatever he said about d4 was basically in the lines of this sucks because it wasn t so in d2 that gets old really fast
lmfao
i used to think the same but his more recent criticism videos were to me very level headed and well thought out the guy just wants a good video game at the end of the day
llama watching himself disappear into irrelevance now that he can no longer claim to play the best diablo
still a nice guy tho
he is very knowledgeable about d2 for sure because of his experience and tons of hours playing it however i think he is so biased d4 is d4 and it s not gonna play like d2 because it was not designed that way i understand the bugs he pointed out but this is beta a lot will change hopefully come release what do you think about llama about his take on d4
i think it s quite obvious why they have chosen rhyker the guy has nothing but praises for anything blizzard do
that s an absolutely baseless assumption people keep saying this without evidence
maybe you should go make low sodium diablo if you want to avoid any thoughtful criticism worked out really well for the cyperpunk folks they found a new shill and this redditor couldn t be happier
they should have gotten lama and others to get multiple points of view in rhykker is just gonna be happy to be there
you are delusional if you think all questions aren t pre approved and marketing monkeys didn t spend days carefully putting in every vague synonym as an answer
why the fk are u getting downvoted for that kripperian is a legend calm and collected nice guy
surprised they didn t
they don t want anyone with a critical mindset they want an easy yes man
bein more tolerable than mrllamasc is a low bar though
same everything i ve seen from him is disengenuous and overly forgiving he s like a giga blizzard d4 simp it s nauseating how he talks about the game
had to google it apparently some youtuber
raxx yes hard pass on kripp
for this type of content questions are strictly controled they basically have already agreed with rhykker what kind of questions can be asked and what should be avoided
are will stash space have

yes please i usually drink when i play diablo
uhh blood shards were the same and they were fine
rhykker has been critical lots of times towards other diablo projects he takes is job as an journalist serious
naw blizzard talks to people that are critical of them if that s what you re insinuating they allowed preach to tour the campus and interview some of the top warcraft guys and they ve given interviews to asmon in the past hell if you want to just talk about diablo raxx calls blizzard dogshit all the time and still gets invited to things like the endgame betas and has a direct line to those developers just don t think of this interview as anything past a charismatic passionate guy speaking with the developers about diablo and you ll be fine
yup dude looks like a shill for the company
yeah seemed to have similar thoughts on that guess we ll wait and see
dev stream hasn t happened yet
i mean you don t have to get high
because mrllama just wants another diablo
because would be problematic
why does your name have two s s
the youtuber
this is rhykkerrrrr
feels like his mic is booster sooooooo much on the low end
in this developer update livestream we will be
i was hoping that the druid would be unable to kill non aggressive animals and interact with them how wrong i was
they can t judge me they re the ones who added an achievement for killing them
i will kill everything that moves to find the cow level
there is a penguin level
kinda wish they dropped corpses for necros to use i don t see why not
i never killed them they simply moved into my line of fire
i am hoping my actions during the beta have not been noted on my permanent record
oh a cute bunny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdxejl6smbe
gif giphy cnna9g8bqvnoi
innocent seems presumptuous
pixels are suspicious as hell and totally worth killing
hehe pulverize go smash
in fantasy there are druids that would kill such animals to keep things balanced
wait what seriously
yep there s an achievement to kill one of every wildlife there s alot
yeah i wasn t killing them till i saw the achievement and then i killed every single animal i saw
that will be next
kripp had a really great doc encompassing this i ll him a few times in chat and get back to you if he links it
man you dumb
the skill data is the simplest data around that s already available it will take time i suspect maybe even after release for more advanced stuff to happen
i m sure it will be available soon enough i ve already seen at least one list that gives a bis attribute breakdown per gear slot though you should have a pretty good idea from beta which attributes can roll in what slots i already know what slots can roll crit get flat damage or roll which skill types
diablo4 cc has all the uniques etc careful has spoilers
i know the general what can be on what and someone else linked a doc here i wonder if that doc has the if x and y are on the item it cant have z haven t had a chance to look at it curious to map out how to get to on specific skills
i loved it i love that setting but i m not a miniature tabletop gamer combat was fun and visceral
it s a fun game if play it but i m avoiding arpgs like the plague until june 1st now
i was playing it but the constant major bugs eventually got to me i had moves that were clearly broken for years found old bug reports on their forums with dev response enemies that were just immune to my builds mechanic for no clear reason enemies that couldn t be correctly targeted by aoe effects they blew up at your feet no matter how far away the enemy is sfx that would cause horrible sounds from the psyker effects i had a really cool build going and then i realized i had to avoid half the affixes that scale your damage because i was applying dots to myself that were scaled higher by the games difficulty system so the harder i set it the faster i killed myself
i put about hours into inquisitor it was very fun i quit because i was running some busted builds and the game wasn t challenging at all i might revisit it actually thanks for the reminder
it s a good game if you dig the 40k setting and a pretty solid arpg it s fun i got back to it from time to time
i m playing the ascent it s really good is kind warhammer
martyr has an interesting mechanic with unlocking of weapon perks when some item drops its perks are unknown to unlock them you must do something like finish mission without healing etc
i tried it and got bored pretty quick the cover mechanic felt more obnoxious and less strategic and the game seemed to immediately become a single hub that you load from into worlds that all have simple and redundant mechanics just to progress a story i couldn t care less about as someone who doesn t care much for lore which may not be echoed by your typical warhammer player as i was picking up loot and looking at all the different weapon types i got really excited thinking about the different kinds of builds but the boredom kicked in before i reached a point where i could actually explore who knows maybe i ll give it another shot next month out of sheer desperation about how many hours were you in before it really opened up for you
that game is very advanced and layered with tons of subsystems i m worried that if people play it they ll expect too much from diablo
it s ok for a while but it s super repetitive it s ridiculously easy even adjusting difficult and the voice acting is super cringe equip heavy flamer and spec for same you ll erase the whole map taking little to no damage
it s a pretty mediocre game but surely just about enough to get you through for a week or so
i hated it actually didn t feel anything to me like a diablo the gameplay is meh and the missions are the same every time
love 40k more than any other ip but man most games suck and wasn t much of a fan of inquisitor either
funny that blizzard though of that they started a project called starblo where you went on a spaceship to plant to planet eventually scrapped it
i avoid any 40k titles they are all predatory
i get it but what about top down roguelites have a pass just started playing ravenwatch tight gameplay but not as much as d4
depends on class crusader i felt was pretty immediate assassin felt like it took a while psyker was middle ground tech adept is a pet class so i didn t really play it sister of battle takes the longest to unlock everything but it works as a hybrid of crusader and psyker
i m on my first playthrough as a psyker and i felt like they didn t really explain some of the core mechanics at first and it took a long time to introduce all of them i think there is pretty fun game in there but i almost bounced off it because of the pace in the early game i like how cheap the passive skill resets are since i definitely made some big mistakes the first time around haven t done any co op or pvp and i m not likely to
even tho the cover mechanic is still technically in the game they ve scrapped it as it s completely useless
will check it out
that game looks like a glorified demo to me map boss the roadmap on the steam page tells you to not expect another map until summer seem like far too little content
maybe i ll load it back up and try out crusader thank you
my own personal rankings crusader a assassin c psyker b tech priest d this is because it s a pet class and i don t like those sororitas a but only because i like the more customization it has for its abilities over crusader edit do know that while you can earn the in game premium currency for the dlcs most of them are just more missions so you aren t missing out on much
hardcore is permadeath that s the only difference all the other things like tougher monsters better drops etc are features of increased difficulties nightmare and torment and those are available with the same exact bonuses and the same exact difficulty in regular or hardcore mode
the not sharing items stats has always been the case between hardcore and softcore difficulties
any information about if hardcore players play on the same server as softcore
let me tell you this entering any dungeon is way more thrilling knowing there might be butcher behind every corner with level scaling and never really being able to outlevel the content hc is going to be so much more fun than in any other diablo
unless it s pvp then hardcore isn t permadeath
that was my initial take on it but was uncertain as they were speaking about the specific incentives to play hardcore mode you are most likely correct but it would be pretty awesome if this were the case
in diablo the stash was shared between all characters in hardcore mode x200b stash isn t shared between those modes but any character within the same mode can share stash gold bloodshards paragon points and cube powers https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d3/t/stash-isnt-shared/58453](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d3/t/stash-isnt-shared/58453)
iirc areas are instanced with approximately players per instance i think the only instance that hardcore and softcore can share is the pvp zone fields of hatred
i was talking about between hardcore and normal not hardcore and hardcore
yeah they could be referring to not sharing stash between modes as was in previous titles the way it was worded had me thinking they meant no stash sharing between characters at all regardless of mode the thought of that had me all twisted
they are children most likely
a lot of these people are just parroting what their favourite streamer has said with lack of understanding why if you push them for further explanation they don t know what to say
the simpsons made the comic book guy to make fun of the type of people on internet forums that claimed every new simpsons episode was the worst episode ever these are the people you re posting about they are the comic book guy irl they will claim to hate everything about diablo but play it thousands of hours they are saying right now that diablo is the worst episode ever because they are the comic book guy irl these types have always been around the internet they like to complain i have no reason why but they are everywhere on forums like this they won t go away you won t change their mind part of their enjoyment of diablo will be watching streamers youtubers who tell them what they should hate and then they ll come on here and repeat that stuff they aren t winning by getting so angry at a video game you aren t winning by paying attention to them just ignore them
it s one of life s great mysteries isn t it why are we here are we the product of some cosmic coincidence or is there really a god watching over us with a great plan or something i don t know man but it keeps me up at night
this is normal in every gaming subreddit though always there will be those kinds of posts in addition to the well crafted critiques and earnest questions everything in between some can t craft posts like that some don t want to take the time some look for humor sarcasm is mostly lost in text and some just want to see the world burn whatever the purpose is i suspect about really are waiting for the game to release
this sub has a serious neckbeard infestation problem that s the basic answer to your questions it s getting pretty bad here just had one of them delete their comments it s like they write their stupid comments out of pure impulse and when they get called out the regret hits all at once if your comment ever begins to resemble a twitch chat comment you ve got issues
i see more don t listen to the haters re anyone giving feedback than i do games trash comments
they re not targeting the game they re targeting you if they know they can get under your skin and if you show your hand that you re emotionally invested in d4 then you re an easy target and they have a new playground oldest rule on the internet don t feed the trolls take this post down and ignore them source star citizen backet since
while saying things like game bad isn t good feedback that s what happens when blizzard ruins their reputation and has given people mediocre bad products with a premium price tag everyone has an opinion and things to say for anything that s the internet the more popular a franchise is the more opinions you re going to see good or bad
why am i seeing way more post about this every day but barely find a post just hating on something
i see a lot more comments like yours op then people saying it s outright trash x200b it s fun the game engine is great but there are definitely serious concerns about the skill tree and itemization the same thing that s been said since the first snapshots of development were released years ago x200b i m going to buy it but i don t see it having much longevity with items as they currently are
i m here because the drama around this game is more interesting than anything i ve seen in the news recently people sure have strong opinions about video games
the copium thing is by far one of the dumbest things to ever catch on i know what someone s response will be cope got me anyway to the topic at hand this is unfortunately just reddit as a whole every sub you go into if it can have a decisive take you better believe you ll see it it s unfortunate but i m sure they stick around because they get massive enjoyment out of seeing posts like yours you can also point the finger at blizz and everything that s gone on over there night of the gaming awards when they showed off the release date trailer the ps5 sub had many comments about how they won t support anything blizzard does ever again i m sure many of those people make the occasional comment on here twitter every youtube video etc just kind of the way things are my man i m just really glad i was a kid growing up the s and would literally just play games because they were fun that was it is it fun yes buy or rent it not fun don t buy or rent it and move on to the next thing those were some good ass days anyway i personally can t wait for d4 i m an ultimate edition boot licker
what a brave thread op this sub is something else
waiting for game
i just wish i could zoom out on console so i could see what was going on
i ve seen multiple posts like this on here you are wasting your time wondering why people do it it s reddit and especially it s a game subreddit people always moan and it s never gonna stop they are a vocal minority and it makes it seems like there are more moaners than people that actually like the game
poe is shit
it s fun to spend seconds making a comment going about my day playing poe and then coming back to see posts like this
there is people who are trolling like them because there is people who get triggered like you i can t explain better than that
why are any of us here the age old question that has no real answer we don t know
ok this thread has to be made by bot literally every thread is hate about some haters there is no way blizzard is not making those threads at this point
take it up with a manager karen
first time on the internet
let me ask you mr op why are you here to hold a mirror up to reddit and tell people how they should or should not be on social media these meta style posts are almost as cringe as the comments saying the game is trash it s their opinion let them have it and quit whining
these are trolls sir do not pay attention to them do not feed them
i ve got a question for you why are you here the people who mock everyone who addresses issues with the game and that try to shut down every single discussion on how to improve the game
they re trolls it s the internet just don t feed the trolls
blizzard doesn t read this board for feedback people are entitled to post their opinions some people like the game some people dislike the game some people just want to suck a billion dollar company s dick for reasons unknown
it s just virtue signaling like half of the f ing dumb ass internet these days they say these things acting like they have some kind of elevated taste in games and then feel better about themselves by comparing themselves to other people who they perceive to have worse taste or who they think are worse gamers or whatever just sad angry miserable people who are probably also fat ugly and lonely aka the internet games are supposed to be fun if you don t like d4 just don t play it and find a game you do like and immerse yourself in that to feel better rather than polluting the internet with your moronic noncontributions
the reality is those same naysayers will end up playing the game and secretly be excited about it
everything that s popular will have a bunch of people desperately trying to seem sophisticated and cool by hating on it
they re here to upset people like you into making posts like this this is exactly the type of response they want and enjoy congratulations you played yourself
i think it s mostly children teenagers and mentally ill people who really want ed the game to be amazing and are mildly obsessed with it hence the presence here but are super afraid it will be a bust or total disappointment they are preemptively shitting on it so they don t feel duped swindled and disappointed or they are demanding changes be made and current systems be altered because they desperately want the game to succeed and become obsessed with a critique they heard and are now parroting
tl dr guy complains about others complaining
lmao this post has absolutely unhinged levels of copium diablo is corporate kfc trash by a company filled with weirdos who drink breast milk poe is a superior game in all the aspects that matter everyone says combat in d4 is better but combat is not in anyway the focus of an isometric arpg you fucking normies it s absolutely trash and you need to recognise it stop giving blizzard money you normie cuckhold
finally someone asked
the usual contrarians trolls kids and bots in descending order of likelihood
because talking trash is a way of life for these people
i made a post to ask this in another angle and had a collection of all these exact people you are describing comment inside i haven t responded to any of them but it s a nice repository of them
dex woo woo
they are here because making a comment online or being critical on reddit is easy they don t need to face anyone like they would have to in real life most likely are spineless when in comes to an actual human to human interaction so they tickle their ego on the forums but what we can do is just the usual eye roll and ignore them when the game launches we will be flooded with either omg i was wrong about this game it s amazing or i told you guys months ago this game sucks should ve listened to me
like you said some criticism is whole heartedly valid and others that are just made to say the game is bad isn t valid however i think there is some valid points these people make like the paragon boards having too many basic nodes thinking the skill tree needs a few more slots so i think some of them have good criticisms but the ones you pointed out yeah pretty worthless comment
diagblo is trash unfortuanterly
the matrix brought them here
i m convinced they re all asmongold viewers
i m on this sub personally because i am excited and i like seeing alot of others excited as well
copium seems to have replaced optimism but with a terribly negative judgemental tone i don t think it s wrong to be optimistic so many people are excessively negative today
their favorite youtuber told them these things
they are looking for assurement that their opinion is valid whether or not it is they have a fear of missing out but aren t actually sure if they re missing out or not and so they want to feel like they aren t and want others to agree
i ll leave this comment here for no reason but i ve basically stopped visiting this sub just so toxic complains everyday about one thing or another yet they ll be playing on day anyway and even then complain about how they can t get past the queue i used to visit the sun to discuss strategy and input from fellow diablo players on what we can expect what will work speculation on contents etc nothing of the sorts here these days
i m here because i liked the beta and reddit keeps pushing the the sub on me i like to critique and discuss the things i enjoy and i have not seen much of the hate this post is suggesting is all over the place mostly just people complaining about hate
we need an annual purge there i said it
why are you here
why are we still here just to suffer
add those clown who post i m glad i refunded this game
giggity
i had fun and didn t gatekeep it judge me
i m here hoping that one day i ll read a useful post ah well maybe tomorrow
but it is garbage because it was here and now it is not and we all must wait and i wanna play badly
the work for the governments secret cartels who are trying to control the productivity of the nation s slaves by driving down the popularity of what will be the next biggest time sink since reddit
they re here to get a response don t feed the trolls
i enjoyed the beta weekend definitely going to play the game a lot the criticism i ve heard is valid but i know it s beta and the game will grow over time poe at launch was different from poe now people make comments like that on various platforms cause they think they should because it s the cool thing to say their streamer god says so or for attention end of the day enjoy what you enjoy and don t let other people s enjoyment or lack thereof take it away from you
i dunno i just got here
i m here because i like to see the jnteresting questions some people ask that i would never think of myself
i m here because i can finally have my skellie wellie posse back together again
i still do not understand why d4 must be like poe its like asking from cod to be arma
you have just served the exact purpose of those people you hate give them more attention and feed the argument with the trolls
poe zoomers who already bought diablo ages ago but still complain about everything wouldn t waste much time on these mouth breathers
i m here to share in the excitement with other people who are hyped about the game
because they want everyone to believe poe is the best game ever and can t accept the fact that it has fundamental flaws that will push away most people
newflash young man shakes fist at cloud film at i mean they have to come from somewhere right
because the first group of people you mentioned they belong in an actual feedback system jira uservoice anything other than reddit reddit is for the latter group of people they haven t the ability nor desire to hold a conversation at all yet we all come here and talk at each other
i m here for info i want to play the game it s that simple not into poe it s to much and i have limited time epoch didn t catch my feels beta ruined me a little d3 i ve played enough
outrage and complaining have become hobbies and if they re not working on that muscle they might have to deal with hole lonely and pathetic they are lol
welcome to the internet
it s people want their cake they want to eat it and then vomit it up so they dont gain weight it took diablo years to get good it took diablo years to get good why would diablo be any different you can enjoy the game and no it s not going to be perfect no game is
i know the op is just low effort karma whoring but reddit in general would be so much better if people stopped asking questions without being actually interested in having them answered
everyone thinks that they need to be herd oh i hate this it s so dumb i have to let the world know they need my opinions
so they can troll people and when you make posts like this it makes them happy because they can troll you even more the best thing anyone can do is just ignore them by even acknowledging their existence you are playing into their games so just stop act like they don t exist that shuts them up eventually
some people don t really have a yum so they yuck on other people s happens when people have more free time than dopamine
bunch of fucking teenagers it s always fucking teenagers
i m looking forward to the game and am interested in content this sub could provide i imagine the landscape will change once the game launches and nobody needs to speculate anymore
because happy normal functional people are the minority on reddit
those guys show the lack of attention from their parents when they were kids some still are and in their mental onanism they consider that everyone will revere them for being rebellious and outta mainstream better ignore their misguided tantrums
i see fun i play i see no fun i don t play i m a simple man
toby why are you the way you are
i loved the betas and can t wait to play on release i don t even notice the trolls anymore
the game was fun in beta but judging from what most big youtubers have said it s concerning sadly we live in an age where many people see concerning data from a developer with a bad track record and automatically condemn them case and point dragonflight is actually a fun game but the sales numbers will tell you a lot of people are past giving blizzard the benefit of a doubt those people don t leave the internet because they are angry they continue to post and try to warn others to keep them from making what they see as a mistake the harsh reality is that this game won t be some mold breaking revolutionary diablo game that changes the future of gaming forever what it will be is more of the same slightly tweeked and and changed so it doesn t look exactly like diablo what it will be is what every game like this is a race to the end of a hallway to see if the loot you got is better than what you had some people are tired of that kind of game play and expected different
but poe is better i mean i m gonna play it tomorrow instead of d4
patch notes and builds
because we wanted a game that looks great and plays like an upgraded d2 but we got a trash game instead and it s infuriating
you re like a vegan trying to get everyone else to eat like you let them have their say if you don t like it you can just ignore it but judging by your other posts you seem to only be able to see it from your side i m not here to pick sides but to point out that you are part of the problem
i assume bots lol and if not useless npc s commenting
it s ok they won t be missed anyway like it or not this game will have a healthy player base for quite some time they just on copium about that and want the game to fail so bad for some reason
i m here to follow progress on the game to see what the community thinks of it and most importantly to see how devs respond to compliments criticism my biggest fear is that release day comes and hits hard with predatory monetisation in which case i am out this was the case with diablo immoral too this enables me to see the reviews before buying it not be lured in with fomo vote with my wallet instead of having to rant and have it fall on deaf ears please don t misunderstand me i liked the beta i ve been playing diablo since i was a kid and i won t preach to anyone how to spend their money they may have more faith in the company than i do or they honestly don t want to miss out on exclusive items and that s their right personally i won t pre purchase blizzard games they are not an indie studio that needs funding to finish once the reviews start coming in i ll be getting a lot of info from this sub and ultimately make my decision based on some of it but i do hope it s going to be awesome and i m looking forward to the release
mental issues including superiority complex i e poe better diablo bad kekw lemao type of comments bad parenting lack of social interaction especially with adults mostly because of being jobless awkward basement dweller i think these are the most common
better question is why write an essay about the minority those people are in every game subreddit praying for attention from people like you
personally just here hoping blizz will announce some changes that the community was unanimous about and to continue criticizing level scaling
this is why i have pretty much ghosted most of the diablo subs lately people just can t handle disappointment anymore so they have to project it onto people who are satisfied with what they have or understand that you gotta take the good with the bad sometimes this sub wasn t in a good spot to start anyways to be honest my suggestion to anyone who feels the same is to find people out there who aren t so damn hyper critical and be around them reddit s just a negative place to begin with we got a couple ish more months to go why spend it constantly defending yourself against the loud few there is a saying out there it goes why don t you roll around with a pig in their mud because at the end of the day the pig will still be happy gif giphy lsqjpniahl31zprxb0 downsized
i m glad ultimates suck so much because i will not alocate a single point in that tree and put it all in defensive max hp reduction thorns etc i rather have permanent defense then add second cooldowns to my bar
i played half and half sc hc barbs one on sc one on hc among other classes and i tend to agree with you rallying cry felt mandatory early on because of the low fury generation and ended up mandatory later on because of the aspect that gave you damage for overcapped fury generated the fact that it gives unstoppable for the whole duration is absolutely bonkers it s gonna be even more mandatory once we pick up unbridled rage on the other hand i played around a bit with iron skin and it felt like it could have a place in a different game different difficulty settings in a world where you can t have permanent unstoppable from rallying cry iron skin has a place as a panic button since it s pretty bad as a pre buff especially without the corresponding aspect and both points beyond the skill itself feel underwhelming challenging shout doesn t even need to be discussed everyone now knows it s nuts and should be on your bar it d probably gonna end up being taken without any of the nodes beyond the skill itself ground stomp is useless as it stands there may be an interest in putting points into it later on as some effects can trigger it but i don t see myself putting it on my bar anytime soon as for brawling skills this is where my bar will likely juggle later on early on war cry is an obvious choice since it s an early source of berserking and well damage is damage but unless you have more incentives to go all out on shouts which is likely it could be replaced later on once we have enough fury shouts generation and crucially need a mobility skill like leap or charge even tho leap and charge are good contenders to take that slot they ll likely take the lmb slot and just get rid of frenzy or your lmb of choice kick felt useless if you were not going for youtube worthy moments but again it could be part of combos to trigger reset other unused skills that could be part of a build that just doesn t exist right now since all those skills question the existence of even ultimate skills seeing as of now that core skills look like the actual core barb skills weapon mastery skills are cute tools that can be scrapped steel grasp is a literal rp skill and currently serve no purpose death blow is a life saver until your build is online and rupture is a great idea that bleed builds will use until they have to ask themselves why they have to spend or skill slots to be viable my concern is clearly that shouts will end up being too powerful to even consider off builds and either the ultimate or the basic skill will be dropped to get a mobility skill like leap or charge don t get me wrong if the pre season is just me spinning with shouts on my bar i m fine with it but i strongly hope there s some change as soon as the first season starts or that i m just wrong
playing hc i only relied heavily on rallying cry just for the unstoppable buff and the boost to fury generation didn t use ground stomp or iron skin at all and only died on the first barbarian i made as far as the brawling skills all three of them are great but kick is by far my favorite lining the target up with the rest of the monsters i m fighting and just playing bowling with them was so much fun
the kick was my favourite bam
rallying cry is a must especially if you play hardcore it breaks any cc instantly generates additional fury for seconds and grants movement speed challenging shout is also a must for hardcore specifically additional fortify as well as additional fury when struck i wouldn t use iron skin myself it s only effective if you are low on life i d try not get to low state of life to begin with
gimme all the shouts i m the dovahkiin up in here challenging rallying war cry i like leap and charge but the cooldown is absolutely wild a second charge would make it worth with the aspect for sec cooldown on the leap it just feels bad for a movement ability to take that long to recharge
iron skin and war cry originally usually alongside death blow an ultimate and whatever basic core combo i was running once i got aspect of echoing fury generates fury while your shouts are running i ran challenging shout war cry and rallying cry and went back and forth between leap and an ultimate generating that much fury was just too fun to pass up
i enjoyed every one of the defensive and brawling skills the shouts were probably my least used but when i had them they felt great leap felt amazing with the fury generation passive power leap especially with the unique which allowed kick and ground stomp to reset it s cooldown challenging shout and iron skin were nearly permanent fixtures on my hotbar though my planned build ditches iron skin as i eventually didn t feel like i needed the defense i may have to reevaluate at release as we won t be quite as geared up full epics got silly if playing with another player challenging shout ground stomp and kick allowed me to control every group we fought i d argue the least diablo thing about diablo was how mobs only ever aggro in groups it really removed a lot of the chaos from diablo where just slightly scrolling the screen unleashed more and more mobs to fight
i made this vid to remind myself when the game launches why lunging strike is the best basic skill that i found during both beta weekends i don t use an ultimate either but not saying i never will though https://youtu.be/oembo3mcmtc](https://youtu.be/oembo3mcmtc)
i d love like a grapple or throw down for brawling kick is fun though
hello i don t like bleed builds so i started with frenzy and upheaval for basic and core skills frenzy because i like to use the one handed weapons as i find it visually appealing and fast fury regen combined with furious upheaval high burst damage on veteran difficulty hardcore i didn t feel the need of having defensive skills such as challenging shout iron skin or ground stomp at all i invested into rallying cry unstoppable fortify could break cc s anytime and become immune to them movement speed etc moving into the end game my mindset remains the same as i plan to add points into concussion which will stun my targets if i use bludgeoning weapons so ground stomp is out of discussion i will also mix this with frenzy as my basic skill to increase my stun chance in terms of brawling skills i used leap on my hardcore run leap is great as you can jump through walls and you can actually control how far you can jump based on your mouse cursor if you invest further into the skill slows the target for sec which is great because i will not be using bleed at all had a lot of fun with charge but i can get out more utility with leap one thing that i forgot to test is if while you are cc ed you can get out of it with charge as it gives unstoppable kick is a fun skill very useful in pvp combined with the legendary aspect damaging an enemy with kick or ground stomp resets leap s cooldown but this will mean to remove ultimate or weapon mastery skills because of multipliers from legendary aspects especially the basic and core skill ones i didn t feel the need to use war cry yeah it gives you berserk but i can get that with death blow again all of this can change as i level into the end game and into higher tier difficulties barbarian is a fun class to play with high mobility potential big burst damage due to how multipliers work but it would be a shame to play it with shouts on your skill bar
at the time i had weak gear i prefered railling cry because of the movement speed the unstoppable and fury generation after i got enough hp and armour i switched to war cry to gain berserk and fortify from it for thorn builds you probaly run challenging shout and i bet we will see later undying barbs abusing this cry shout
obviously this could all change endgame but x200b i think iron skin was a very strong skill and our only good source of non situational self sustain i really wanted to play with a build that could utilize deathblow for berserking and rupture for self heal that could play heavily in to the whole weapon swap mechanic and buffs but often found myself going back to iron skin rallying cry and warcry as the of them just seemed to good not to use i could see challenging shout being added to that list for hardcore as well but never felt needed for me on softcore
really hoping on launch i can get away with a generator less upheaval stomp jump all warcries barb i really think ultimates should have their own unique designation and even that mobility skills should just replace the mediocre default evade ability maybe generators should have a single unique designation as well right now the six skills feel too limited and ultimates don t feel very ultimate
challenging shout seemed way too good without any skills from items you get damage reduction can easily get that to with a couple items to get cs and almost uptime with the right aspect and skills doesn t anyone else think there s no way this is making it into live nothing any other class even comes close to this defensive power don t get me wrong i was loving barb all beta but perma dr seems absurd lol that s without all the additional max hp fortify etc effects from just having it running
when i get a chance i ll do a breakdown from my experiences but yeah i found them all to be interesting useful i m really hoping to make a charge leap kick build work because i think it d be hilarious to kick an elite in the balls sending them across the room before they explode
https://d4builds.link/vqfjm4 my first build and i m planning on sc at first till season start then i will try the build in hc if the build feels good in sc i love iron skin esp with the extra hp it s like a free health pot with a buff i love frenzy barbs though and will mostly be spamming frenzy and rend and working everything else around those two skills i ll see how it goes using a point in lunge for right click gap closer lunge with 2hb frenzy with dual wield and rend on 2hs is gonna keep arsenal buffs up constantly while reducing ultimate cool down i think it s gonna be a fun time
rallying cry kick and charge all going on the bar due to stacking vulnerability damage and trigger berserking might change at higher world tiers but those let me dish out insane damage
i wonder if we can make a kick build and how far we can make kick viable it s gonna be funny name a barb chucknorris and just yell in general chat in pvp roundhouse
call of the ancients was a worthwhile ult in my play through gave me good burst and usually pulled agro as a definite cooldown to allow healing gathering pots
that s where i got to as well the ultimates are useful for high burst e g bosses but the power and availability of the defensive brawling skills made the ultimates pretty questionable value
for thorns build ultimates might be rather underwhelming aside from cota for single target but after playing the barb more and also watching gameplay of rob s akaizer s ww barb kinda starting to see the appeal in wrath of the berserker cc immune and 10sec of big dmg is pretty good
good analysis i agree on challenging shout i was loathe to ever take it off my skill bar kick with at least the first enhancement seemed useful against boss packs bash the main guy into a wall and then pummel him into the dirt note that i play a lot of couch coop so i movement skills are slightly less appealing that being said leap charge did seem to be stronger choices
there s an aspect that makes the kicked mob explode doing aoe damage if it dies
i enjoyed kick as well especially on larger enemies great sense of power in that skill however i m not sure it is better than leap especially once it has the fury generation
one of the things i really liked about the beta was the sense of weight to the barbarian s attacks and skills i used a lot of kick leap death blow and hota all of them felt like they dealt bone crushing blows to the enemy which is exactly the feel i m looking for
indeed i do my best to avoid that but some of the boss fights did have some tight moments where having the panic button of is was quite timely
i had a similar experience mainly played couch coop so challenging shout kick sometimes leap allowed me to take control of the boss packs while my sorc wife burned them down
yes rallying cry got used a lot which makes sense for a class that was relatively resource starved it s just so convenient especially since it doubles as a cc break i don t think it has the actual power of some of the other options but sometimes quality of life is hard to give up
challenging shout iron skin provides a ton of sustain over the course of tough battles i pretty much always ran one of these two or both i ended up liking the other path for deathblow as it let me get away from some other resource gen stuff and tied in well with the big aoe cores hota upheaval
i did a fair amount of kick leap in the beta and had the explode aspect on kick charge which i combo d with death blow for some satisfying results
thanks for the build i hadn t seen that site before two primaries is interesting but i can understand as lunging strike is basically the best movement skill the barbs have
i enjoyed that one quite a bit worked with charge as well
oh yeah that one was a lot of fun to use but once i hit i couldn t fit it into my gear because of the other legendary powers i wanted to keep i may try to incorporate it when i do the build in the full game though
i actually used kick and leap in my build during the open beta really enjoyed both of them
yeah the sound matches the impacts perfectly
yeah nothing was more op than a sorc wife with a full hotbar of dps frost skills chain lightening and the fireball enchant while your barb is doing everything to control mobs she didn t even need defense my wife and i had a great time with the beta but i think she s settled on necromancer for release
and being unstoppable is probaly the best choice for the pvp area at least in hardcore
challenging shout definitely has the better mitigation but has no self heal off of it so why i ending up going iron skin
i want this to work so bad what the cool down resets and other supports hoping it makes for some fun or at least silly gameplay i want to punt a fire enchanted elite into my wizard friend so bad
i added an edit i also use lunge with 2hb so i get all three arsenal buffs lunge in with 2hb then rend with 2hs which will cause debuffs and frenzy spam with the dual wield
damaging an enemy with kick or ground stomp resets leap s cooldown can t wait
that was our experience as well my girl mainly ran lightning stuff with a big dose of hydra and of course the fireball enchant the main downside was her chain lightning picking off weaker enemies before my death blow animation could resolve denying me the fury and chain into hota ah well there are worse problems to have
i didn t test it extensively but my first impression of healing of iron skin barrier per sec wasn t impressive there s the other passive that allows shouts to regen max health per second it does take more skill point invested but seems more consistent uptime than iron skin healing especially if taking more than shout and the shout duration
yes that heal on the iron skin is very appealing the combination of the two skills is really strong punch cs then punch is when you take a heavy hit
getting a kill every death blow is a skill i m still trying to master
i thought the healing from shout only effected allies
i assumed it counts yourself but you could be right now that i read again i didn t test that one during beta
i tested it and i didn t see any healing to myself
not sure if it was bug in description or in skill itself but i ve tested it and it healed you as well
i believe i tested it and saw no heal for myself hopefully i recall incorrectly tho and i agree iron skins heal is far from amazing but oxutside of it our only other options really are invigorating fury was ok for ww but i didnt like it for upheavel build rupture not really a fan of this skill in general using up ur bleads if blead dedicated or just really being incredibly low damage or lunging strike situational annoying to try relying on in group play and worthless against bosses elites who wont spend most the fight health i dislike relying solely on pots for heals while i enjoyed rogue a lot in beta i just kept on wishing barb could facetank and self heal as well as him obvi this could be vastly different lategame could literally just stand still facetanking the butcher on rogue even when surprised in the teens levels
up to you personally i feel it s a bit dated but it s still enjoyable
yeah it s the best diablo game ever made imo resurrected is great
you can try it the combat is dated as hell and can be extra tedious on some characters while leveling up but d2r nailed the graphics imo and playthrough is fun and challenging d2 shines at the endless item hunting and figuring out the itemization
d2 will feel slow and clunky but the progress is quite satisfying the real power is in items but some characters and builds will go a long way with just skills i would highly recommend not spoiling too much with guides builds on your first playthrough but after you reach hell you will likely need to respec if you don t they re limited so don t use them all willy nilly one thing worth understanding is breakpoints for cast rate and hit recovery look that up if you re interested in some details up front
if you are only looking for a gap filler until d4 you might as well safe yourself the money and try poe instead since it s f2p
it s on sale i decided to get the prime evil collection and play through 2r and i can see why people get hooked on it especially if they have the nostalgia factor and are obsessed with the itemization and trading from a gameplay perspective however it s just not even in the same realm as or even you run around pressing one button to make dimensional bots fall over even immortal feels closer to that hit of satisfying mass demon slaying carnage ducks definitely feel like you either give it a quick run through for the story to say you did it or you invest hours and make obtaining items your second life no in between
you should play diablo it is most like then play
you won t get the d4 feeling but d2 is a good game old but gold
i feel this i ve never casually played d2 it was always an all in or one and done situation
keeping it as an emote keeps it exclusive while not also taking up the back slot i want both the wings when i want and the pup on my back with other cosmetic options from future finds or purchases but that is just my opinion
i agree with you it could be wings special pet mount or even just transmog all that is just reskin anyway emote is just lazy job i don t know who s idea that was but that guy have sense for marketing i don t think in heat of battle ppl will emote each other also not many will chill out in town and emote everybody to show that they have that one special one after all they would look stupid and nobody would care but blizzard is known for idiotic experiments like that
female druid isn t unattractive
druid wasn t that weak in the beta and will be the most overpowered class at launch
the game will cater towards those that are willing to buy stuff from the store
too edgy
it s going to be a good game
diablo has four body types thin toned muscular thick and that s ok if it s a big deal play the one that suits your desired preference the most instead of trying to prevent an entire body type from not existing at all as if you live your life in an episode of baywatch and have the depth of a rain droplet diablo is just an evolution from diablo immortal and the other classic style diablo games d2 d3 it integrates elements from both heavily many of the features mechanisms diablo will be implementing exists in diablo immortal already you don t have to play or like diablo there are other games you can play if you re filled with rage and just drink hatorade all day vote with your wallet bring it
i love the witch doctor aesthetic but i didn t really enjoy the gameplay i d hope if they brought it back they d focus on drain and curses i d love for skill abilities like essence drain hexblast and bane from poe to be the focus i d love the aesthetic to be spirit and black magic curses focuesed
they won t because it s too druid necro vibes and since we got both if they want to revamp the class to its own unique thing that isn t just druid and necro i think there is potential and it would probably play as a dot class mostly
probably go all in with hex voodoo magic and poison maybe little to no minions this time around the rest of the skills would still work like piranha pestilence bbv for group buff etc
oh definitely i feel like some of their skills are in need of a buff perspectively the witch doctor is like the necromancer except weaker in terms of their skills relatively while playing them as my main i noticed some abilities just don t have a high rate of kill or kill enemies as fast that is needed for some play styles they can dish out a shit ton of debuffs i will say that my current build actually has it to where it debuffs elites for my pets to attack with higher damage it s hard to build up mostly because diablo doesn t have that good of a system to make builds with but with the skills it can be a little hard to find the sweet spot
indeed like the pets are ok it s nothing large to the extent of necromancer since you can only summon a limited number of zombie dogs one gargantuan and fetish s the druid has the dogs and the necromancer obviously has their own gargantuan so that s mostly covered like you said but the fetish s can definitely be their own thing small little gremlins that can help fight or support is definitely fitting for the witch doctor and all that the spirits can easily become a focused ability to use like the blood abilities or nature abilities of both necromancer and druid like it can definitely be worked on in a specific way where it can be fun
the dogs and gargantuan can be added or not with little to no change but the fetish s could be added to make a truly unique class most of the wd abilities can be builds if focused on like both necro and druid have with their abilities
they had some cool idea but it was weird bc it felt like glass cannon gameplay i like the idea of a debilitator but one that kind of brings their enemies to their knees kind of vibe yeah i felt the class had a lot of potential and cool be really cool but just didn t quite feel right unfortunately i doubt it will be back bc i don t think it s very popular it s a shame because i think it has a ton of potential at least initially we ll probably see another iteration of a holy warrior paladin type we ve seen a thousand times before oh well
yeah wd definitely can fit and i hope it crusader monk and many more classes get added
yeah honestly wd can fit into d4 with some minor changes hopefully we get them in the future
indeed of course it s probably gonna be named differently but for the core of the character it wouldn t be out of place in diablo if they were added i can already imagine what their skill tree would look like
yeee i feel like they would have a very fun skill tree considering how some of their abilities in theory can be if it had a sole focus on
wow they really did paragon boards dirty by only showing primary stat nodes lol still early but it seems you ll feasibly hit glyphs and legendary nodes about rare nodes and maybe magic nodes with the rest being common gates if you rush through boards you could hit glyph legendaries each not that they will be super complex but some glyph and legendary node examples are mastery skills have x increased area you deal x increased damage per nearby burning enemy up to y skills that critically strike generate x fury thorns damage increases all damage an enemy takes from you and your minions by x up to y for z seconds bleeding enemies you kill explode dealing of their max life to surrounding enemies hurricane and cataclysm create a tornado every seconds while they are active after shapeshifting your spirit costs are reduced by for seconds up to crackling energy has a chance to not consume a charge when triggered crackling energy s damage is increased by x2 per total intelligence you have alot of the paragon and glyph affixes are exactly what people were describing they d prefer to see legendary item affixes of not something powerful to a specific skill but some interesting unique modifiers that apply to a group of skills based on a keyword or skill grouping source https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/database/](https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/database/) i dont think these are going to feel super robust at launch but what makes the progression mechanics in d4 exciting is that its easy to imagine how they can scale and grow and introduce more interesting choices new paragon boards changes to existing boards increased paragon max level new glyphs expansions to the skill tree this where d3 really failed there was so little to expand on to give players new interesting choices all they had were just new item affixes paragon in d3 was so mindless and in the end pointless since everyone ends up the same at max paragon we ll see how d4 follows through on this
the comment section is so predictable the video shows the paragon boards and shows them selecting nodes at most on the boards spoiler do not read on if you don t want spoilers the nodes selected and showed however brief are all basic nodes there are also magic nodes rare nodes and legendary nodes on each paragon board each type of node has a different batch of affixes that they can draw from basic nodes have flat increases to basic stats magic nodes will boost skills in a very basic way to wolves or damage on tornado etc rare nodes will be more diverse but basically just bigger boosts vs magic nodes legendary modes can completely change an ability it can change an earth skill to a storm skill and boost the damage significantly in the case of a driud to make one example each board will have roughly basic nodes magic nodes rare and legendary meaning each board has one legendary node these legendary nodes can and likely will completely define your characters build added to all of this there are glyphs that you collect and upgrade when you start completing nightmare dungeons these can be placed in glyph slots and further boost the nodes surrounding it the higher the level glyph the greater the area of effect and increase in boosts i can t confirm nor deny that i participated in the end game beta alpha and therefore know any of the above to be true or not i can say that the details mentioned above have been seen and shared in various images the primary takeaway from this is that paragon boards are already much much more complex and unique than what of you think or believe they are all that said everything i ve shared is subject to change by the time the game goes live i can say that there s zero doubt in mind that things will only improve as time goes by after the game launches
im about to cook myself some dinner thinking of making tuna tacos
the leaks have revealed all this in about 100x more detail this was more of a marketing video not really end game in depth video the paragon they showed was a complete disaster didn t even go into the glyph system and leveling up glyphs and how that changes paragon boards at all blizzard only have themselves to blame for putting out a weak marketing video instead of going in depth to show off the actual system people see simple stat skills and think that s all paragon is completely disregarding the glyphs paragon awful job blizzard to make your paragon system look a lot worse than what it actually is talk about being your own worst enemy sheesh blizzard trying to make their own game look worse than it is for pete s sake show the details of the paragon system and more specifically glyph powers and how leveling those up changes paragon
the paragon board will make your character uniquely yours meanwhile on screen dexterity dexterity willpower x200b x200b that paragon board bullshit is fucking pathetic
so many buzz words used which is never a good sign it all felt so forced
everyone here is talking about the paragon board but i m just happy to see andussy andariel returning
i see a lot of comparison between poe and d4 while similar i think the biggest thing is that even if poe tree gives lots of stats there is still a lot more diversity and depth in that tree for example a lightning arrow ranger will spec into stuff like life evasion spell suppression mana reservation efficiency additional projectiles crit bow damage attack speed life leech movement speed projectile speed then more nuanced nodes like masteries and whatno with the datamined info and this video there really isn t that there is a lot of base stats and a few comparable rare legendary nodes most of the paragon board is very basic stat while they may result in the same power they don t feel as impactful or special i get much more excited to spend points on travel nodes to get attack speed and bow damage than i do to get dexterity that s the big disconnect issue a lot of poe players are commenting on
just delete this sub holy shit you guys are unbearable hmm let s see one thing i don t like and cling to it like it s the worst thing to ever exist and will kill the game before it comes out like literally go do anything else before june
re paragon there was a legendary node they highlighted over called cheap shot which was a damage increase on nearby crowd controlled mobs which would be essentially a flat increase on my rogue build i had so that s cool that s basically how every tree in every game works builder nodes to cool single nodes
so for pvp they went to the division s dark zone which everyone freaking hates and no one plays because it s an absolute gankfest and went let s do that
the marketing in this video is so bad i don t blame people complaining at all awful showcase
these official dev videos are honestly not that good
main stat
ok hang on a second so we see parts of paragon boards and everyone loses their minds yes i grant you that base stat is not exciting but we still don t have the full picture is there a website that has full paragon boards yet so i can formulate a proper opinion
there s no doubt that d4 will be a financial success you can be as negative as you like about poe but there s no denying that when chris wilson talks about the game he sounds enthusiastic about it these devs all came across like they are being held at gun point to praise something they have zero interest in
looks pretty cool
really hoping that new seasons bring better paragon boards the system itself isn t bad they just need to be more creative within it
this entire thread https://i.imgflip.com/7h5th3.jpg)
can i get a cod with my order of fish n chips
literally nothing new what s even the point of them making the video lol
what human actually says in a meeting discussing game design that stats over and over and over is exciting i m being serious and not joking who does that put yourself in that meeting someone suggests an entire board of stats but it rotates and the consensus is looks good do these people not play games how is that fun or exciting or thrilling what does that even add to the experience why
i don t want to be overly critical until i try the endgame but it does seem to confirm the fears of many that it ll be shallow
glorious everyone will be so different build dex dex dex dex dex dex strength build dex dex dex dex dex dex int build dex dex dex dex dex dex dex
i m so so glad they took quality minutes to go over the biggest fundamental core component for the longevity of the game i m glad they matched the depth of time the end game will have with the length of the video
for everyone that says poe is also just main stats and all notables are just x in category y poe main stats are actually weak in comparison to everything else thus you want to minimize the amount of travel nodes that you take this introduces point tension where the value of a nodes changes dependent on the node location relative to your tree also you will never have multiple travel nodes with nothing interesting next to them i e every travel node is the entry node for a notable wheel most likely one you dont need but still in the paragon board it seems like there are multiple stat nodes next to each other just because at the same time stats are a major factor for requirements even as a melee char i e str dex you may need alot of int to equip a specifc item or utility gem this is especially true of int chars because the defensive auras are so powerful that you need both str and dex finally you can invest into the value of the stats themselves i e make str itself more powerful by adding effects which can shift the value of travel nodes to the point of making them the best nodes you can take something that alot of ppl here dont get is that while its true that most stats in the poe passive tree are just to x category you cannot have 1k uniques nodes btw each and every playstyle has multiple axes to scale dmg i e crit crit multi in d4 and defensive resource requirements to fulfill which have their own axes to choose from and to scale and each of those are different for the skill you play you can even change the axes you want to scale e g poison instead of hit this introduces so much variety and degrees of freedom for each skill that each and every notable even if its boils down to stats are super valuable which in turn also introduces point tension like in travel nodes because you simply cannot allocate all of them also the value of specific stats changes depending on how much you have of it in the tree items e g poison chance dmg conversion etc you just cannot say stats to categories is the same as stats to categories especially if the former is mostly only the super basic ones that dont really interact with you at all i e the main stats if you would take the ratio of main stat travel nodes to notable wheel nodes in poe i dare say you take less travel nodes than wheel nodes final note i dont say this to bash d4 because d4 wants to be a simple game and that is fine if you want more depth you go to poe but what some ppl here say about poe passive tree is just plain wrong
if it s not oprah screaming that i got a new car as part of the endgame then i m canceling my preorder screw you blizzard
looks like the open beta feedback response is far off in mid april we will publish a blog on our news site that details how we ll translate player feedback into improvements for diablo iv on april a m pdt members of the diablo iv development team accompanied by a special guest host rhykker will return for the next diablo iv developer update livestream where they ll further elaborate on our planned improvements they ll also delve into the flames and share additional details about endgame systems
this is a marketing video not the developer blog
wow so much hate here enjoy being angry i m gonna enjoy playing the game instead this all especially the new paragon system looks great to me see you haters in june when you all start playing the game anyway lol
sounds like a blast and i m here for it
i think the paragon board will be a little more diverse than people are giving it credit i mean outside of some bizarre major build changing nodes in poe that tree is also mostly stat life movement damage type armor dodge etc chances are there will be some room on the board to make more of a defensive character focus on health pool movement speed etc it s also not that far fetched to assume they could add some really unique nodes to the board in the future it s a brand new game i m not going to be that concerned about lack of build diversity until seasons or
these videos look so forced and rehearsed this better not be another trash ass game like d3 ill never forget they showed pvp in the trailers and then never had it during release
holy shit this is bad none of these people ever played an arpg in their life x200b edit only d3 apparently
do i miss something or is there just no goal after you got your build going and got the legendres needed you are basically done there is no trade no leaderboard no longevity it feels like that will feel exactly like d3 without set items and hell if without leaderboards
i don t play poe so i m genuinely curious how different are their paragon boards and what makes them better
i can t be hyped up with such a video sounds like a lot of noise for nothing am i the only one that feels like they have nothing to say about their game i m worried about the endgame deepdive telling me how we will be running around the world do nightmare dungeon once again lol i would legit prefer if they wouldn t release such a video at all this is depressing marketing
there will always be something to be done makes me think of daily weekly quests there shouldn t always be something to be done the player should be wanting to do more on its own you know grinding and that s a big difference
ngl bros this video was super mid borderline l havent played the cbt but it looks like the people banking on the paragon systems are gonna be dissapointed
deleted
i m still a little confused at what exactly the end game is we can unlock nightmare versions of a dungeon which is harder and adds affixes i m assuming like a map in poe do i only need to unlock the nightmare version once the tree of whispers looks like a daily weekly quest that tells you to go out in the world and kill a certain amount of monsters and come back for an award and then there s a pvp thing they also said there s some sort of dungeon you have to complete before going up the next difficulty so do i just re do the campaign over and over with each new difficulty or do i do the nightmare dungeons i also don t know why they showed such a boring aspect of the paragon board i understand there are the travel nodes but is there something to work towards to make your build more unique maybe i didn t pay enough attention to the video
i guess i m casual but i liked the video i like that you ll be able to endgame via pve pvp or dungeon grinding whatever you feel like doing at the time that makes me happy the paragon board seemed interesting that you can rotate them around and yeah it was enough to get me excited for the live update that they re doing this month
d4 is only a short step ahead and i guess blzz will give us more and more information now and then yes it seems like a poor marketing video and blizz blames his game but throwing out every information now would be boring i rather hunt the rabbit and get some cookies in a spare way to finally build up my interest tension and of coz my anticipation for the game i waited since years june will come and u can be sure blizz will release more information soon so be happy with it and dont be to much aggressive coz u dont get all at once
hold up the lady said you can complete a dungeon for a chance to drop a codex entry are they not guaranteed like beta
it appears we are at the stage where every time someone at blizzard produces any content whatsoever this subreddit hyperventilates over their keyboard tracking ahead of schedule
bring me the copium fast lads
so beta had all the endgame basically except stat
truly depressing rebranded bounties same but scaled up dungeons pvp to farm shards for bounty bags
i cant decide should i go for 5dex 5dex 5dex 5dex 5int or 5dex 5dex 5dex 5dex 5strength so much possibilities
yikes
i liked the video that s it
this video is a disaster any hope of innovation that was left is gone
x stat and x damage that s all blizzard fanboys let s googogogo i m so excited i feel like all games are trash after i played d4 beta
so many things in the video look great i just want to be able to play and see how many of these systems work out
i am no longer looking forward to d4 will wait the early access out for endgame reviews there s nothing interesting to do that i haven t done in the other arpgs currently on my pc according to this video but with less complexity and stats what doing blizzard what an own goal of a promotional video
endgame and paragon boards look to be in a pretty bad shape last hopium on the seasonal content
it feels like endgame is something they only put in cus they had to put something in not because it s something they really care about or rather it s more that it s made by people who only play relatively casually designed for them like they know some players care a lot about endgame but don t really have a clue what those players want or don t want to make that sort of game
all you folks who just compare everything poe does why are you even here just go play poe if it s that much better
players we want to distribute stat points like in d2 also players the paragon board pathing is stat choices wtf is this boring shit
nothing about endgame is different then the level character we had wtf
but but but the paragon board guys mainstat alright onto the next cope end game obviously gonna be mid
tldr in terms of endgame there s no endgame
haha this really helps with my withdrawal symptoms if they continuelike this in the next months they may convince me not to buy the game let alone paying for the early release
people who design the game don t actually play it it never changes
damn end game is looking really bad i m glad i refunded my pre order silly me pre ordering a blizzard game after the diablo immortal launch yikes
is it implied that we have to actually physically travel to each dungeon to run it
video intro general marketing said nothing end game content paragon board blizzard has an overemphasis on the paragon board it s nothing special at all the customization offered by the paragon board as per the leaked paragon board is extremely cookie cutter each board has an obvious pick for each of the main skills meaning everyone who uses those skills will always pick the same paragon boards this is a linear progression with in actuality no customization so to make it out to be highly innovative by blizzard is just insulting to the player base s intelligence you can turn the board around no one cares nightmare dungeons harder dungeons has been around in arpgs for decades diablo had normal nightmare and hell difficulty this is nothing new the best addition to the dungeon they could come up with was a portal that just spawns a bunch more mobs do you know how not imaginative that is that s like programming assignment for a video game development course it s about as easy to program as it gets with intelligent thought going into it and that s the best they came up with uh oh bounties i mean we saw bounties in d3 also and they were more annoying than anything else just a lot of teleporting around for quickly doing quests that no one really cared for i will say the implementation of this system looks a lot better in d4 than d3 though so i think given how negative my review has been up to this point i am going to say this looks decent and i ll give it the benefit of the doubt there might be something good here but it also looks like something that might just get ignored like bounties in d3 pvp this right here looks like the only good thing they re offering at the moment for end game content imo this needs to be a huge focus if pvp ends up being an afterthought and these zones are just pve zones because no one bothers to pvp in the zones that s going to be a huge letdown if blizzard focuses all their effort into making these pvp zones be a major focus of the entire game then this will be fantastic imagine the level of competition in d4 for these zones as you might see in a lost ark or league of legends or wow arenas pvp if they can develop this well this right here will be the best addition to d4 and set it apart from all other arpgs forever however i say this with low expectations i fully expect blizzard to make pvp an afterthought and i have a sinking feeling that after the novelty wears off these zones are going to become empty of pvp and people will just farm them as a normal boring pve experience yet they won t even do that because i bet the pve gains from these zones are going to be less than other areas so in the end these zones are going to become a ghost town save my post now for when this happens you can subscribe to my channel for future apt predictions ongoing updates blizzard is good with ongoing updates blizzard completely changed d3 around after its disastrous launch into a completely different game than how d3 started at launch i do believe blizzard will well support d4 after launch this just becomes tricky though typically your best programmers designers will want pay raises soon and blizzard likely won t give it to them so they ll bail for another game company using d4 to leverage their resume unlike with an mmorpg that has subscriptions there isn t too much monetary incentive for blizzard to keep the best talent around post launch this means you re generally left with the b team post launch redhead girl is sticking around for sure and she ll probably get promoted but she has drank way too much of koolaid for me to have faith in the progression of d4 post launch i guess we ll have to wait and see how the monetization is if they start adding battle passes every months and people are buying them because blizzard is adding significant amounts of content blizzard might pour a lot of resources into d4 which would generally be good news for us overall the video doesn t leave me feeling very good about the end game content i think d4 is being released pretty barebones and blizzard is basically banking on simply being able to add more content post launch which isn t really a great position to be in for a game i m still going to play and i m sure i ll have fun for at least a few months
is she the endboss
if they are going to have unique rewards and such for pvp then they really better address the massive advantage of people on wider aspect ratios going to destroy anyone on without ever appearing on the screen
this is actually really good we got the basics to the end game content so the livestream on april 20th can hopefully focus more on the details
since when getting main stats are meaning full option
grim dawn a budget arpg made by an indie dev has more endgame content than d4
so they didn t change a single thing from closed end game beta great
so thats where the druid model came from
watch out yall may anger the fanboys with this criticism
is it weird that i am erect
sorc spells look exactly like base lol hopefully they forgot to enable the leveled up fx in this vid cuz if not it s visually super underwhelming
so no end game
this video is a big win i don t understand where the main stat retards come from exploration open world diversity pvp keep on this track blizzard and d4 will revitalize the franchise don t listen to haters or the minority that will always complain
it s funny to see so many blizzard defenders keep mocking poe and d2 whenever d4 got some shits
people still thinking paragon boards are anything but mundane the info was leaked long ago of them are garbage with a few slightly interesting glyphs in total it s a joke
removed
anyone else more terrified of the nm dungeons then anything else extra objectives to make the mindlessly boring backtracking in d4 even more apparent
what a fucking shitshow truly d4 will be killer of poe and other action hack slash games s
did they just spend minutes telling us less than we already know wtf
this was a pathetic marketing bs video that told me nothing that would make me excited for d4 endgame blizzard must think we are all idiots if they talk to us in this way
what a joke
conclusion so there is no endgame
is she a druid
hey if we re copying d3 can we put in the leaderboards gr pushing that was like the best part about d3 so might as well include that too
its funny because lost ark provides huge build changing bonuses and literal ways to change your skills fireball splitting off into arc fireball ray fireball etc without all the extra head work why overcomplicate and take away from player agency
does anyone else think the devs on camera look slightly lifeless undead not sure if its the lightning or they added an effect but one dude looks like he has no pupils
the best part of the video was the redhead
meanwhile druids haaaaaahaha
this isn t targeted at players at all this is targeted at the shareholders who are like years old and want to see slides for fucking everything to justify progress and guage success this is all about satisfying some ancient need for progress according to out of touch shareholders
i made a post about this the other day and got downvoted to hell as i called it out of not being more then a couple attribute nodes seems i was right
game seems promising s
paragon system looks way too complex i m also worried about always having something to do a good game should have you nearing maximum power able to deal with anything in the game besides ultra optimized other characters with gg gear by playing a reasonable amount per day you can get to running hell mode in less than a week of solid play in d2 and by the end of the second week you will be able to run hell mode without much threat of dying i m really worried the game will go the way of d3 so many new games these days remove the enjoyment of being the best in the name of infinite content just let a game have a fucking end i don t want an end game i want the game to end corporate products also often target center mass i m worried how they kept saying you can play any way you want to clearly an initiative by corporate suits rather than an initiative by an artist trying to make the best game possible for people similar to themselves
wow paragon boards will make your character so unique strength strength strength strength armor wowee
i ll continue to wait maybe after the game is out a year i ll decide
i ma be honest here but it kinda sound better when played at speed
the failure of live service games are normally because of being a half assed release so as long as the game is solid out the gate i think the game will be very successful
let s also please remember for a lot of people this will be their first diablo game
tl dr d2 had no endgame at launch or after expansion it still doesn t pindle runs is not end game
pretty sure d2 act wasn t complete
the key phrase here is live service implying changes updates new events new story elements this a stark contrast to the current diablo games that are more static at the end of the day the loot hunt is what diablo and any other games like it are about doing its what a arpg is the end game is always the addictive rush of hunting for new items and thus getting stronger its about trying builds cool ways to do better and be more effective the fact that it has mmo type elements doesnt change the arpgness of it arpgs are about building up strength and the loot hunt i see all these comments and videos talking about how light the game appears lets not jump to early conclusions till it comes out a live game is active always changing always adding new stuff no previous game had the designation we haven t seen anything yet i think people should just take a step back and stop and see what game we get you either are excited about it from the beta or you don t which is ok its not everyone cup of tea and it never will be
xmog is the end game guys
that clickbait title
personally i think people have way too many expectations for this game on launch arpgs always start with a lot of systems and ambitions some work out but a lot don t does anyone remember poe at launch how many years were people running the same acts over and over no altas just stick the maps in the machine or how about d3 launch the auction house inferno these games all improved considerably after a few years of fine tuning also pvp in these games have always been a fun mess around mode if you are coming expecting a fully balanced esport with all build viability and skill based gameplay just don t pvp will be rife with unintended skill abuse gank squads stun locks perma unstoppable op gear thorn builds killing rogues rogues shotting sorc even with the pvp dmg reduction it s fun it s goofy and i m sure there will be a tryhard discord for duels and squad battles just please don t expect it to be some super skill based any class build can win with good play it could be but it s really likely it won t be
but this sub has told me repeatedly the endgame is boring uninspired and safe who do i believe now
updating content with seasons doesn t and have seasons or did i misunderstand this
people do need to realize that this game has every model of monetization so long as you re willing to keep giving them money more things will release
d2 endgame content is endless baal runs d3 is endless grinding for paragon and hoping you hit gear better than what you already have i would say anything else at all would be superior and welcome
yeah but does d4 have deckard cain
diablo had an end game nearly of all classic diablo players reached level levels were end game running chaos sanctuary literarily times or you just will never reach max level end of the game your character never being finished or complete until he is even in lod hitting is no simple task but that is end game sorry your level amazon isn t end game quite yet you have roughly baal runs to go
looks like you forgot about diablo immortal
vanilla d3 inferno was the hardest endgame ever i know you really love d4 but it s not reinventing the wheel here it s integrating mmo elemnts into a diablo skin
the thing people keep forgetting is that this is just the beginning just the foundation the game will only continue to get better and i had more fun playing d4 than i ve had in a decade playing any other title
i would hope in general a game coming out from the same dev years later would improve on the original
what matters is quality wise how good and frequent the content is if the game comes out and the content added is nothing but a dril with minor or simplistic additions the game will die yes the game is going to be a live service but that really is not justification for a limited game not saying the game at launch will be but i m just saying that ultimately what will matter is what the end game feels like and if it warrants sticking around for new content this is also why it is imperative blizzard makes a good faith effort to listen to feedback and make reasonable changes
i already know i m gonna lose my life to this game i have zero idea how i m gonna balance this with destiny and ff14 not to mention ff16 and baldurs gate coming out very soon after it this is like the golden age of gaming for me right now
long as d4 endgame doesn t devolve into fuckin gr runs again
sure but overwatch is a live service game and look at how slowly content comes for that compared to fortnite
what do you think live service is
unfortunately it seems to be exactly like diablo when it got seasons which i think is a shame i would rather pay a subscription to not have endless season restart but endless horizontal content instead i liked that about lost ark all the content and playing different classes if you look past the incredible greedy shitty pay2win main progression it was very fun
i feel like i m explaining this all the freaking time too they re just set on complaining and too stubborn game is not perfct for them now hurrrdurrr it shouldn t be difficult to understand if it s not the game you want it to be now wait and it likely will be later poe didn t get there overnight d2 had issues too d3 you re not going to make the game change on your whim so stop throwing tantrums people
d2 endgame is the blood moor d3 has no endgame d4 probably wont also get good
from what i heard so far d4 endgame on launch won t be so different to d3 endgame on launch work your way up to the highest difficulty outscale everything wait for new content the first season in d3 came a bit later but if you forget the time between content for a moment then d3 seems very much like a life service game to me so yeah from my pov d3 and d4 aren t that different after all it even seems like d4 will launch without impossible content that can only be completed with maxed out gear just like d3 did which is fine by me i hope they bring it in season
honestly i just dont like live service it has become a fall back term for devs to release games half finished and finish them with the live service tag as an excuse there something to be said about games years ago or more that released feature complete it was nice to know you had a finished product if the game done well it got supported with expansions i feel thats a much better way of doing things as you go in knowing what you are going to get from the start d4 looks to be a really fun game but like most argps now days there true game content starts at end game and when we see end game content lacking that live service tag starts to pop up for an excuse and we now have to wait many seasons for the game to be a finished product if at all
hopefully the last
d2 the end game is completing diablo baal on the hardest difficulty but yes it was way too easy even when starting as a newbie tho it s severely harder if you are doing ssf and starting as a newbie the unlimited play is getting stronger completing stuff faster easier the lack of updates is what s holding it back no new content no new challenges d3 highly expertly to be a carry on to d2 story while providing new content and upgraded mechanics failed apart heavily once they removed and bounded items butchered item design in worst than better ways paragon system was new but at the end was not any better than the simple design they had previously repetitive paragon runs and item finding was just not as exciting as d2 because they are worthless you see a ton of legendaries drop in the same run only to know they all suck ass severely and not even worth keep any they butchered the darkness theme d4 endgame who are you kidding it s going to be the same thing as every game eventually none only thing that helps this is updates which they can do with any game the itemization and skill relocation from what we ve seen is somewhat newer but in no way that any better than previously just look at the paragon system do you want to add int or get str skill nods do you want to spend or extra point to buff synergy the skill how is that better then me pumping in more skill points to make a skill strong or stats individually for more customization all they had to do was revamp the skill tree from old design with these tickers bonuses to allow more customization overall d4 the bar is set a lot higher with the amount of time they had and the year we are in now to be a lot better in terms of everything so yes d2 is superior expectations are not met yet people are comparing how this is better then over decade year old games they worked and still working running today for a reason at the end from what we seen while d4 has made many improvements it also is missing a lot of working and loving elements of the franchise it is just mmorpg under the diablo2 name just like d3
no it s not diablo was as well as diablo immortal
arent all the diablo games live service i cant play d3 with no intranet
so you suggest buying the game after a couple of years where it might have meaningful endgame
yeah d4 is designed to be an mmorpg rather than an arpg
you should also remember that d4 is being designed with monetization in mind which most likely means practices meant to hook players i understand being excited about the game but these posts really sound like either blizzard marketing or straight brainwash
what is the definition of a live service in this context
disclaimer i like diablo and i can t wait for the release i m not a hater that being said i would like a d4 as a service game but lets remember it s blizzard they have abandoned all of their games at the release even the games which were supposed to be followed game with new content to add starcraft abandoned overwatch abandoned heroes of the storm abandoned one exception is wow but they are adding less and less things so i can t trust blizzard for that
i really hope they grow and further expand the classes skills after launch druid and necro both need better mobility skills on the more general topic i agree i think live service model is great when done right it s just that so many games don t do it right path of exile is just too much for me and warframe is too much of a shooter to keep me engaged for long i m really looking forward to d4 i might wind up putting wayyyy more time into than d3 which i probably wound up putting more time into than d2 even if it isn t necessarily better
well diablo hilariously had no attention given to it it s almost like that game was a giant accident it eventually became fun but damn i m glad they care so much about because boooiiiii i ve been waiting for this for so long
people actually like season content i ve never understood the appeal
d3 was designed to be a live service game and profit through rmah it didn t work out so blizzard redesigned the game and fired the creative director at that time or is it forced resignation
looking at you anthem
and how succesful when it comes to mtx if they don t reach their internal goals shareholders might not be happy results in scaled down content but hopefully they will give it their all for the next years
a ten nay eleven year gap tends to have that effect
this is my first i played poe because it was free when it first launched as opposed to d2 and d3
one could argue ubers is a form of endgame i m trying to be nice it s one of my favorite games ever
that diablo has literally no endgame does not mean that it is not fun i m still playing it but there is no end game per say
diablo is about the loot hunt like all arpgs if you boil it down every arpg is about that on a basic level the other things are just activity to do when you have built up your character its extremely addictive and the fun of the game i don t get people who don t understand that part you either like that or don t even people in poe which alot of younger people seem to worship even in this sub as an example of what a arpg is supposed to be end game hunting for loot is the basic end game adding to that to keep peoples interest is what games usual do mapping paragon other silly things
regardless of how many runs you do on specific area and bosses d2 endgame is to hunt the runes and the loots
believe it or not back then endgame was ladder and build exploration with friends especially in hardcore so when ubers dropped that was a fairly significant endgame update and really fresh at the time
maybe i m old and jaded but farming for end game now activities systems often just feels like farming with extra steps end game as a way to measure your power skill objectively then just acts as a way to validate or justify all the farming this isn t a criticism to d4 but i think both devs and players get overzealous about new complex systems bounties rifts greater rifts for example don t fool yourself you re still just chasing a carrot all that matters is whatever is implemented is fun complexity for the sake of complexity is not needed we don t need to go back to pindle days but devs have to also realize that the gameplay has to be fun on the player s end of the screen and not just a well intended talking point on a notepad
trading was the endgame best endgame in any game
so you dont like arpgs never played d2
the end game in d2 was about trying to get a hc character to if you didn t play hc particularly hc ladder you were just a pussy that never actually participated in the end game
pvp was the true end game change my mind
what was not complete about it
i am a bit afraid of games claiming to be live games so far many of them were scams names such as dice with battlefield were promising long support only to kill their game shortly after release but having long support is great look at league of legends they are doing an amazing job with that
pre atlas mappinig was the best mapping system though it was simple but had a lot of depth current one with single atlas tree and ruthless mode i guess is also good but all other atlas iterations since original release have been each worse than previous one and original was worse than pre atlas mapping in many ways they are overbloated with mechanics that just added complexity for the sake of complexity but didn t add much depth and in some cases made it worse and because of all the micromanagement it ruined the feel of mapping
it s been over a decade since d3 or poe came out the fact that those games were built up significantly over the years after launch doesn t change that d4 was created in a world where those systems already existed many of the more recent arpg releases have end games that build on what came before them or at least partially incorporate them if d4 isn t supposed to be a step up from d3 what s the point i don t expect perfection on day but it s also frustrating to be getting a game that while it ll of course still be worth playing at launch will take a year or two to be brought up to snuff
i agree but for different reasons i did not have high expectations for this game i was saying two years ago i doubt it will be good i will say the graphics teams did an amazing job it s just a different blizzard the one a lot of us grew up with made great games it s not easy to make a great game it takes a lot of passion and talent poe was free and still is free and pumps out tons of new content that is because of true passion and talent people should expect that when they pay for a game that it will be finished d4 might get there in years but i think people were expecting them to get there in the years they have already worked on it
blizzard attempts to balance pvp though if it s a decent part of their game even balancing abilities separately between modes saying it will be horrible because it s an arpg is not correct these games are typically singleplayer focused so nobody cares to balance pvp d4 is going to be a multiplayer live service game
d2 and d3 have seasonal resets but basically zero seasonal content neither game is a true live service because they only make money on the box cost of the game expansion d4 on the other hand has battlepasses and cosmetic mtx to fund continued development
had seasons none of the seasons ever changed anything just a ladder reset until recently with d2resurrected
those aren t real content
no they did op is just completely wrong lol
it s best if everyone forgets about that game
true
we don t talk about di
and diablo
doing the campaign again but harder is not an endgame design it s a difficulty setting
yeah but poe didn t cost money to get into if you are charging right out the gate the game needs to be worth it
there are nightmare dungeons in d4 d3 really only had doing the story again on a harder difficulty on launch nightmare dungeons in d4 are much closer to the current d3 endgame of greater rifts
no they stopped adding content after reaper of souls because nobody is paying them for it seasons were introduced to keep people playing without having to do development work for free
system in place for the game to continue making money so they can release actual new content instead of just seasons why would they release more if not getting compensated for it that s d3 for you
people that haven t experienced actual endgame probably only play arpgs
rip
i m and just never had no interest in this type of game but the beta hooked me in
i have high hopes despite it being a blizzard game
ahhhh the ubers end game you can reach on a first day of reset and put it down not slagging d2 off great game spent my early teenage years playing that but there is no end game mf runs are not end game neither are ubers or any farm runs for that matter players had to create their own end game like holy grails or even random character playthroughs as a form of an endgame looking at you zoo druid
for what purpose i ve seen the yt ers resplendent with multiples of every super rare item in the game and they continue to play why at some stage you just gotta stop
trading is the result of loot itemization systems endgame are systems that you engage with usually after completing the story or getting to max level in games trading by definition is not endgame it s like saying people who played diablo on single player couldn t engage in endgame because they couldn t trade people in single player could summon uber diablo and farm keys for uber bosses which were the only endgame activities in diablo until terror zones were added in d2r all of these systems were created for higher level characters to engage with after the story is completed seems like you just don t understand what the term endgame means i could trade a gull dagger super early into playing diablo on a new character from your use of endgame that would mean the endgame starts at level or which is a ludicrous statement but that s because trade isn t endgame
finally someone got it
its very short and was supposed to have quests lke every other act but they had to cut things due to time we were supposed to actually break diablo s soulstone in game theres an item file for it a red version of mephisto s soulstone but it was moved to a cutscene
i feel you played maybe or nice seasons since release i thought about picking it up again after the d4 beta popped onto the poe sub and decided all the new mechanics were gonna melt my brain
yeah i do agree with you on this as a counter argument that nothing stops them from learning from last arpgs mistakes i think this is often times a difficult problem for blizzard in regards to the diablo franchise if they innovate too much they are taking too much risk on alienating their core audience if they play it too safe then the game doesn t offer satisfying systems and incentives to play over other arpgs i do understand blizzard is supposed to be the leader in this genre people look to them to advance the genre forward they went too basic and played too safe but that appeals to their core audience while managing risk from a business perspective i think
people should expect that when they pay for a game that it will be finished the point of the post was that its never finish because of continuous updates and that s valid the real question is are we getting value for money at launch and for me the answer is hell yes i am confident i would get hundreds of hours of satisfying entertainment from the base game alone future updates are just a cherry on top
why do you expect the game to be finished at release no arpg has ever been finished at release poe horrible launch d3 horrible launch d2 still has no end game years later it isn t fair to compare d4 at release to poe that has had years to perfect their game and build a loyal fan base i m viewing the release of the game as another beta in theory with the live service model the game should get better every season the systems that failed at launch will be removed and new systems will be implemented questioning if blizzard had the ability to keep improving the game each season is a reasonable concern but imo the starting systems in the game at launch is a good starting point to keep improving the game
my guy pvp in wow isn t even balanced the fuck you mean d4 pvp is gonna be pure trash you re high on hopium lol
d3 has had different gimmicks for the seasons for a while now though like the altar thing currently
depend how you define basically zero seasonal content they ve almost never tacked on a new endgame activity echoing nightmares being an obvious recent exception but their seasonal gimmicks are almost always game changers that alter game systems in a fairly substantial way including some occasionally permanent system overhauls follower rework upgrading to primals some of the gimmicks are boring basic throughput changes but most of them will enable builds that are otherwise literally not possible d3 has a lot of issues but its seasonal system is not one of them
trusting that funds will be used on development is bold
so with the seasons in d4 will it be like laddering and reset or it just content updates for all
a competitive ladder that tracks your level performance against the entire game player base an amazing feature to keep the game interesting for over years
obvious bait but d2 absolutely changed with patches no idea what game you think you were playing v1 added the uber tristram event and a massive amount of new runewords v1 added more runewords dclone was also added at some point during these patches the game changed dramatically from and no subscription service was ever required online totally free we got patches with new content for free why are you blatantly lying about this fact in your post and to that other ignorant comment endgame wasn t about running pindleskin times unless you re an idiot his drops were nerfed in balance patch almost like it s a live service aye it s not the game s fault you couldn t figure out a more efficient way of farming for endgame endgame was pvp you needed a stash full of different sets of gear for each class build matchup most noobs never reached this point and thus think all you do is run baal which is simply not true whatsoever i had a lot of fun farming these baal running scrubs in pvp that s for sure
but it s the one with most similarity to d4
i was shocked how many people seemed to play it relative to how much of a shitty cash grab it had clearly been designed
i m sorry i don t have a phone what is diablo immortal
it was an endgame goal at that time but it was so hard only people managed to kill diablo before they nerfed torment entirely
arpg players have no idea what actual endgame is they are completely conditioned
sorry i don t play many games these days but isn t increasing the difficulty after finishing the campaign part of an endgame
https://mythicdrop.com/guide/diablo-4-hardcore-mode#pvp
if i remember right pvp death do not countdown and the hc player can respawn
hardcore pvp should be permadeath or what s the point of playing pvp on hc
almost certain you die and lose your character edit i was wrong and apparently you do respawn that s so lame
it should be perm death no matter what don t roll hc if you can t deal
i made a post about this that people didn t like apparently i would be shocked if hardcore pvp was permadeath all these elitist tryhards would hate it if it was permadeath too the result would be that there wouldn t be any pvp and the pvp zone would be a ghost town let s hypothetically say everyone on hardcore actually wanted to pvp everyone makes their character and goes to the pvp zone at a random level everyone except group is going to die that group then will have no one to pvp then let s say all the dead characters get leveled again and come back everyone dies except group people aren t going to keep spending hours making a character to go die no matter how hardcore they are no matter how good at pvp you are you are eventually going to get got and there is an exceptionally low chance you wont get got in a 24h period the pvp is voluntary and people are not going to waste that many hours more than a couple times a better solution is to have item drop on death where you drop equipped items on death while playing hardcore
i mostly play hardcore would usually just have softcore chars for pvp honestly super happy with blizzard on this for no permadeath in pvp because no matter what my fellow hardcore degenerates say pvp hc player count goes straight to zero with permadeath i get it its not true hc then dont care i much prefer to have active pvp would be cool if there was a hc penalty for death in field of hatred though like the pker gets some of your gold or loot or if there were two pvp zones for permadeath and nonpermadeath everyone might be happy
i hope they make it perms death in pvp
god damn it hardcore is no longer enough blizzard must give us hardestcore and enable the pvp deaths
i hope this changes
yep closed beta players confirmed it would be a fun thing to have a community to rush to fields if hatred let s say average level of in world or whatever it will be and pvp there i assume level will only take a short amount of time after we are accustomed to the game
it needs to be perm death they can have a special dueling ground for people who want to do friendly duels where you don t die but everywhere else should be perm no matter the excuse
i get the argument i wonder how many people are interested in getting ganked by a mob of pvp focused higher level players though if permadeath reduces the pool of interested players too much it would be counterproductive maybe even to having pvp really exist at all
i agree hc deaths should be permanent regardless of the chosen activity
looks like they changed it
yeah the issue is then it isn t hc
i didn t think gaming was possible in d4 you have to go to a designated pvp area
yeah if hc pvp is not permadeath it s basically sc and that s lame when i play hc i like the risk of death at any moment even if i walk into pvp where i know i may get ganked
yeah the issue then is there are insufficient players willing to pvp on a hardcore realm if your choice is non permadeath pvp on your hc character or essentially non existent pvp for your hc character which would you choose
you do not sure how that changes what i wrote though
the softcore ppl are trying to dumb it down
i agree also people may be less inclined to grief in pvp areas if there is a risk of losing their character for doing so
i d rather hc be hc not hc unless it s inconvenient then it s sc
it s not possible to get ganked if you are willingly participating in a timed arena fight
exactly plus then you can almost die run into a field of hatred and get ganked boom your hc character never died technically
like i said i get the argument have fun with few other players willing to exist in your world though
where does anything claim the d4 pvp areas are timed arena fights rather than free for alls
wouldnt it be easier to just go to town i havent played the beta but usually if people are in danger of dying its town portal time i dont think anybody avoids death by running to a different zone
i doubt it s a few i m sure lots of people will pvp in hc even if it was permadeath
look up fields of hatred i haven t seen any indication you can hostile players in the overworld or in dungeons you can t get ganked in a ffa where there s no teams that s not what that word means
i think if you get hit your portal doesn t finish
we ll almost certainly never know but maybe
this fields of hatred when enterting one of these corrupted areas players can be attacked by other players and freely and also take part in pvp against any player they are not grouped with players will also be able to pvp as a group
and even if entering is changed to opting in then you have that converting seeds of hatred into red dust will auto flag you for pvp so you ll be flagged for pvp by trying to make use of the resources there
loool while i like it maybe its too hardcore for some players running away is fine and always an option and if you have to open a portal and click on it while running thats good enough for me maybe a timer that closes the portal when youre not in town might be good so players cant open a portal before the boss fight and run away like that
probably it s just what s the point of playing hc pvp vs sc pvp there isn t and that is the issue
maybe i personally won t portal out i like the challenge
just paragon points
you get skill points from level level gives you and level gives you paragon points instead of a skill poijnt and you get from renown other sources for a total of i believe but obviously can t pull up the game to double check or anything
from leveling after paragon pts only but if u complete achievements in a act u can get some more skill points from completing a certain ammount
thank you
i heard you get from renown not zones with points from each zone for each lilith statue in each zone
collected all the statues in the beta but that didn t give any extra skillpoints so looks like it is
i would assume they don t want to spoil much as usual i think they said intensity will be part of the game but no clue really from the video you can t really see much most of the clips are very short with not that many different skills used some even contain just ultimate skills during open beta you could feel the intensified fireball for example it was way bigger at level fireball than actually at level fireball
have seen it in vids eg incinerate adds a blue flame and is wider than the base version so yes but i don t think it was in the recent vid
i m still putting all my points into passives every skill in my ideal build only has point
post your build
not sure if this will come through correctly druid https://d4planner.io/skilltree/druid/s2:1%3be5:1%3bt1:1%3be10:1%3bp5:1%3bp2:3%3be7:1%3be13:1%3bp8:1%3ba1:3%3bh1:1%3bw2:1%3bh2:1%3be24:1%3bs8:1%3bb3:1%3be22:1%3bn7:1%3bc6:3%3bs5:3%3be17:3%3bc9:3%3be28:3%3bp12:1%3bp16:1%3bd5:3%3bn6:3%3br8:3%3bd4:3%3bt4:3%3bu3:3%3be27:1) deer wariness eagle spec scythe talons avian wrath snake obsidian slam or calm before the storm wolf energize or bolster i ll have to edit for aspects when i get home in a couple days
it s a dogshit way to engage players the developers need to produce some actual story content and meaningful reasons to keep playing beyond grinding ladders most people could give two shits about participating in a ladder every single season replaying in a ladder season can be fun on occasion but you have serious mental issues if you don t get bored running the same exact content several times a year every year with slightly different modifiers there really needs to be large narrative changes and additional gameplay content added if their intention is to sell d4 to players on the game as a service model they need to do better than some super cheap easy to implement faux reason to play
check the new mattjestic that just dropped dev interview in germany they are tinkering with the idea of some rewards that carry over from season to season what i have no idea
why would it be the only reason to play a season lol why not one of many where in my post did i say only
you described poe and people lust over new seasons
oh awesome any chance you have a link
https://youtu.be/z0r3lybzj_a
he keeps repeating cow level confirmed by developers and talking about the ear maybe being used as a key who watches this lol
apparently not you any longer shrug
vader is luke s father
this is how i play too i watch and read the news about the game to understand base mechanics but build videos couldn t care less stay away from the omg the devs have trashed the endgame threads too
imagine following a build day of release
https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/12c9fwm/anyone_else_planning_to_play_the_game_as_it_comes/
you should play the game as it was intended on your first playthru just follow the story do content as you feel it test your character check skills try things out search and explore for a while let those hardcore min maxer guide on the bench till you actually reach endgame and are comfortable with the game enough then for your second character or on season starts you could use some guide during my gaming years i found i was having wayy more fun exploring and playing the game by myself w o guide sure guides would be helpful to find things and get the best out of your character and the game but youll reach the end wayyy faster and youll have no sense of wonder for the gameplay the lore etc then after you reach endgame and really happy with your toon start going for collectible if you havent get already try and search for em b4 looking for a guide x200b imo arpg are best played slowly and peacefully
it s not like blizzard is going to do something completely out of the blue at this point they are a pretty formulaic company so i wouldn t expect to many mind blowing revelations if i did and was trying to go in blind i would not be hanging on the reddit that s for sure but you re not going to ruin your experience anytime soon anyway i say just play and have fun

lilith dies at the end
generally speaking i don t care about spoilers whether it s video games movies or books and in particular i m certainly not influenced by what builds other people think are the best
imho thats the way to go i do the same thing for me it is far more enjoyable this way in the old d2 days there wasn t a lot of guides if any at all when it came out still managed to clear hell with my wife with a barb ans sorc duo just play how you want to play my brother d4 will be here for a long time i intend to play it at my pace an learn everything myself before even thinking about reading a guide
i am also pumped it will be like how i struggled through elden ring no streamers or how to s
mixed bag if its offline and single player i often like to be spoilerfree and find out most on my own if it has some janky upgrade system sometimes i will look up some of it for tips as i hate wasting time on crappy upgrades why take damage when theres a but you didnt understand how it works because poor in game documentation if its multiplayer i ll often check because i don t want to be at a deficit right at the start
that s why i left this community to avoid leaks complaints theories and i really enjoyed the beta so see you all at june
i played the beta and really enjoyed it i played diablo and but never got around with diablo looking forward to d4 and the complexity it brings to the different classes
bruce willis was dead the whole time
awesome i can t wait to meta the shit out of it and see lots of big numbers and dope loot
i don t even think there s such a thing as a diablo spoiler i mean what is there to spoil it s diablo it s not like you ll get a game that s vastly different from its predecessors
not much to spoil
i had a blast playing new world like this i think your right but it s really tempting
every sec min is passed in north america
you son a of bitch how could you do this to me tempting me with your spoiler text you knew i d click it to find out what was hidden my life is ruined s
inertia is a property of matter
ups a much better worded post than mine i had a feeling someone had posted the same but was too afraid of checking too many spoilerish headlines here
blizzard has never been truly innovative with their gameplay where they shine is taking all the best ideas of their competitors and polishing the hell out of it with a decent story on top and it works well
you are right she only sold over million book and won multiple awards and multiple honorary mention
you have a point i will say though it s all the little things that matter here the minuscule changes for each new season in d3 were a big thing for me i was craving for more diablo content so getting a new diablo with new graphics a new more grim world a new story new characters and probably a few new mechanics here and there maybe a new form of endgame new types of loot etc etc for me that will be a big joy to experience even though it of course all comes down to slaying monsters but still
i except maybe clan achievements and some perks but not really any class specific activities you cant do without it
all i want is an easy way to play together like porting people to a dungeon easy party invites maybe some achievements
shared stash
clan house with storage quick matchmaking features offline messaging think motd clan specific leaderboards
i imagine clan will be good for dungeons events world bosses and grinding dailies
it d be cool if they did like warbands in diablo immortal but without the person limitation crap and other garbage warbands had
nothing much of any substance as clans are not at all the focus of d4
thanks for the reply what kind of perks can a clan offer beyond higher ranks also are there some typical achievements to implement much appreciated for your help
if they actually implement it i d except something similar to wow guilds completing dungeons killing bosses with clan members as achievements and for perks maybe some discounts or even maybe clan shop where your guild unlocks rewards but i m just guessing we may as well not get anything beyond clans being just some kind of community
beaver cosmetic when
animorphs were the worst books
never knew how much i wanted to play as a werebeaver until now
so druids are canadian look at that majestic beast so noble so cute so loveable so deadly
what s wrong with beavers
i think its a bit unfair for you all to believe that the boy changed into a beaver clearly it started as a beaver and morphed into a human to blend in to society to buy wood at a valued price at home depot
i hope so though i m afraid it will probably be cash shop stuff maybe battlepass stuff
a palette of colors or the ability to rotate the ones that are offered would be preferred
they wont have level brackets the video clearly showed a group of three at all level ranges together i do remember seeing a dmg reduction for pvp somewhere but that will only get you so far i expect it to be ruthless pvp group for safety or suffer a gankfest when you attempt to purify those shards
yet an lld lvl could kill a level with proper gear even in d2 and there was no scaling proper gear has always been the real power of the diablo series not levels if they don t scale it they ll have level brackets safe bet that you re not going to run around battle grounds at lvl100 steamrolling noobs buddy sorry
so basically you only want players to begin pvping at lvl that seems unrealistic
for good pvp check out albion online
i really like pvp but if there s no scaling at all i m not going anywhere near the fields until i m max level and i think a lot of pvpers would agree and that would be a big mistake if they have level scaling though your paragon points boards legendaries and unique should still give you the i ve played longer got luckier drops than you haha advantage you re looking for op
the very best thing that could happen to pvp is everyone being on the same level with the same amount of skill points gear and whatnot gw2 style where it was a separate game mode the second next best thing is scaling
sounds good to me but some people are not gonna be happy no matter how it s implemented
i never said that i said a low lvl shouldn t be able to kill a maxed lvl gear player because of scaling but i guess twist my words
great pvp you mean
why not you want pvp to be about gear or level rather than skill
yes
i don t think you understand what i said but fine you re right let s have a level player destroy a level player end of discussion
see those curly things at the end of the sentences question marks do you know what they indicate
if the level player is better at pvp i see nothing wrong with that
that literally defeats the purpose of gear at all in a game like this how dumb is that just go play a capcom fighter
that should be literally impossible sorry now if you re talking about an beating a bad sure i m also fine with uncapped zones where 100s can gank all levels but a beating a is kind of like an adult losing to a toddler chance unless they go afk for minutes or something
then you are saying that the player who has more free time wins and not the one with better abilities
i know that s a little too much i just wanted to reply with his own example but you get the point
it s an rpg there is a balance lol a level one shouldn t beat a ever a tho should be a minimal advantage your point is gear should be worthless i completely disagree with that i am not saying gear should be everything if you have more stats then me you should still be beatable
fair enough
here s what you should measure it by minimum wage in australia is diablo will cost australians around hours of work after they get taxed minimum wage in the us is diablo will cost americans around hours of work after they get taxed
it s high everywhere nothing special about australia it s only available from one place it s a game targeted at an older demographic from an extremely successful series feel free not to buy it to protest
and in norwegian krone it s 731nok doesn t mean it s actually more expensive here conversion is funny like that
is this on console the console standard edition is us dollars which equals australian dollars the us price is before taxes too

be thankful they didn t ban it
accounting for inflation it s almost identical to the price d2 released at
blizzard being scummy as usual but the way i look at it like this if i spend hours in the game that s an hour for entertainment show me where else you can get value like that given i spent hours playing the beta i suspect hours is lowballing it
greedy company doing greedy things
almost as expensive as japan
ultimately i m not really poor so i don t care too much
worth it i m going to get thousands of hours of enjoyment out of this
here in brazil the standard edition costs r the minimum wage here is r a month a minimum wage worker has to work a whole week to afford the game i know this is a third world country but i cant ignore how fucked up that is
feel free not to buy it to protest like those have worked on aaa releases in the past i think it even had the opposite effect for hogwarts legacy
poe fan doing poe fan things lol
have fun playing poe when d4 kills it completely
it is sorry
i mean i bought double downs to get two beta keys that was us thats au that means i had to fly to australia to work for one hour at minimum wage and that ticket getting there and back was pretty expensive too
i wonder how they ll look at full release they said they weren t final right
the health bars above the skeletons are more than enough to indicate they are player owned minions i think the model could be darkened a bit
i just don t like the look of the glow the skeletons themselves are ok the glow is too bright for the world art style and makes them look out of place and cartoony versus normal mob skeletons it does not matter that it makes sense with the lore pleasing to the eyes lore that can easily be changed or ignored all i really want is either an on off option for it or a slider so i can tone it down on my end that way the few people out there that love the look don t miss out x200b thankfully the devs agree with the public opinion on them and are going to make a change
someone needs to tell them to just be themselves
they didn t even look bad they looked held together by the magic a necromancer uses and people are salty because they don t look like mob skeletons that s silly redundant and does not take into account magic within the worldbuilding i m talking aesthetic in terms of bones not the various additions and changes i played a mainly melee necro type build so i sacrificed my minions
the pic isn t bright blue enough
no blue aura so its not from div
it kinda felt like the skeletons came from diablo
the bones are their money
replace them with the skeletons from d2r
this is hilarious well done sir
everyone went straight to dogpiling or defending the art direction and didn t acknowledge the pun in your title tips fedora to you sir for that gem btw i hate how cartoony and aged down all of necros summons look so jarring compared to that gore fest of lilith s summoning in the intro make the undead guy spooky please
i think they looked good in the beta and i truly don t understand the criticism magical skeletons look like magic wow
i loved them and i loved the color edit also bet they don t change anything and release skins for them to milk to people who are upset lol
the only thing i don t like is the glowing model
i m sorry but skeletons drink tequila that being said i played a summon build and was fun also killed the butcher
years old diablo has better skeletons they change everytime you give skill point into mastery d4 skeletons looks awefull terrible and bad they are not cool and they are glowing like a dinosaur skeleton which i collect from dinosaurs magazine when i was kid skeleton mages constantly praying their god with their awefull animation but hey you gonna change these skely mages with succubis and warriors with mummy skins just after months only for and i can assure you i will preorder that shit cuz skelys are sux atm now you can post about who are buying microtransactions hurt to game content
i don t understand the hate i had something like thorns and nothing could get through my skeletons shields anything that touched them instantly died so every single fight i had three health bars and if an elite somehow managed to touch me a protective bubble popped up and provided even more protection every single fight it was stupid skeletons are op as fuck
i liked them i could see not having them in town but it was easy to tell which were yours and which were enemy i was a big fan
me and my buddy were talking about how cool they looked with the glow i genuinely don t understand the hate they got
i m sure the devs are crying themselves to sleep on pillow bags full of money
i ll be trying a solomancer no skeletons sending mine to the bar to drown their sorrows
they have no body on their side or on their front or back or top and bottom
every critic coming for their pound of flesh
yeah they looked like crap just give us an option to choose the glow color in accessibilty options that way you can choose neutral or dark glows to make them blend better as for them looking too much like regular skeletons that s precisely why you give them cool crowns armors and things like big scythes and the like anyway they have the ugly and kinda pointless skeleton lifebars on by default anyway to make you tell them apart speaking of which please add an option so that ally lifebars only appers when your skeles and party member s hp bars are only visible are at hp or below that way you don t have to disable a somewhat useful feature knowing when you need to heal your minions just because it makes the game looks like garbage with green lifebars obscuring what s going on
question did i miss ok i ll admit it i barely looked for a way to dismiss skellys for when you re in town they were little lag monsters and it s not like rummaging through my stash wasn t crowded enough with xxxbuttstufferxxx and his friends in there too
i will be playing a skelly necro till i die i had an absolute blast playing it in beta
i certainly hope they were a placeholder or even a finished mtx that they used while the actual skeletons were being polished i cannot understand how they are supposed to fit into anything else in the necro s toolkit in the state we saw them in they clashed with all the skills all the armor and especially with the golem they were uninspired as per their variety the melee versions were just different weapons the mages were literally all exactly the same minus their projectile colors there are already skeleton models in the game the ones we fight that would work a lot better with everything else the necro had going on and i hope we land with something closer to that the huge bright blue glowing ethereal skeletons would make a fine mtx for people who want that it simply does not belong as their base visuals
thinking virtually anything will change at this point is naive
agreed or just add a simple symbol like a blue dot on top of their head we can even remove the health bar it s personal taste but i prefer they don t stand out too much
honestly if they reduced the glow by and changed its color to match what the minion does it would be leagues better keep the blue for cold red for physical bleed that ghastly chartreuse for the plague stuff etc
they didn t look great either was one of the very first impressions of the game i got and they looked outta place and the devs said as much when they said they weren t final so i ma stick with the devs on this one and hope for a bit of a better fit
and the other skeletons function without magic
i agree i absolutely do not want necro skeletons to look like the skeletons in the world specifically for this very reason
people are salty because they don t look like mob skeletons in my case it s less that i hate them and more that i really didn t like that their glowing make it harder to tell what was happening onscreen since you have so many of them both going around and glowing around that it becomes a visual clusterfuck in motion if we could toggle the glow off then our skellies would stop being little diva s and fade into the background properly leave the glow option for the folks that can t tell them apart from skeletons at large both sides are happy
it s not that they looked like they were magic it s that they were held together with magic that clashed with the rest of the magic in the necro s toolkit magic that didn t change in any way to display a change of base skill magic that was exceedingly bright and constantly distracting against the grim background of the game and magic that seemed vastly more magical _ than anything else immediately available to the class concept was fine execution was boring and garish like i said in another post in here somewhere what we got would make a perfectly fine cold minion or an mtx or something that displayed a level of magical ethereal wonder from some legendary affix or unique item they were not the skeletons i would expect to see from any diablo character at low level nor did they do anything to convey what the actual sub skeleton did or was doing or was for once they began to level up bad implementation of fine effects i just don t think they fit as the default at all
they looked like they re ripped straight out of torchlight their art style looks different than the rest of the game they re just off
i was gonna add a really bright glow but it was too hard to do on my phone
this was actually what struck me first actually wondered whether there was a couple art directions and this one just happened to slip into the beta
flashy glowing blue aura is not the only way you can give skeletons a magic vibe thought just give vivid red eyes or something
the glow isn t the problem the art style is compare the enemy skeletons with necro skeletons necro ones seem like they were ripped straight out off torchlight they look like they belong in a different game
you do understand the criticism you don t agree with it big difference
see i m here hoping that the skin we got is mtx for ya ll who enjoy shoving bright blue glowing minions in your otherwise devoid of bright blue glowing stuff build class
same
haha i cannot unsee the dinosaur skeleton now totally forgot about those things
i think this is about people not liking how they looked in beta there s consensus that bone armies steamrolled most everything
shhh ahem thorns and skeletons suck and need a buff
thorns never scales well end game it s definitely a fun build to mess around with but i would be pleasantly surprised if it was a viable build end game i think the hate was the looks of the character model and the blue skeles
you think the devs residuals from the sales
all of the necro s bone magic has a blueish glow to it why doesn t it make sense that their skeletons would have the same glow
they re animated skeletons it makes sense there d be magical glow they re animated skeletons what kind of variety are you expecting
i mean they did say it wasn t final so if anything they re gonna change this one thing maybe a few things could get wild but i m naive
i could easily see them toning down the glow so it doesn t overpower the other details as much the dirt on the bones the blood tinged tendons the caked blood on the weapons maybe tweaking the color toward a more greenish hue possibly pulling it off the bones where it pulses and having it illuminate the inside of the rib cage only like some fell heart i do expect them to have at least some glow that is unlikely to change since the aesthetic is that they aren t just raised skeletons but raised skeletons actively being controlled like puppets by the necromancer
reduce it some and move it into the rib cage and off the arms leg bones where it would be like a heart of necromantic magic would be a good change i think something like that which doesn t overpower the other details but still allows for things like the fairly macabre appearance of the skulls when lit from beneath
yeah i find them a little too flashy more bone toned does that even make sense armored but in chain mail shambles rusty a little bit tilted like movie undeads just a tad bit and it would be perfect for me
i m not saying they re perfect i liked the idea though more distinctly skeletal would be nice because they did look like blue globs of bone i just wanted to throw my two cents in with regards to the aesthetic as a whole i m sure they ll have a better look come june
demonic magic is not the same as whatever essence is descended from edit because i quickly replied like i d say that it s different because the priests of rathma have a specific method rather than just chaos and murder the dead souls of tristram and elsewhere are risen because of the demonic influence whereas rathma was both angelic and demonic in his origin and from that the philosophy of necromancy is derived
i look forward to the easter themed skeletons that have bunny ears from the cosmetic shop or an event reward
i hope they comprise and allow us to have skins for them or something that turns off the glow for the people that don t like it for me it made sense the necro uses magic to hold the reanimated skeletons together of course it would look like that but i accept that s how they would look for me for others they want them to look different what i really want is a way to alter how the corpses look even in d3 the targetable outline for them was too much in d4 they feel completely out of place as long as they entertain the idea of cosmetics and choices which allow us to affect how the game looks to us i think that would be a winning strategy
see this is the criticism that doesn t make sense absent the glowing effect that currently pulses inside the ribs and infused the bones some they are the same model as the enemy skeletons and don t look anywhere close to the cartoony design of torchlight that s just straight up hyperbole
not really i don t think the criticism makes much sense
wasn t coming here for this but this is a very good point we ll said sir
i can understand that the coloration is to separate them from the other skelies but i m honestly okay with them either way
ohh okay that makes sense my bad i feel like i ve seen more criticism about their usefulness rather than praise though but i could just be focusing on the negative comments honestly i don t particularly care about how they look but i will say i accidentally tried to attack them once or twice lol
more of our power will be coming from our character rather than the armor or so they say this would suggest that thorns and pets should scale better in the endgame but who knows you re probably still right
no i don t thanks for the strawman argument though
because there are summon specs for shadow and blood skills and i don t want my skellies to glow bright blue while i m they re dark red blood surges
are skeleton summons considered bone magic edit this isn t meant to be sarcastic i actually can t remember if they have the bone magic tag per scaling etc in the tooltip
not bright blue eyesores something that matches the entire rest of the game like every other skeleton we run into in the game
isn t that what everyone is basically asking for they had a bit of a d3 cartoony vibe to me while everything else looked proper grim dark not too far off but a bit better on the detailing and more inline with the aesthetic and just an aside i hope by not final they also mean the skeletons come with different equipped weapons randomly etc was a nice touch in the old ones
well skeletons without magic are just bones my friend
and this is exactly why i can t take the skeleton complaint seriously they look exactly like the enemy skeletons except they fly and have some blue glowy energy they do not look like they belong in a different game
i don t think you understand the criticism then it s not that they were magical and looked like magic it s that the magical magic look they had clashed with pretty much every single other aspect of the games visual experience necromancer spells other skeletons other minions the golem and the very world around it i hope this helps
lol not a strawman just trying to understand why you think devs would be sleeping on pillow bags full of money
the point was the magic classification is different not that one is magic and the other is not
i realize now you re the same person actually you lack reading comprehension apparently
i truly don t understand the criticism wow that s just like the thing that i already said i disagree and think it s an inconsequential thing to be critical about the skeletons look exactly like the rest of their bone magic and every other magical spell in the game magic is colorful
if you can t figure it out by now they re obviously making way more money than you are
you seriously can t grasp the concept of aesthetics or that other people at least can
doubling down on the ignorance brilliant move the average is under 200k that s hardly enough for pillow cases full of money and not much more than i make but bad attempt at a lame insult tracks with how you ve been responding username checks out
so that implies that reanimated skeletons have one definitively good look and anything else isn t aesthetics
whatever you say santa klaus

okay
how should we know just write to blizzard support instead of asking on reddit your problem is literally that you re willing but unable to give them money so im sure it will be prioritized
it s a sign
contact microsoft if you re getting an error buying it on your xbox then it s a microsoft billing thing and their support team can help you out
thank you that worked apparently you can not pre order games on xbox with a pre paid haha thinking about it makes sense
ahh yeah i don t think microsoft actually charges you for the preorder until right before the game comes out glad it s resolved
i shoulda married a wife that s into computer games
i would be your wife husband w e just give me something like that instead of a ring

lucky bastard to have a gamer wife
can you adopt me
love how even the white fluffy cloud wrist rest looks sinister with the lighting and backgrounds
i love the subtle aesthetic difference between your setups
r relationship_goals
dude i take pride in my set up but this is beautiful link to wall backing mouse pads
did you sacrifice a cow before that
what happens if the game flops like d3
my partner and i face each other with the way our desks are laid out and the only issue is his voice is very deep so it gets picked up through my rtx voice when he s really excited about a game lol we both have been gamers since little children and are lucky the majority of games mostly fps is what we both are into so get to play together anytime we want i decided to give the d4 beta ago and loved it and he s so excited since the diablo franchise is of his favourite and so another game we can play together
i wish i could find that wallpaper without the text
i spent years looking for mrs right but my qualifiers were always wrong hot and spicy i picked a nerd who loves games as much as i do and we ve been together years we are building two new rigs to play together too but damn that looks sick o7 x50
i didn t know we could marry our hands s sick setup though
yeeeee lfg my gf and i lived together for years played fire sorc ice sorc together her on pc me on ps5 frost maniac fire maniac so much damn fun the first time we ran into the butcher butcher randomly spawned on her when i was in town selling items i valiantly raced to her rescue on arrival i peeled that big bastard off of her and an arduous minute fight ensued her and i traded aggro effectively kited as much as possible and relied heavily on her self healing and hydras near death and without pots with nothing but my barrier to save me i ran around corners in a panic trying desperately to evade the hook that would spell my demise cornered and out of options her hydra landed the killing strike saving me and solidifying my love for her and the game never have i ever had such an intense bout of combat in any of the diablos poe or any other arpg it felt darksouls ian in the amount of sheer terror desperation and heart pumping moments happy hunting to you and the missus see you in sanctuary
we played couch coop this game is perfect for it
that s honestly looks great
pcmr
seems it s mouse and keyboard weapon of choice
serious question does the mix of the screen and back lighting hurt your eyes or not really
what is the keyboard and mouse on the right
that d be my dream come true not to play every game just diablo
same here had the diablo loading screen as my wallpaper and the ambient lights set to red and the peripherals set to match in the game settings looks great see you in june
you two are way way neater than i am
i could not imagine being with someone who s not a gamer at all this is a dream setup absolutely love it might even get inspired because of it now d

goals man good for you
verrrrry niiiiice
behold my stuff
sick setup and loved the atmosphere you should program the room lighting to reflect the game scenario that will step up the game lol
u bryanmaxim i see a lot of macs there on the desk were you able to play the beta on these machines i assume no
looks nice and clean yeah i m jealous of the setup
nice setup been side by side for a while wife and i decided to have our rigs in separate rooms that way if one of us wants to jam out to music the other can still use comms or if i m 3d printing or she s crafting we don t get in each other s way makes personalization or lack thereof of the setup a bit easier as well only downside is you need spare guest rooms
can i inquire about your desk i want a desk with basically those exact dimensions for my wife and i and this looks absolutely perfect edit freaking stunning setup btw i m aspiring to do something similar in the next couple years
my girl only plays sims how do i fix this lmao
my wife and i have a similar setup to whoever has the vertical monitor check out the app littlebigmouse it s life changing
yes ok i realize i am and married with kids of my own but could you guys possibly adopt me
my wife leaves me to my games has zero interest but is happy i have a hobby i enjoy
does wireless mouse lag bother you every wireless mouse i buy there is a delay and since i play competitive shooters i cant have that but id love the convenience
i showed this to the wife and now have to get a lighting setup before june so thanks for green lighting that for about years the only time me and my white played together was the occasional couch co op about a year and a half ago she took an interest in one of the games i had pre ordered and we played together ever since side by side i play seperate games quite alot more than she does but i enjoy gaming with her times more than the alone gaming time i had
i m the wife
dammmm i wish i had that setup
ya ll gangsta
very cool looking setup
nice setup
hey guys i want to thank you all for all the appreciation about the setup and the kind words x200b thank you all
wow
got a link to that wallpaper
i want your wife
i m not married but i want your set up in my room haha i can find ways to use pcs
gg question do you play together the entire story because you could spoil each other with the screens next to each other
missed opportunity not having one setup be light blue with inarius and the other lilith still dope
she use the dark side i see
god with just one computer my room gets hot as hell i can t imagine all of that
damn y all sure are d4 fans what r u gonna do when the game flops jk
i need someone worth it
gamer wife best wife she even has a 2nd monitor
what did you main
should have played on ps5
i bet you re american right
goals but in my demographic zero chance
imagine not having kids
a lot cooler and wealthier than i nice
looks really good really happy that you both enjoy gaming the black wall is lit af but how can someone work game in with one screen only it would be hard for me to stay sane exile
my wife and i played comfy couch coop on ps5 and lg c2 oled that is pretty hard to beat
false love is a myth after my last relationship at least lol
possible to ask what desk that is
ha since i got my ps5 my partner asks what days i m at work so she can play her spiderman games
does she have a sister
just a hunch but your house must be fun at halloween i m guessing it s the first stop for every kid on the block no sarcasm
sick setup love the backing wall im assuming you were on the left

left is his right is her s
okay reddit needs to stop putting this subreddit in my notifications because i m not even joined to it wtf
truly living the dream
got my wife to play wow definitely need to somehow talk her into d4
could have just played splitscreen for on xbox and saved grand
your icons are so perfectly arranged
we didn t ask for your life story
maybe they ment that aspects which won t be in codex can be dropped in dungeons as single time use items
i don t really understand why respecing the actual tree costs gold won t getting new gear cost alot too is having that freedom not fun i bet of ppl will just use the meta build anyway
i hope they keep world tiers in check like 4ish world tiers sounds great it s basically normal nightmare hell inferno i like static content that the community is measuring against and builds being rated at how well they can conquer end game bosses or dungeons i d hate to have granular world tiers that you just click from a list and everything is arbitrarily scaling and matching your character level despised that about d3
i liked what i saw you just have to extract the actual useful information from the marketing bullshity talk i can t stand those anymore i want to rant about that a little bit sorry in advance an example is when they say something like they re the parangon boards really a way for you to keep expanding your character and making it uniquely yours lol no useless sentence done in order to try to hype you for something that probably does not deserves that kind of hype waste of time what is useful though is telling us how it works and showing us what those nodes are doing that was useful information it s really special to discover what kinf of playstyle really means to you i mean hugh i don t even know what to say what s the point of this sentence the whole only the beginning part no actual information besides that they re going to update the game after release duh
here are some things i ve noticed from the video first they cut the top of almost all the gameplay off this is more of a peeve than anything worth noting second thing the tree of whispers was level but the character was level this means there is some mechanism to not scale levels above based on screenshots of the world tier option from the beta we can assume this level character is still in world tier as world tier is for levels and wt3 is for third thing in the pvp clip they are fighting a boss it s hp bar with stagger was not quite cut out of the clip so this might mean you want a robust build capable of fighting players and all pve content when in the pvp zone fourth thing they purchase an equipable item with the pvp credits fifth thing helltides rain blood and the water seems to turn to blood generally the area is a bit red last thing when talking to the tree the player earned 000xp and gained maybe of level
annoyed the video wasn t linked so here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agdizgfd5kq
very confused on the difference sorc v barb in attack power despite level difference do not overinterpret like not real characters that were leveled and geared the same way feels like the barb is doing an overpower build so they built more hp than attack power
end game seem sad
man it s respecs in games should not be this big of a deal especially when you want to target the casuals
being an endgame beta player i cant help but giggle with the deep diving interpretation on the video
i m gonna pretend barbarian is just that strong in endgame probably not but it s a nice thought
i don t understand why there is so much discussion around point respec gold costs i don t think people realise that respec will be the cheapest thing at the endgame here is an example of level in beta respec was 110gold per point and upgrading a legendary 1hand weapon from tier3 to tier4 was 160k gold the first gem upgrade was 4500g i spent around million gold in beta for upgrading gear and properties rerolls oh and the prices for selling rare items was 800g to around 1500g at level it is said that respec is 53k gold per point that will be the least of your worries i expect the gear upgrades to be in the millions range
thanks so much for the recap dude good post
i was very concerned when they said aspects will have a chance to drop tbey should be you do the dungeon you get it
i m fine with respecs being expensive as long as it doesn t take a rediculous time to regain the resources to do it again to be able to respec after a few hours grind isn t bad to have to grind days is a little much though
if respeccing doesn t take long to grind for then again why even have it
i m unsure on this endgame the dungeons not being randomly generated has me worried the beta dungeons i was already bored of them
keep the current gold system but enforce a respec all at once cooldown or hours once past a certain level this would allow low level players to experiment as they level within the current gold cost system create a respec token item totem whatever that rarely drops from doing high level content this would give you the option of refunding all points at the cost of the respec item in lieu of gold allow for saved builds that you can quickly select within the parameters of the cooldown giving the option of either spending gold or the respec token swapping saved builds on the fly using gold or a respec token would simply refund all points not swap saved equipment as in destiny per latest expansion this would allow for a huge qol feature without undermining the diablo legacy of utilizing your stash i m all for focusing and committing to a build but it d be nice to have the option to quickly switch between builds if i have an endgame barb build i ve built for solo but want to play support with friends or pvp it d be nice to switch to a singer support build or pvp build respectively the cooldown timer on reset all points would keep people from cheesing content otherwise you d go aoe dps up to the boss then switch to single target
i m confused about mightmare dungeons you can turn any dungeon into a nightmare so the meta will be to find the easiest of the dungeons and just do only this one as nightmare or do the nightmare stuff are linked to specific dungeon
i had 2m gold after around hours of playtime across both beta weekends by time time we re i anticipate that everyone will be swimming in tens of millions of gold
so many whiny bitches in this thread edit finished the thread the things some of you babies will cry about without the game even being out or trying it is ridiculous
i m glad we re getting gradually more expensive respec costs allowing for experimenting early on yet incentivizing some permanence later all while finally adding value to gold d4 seems to have struck a good balance as having fully free respecs causes problems such as people constantly respecing which largely negates the reason for even having a skill tree in the first place
why do most people that are for free respeccing make it sound like it is a known fact instead of their opinion free respeccing does not necessarily have to be in a game it s a design decision not a clear fact i like that there are costs to it to stop one from respeccing constantly and i hope that blizzard keeps this is
the character stats str int dex will in the video are super odd to me since some players were crafting albeit insane gear pieces in beta and had similar overall char stats or higher
i ve heard that the endgame is just farming the same dungeons over and over again for the same aspect as you scale the dungeons and that sounds interestingly vague
make basic skills respec cheap and respec paragons expensive af that s gonna make sense for casuals and pros
the amount of content seems insane
i like respec cost to make choise matter my problem with it is the itemization is counter intuitive to this design filosofi due to legendarys dropping with passiv abilitys if im a rend barb and i find massiv whirlwind items ofcause i need to respec in d2 it made sense because no item had any passiv ability booster maybe a solution is respec is free until level after that you can spend gold or collect x ammount of boss currency to respec for free like essence in d2
regarding codex aspects chance to drop we unlocked the lowest rolled rank of a legendary power in the beta on completing dungeons i m guessing the chance is to drop improved ranks for aspects so instead of having to peel them off of gear eventually you ll have the max rank codex d and can put it on whatever you want
in dragonflight we can respec without any cost and on the fly we even have loadouts why would they introduce a high cost in diablo jesus christ
blizzard can learn a thing or two about respecs from last epoch
to touch on respec costs i think i saw a dev tweet about how they want to make respecting easier not in terms of cost but i think the issues with nodes breaking this preventing early tree respects could be fixed for launch what was mentioned was the ability to reset single points hopefully that s what they meant being able to for example only change out the points for a core skill without removing everything else or changing your basic attack if this is what happens then costs won t be that bad still i do think there should be a cost to avoid promoting full tree swaps right before a boss
i don t know why they insist on bringing back old bosses andariel really i killed you already stay dead can they come up with new characters or what d3 was like a rolling cast of returning demons who can t stay dead from previous games and it was a bit cringe i gotta say
glad respecs aren t cheap nor radically expensive nice that a partial refund won t cost the world but a full one isn t something you ll be doing constantly either hated the skill tweak paralysis of d3 more choice is not always necessarily good
fuck that i m not leveling any char past respec and trying new builds is the name of the game
there is pvp the respec thing is for balance and to keep from swapping per dungeon i suppose cost almost nothing to respec low levels but 100ks around level it cost nothing compared to what you are making from bosses tree world events and sit up runs so many unique and ancestral uniques for sell you won t have an issue
i also noticed the chance thing i sadly believe they meant it they said they boosted item drops to make us feel the content a bit more i m sure the same is true for aspects very sadly
if shadowlands shows us anything it is that yes a very large portion of people will go meta builds and call it a day
of people won t even know what the meta is they ll play the game perhaps twice from the first act to the last act on normal difficulty and then fuck off i find myself repeating this a lot but the actual core community that sticks around for endgame content for any prolonged period of time or intensity is fairly small in most games and d3 is hardly an exception
g2g com https://g2g.com) about to get some traffic
true i saw some rumors flying around that there might be a fifth any ways i hope the last one is very hard give us a reason to grind some months one of the leaked rumors was that the last tier has up to lvl mobs characters will max at lvl
higher difficulties or at least highest difficulty should not only change stats but also mechanics like mobs doing some extra move they didn t do on lower difficulties arpgs seems to always be just stat scaling but thing just taking longer to kill seems kinda boring and outdated tbh
they have normal mode has difficulty s that were in the beta nm at hell at torment at it could have changed though since december
i like static content that the community is measuring against and builds being rated at how well they can conquer end game bosses or dungeons this community has already determined this is a bad thing and that if you are against scaling or if you want static content it means you just want to one shot everything ez baby mode i d hate to have granular world tiers that you just click from a list and everything is arbitrarily scaling and matching your character level despised that about d3 i d rather have difficulty scales if it meant they turned off auto scaling everything auto scales minus a very small portion of the game
like 4ish world tiers sounds great it s basically normal nightmare hell inferno i d hate to have granular world tiers i agree with this so much sometimes less is more
it s literally anti marketing blowing something simple out of proportion as if to justify its cost
on the pvp clip specifically fields of hatred aren t just dedicated pvp grounds they re world areas in their own right sure you can go out and kill other players there but you can also do general quests and events and other stuff that you would do in basically any other location in d4 in order to enable pvp you have to check the i want to pvp box though it s possible that once you ve checked it you ll be able to hit other players who haven t checked it either way it seems to me like if you just want to fight other players then you can do that for the most part afaik the red dust cleansing ritual summons in monsters but not really hard ones but you don t have to either you can just as easily go into fields of hatred with the intention of ignoring pvp and doing regular questing stuff you can even get crimson shards there since regular enemies drop them you just might get forced into pvp if you want to purify them since the purification ritual will get marked on the map for all players interested in killing you for your swag
thanks for sharing good observations
that last one is curious quite a lot of xp i guess late game quests give a lot
apologies was not my intent to annoy you feedback taken and added to the op thanks
don t see how that s better than having times more attack power always maybe pvp build
yeah i m part of the crowd that likes respecs being a problem because it gives characters a sense of identity i also agreed with people when they requested respecs to be a big deal in d4 but after seeing the game i don t understand why it s so important now d4 just isn t made to be a game where respecs and character identity is really important it s much more casual and if you are making a casual game then having jarring systems like respec cost is just bad the only upside to respecs being expensive is that it serves as a gold sink if people really use it and gold sinks are always good in games where the economy matters outside of that it s just annoying
idk i really like the point wudijo made in one if his recent videos if you allow respec ing to be free and easily accessible then it suddenly becomes almost mandatory to min max your build for every little thing for some players and people will get around to making macros that respec for them in seconds which then just creates an issue of fairness plus as for trying things out while playing in the beta i had enough gold to fully respec like or times and i wasn t gold farming nor paying that much attention to it and i only played the beta for hours total much less than some people that docked or hours you will be able to try things out in the early midgame as much as you want there isn t any respec cost at all until level btw idk if people noticed that during the beta the cost only goes up as you level at least from what i saw and doesn t increase based on how many respecs you ve done and lastly everything we ve heard from the closed beta also indicates you can farm enough gold for a full respec in a few hours or days tops obviously that s also not optimized almost everything we ve heard and seen on respec ing has shown us it s really not that bad and not necessarily in accordance with the make a new character comment from a few months ago i think maybe that s what s causing the perception of an issue this isn t really like a true mmo where you have full specs you need to swap between to be effective besides committed pvp players the large majority of your time will be spent on clearing mobs and or bosses and support builds in arpg s are normally only a thing in parties at the highest level of play for season players and diablo doesn t even have mechanics that heavily encourage or require support builds anyway it s interesting to see the differences in communities though on reddit there seems to be a huge bandwagon in favor of free respecs whereas the d4 discord at least the sense i m getting is overwhelmingly against it
not every casual has an issue with it just dorks on reddit that think they re the only people in the world with busy lives
i feel respecs need some non trivial cost free respec seems cheap to me and decisions do not matter it should not take a week to farm your respec but it shouldn t be a carefree decision either i feel d2 has it right with the token the components drop pretty easily from bosses which are the primary farming areas it may take a good day of farming to get all of them
there needs to be a gold sink so they can sell gold potions
i think they got the balance right a partial respec is still cheap full respecs are entirely possible but you won t be doing it every day which has the advantage of also incentivizing people to commit somewhat top building certain characters i think its a bit game breaking when you don t have to meet challenges to your build and can simply fully respec on a whim to meet certain boss requirements etc i suffered a lot of choiuce paralysis in d3 constant pressure to be tweaking skills for every situation rather i want to spend more time battling and less time constantly swapping skills and this gives us freedom while incentivizing restraint
they have said it won t be prohibitively expensive which means it will be cheap wouldn t even worry about it they have obviously heard the feedback and are striking a good middle ground remember there are many people that want some type of cost involved
i m predicting it to be the strongest in end game honestly unless they make something fall off and aren t telling us
closed beta players said it was the strongest
barb is broken asf endgame no worries
looked weak compared to sorc int and triple attack power
well it s a fact that they can use an extra 2h weapon and an extra set of 1h weapons compared to like a sorc
i believe they are saying aspects that aren t connected to dungeons have a chance to drop or aspects from dungeons you haven t done yet have a chance to drop
if it is a chance it better be a high chance not like a
dam so much for being able to play different build and try out new shit
ill have to fight you about this there should be zero reason to have respec cost let us explore diablo didnt let you pay money to respec if you want a money sink they can do armor repair jc costs enchanting costs applying legendaries costs there are alot of ways but the main system of your talents should not cost a single penny if it goes live its going to feel terrible
agreed i m gonna give d4 the benefit of the doubt here if we can accumulate plenty of funds by endgame to a lesser extreme than d3 i don t need quadrillion gold lol i don t see a problem with respec having a cost
i m with you on this taking a few hours of grinding to be able to respec is fine i d be okay with a hour grind for a full end game respec but if it s taking days of playing in order to respec an end game build i think that s a little over the top
inflating gametime possibility for mtx afterwards same thing they did with wow shadowlands making you choose a covenant if you want to try them all out get ready for some stupid sidequest to be able to rejoin the first covenant you picked taking up an hour or of your time for absolutely zero reason
nightmare sigils are like map modifiers in poe they modify the map the enemies and modifiers of the enemies and yourself in exchange for higher gold xp loot rewards so you can t really cheese it you have to play harder and harder modifiers to get higher and higher rewards
pretty sure you get a random dungeon assigned to the sigil in a similar way to mythic key in wow you don t choose the dungeon yourself
afaik you cant choose a specific dungeon
you can only craft random sigils so you have a chance to get a specific nightmare dungeon thus you ll play random dungeons depending on your rng
i think we play differently i had more than triple your playtime and were mostly sitting around 100k or less even sold of what i looted the aspects rerolling reforing and upgrading all felt like major gold sinks just swapping around a few skills before a boss is going to costs millions now if you just need skills back and forth
can t remember which video but they released a clip where we can see some ground gold around 1k for every pile
i really think that things shouldn t be like that milions of gold seems a lot like d3 blizz not putting their numbers right
this especially if we aren t buying from the shops except for maybe a repair by the time we really need to respec which is the launch of season imo we will have way more then enough and the seasonal characters start fresh anyways so overall i m pretty sure the respec cost will be a non issue
dude just imagine what would it be if the meta were like after this boss you completely respec then go do this and after that respec and so on even if i don t like the respec cost i dislike even more the possible consequences that are highly likely because we have multiple game modes in endgame of a free or almost free full character respec
these were probably just characters made with game commands to quickly get footage for the video i would not expect them to activate the lilith statues and properly gear the characters
doesn t make a ton of sense to me either if there are around altars of lilith across the game that s stats divvied up across the stats giving us all we also get all stats every time we level i don t know if this will continue past level so let s just assume it s that means baseline at level we should have at least all stats possibly more if we continue getting all after we also get paragon points most paragon points are primary stat bonuses let s say of all allocated paragon points will be primary stats each node is of a specific primary stat and the gates are all if we assume the of primary stat nodes are divvied up evenly and you get gate nodes that s all stat plus the base should be now of course the paragon board stats aren t likely to be divvied up evenly but if they re imbalanced then we should still see at least one number higher than this even if there are fewer altars of lilith the numbers should still be relatively close it looks to me like the barb hasn t put a single point into his paragon tree or something
aspects come at a fixed strength maybe doing em again will give you a stronger version idk
it s already like this sort of it s super inexpensive at low levels and takes some hours of gold farm to respec at higher levels by what i ve heard from closed beta players anyway maybe take it with a grain of salt seems to just scale with level since paragon is an endgame thing more or less as for respec ing your skills you ll be able to experiment plenty in the earlygame if nothing has changed from the beta
i remember playing d2 as a young kid and being scared shitless of her same with butcher and duriel i think they re bringing that fear back
if they change it to a chance i m going to be pretty upset
you didn t realize that until shadowlands
i reflect that my time playing d2 over the years has been fairly lonely where each and every single friend i ve ever played the game with has gone thorough the campaign once or twice and then fucked off lol
it has changed at least by the two betas we just had there are now only world tiers and are your normal and hard then you can unlock after being the game and after that
of an aaa title s budget is marketing
you can never know when the elitist will emerge from their caves and get annoyed at us casuals you just take it with a grain of salt and roll on wonderful review thank you for your time on this post
only reason i m not a fan of high respect costs is rng and legendary items most any good legendary adds bonuses for a specific skill in d3 i find a legendary that makes swarm do much more damage to slowed enemies i switch to using that skill if your locked into your build many if not most legendary item we find will be useless without paying a fortune and i really enjoy being able to try a skill if i find a great looking legendary that adds to its usefulness
i actually liked hard respecs back in the day when it really was just people figuring shit out but now everyone knows anything they want to so i don t see the point all expensive respecs do now is funnel people who would otherwise like to chill and explore their own builds to build guides costly respecs are just a relic of the preinternet days imo
they re doing it because they re going to sell respec gems or gold soon after launch
it is kind of strange to say they are making a game for casuals and then complain it isn t being designed for casuals
maybe there can be an optional mode for people that want to pay for respec and they can have their own leaderboard d d4 has hardcore mode poe has ssf and hardcore modes i think optional but official challenges are great i personally would even like it if there s an option to lower the exp rate since i prefer leveling to be more slow paced you don t even need to give me a leaderboard since i don t play competitively i mean that won t affect anyone else i already self impose lower exp rate by not buying exp boost in mmorpg i don t mind if others have higher exp rate than me preferably not because of p2w though
they can make it so players can only respec for free in town maybe there can be a cost for unlocking each skill but returning skill point and reallocating it to a skill that you have are free so you still have to earn it like it doesn t cost anything to swap gears it only costs time to find them though for skills i think it makes sense if you can only swap for free in town it ll be similar to swapping runes in old seasons of league of legends it costs currency to buy runes but you can swap runes that you have for free outside of a match x200b people will get around to making macros that respec for them in second whether there ll be respec cost or not i think it ll be good if you can make your own build presets like having rune and mastery pages in league of legends so you don t have to reallocate skill points and swap gears one by one every time you want to change your build it ll be more similar to changing to a different character but it costs gold everytime you do it or it s free if you do it in town and you can only change build not class if you want to change to a different class you have to make another character
f you make it expensive everyone plays optimal build they copy and never experiment
i agree with you free respecs just pushes everyone to the meta even harder part of the game is the challenge and making respecs free regardless of internet access makes the game easier as you pointed out we also have no idea how long it might take to actually try and respec in the video those guys had paragon boards i m sorry but if you have a paragon board and are in depth with it thats not casual thats trying to become a top player at such a high level respeccing should be costly even if that means you spend a saturday grinding bosses
ok you re not the only one but i m going to ask you what exactly is fun in a good day of farming i mean how can you think that locking something behind a day of mindless chore is good game design sometime i m honestly baffled i can t comprenhend why you would want something unfun for a day i will never understand farming and why people ask for it i mean i understand gamedesigner trying to put out bad content but you as a player why want to farm something
my fear for that is that while it was the best it may only be a specific build instead of just being good overall same for druid
inevitably some dudes will no life it and then declare the game dead and boring since they played hours in weeks and now feel like they have no content
what are capstone dungeon bosses
the level boss was getting one tapped during the end game beta so i hope they ve tuned it better
obviously this is very disappointing but let s get real poe took a long time to get shaper elder sirius maeven etc this is the launch of the game clearly one that is being pushed out a bit underbaked my guess is in a year or two if they actually stay dedicated to development we should see actual pinnacle bosses with both challenge to reach them and challenge to defeat them i think people need to temper their expectations for the initial launch and just enjoy it as a fun arpg with a good story campaign the end game will come later
so just one
for those wondering about capstone dungeons and future difficulties of the game copy and paste from my comment below in the open beta we got world tier and world tier world tier was named veteran there are tiers and each has a capstone dungeon you likely cannot complete it until you ve leveled and geared through the relative tier requirements each capstone dungeon has a boss if you go in undergeared there s a solid chance you ll just get shot repeatedly or do no appreciable damage to the boss they re gatekeeper bosses which allow you to unlock the next world tier or in the case of world tier to claim victory over the game for that level of mastery nobody knows how release will go but i can already predict that people who beat the capstone boss will say that the game is over even though there is a lot more to still do in the game if they wanted to it s like d3 players saying they re done with the game bc they completed gr tbqh you can really crank up most dungeons with sigils and if you want a serious challenge some of those can be insane they can be so difficult people will fish sigils like they currently fish gr in diablo only using the ones with reasonably easy affixes to conquer because hard ones are just too hard
it was not really a pinnacle boss last time and i dont think they changed much about it
i m cautiously hopeful
so the answer to this question is no why did he answer yes and then say well actually no there is one boss
so bosses lol
game is crap anyways
but is there matchmaking
so how do you make a boss difficult while not potentially requiring multiple attempts to defeat it you could make the boss incapable of killing your character but then you d require something else to make it hard as not having a risk to die takes a lot of danger away from a boss you could put a timer on a boss so that the fight fails if you do not have enough dps but that is more about gathering gear and not about understanding mechanics ata certain point which then likely requires theory crafting again the whole principle behind that question seems to be a huge contradiction
this guy is asking for extremely hard bosses without dying a lot
deleted
great news i finally have a goal now glad to hear it
so to summarise briefly bosses with actual mechanics i would like as well but it wouldn t go down with the casual player base
good compromise might be to bring back that mythical inferno difficulty at higher levels but make the progression more steady instead of spikey
inevitably some dudes will no life it and then declare the game dead and boring since they played hours in weeks and now feel like they have no content two weeks more like one week there will be exploits and bugs and broken classes it s possible somebody hits max level within the first hours or less the game hasn t actually been tested sufficiently for release look at how unbalanced the early game was just in the beta on act one
don t worry seasons are content
in the open beta we got world tier and world tier world tier was named veteran there are tiers and each has a capstone dungeon you likely cannot complete it until you ve leveled and geared through the relative tier requirements each capstone dungeon has a boss if you go in undergeared there s a solid chance you ll just get shot repeatedly or do no appreciable damage to the boss they re gatekeeper bosses which allow you to unlock the next world tier or in the case of world tier to claim victory over the game for that level of mastery nobody knows how release will go but i can already predict that people who beat the capstone boss will say that the game is over even though there is a lot more to still do in the game if they wanted to it s like d3 players saying they re done with the game bc they completed gr tbqh you can really crank up most dungeons with sigils and if you want a serious challenge some of those can be insane they can be so difficult people will fish sigils like they currently fish gr in diablo only using the ones with reasonably easy affixes to conquer because hard ones are just too hard
that was due to confirmed bugs not due to the boss at all people were abusing it by one shotting world bosses too if you weren t abusing the bug it was actually somewhat of a challenge to not die to the mechanics without having some invulnerability skill to avoid it the vast majority of casual players will not be able to solo the level boss without dozens of tries and going back to the drawing board to find something that works
with what sort of gear poe ubers can get one tapped as well but can still pose a good challenge to players attempting it with a normal gear level or non cheese build just curious really
player power needs to be tuned at that point or we end up like d3
call me crazy but i have good faith in that the d4 team will make the end game boss somewhat challenging until you re insanely geared
lets made boss so hard so only streamers and of no lifers can beat them people who cannot beat them still get enjoyment from seeing streamers beat them chris wilson ggg boss
this is sadly what i m fearing the end game will eventually look like but it s arpg so hard to expect anything else
lmfao end game beta also that boss wasn t a level to my knowledge if it was our level s wouldn t even put a dent in him not to mention players were using a bug to make that happen
at the end of the day they made a game that is fun to play i would be happy just killing demons and getting loot with how good the game feels everything they add is just gravy
clearly one that is being pushed out a bit underbaked i don t think its underbaked i think yall expect too much every time a game comes out that s live service and mentions an endgame people expect to be able to play it every day for up to hours minimum and when ya can t yall get all up on the comment boards bitching and complaining about how there s nothing to do after playing to hours just on the vanilla game and basic price tag shit s ridiculous
i feel like we say underbaked because its blizzard aaa because doesn t d4 look to have more content than any other arpgs on launch definitely in better shape than poe or d3 were that is still a very fair criticism just so we re clear considering how long this game has likely been worked on
i agree with tempering expectations personally i m going to go in with the expectations of feeling how i felt when i was playing during the open beta weekend with the knowledge that rates were up
im glad it does atleast have some difficult bosses
poe was developed in a garage by a couple of nerds who wanted to make a successor to d2 you re really gonna compare the release of something like that in to what one of the biggest game dev companies can do in with over years of experience there s a good reason why it took so long to get shaper elder maven etc in poe a reason that shouldn t exist for blizzard you should expect progress and hold things to a higher standard not point fingers at shit like d2 from years ago and a game made by like people in some guy s garage in
yup lol
bosses at launch for level characters you aren t beating them opening weekend lol you think it s gonna be bosses for the next years relax
other acts have world bosses as well
nope boss lol
i m pretty sure you re reading the question wrong he wants a boss that does take multiple attempts to beat one which you can t beat without theory crafting
dudes from ukraine english isn t their first language most likely use context clues and try not to get hung up on semantics
l2r he says dozens of retries he wants to die a lot
see my other comment
like man of course humans can make whatever goal they want maybe your goal is to kill diablo times maybe make all the ancient versions of your gear or as u said beat gr that s totally fine if u think that s a challenge but for me it s not for me wasting thousand of hours in getting the gear which will one shot trash before it one shots you is not the challenge for me it s just unhealthy gaming i am talking about the bosses with really difficult phases that require the combination of your human skills and gear if u don t understand what i am talking about just google shaper bossfight
only challenge in that is the fact you have to be immensely bored and stuck with one game to even want to reach gr150
bosses with mechanics in arpgs don t stand in the fire
i didn t notice anything like that then again i m an old man now and i deliberately try to avoid trying to learn the meta
oh got it thanks for explaining i kinda like it that there is somekind of benchmark to overcome before moving to higher world tier rather than only switching button some will probably quit after getting capstone dungeon on wt5 or maybe they will never get it if it s too op but still as you mentioned while there is some kind of ladder there to climb in a way of progression that can be measured there will be that to chase for people
ok this sounds a bit more hopeful also gotta hope there s more than or of these or at least that they keep adding new ones regularly
the last capstone dungeon for level imo wasn t that hard used upheaval barb at level or so to attempt it and i didn t finish it but was able to get it low imo if i was actually level i would have beat it with little issue unless for some reason the attacks that one shot me still one shot me at edit to be clear so there is no confusion in the endgame beta you had the capstone dungeons to go up world tiers plus a level capstone dungeon in torment pretty sure that was what was talked about here the nightmare dungeons are a whole other thing and i think the highest i did was or
what kind of bug was it because he was pretty much stomping everything in his path
finding something that works watching youtube or streamer copying their build tactic exploit then coming to reddit to post a best way to solo x and pass it off as something they figured out
even with psycho standard gear you can t one tap ubers as they all at least have phases they must go through
they re going to double it
call me crazy
based on what no offense but these devs haven t really proven anything yet it s a tall order to make an arpg have a good end game that can be played for thousands of hours without feeling too stale
rogue enters the chat downs world spawn boss times in mins read forums of people bitching about necro and sorc clearing trash fast me lmfao
same here just check how insane inferno diablo was till they nerfed big time so i have high hopes and those hardcore players will get their feel of accomplishment d
he was doing tier content nightmare sigils are tier what you watched was just the daily open world trash that is never gonna be hard when your fully decked clearing content 90x harder
exactly i think the expectations from us hard core gamer types are unrealistic if this game came out when i was i would think it s the best thing ever playing it as a game from start to finish with my buddies would ve been enough now we re all looking for a game to live in and for whatever reason expect it to be that expansive and deep on launch
i think a lot of people just have a trust issue with blizzard they have said these words over and over again and yet look at previous wow expansions d3 etc the updated have been very disappointing to say the least
i was more speaking to the unfinished ui poor balancing weak skill trees bugs etc according to several streamers with a little bit of insider info the dev team themselves wish they had more time with the game so it s pretty clear activision is pushing this out the door a bit early
after looking over that question again yeah you may be right diablo already had some challenging bosses in act though depending on the class that was played it took me more attempts than i d like to admit to defeat the final kor dragan boss while i was playing rogue as a sorcerer though that boss was pretty easy
exactly
that s not how it reads which are hard to overcome without theorycrafting which are hard to overcome without dozens of tries to beat you can use the word and to combine the two thoughts which are extremely hard to overcome without theorycrafting and dozens of tries to beat or if your thought was to ask for dozens of tries then you d say which are extremely hard to overcome takes dozens of tries and without theorycrafting
that fight is kinda janky though def does take both aspects
this is not a soulslike so no need for bosses like that this game is about gear minmax level or loot game but as its the whole franchise i dont think it makes semse to ask for smhg else
i put points into thorns on a barb without having any gems even and on world tier ranged mobs would one shot themselves shooting me there s a lot of quirky ways to level right now that may not get you into the end game but can certainly get you max level fast
it sounds like you are basically just mad that the internet exist
what is your point with this though this is unavoidable
i watched a video about the corpse explosion legendary does that mean i will alva sudden have one in my bags now seems like if i am up to the level boss but dont have the pieces of exodia in my hands i m still gonna throw everything i have at it regardless
welcome to the internet have you been here long i ve been seeing that for nearly years now
incorrect for a few of them at least some do have unskippable phases but even in those cases the fights can still be pretty much killed instantly after phasing maven memory game can be skipped and each phase can be pushed pretty much instantly exarch can have his phased skipped with enough damage same with eater point was more about them being non trivial with gear rather than instantly killed so poor wording on my part i suppose either way that s only with absurd gear or meme builds i was curious if d4 would be the same or if the boss was more of a pushover in general
and give it to the next person
isnt that what they did last time with d3 and hell mode doubled it after beta
d3 i m assuming you didn t play d3 at launch
yeah but the dev team spent years talking about how hard d3 was going to be it was a huge cornerstone of the games philosophy we ve seen nothing like that with d4 d4 to my knowledge has never been advertised as a hyper competitive brutal game that will spit you up and chew you out it s always been look how big this game is look how non linear it is look omg a mount shit like that way more casual friendly
figures but what i mean is that arpg s are about gear check and about skill in difficulty as a generalization not saying there isn t difficulty scaling but just afraid that at the end of the day to beat that you just have to get the gear and then play just like you play any content just lawnmower the dungeon clean by spamming1 or buttons
world tier and dungeon sigil levels are completely different things i m not sure how they interact since i didn t play endgame beta but my suspicion is that the world tier sets the base level of difficulty after all you can t run nightmare dungeons on world tiers below and then sigils multiply that even further so level dungeon on world tier and world tier might actually be very different in terms of difficulty
ah seems you agree with my previous comment
yea true i don t trust blizzard at face value either but this happens all the time in looter shooter game communities hell outriders wasn t even live service and they said from the beginning when you finish the content that s it the game is done and you can move on to something else and people were still bitching about the endgame and standard nothing to do game is dead etc bullshit
my chain lightning sorcerer took quite a few attempts to learn to avoid his abilities my twisted blades rogue deleted the boss before he could use abilities
sorry for semantic issues guy i am ukrainian english isn t my native language but i meant exactly what person above told u
it would fit perfectly fine in a diablo game in of itself did you read his example at all poe does this quite well has actually challenging bosses for leagues that are very fun and take at least a minimal amount of learning not saying poe is a better game but that this style of boss fight can be implemented perfectly fine in an arpg and while it may be a whole franchise every diablo game has been very dissimilar to each other the only thing truly tying them together is lore
why the game needs fresh content that is challenging for both solo players and groups diablo end game is the most mind numbing and soulless take the genre has ever seen you literally just make numbers go up and try to speed run rifts why can t we have content designed that actually makes you have to strategize to complete there is zero challenge in diablo aside from being able to put yourself through a tortuous grind you can gear your character and still design mobs that require more than just holding a button down to defeat
i think if heavy amount of diablo fans want to have that kind of a content their needs should be heard btw do you know that initially they have planned to make the diablo iv souls like https://www.psu.com/news/diablo-iv-hades-souls-like/)? if u have played the beta then you should know that combat on melee characters feels more souls likeish so yeah now is and the game is not about just killing trash and looting
was there a thorns option on the skill tree pretty sure i was too busy trying out active skills to put any into passives edit really that deserved down down votes fucking hate reddit sometimes lol
sounds like he is basically just mad
exactly gamers have been looking at guides since forever i remember my older brother buying magazine guides for the games he played
i dunno prolly just wants to shit on people who don t play games
alva sudden thats a first i ve witnessed that spelling variation
no but it means if you turn around and post what you learned as a hey guys check out my corpse explosion build that you are exactly the cohort i am shitting on
people already found broken meme builds in d4 beta ww barbs doing a second
yeah without absolute peak gear they re nowhere near push overs my guess would honestly be diablo won t allow you to get to that point on launch i m wary of d4 devs falling into the trapping of d3 and their heinous multipliers hopefully end game bosses can t be out scaled that hard although leave it to the playerbase to find impossibly high damage interactions
fk that guy
yeah that s how inferno difficulty came about
i did these are d3 devs if so i didn t realize that and the d3 end game sucked imo
like you said that s mostly what arpgs are my man
but blizzard have failed to deliver in the past years what makes you think they will do it now what makes you so certain that season won t just be extra of what d3 seasons were quite literally all the data points to this i just don t see any other way don t get me wrong i d love for d4 to turn out like poe solid years of work behind it with each season league adding a lot to the core game it is very unlikely though will i buy the game most likely am i expecting anything more than a game and mediocre seasons definitely not
you re fine some people just wake up in the morning looking for a reason to bitch i m also hoping we get some insanely difficult challenges at end game
it s fine english is easy to be misunderstood on word usage of it s barely used wrong i don t fault you for 2nd language its just if someone else tells me l2r they better be ready to back it up by the way i prefer dozens of tries as you do which is why i made a comment in the first place misunderstanding you
i hope the game is successful enough for a long life and many updates like they claim i m guessing they ll save the prime evil for an expansion with power creep and new higher difficulty maybe for a while they will be high end challenge like ubers and won t be punching bags we farm easily also d3 ros ending has tyrael fearing that nephalem are too strong and may fall to corruption some day civil war arc some of the d3 protagonist classes stay good and some turn evil high end nephalem boss imo classic diablo tradition to have the previous heroes fall to tragic fate
i want a blank boss template i can import my boss s face on
d4 should go down the road of poe and make difficult bosses that you ll need to farm enough gear to complete such feature makes people wanna keep fighting grinding untill they achieve the goal of killing that boss
i d love a rogue angel and a rogue demon but they are very like high ranking
that response is very ambiguous personally i m not getting my hopes up
title is extremely misleading the quote does not hint that renown and statues will carry over the quote says absolutely nothing other than some things will carry over between seasons in fact you could almost read it as confirming that progress does not carry over because it compares it with diablo ii where everything is reset while i think we all realize how bad it would be if we had to redo these every season it says a lot that they are dancing around answering the question directly my read is that they didn t think about this before seeing the uproar and now a bunch of people are in a room trying to figure out how to not make renown statues super painful every season while also making season resets kind of the great equalizer they tend to be in diablo alikes expect pre season progress in these systems to not affect season but in season they will do something to make it less time consuming
my guess they just bake in the stats or whatever right into the characters to start and take away the bonus from statues starting like season or to avoid that fatigue just make each statue just give some gold and a bit of xp
i saw that and it s basically just clickbait on wowhead s part that answer says nothing about lilith statues only that there may be some features that carry over which tells us very little
man that would be awesome definitely not something i care to do more than once
they have spoken about considering ways to make the statues not too tedious for seasons but had no firm plans and wanted everyone to start on equal footing there is one piece of content in a previous blog that said we can skip the campaign after we complete it for seasons so i assume that would cover the progress that is saved between seasons in this statement
i read this exactly opposite tbh they give stats so it wouldn t make sense for them to persist across seasons
simple yes or no question and activision blizzard are still incapable of answering it
my gut says no everything resets
fuck thats good news if so
i figured they would if people were forced to restart the statues every season it would make the account wide bonus kind of pointless and people would get burnt out and just skip it i don t think i could do it more than once
i think it makes sense for renown altars of lilith to be reset every season yeah yeah i know doing it all over again sucks however in order to truly set everyone on equal footing it must be done otherwise it isn t fair for people starting a new season without having done all of that beforehand
i m pretty happy i know some people aren t but as someone who plans to play most if not all the seasons yes it may only take hours after we gets mounts and such but that s still hours edit if altars and renown do transfer really as long as altars do i don t mind renown as much but altars sucked
i hope it doesn t carry over so whiny manbabies quit the game and fuck off
to me personally it would be a shame if completing renown and finding statues of lilith is just a once in a lifetime thing
i sincerely hope so cos fuck doing that shit every season
i hope the statues are moved every season to new locations i know some players would find that annoying but i think that exploration is fun
i found nothing reassuring in that response
imo everything should reset yea you ll spend the first couple hours of a season refarming stuff but that s what seasons are to diablo a complete reset dunno why people are so whiny about having to click a few statues every months
i am telling you i wont ever touch another season outside of realease if i find out i have to do lilith alters each season
i would be okay with them making us farm for the altars again in season if the altars then transferred going forward with each seasonal character i think it puts less strain on players who want to complete everything they can in a season without feeling fomo and also allows people to not get burnt out hunting for the same things repeatedly
the size of the beta and knowing there are acts and area renown being actually useful granting skill points etc it does sound like it would be a lot to redo every season
i doubt paragon carries over discovery achievements like shrines of lilith maybe it s more likely that things like pets and cosmetics carry over but anything that actually affects your power probably doesn t
lilith statues per zone everything resets please blizzard lilith statues should have never been approved
how would everybody be on equal footing if statues carry over between seasons not every player will have all of them and new players definitley will not think at least for one second before you delude yourself with something that makes no sense
i think it would add challenge to the race to have to get all of the side stuff along the way not only would the xp farm be optimized but there would be decisions to make if the extra power from renown would be worth routing in makes the game more interesting
if they are going to keep the statues they should make them appear in random locations per account every season that way you don t feel obligated to go find a guide and just go click on them all because this is utterly uninteresting they can just be a nice bonus that you might happen to find as you move around the world of course some people will feel it necessary to exhaustively search out all of them but imo they shouldn t be necessary in order to reach a reasonable level of power that way we can just ignore them if we want there s no way to have a truly fair start for everyone if they carry over between sessions
so joe shely explained absolutely nothing
to me that sounds like a no i m trying to think of stuff that carries over in d3 and all i can think of is if you ve finished story you can go into adventure mode straight away each season most transmogs don t transfer over even
he is probably talking about cosmetics mounts and titles tied to the account nothing in this answer said something about the altars of lilith directly
imagine they change the location between each seasons
my preferences renown no re earn it every season altars yes it s silly to rediscover them like columbus discovering america you know where they are located it s not random cosmetics yes full carry over there s no reason hold this back or a need to rediscover it on a new season
these systems carrying over will likely be cosmetic only
can anybody explain me a little closer how all those resets works in arpg i never played diablo3 poe or anything else similar and i am confused i am old school gamer who just played d2 chars up to level enjoying all those difficulties and building all that character for long time imagining that i will have reseted char after few months and start over again i am kind of upset but thats maybe because i just do not understand the concept what happens to previously played characters how this all works thx
i don t know the common consensus among the community so this could be an unpopular opinion but i hope they don t carry over from season to season over time we ll learn where all the altars are and renown comes fairly naturally while playing the game from what i could see while playing
it ll just be a thing you do for 1hr every season open your map on whatever fansite you prefer run around on your horse collecting your meaningless stats for an hour and then ignore for months if they do reset for s1 and everyone hates it it ll be changed from s2 onwards
altars of lilith serve no purpose but to add artificial content
some systems will be tied to your account has nothing to do with seasonal resets the statues and the renown system are account wide but will almost certainly reset with each hopefully enough people will complain about this to get blizzard s attention after the first couple of seasons
pretty sure only cosmetics will carry over
pretty vague here man
especially when the lilith alter tutorial pop up specificaly says that the perks are shared with all characters in the same realm realm season or eternal realm non season maybe they changed their mind since then but the game is really unambiguous about being restricted per realm
agreed i think there is too much speculation on this sub we all have the same limited information from blizzard so i m just going to sit back and wait for the game
i agree they can do almost anything off that statement
what would be the point so the games harder for everyone in the realm only the first time ever through it s not meant to be a go out and collect them all for most people you just happen to come across them time from time and it makes it easier for players who join in late in the ladder to grind it will reset every single ladder or be the dumbest implementation in the entire series
if you had the context of the rest of the interview every other answer they gave for the interview was extremely on point like they pretty much confirmed theres no cow level on launch they cuda easily been wishy washy about that and say something along the lines of wait and find out so i dont really see why this one would be intentionally ambiguous by laws of inference maybe it s just a poorly quoted sentence
why does everyone treat it like it s must to hunt these all down i will probably never hunt them all and they need to reset every ladder or wtf is the point in the first place
this is probably the best solution i ve heard i like this idea a lot
it probably means like cosmetics and premium cosmetics not altars or renown that s my guess
honestly i think what they mean as being shared is cosmetics which makes sense especially for premium cosmetics
i m almost certain they are referring to cosmetics but don t want to because then people would demand they also make altars account wide as well
i think it will be cosmetics and stuff exclusively
i feel like everybody is missing this important detail if the altars provide you with skill points and other stuff from the beginning then someone new who thinks alright imma start with season and be on the same level is everybody would not at all be on equal footing which is the whole idea of seasons
this and also you re going to be traversing the open world each season as that is how the game is intended i don t see the issue with clicking an altar while doing so gamers these days are incredibly lazy
so i m just gonna say this i don t think the altars renown or anything is getting shared across seasons i think what the quote is referring to is cosmetics and stuff things that have no effect on most players
deleted
they could keep it like beta so you keep the stat bonus from the altars but new characters you can find them all again for the renown
for me i have been a diablo fan for years when d2 introduced seasons i basically stopped playing i wanted to finish taking my amazon to not start over fresh every months with the new much deeper character creator i want to focus on the rpg with my time on diablo not so much the action part id love to play my same character and never reset i know there is a subset of people here who will downvote me and tell me arpgs are not for me then but id argue you could still have seasons but in a better way than locking content away from eternal characters for months
sorry to burst ya bubble but people who already finished the campaign once gets to skip the campaign entirely for all subsequent seasons so i m not quite sure this whole everyone should be on equal footing premise even existed in the first place
and titles from achievements
you have two realms non seasonal and seasonal seasons lasts months nd after that your character is simply moved to a non seasonal realm so you can continue playing it if you want to play the next season then you start all over with a new character
idk seems like he could just say no instead of what he said i think at least statues will carry over
it s more likely that some systems will be tied to your account means the transmog cosmetic systems
yeah i recall that verbiage too which is why i m skeptical to begin with
as someone who never enjoyed seasons and was only really forced to play them due to new items in d3 i loathe that ladder non ladder monyh behind differentiation d2 was the only diablo game where you absolutely didn t need to play seasons and didn t miss out on stuff
for the fucking x time eternal is by opposition with hardcore not with season
i just had an argument with someone on another post about this a couple days ago before this interview my guess is that you ll have to do them during the first season and then they ll carry over to all seasons after that obviously no way to tell for sure and i ll admit to that unlike the other guy who just kept telling me i was wrong without offering any alternatives lol
well to each their own but it seems like it will have a significant effect on your account to get them or not for a silly example it would be like not wearing a helm yeah you can do it and you can probably clear all of the content but you re leaving a lot of power on the table to such a degree that i personally would feel all but forced to clear them every season ymmv and as long as you re getting your money worth that is all that matters
almost seeme like some ppl would pay for progression to be made sadge
says a dork with 30k karma
it will be like this if it carry s over
you are not bursting any bubble i personally don t care about the equal footing stuff i like seasonal resets but i also don t want to farm the same stupid statues every season so i don t have anything to lose here however blizzard themselves said everybody will be on equal footing at the start of a season but that s not even what i was talking about all i said is that it does not make any sense for people to think that if blizzard wants people to be equal at the start of a season that they won t reset stuff like statues and renown i mean you even added a point since blizzard stated that the story only needs to be done once but they did not include all that other stuff in that statement
woah woah calm down that d ruin some neck beards emersion
thank you for response and non seasonal realms do not getting any new content experienced in seasons i am not a guy who wants a rush every month to reach some kind of ranking i just want to log few times per week and chill with few friends we are going to play together does it mean that if we will not play seasons we gonna be worse in itemization way or skill set or smth like that than ppl who are into seasonal gameplay
no in this case the pop up was when interacting with the first alter and specifically said the bonus you gain from the altar are only for character on your realm
lol no all the best rune words and rune upgrading cube recipes were season only for years
i assumed there d be realms eternal ladder eternal hardcore ladder hardcore but there s a chance after feedback they make it only and alters renown carry over between seasons not getting my hopes up for that but it s not impossible
not to mention they persist to the rest of your seasons characters as well making leveling new characters incredibly nice here s the values from beta assuming each zone will get similar amounts it s a lot of power left on the table i agree zone dex int str wp obels fractured peaks
renown has a serious effect but statues do not attribute points have insanely low value in the current game if you roll all stats on a piece of gear it s basically useless also for renown you only need completion in every zone so it s not even a big deal
i never said i wouldn t collect them i won t go out of my way to collect them all of the bonus is already more thab enough to make the game uninteractive while leveling you should find most of them just from doing strongholds and leveling only trophy hunters will feel a need to get them all every season
i assume each season will have a special name like ravaged realm savage realm ruthless realm based on the content of the season
following the same numbers and say i just happen to come across while grinding you don t think would be plenty of bonuses i m not a trophy hunter i won t need them all i never said i won t collect them i don t need to collect them all l
old yes https://twitter.com/tarantu73291035/status/1638189995931336705 but dont think they said how old october beta was a little different
druid didn t have crushing blow so maybe
i too would like to know this
i played the closed beta and it definitely wasn t the same build in the previous one there were missing assets and textures and a lot of the skills looked different visually
usually it is a stable version of game could be 3months old or more we need a crystal ball to know the exact date
dont expect anything new on lunch they already mention no time for any ui changes etc in lates video
likely i m a dev not at blizz and the answer is quite simple stability the build needs to be as bug free as possible so we set build lock dates to kick a build for playtesting having a stable functioning build is always more important than anything else
rumour this was the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/128yo4c/diablo_4_is_far_better_developed_at_this_moment/) trying to claim that they heard it from someone it makes no sense to beta test a development build from months ago it would essentially be wasting any bug reporting potential
no that s just pure copium
all i know is that i hope they fix the crows bug i was able to melt a boss in seconds with that druid spell somehow
deleted
all we know is that it was old i doubt it was months old the december build still had missing textures assets probably months old
it was 8x build if i remember correctly
as far as i know it was the same build the press played in december but with two more classes unlocked
the open beta test was an old build they told us this in one of the vids their current build is 1xx something temhe one we played on was
no point for anyone to run a beta on an old build the aim is to find bugs and what s the use of finding bugs in a old build
i think the speculation is that it s a build from december so not months old more like months old and months isn t actually a whole lot of time the game come release is going to be very much like the beta don t expect a huge change
to be fair the closed beta version could have been even older but all of this is just pure copium nothing substantial is changing at launch
but i want something new for lunch tired of kraft dinner fuck
dang they did that s really rough to hear it s kinda horrible at the moment
it would not especially given their focus on server stability and their removal of the bug report feature to an obscure location
betas typically are branched out months to the actual beta for polishing and bugs wouldn t be surprised if it was from december or november but also wouldn t expect there to be big changes
if you can t even recall where you might have heard it let alone actually providing a source why on earth would you just confidently say yes god damn this subreddit is fucking weird edit u darcikitten86 responding and then instant blocking me so i can t respond is peak reddit lol
endgame beta was and the betas we played recently were
it s leagues better than d3 on xbox tho i hated the diablo 3s console ui
deleted
nice healthy take on discussion right here
what second bit your comment says you don t recall where you heard it from and you literally say that you don t even know if it was reliable in the first place
deleted
dude i m literally responding to your initial comment yes idk if it s reliable but i heard it was a december build of the game unfortunately i don t recall where i heard that from probably this sub that s all you said that s all i m commenting on if i missed something about a dev confirming an old version from your comment you must assume i m a fucking mind reader lol

what are ears trophies i think i saw a pic of one in someone s inventory in a screenshot earlier
they re gonna get nailed to the church door
yes trophies they drop from players in pvp
ah ok any word on what the op asked as to what awards they offer thx
all we have seen is a screenshot of an ear in the inventory so they do take space but aside from that we know nothing in d2 they used to have the players name and level on them i would be surprised if there was anything beyond that but who knows
gotcha thx again
fun fact getting ears from players happened all the way in the first diablo game there were server rooms hosted by people where you d do just strictly pvp like fight clubs whoever could be the strongest player would get a prize usually from the host there would also be player server rooms called something like bounty guild and you d go in get a name of a player look for them in the battle net rooms and if you could get their ear you d get a prize as well ear hunting used to be a huge thing in d1 and d2
cool history lesson about the series thanks
anytime i love ears and would love for them to play a good roll in pvp again

legendary power extraction imprinting and getting some of those from first dungeon completion more focus on story and side quests casual co op play in all of those open world events that seem to be everywhere
i like the seamless open world design a lot and being able to see the occasional other players is a nice touch mounts are an interesting addition too that goes well with the open world excited to try those out to see how they feel i like the whole aspects design and that they can be extracted and transferred especially since it gives importance to rare items again being able to upgrade gear is also a welcome improvement that extends the longevity of really nice items you find there are also various qol changes that i appreciate like being able to mark a destination on the map and the game plotting and adjusting a route to it on both the mini and the large map above all full seamless cross progression and cross play and no region locking this worked really well in the beta already
mostly reduced drop rates of high tier items when you start showering people with legendaries every minute it makes them feel like common items they shouldn t may be would be nice if they tie up materials from salvaging as a stand alone drop and put them in global loot tables or just reduce overall rarity of items dropped and increase the amount of materials each item gives i am already tired of d3 constant fill up inventory go salvage all not bored enough now do that more times
i like the open world other games of this genre feel like you re walking down a long hallway until you beat the last boss and then things open up with the beta i kept getting sidetracked by things to do i never finished the storyline before i ran out of beta time
online only is a deal breaker for me i should be able to solo or even couch with another person without needing a ps subscription
better options to modify skills chance to do something ain t it love or hate diablo many of the skill modifiers were more interesting and impactful than d4
crossplay cross save with console is huge for me especially since its couch co op on console im also looking forward to world bosses and hopefully more group content i know its a controversial take but i kinda like the soft mmo direction the game is moving in ive soloed so many characters in diablo ii and iii im kinda looking forward to the game feeling alive im also interested if not a little apprehensive to see what direction the battle pass and live service and monetization aspects of the game go mechanically i was fairly happy with everything i experienced in the beta the combat feels really deliberate in its pacing i feel like enemies telegraph their attacks clearly and good positioning is manageable and rewarded
people are forgetting that stuff didn t really drop on normal most of the really good stuff wasnt even in the loot table till torment in diablo which would probably be world tier in diablo 4s case
the customization comes in other forms in d4 like spending paragon points on boards that empower a specific mechanic that a certain skill uses or procs either by its base use or by an enhancement point in the skill tree there are plenty of ways to modify your favorite skills just not in the form of a tree that follows the skills base point you spend to unlock it and by designing it this way you dont lock characters into a specific ability as much as it was done in d3 where legendary affixes for one specific skill were stacked and assured you that in order to change build you first had to find replacements for all those affixes and then plan out an entirely new build that probably required a few more key pieces than just those dmg scale affixes to a certain skill
d3 combat was similar at launch a bit more methodical until they started adding to the point where there s almost no cooldowns or resource issues aka spamming one button i really hope d4 doesn t turn out like that as i also enjoyed the more methodical combat when i played barb now necro was a different story i just summon skeletons and spammed basic and corpse explosion
hard no from me i d prefer skill points were permanent but it did make me think about pvp in diablo i am torn between sc so i can enjoy pvp or hc so i can enjoy pve perhaps i will make a sc rogue and keep it parked in the pvp zone then i can play the my favorite classes in hc for pve and i can keep my rogue ready to jump into some pvp thanks
inspire yeah make it a furry chatroom as well like lost ark is haha
the pvp zones also have pve within them so this becomes a trade off do you want the pve to be easier but then sacrifice some of your pvp ability or vice versa i think this is a good thing overall to encourage people to think about their builds
you can do hc pvp apparently there is no perma death in hc pvp
i want to turn into a llama and prance my way from one town to another
run on all 4s werewolf form maybe a legendary affix that causes your mount to be different travel form animals
we re already missing out on cosmetics for a major part of our gameplay due to being shapeshifted so now you also want to not use the cool mounts you unlock kekw
i hope it s a deer until we get flying mounts then it s like a raven and then when we become an archdruid it becomes an owl
cosmetic purchase likely
what about having mount drops unlock travel form skins
to be fair you would break the back of any normal horse
that would have been great if the intro cinematic for druid was just the horse wandering along and when he gets to the statue shifts back to human form lol
unfortunately it has 20minutes of content
yes i m gonna itch it despite looking they run the early access to get the diablo hangover people only one map etc but seems to have a good base of gameplay feel
im gonna nope this personally looks more like hades than diablo plus last epoch has definitely been scratching that arpg itch
it looks great but it s not on console
the amount of times i see scratch an itch on this sub is astounding
it looks interesting but it seemed like you only get one map not even sure if there is more than one boss if that s the case then it ll be extremely shallow even for early access at least that s what the preview i saw seems to suggest edit they even have a roadmap on the steam page you won t see a new map until summer basically you pay for a glorified demo might be cool on full release but for now not so much
counting down instabuy for me if i don t like it within hrs i ll just refund their previous roguelite was top notch from the trailers combat looks excellent
d2r scratches that itch i don t even know of a game that comes close at least for me only downside is the effort to get geared will end up wasted if i drop it in a couple months but i m sure i ll pick up during a d4 content drought
nacon yikes
roguelite has nothing to do with diablo likes though how does that scratch any itch like a roguelite itch yeah for half an hour maybe that s the amount of content it has arpg itch not really not the same genre sorry if i misunderstood that part i loved curse of the dead gods and i think i unlocked everything in that game and had a blast trying out stuff probably the best combat in any roguelite roguelike i ve experienced but it had little content even after many updates i guess they wanted to go for a different approach and started working on ravenswatch which is basically cotdg v2 i think scarce content will be improved in ravenswatch as its design is a bit different though them releasing map chapter even for ea is rather laughable that s a demo not even ea level of content they ve released it way too early maybe for financial reasons cause i don t see any logic in sabotaging themselves like this otherwise i don t think it ll do them good though considering how many people gave it a negative review already just because of the reason above people interested in the game will see them and think nah i am not paying any money for a half an hour of content there s literally no game here yet but i m sure it ll be great once fully complete surely better in terms of stuff to do than cotdg
the hc aspect rogue like part sounds fun
yeah will pick this up with some friends
imo its not worth the money might wait for full release or big updates u got map and boss it takes you like mins for a run and thats it ofc you can play different heroes but ull probably get bored quickly thats what happened to me
work out
never understood the appeal of early access games rather play when they are finished don t wanna pay to be a beta tester
looks great and i have been watching it but the ea is basically a min demo rn so i ll hold off till later
my good sir you can scratch it not itch it
yeah guess it depends on the cost hades only has levels and i played that to death
i just started d2r and i ve been loving it but the combat leaves so much to be desired which i m hoping ravenswatch will help with should hold me off until d4
i m sort of mixed with early access i feel that it can be good for smaller indie developers to get enough funding so their ideas can become reality however most people using stuff like patreon kickstarters subscribestars and ko fis just take advantage of people and use early access gaming to milk money from so many people lot of games these days i ve only been able to play thanks to ea gaming
not every ea game is bad or lacks content it s just the fact that most devs abuse it or use it as a source of income to even finish their game in the first place many of them still don t though there are many great games from the top of my head ea games that i own farthest frontiers last epoch wartales songs of conquest all of them can provide a lot of hours and have decent content already and are pretty polished so basically there s early access and early access you just have to read the reviews and opinions about a certain title before buying it s also good to do some research about the company behind a game
i ll wait and look at reviews after a few hours i m assuming some people will leave a negative review after beating the one level times but either way we ll quickly see how much content is in there
the combat is definitely a weak point mechanical stiff i bet ravenswatch will be a lot of fun
yo hit me up
what for
i will say being able to teleport directly to friends who are running a dungeon would be nice maybe having you appear at the entrance rather than having to slog through the map to get to them first but how much of an issue would that be for world events bosses and such
i never thought about it getting so much use i liked customising mine but largely played solo occasionally with people i knew but then were in voice chat or sometimes in silent split bounty runs so basically the only times the banner got dropped is when i fat fingered a key haha
full on shards at the end of a rift don t upgrade your gems they can t close the rift
if i had a penny for every time i accidentally clicked on a teammate s banner in town trying to a pick up cache contents i stupidly dropped too close to the wp b turn in the bounty quest to the npc that is too close to the wp c trying to use my own banner to tp but since i changed it for the 419th time that morning i mistook someone else s for mine love banners in every way but their actual application
yeah locking the only way to teleport to party members behind going to the act s capital and going through their portal is weird to me we should be able to by clicking on their portrait or a party menu
rift not greater rift
agree one of the things that d3 really nailed and sucks to see them taking a large step backwards
my bad in that case 30s has always been plenty of time for me
it s too hard to tell now before we know what things are like at end game usually damage is worth less than percent damage but if it s added before the multiplicative increases than it s worth more but the flat damage could be so low at end game it s outpaced anyways it s just way too hard to say now without looking at all the datamined and leaked stuff in general though you have to look for synergies things that either work together or benefit multiple things there s a ton of this with fortify boosting damage on the barbarian and druid werebear so you can essentially use it twice once for defense once for offense

if i press button and then things go boom then it s fine if i have to press said button more than times and things don t go boom then i press button so hopefully things can go boom

affixes on the items and affixes on the paragon board including the stats are all funnel to the same thing overall like the one you replied to it was not rocket science here if you played a cold sorc mainly you stack all the int willpower dmg to freeze enemies dmg to chill enemies and dmg to crowd controlled enemies whichever you can get overall from the gears and from your path in the paragon boards there are board that will be your priority being the one that enhance your cold dmg dmg to chill freeze and the board that enhance your dmg to crowd controlled enemies
nice minutes after i get home from work on thursday night will probably be a mess at the start but can t wait

sweet i ll be wfh on friday
thats because i believe they use the greenwich mean time for launch so whatever place you re in when it s greenwich mean time you can play for me it s hour later so am on the 2nd its fine imo
time to use some of that unlimited sick time that friday i m already feeling some symptoms coming on
well its still technically the same time as the rest
good news and possibly a change after the beta since it seems by day they were able to compensate and queues weren t terrible or broken that way by the weekend people could play hopefully i am still going to try and play thursday night sucks because i will be too busy to play much that weekend aside from sunday night and then i am going on a family vacation the following weekend oh well these games don t really have a reason to rush especially since trade is basically non existent
ugh i have taylor swift tickets on friday wtf blizzard
pst eastern
the actual playable release will be about a week later once the servers are working as intended d

4pm what timezone someone help thx
glad i spent that extra money let s gooooo

i m actually mad because now i need to use another day of vacation i ll be a monkeys uncle if i let others get ahead of me while i m working that s bullshit
fingers crossed the weather is trash that weekend as well
we were gonna do dad s wake service that day but you know what fuck it
game comes out on my birthday so pretty much the greatest present a man could ask for
damn i told my job i needed the 2nd 6th off lol
mike ybarra doesn t know that each continent has more than one time zone
anyone else a irresponsible adult and are taking the week off work to play i hope its not just me
taking a week vacation starting on june 4th to june 10th hopefully giving the game a couple days to get stable will do the trick can t wait
have to work that friday and saturday but each i finish early because my work starts early in the morning but the next days after that i took off to play d4 like crazy
sa it ll also be but about hours later p
just put in for the 7th off it ll be tough being at work that friday itching to play more but i figure it d be smarter to give it a few days for the servers to catch up
dude there won t be another diablo you know what to do
diablo wedding party
mine anniversary is june 2nd i m still trying to strategize this out lol
groom not found
remember that diablo won t divorce from you because you didn t pay attention to it just saying
cancel it you dpont love her
yo congratulations
better make some calls
this is what i was looking for thanks
pdt as in daylight savings google cal mixes up with pst
nah i got kicked plenty of times maybe it was just a long counter
work from hell
exactly most people are stupid regardless of the time different zones the game releases the sane time for everyone in the world lol
scalp tickets at ridiculous prices stay home and play d4 sounds like a double win to me
have fun i went with my gf and our best friend and it was amazing
tay tay show is amazing worth missing a day if you ask me
i didn t really have much issues with either beta i had an hour login queue the first day which didn t really bother me and one dc with a min queue after the other days there were no issues the second weekend i play the first day hours straight with no problem and no problems the other days
this comment is dumb early access worked for me after i got out of work after it released in the morning same day be salty for not pre ordering i guess
yup that s why it s dumb to preorder
nah early access beta wasn t too bad but i have no done blt blizzard will find a way to make us go really
true but it includes other things that some people would pay for anyways like the battle pass so who cares
i look u i gf huh i man in minh
i don t understand what s the issue
depends on which part of canada you re in what s your timezone
this is wrong unfortunately release is simultaneous everywhere so your us launch link is the only correct and required one confirmed in a reply to this tweet https://twitter.com/tekox/status/1643628239204634624](https://twitter.com/tekox/status/1643628239204634624) only the us time was in pdt i think you converted them all from pdt us 4pm pdt is midnight london time and 8am in korea so the launch times mentioned by ybarra for europe and asia times are simply time zone conversions from the us release
i m so envious of people who can take off for a video game i d come back to a mountainload of unanswered emails and work that would make the pto feel it was not worth it lol
i m planning on taking june 3rd through june 12th off but i m waiting until may to put in for the time off in case there s a last minute delay having weeks of vacation plus personal holidays is nice
there can t be more people playing it on the early release compared to the free open beta right like i ll expect queues but i m fine waiting an hour
honestly i think think those days will be worse as i m sure the vast majority of players didn t fork out the extra for ea
diablo lasts forever marriage might not priorities
this is the way
shit i have no way out i m still shocked that out of all the fucking dates in the calendar it had to be june 1st
but it might take your decked out hardcore character
nope you crashed or d c ed can confirm no log out time wife connected friday evening and stayed logged in all weekend
gif giphy a0lgc1jvbfs4o downsized
and with all the money they made from scalping the tix they ll be able to afford all the cool looking skins in game
i suppose that s true i care less about cosmetics so it s not really important to me for younger gamers though i know cosmetics are really a huge part of gaming for them i just grew up with games having everything included but all companies became cheap and need a way to milk money from the consumers
people don t understand time zones is the problem
atlantic
thanks that makes a lot more sense removed and corrected
don t worry most of them are really just taking time off to complain about how they took time off but the game doesn t work
you get time off
i actually might be accepting a job soon that makes my plans null funnily enough great opportunity but not sure i feel like stepping out of just being another cog in the it machine we ll see
same boat and i still take some days off for d4 release it s rather just getting over yourself and doing the extra work due to free days off
is it your company if not just work at the same pace you always do its not your fault you have backlog i had the same issue in the past but fuck it if they don t want backlog they can just fix a backup ill work at the same tempo i ll always do even if it takes a week or to get up to date
i just got lucky with a week of vacation but i aint complaining
sometimes you got to do it for yourself work is always going to be there man
man i had a job like that once the last days of my vacation felt awful cause i knew i was about to walk into a shit show sorry buddy
my wife s cousin is getting married tuesday may 30th so we are flying cross country east coast to west coast and flying home overnight wednesday to thursday so i unironically had already taken this week off so i just extended my vacation by a week but i am not looking forward to the pile of emails and calls and questions to catch up on after
with covid came wfh ended up saving so much time off i need to burn it before i lose it but i m going to anticipate emails at least that i need to sort through when i get back
oh i d actually probably bet on there being more well maybe not early release not sure how many people want to pay extra to play a little early but i wouldn t be surprised if there was more but they cut queues down from like hours to minutes in just a few hours in the beta they ll probably figure it out
the majority of ppl that i personally know that have pre ordered but didn t touch the beta they wanted to save everything for release
error
comically bad timing for sure anyways congratulations to you and your bride groom to be

same easiest way to beat the queue was to stay in
ikr
adt timezone early access launch 1st june pm standard launch 5th june pm hope this helps edit correction based on clarification from mike on us launch date and time
i m so glad i like the basic murder hobo look in games i ve saved hundreds thanks to my inferior fashion semse
meh i ve played fortnite apex legends and more if i want a skin and can afford it cool far more likely i just enjoy whatever i get through playing the game and completing battle passes i reserve a right to give extra consideration for tasteful halloween and christmas skins yes yes i m part of the problem boo hiss the line to throw rotten vegetables forms to the left it s not an absolute or anything but i do enjoy a good seasonal thematic skin if whales wanna whale go for it i m under no obligation to front them cash just because it exists
they are positioning the battle pass to be the most cost effective way to acquire cosmetics it will be interesting to see how much premium currency they include in it
i think standard is around for mounts cosmetic sets so i guess that s what we should expect i would be equally surprised with prices as low as and as expensive as
i can see skins being anywhere from average which will suck i got that rude awakening playing lost ark so it will be no surprise for me if they do appear to be this expensive we already paid at least but being hopeful of them being cheaper doesn t exist in the blizzard name
for a skin pass some whales will buy it but i never will
depending on item is pretty standard
people getting mad at monetization that doesn t directly influence player power aka pay win baffles me why the hell wouldn t you want the company to make so they have more incentive to keep pushing out additional content expansions at the end of the day a game company isn t a charity that pushes out content for free for the enjoyment of broke neckbeards they answer to investors owners every quarter as to why how when the profits are coming in bunch of mouth breathing basement dwellers imo
i wouldn t be surprised if they are more expensive than that
my best random guess weapon skins armor skins each for an armor set mount skins
i m fine with it as long as it s just cosmetics they seem to have done a good job with the looks of standard items anyway i think it s a good balance between getting an active source of income to justify having long term dedicated development resources put into the game and becoming p2w
i hope they are a million dollars
i don t think i ll be participating too much i think people should tinker around with looks granted by salvaging legendary items as they are often pretty fucking dope they might save themselves some money it s really a pretty subjective thing so i wish people gl
it doesnt really matter much to me personally as i dont intend on buying anything aside from the game if theres earnable coin in the pass ill grab some transmog if nothing then i get nothing d
idc never buy cosmetics in any game so they can price it however stupid they want
the cosmetics can cost bucks if that means there will be more quality content and gameplay coming in which it otherwise wouldn t
can someone please explain to me why anyone would pay for cosmetic armor i honestly don t get it some of the in game free armor looks good enough to me
they can be even a piece virtual fashion is not my thing so doesn t matter if they or i wouldn t buy any anyways
with the option to transmog the gear i don t really see myself grabbing anything beyond what s free
as someone who has paid lots of cash to ffxiv store for outfits emotes and some dyes when i was in a hurry meh if i like a look i ll get it
bro i used to play hots where blizzard charged up to for a color variation of a skin you might already own i m not shocked at any of their pricing
wel its a micro transaction if you was a millionaire so prob to bucks for season pass tiers of the same cosmetics bucks bucks bucks skill skins ranging from to bucks and prob a doller kinda meh but cosmetic skin pack with at least half decant skin in it while the rest is that vermin tide levels of mediocracy ofc and than we d prob also have the real part of the shop that only a normal person would use the seasonal dicount rotating fear of missing out store page that cycles through a bunch of skins for you to buy
i don t see a problem with expensive skins you ll get cosmetics from battle pass which you can view as an optional subscription but it will likely be seasonal whales can dump money into the game buying every single item and ensuring the game is supported while you can buy what you like and ignore what you don t
haha same i generally don t care what costume i m wearing i m sure i ll end up buying one and wearing it for years
deleted
highly doubt it ll be a one and done like fortnite where you ll get enough to buy the battle pass from the battle pass
deleted
most certainly will be i m sure there will be a few every couple months for there will be some shitty cosmetic gloves for and that s all reddit will talk about rather than actual gameplay
paid track will be cosmetic exclusive but according to the interview yesterday the free track will have some form of power in it although this could just be referring to the xp boosts they mentioned were in it months ago
think of it like accesory packs for dolls if you dont play with the dolls the cost seems ridiculous but if its accessories for your favorite doll you reeeeeally want it
it was not
useless the friends list is just as good likely to change later though shelly said yesterday they re looking at adding clan features later
not that i saw but i did make a clan during the beta and it was super cool to play around with i don t know if there will be anything specific outside the potential of perhaps dungeon queues or world boss queues i didn t see any way to trade store items or gold in the clan but then again we might not have seen everything during the beta
clans voice message chat that s all for now
you don t get random people spam inviting you to their clan i hope blizz puts in a way to block group invites from randos as well if it was in the settings i missed it
not at the moment clan won t have any benefits or features at launch other than being easier to group up
slappin kids in pvp
you re a masochist who likes absorbing other people s drama that they bring to the guild s this game is like solo some encounters and dungeons will be faster if you group but it s designed to be played by us misanthropic introverts who tired of years of mmos
i mean for pvp farming a clan would be helpfull
mental exp boost if you find guild named funny way
benefits yikes playing with people annoying
clans make it so you don t have to do pick up groups for raids dungeons and can implement a dkp or loot council system it s highly recommended for any mmo to join a stable clan
i couldn t get cross platform friend invites to work during open beta but making a clan got around that there s that at least
just made it easier to group up especially when local was on the fritz
you want to subject yourself to putting some stupid abbreviation in your name so you can team up with kyler and tyler
i m fine with there not being much of a benefit to start and eventually having some challenges achievements cosmetics or whatever associated with them down the line if that s what they end up doing as it s a fairly obvious design space to work within i ll likely just keep it to people i personally know and their friends still a diverse mix of folks but i refuse to just recruit xxxweedlordvegeta420xxx or whatever for arbitrary reasons which is why i hope that whatever they design for clans that it scales to reflect the clan s size within a margin of error so that smaller groups of or whatever aren t punished too badly for not capping out membership and having to track contributions and crap
clans are cool with wpvp just because in wow for example you d have anti gank clans that would just sit in gen chat waiting to gank griefers in low level zones that probs won t work in d4 since pvp zones are contained but im sure there may be some faction things added at a later time and incentive to pvepvp with clans soon enough
biggest benefit of joining a guild is d r a m a
made it easier to find my friends when playing during beta couldn t port to them using travel to player option but when we joined a clan we could use that travel to player without problem
as of now the only thing is grouped play with added exp bonus and that sweet sense of belonging
stash pls i want to put in great gear for my friends find a to whirlwind but i don t need it toss in the guild stash for a buddy
there are no raids or anything needed for group content
are these confirmed features or just assumptions of yours
good thing this is an arpg not an mmo it s limited to people per map i d hardly call that massively multiplayer
no 1070ti is showing its age you could run max settings but i doubt you ll get 60fps especially on an ultra wide
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fshyae20mo this might give you an idea how it ll run
with dlss sure native iffy
no due to vram limitations textures on medium maybe
looked it up short answer yes 1440p is very doable max settings will depend on the game
whit a 5800x3d processor and the rx 6800xt i can finally play on a normal 2k 144hz screen in max settings
you want to buy an ultrawide but not the hardware to support it you won t be getting the most out of your purchase that s for sure
i had major stutter on medium settings with my non ti
i ran a 3440x1440 with a 1070ti years ago you re better off upgrading your gpu and then going ultrawide imo i played everything on low med for fps might be worse now though
60fps would be fine for me i just want to play 1440p on max or nearly max but i not quiet sure about my setup for d4
thanks for the great link
native i believe dlss is only supported from the rtx generation onwards
yeah
i have neither said nor excluded that
my and 8700k stayed around 130fps the majority of the time there will almost certainly be more optimization before launch so who knows but based on beta you might need to drop a few settings to stay at
i just saw that this is from a regular non ti so your system should be even faster
oh shit you re right i forgot it was only for the series and newer i think you re asking a lot from a 1080ti to be maxed at and get 60fps although max for you would not include ray tracing
thats right
1070ti not 1080ti
we are fine majority of us that don t comment so much are fine with the game and looking forward to it come june
honestly i fail to see the huge toxicity in this sub and seem to only notice every 2nd post like this that complains about the haters may you point me to those toxic threads
nah it ll be just fine even with the people who are here to rain on others parades
most people criticizing the game are doing so hoping to be heard in some way so the game will get better they actually have a point to them posts like this have no point and have you considered that maybe you are the toxic one
lucky for most of us d2 wasn t as popular as d3 so most aren t toxic
just downvote them and move on
no the reddit community always kills itself big difference this is hardly the majority of the playerbase on here
this community is a drop in the bucket of the entire player base i assure you it will have no impact
for some people criticism toxicity op seems to be one of them the diablo subs are very mannered and nontoxic when compared to other subs community is absolutely fine
agreed i get frustrated with the dumb posts too but the game is too good op keep in mind reddit is a very small of players most think cool that was an awesome beta i got a puppy and momentum is gathering i d be surprised if it doesn t do another million copies at launch for 5m it will be a hit it will have tons of content and you ll be pleased
also isn t reddit like 20th of the community that we saw in the closed beta alone
people love to complain change my mind
i enjoyed d2 more than liking it being from a different game doesn t excuse poor behavior
i m not doubting it just tired of everyone bashing every game that releases
that s probably an extremely generous fraction
i enjoyed d2 more than i enjoyed d2 at release more than i enjoyed d3 at release but if i was going to play one of them today it would almost certainly be d3 as good as d2 was the gameplay even in d2r is dated and it shows it may still play well to others but to me the gameplay kills the experience for me today compared to more modern games
we all are
okay i am seeing two opposite threads right next to each other one says the video is bad one says is good i guess i have to go watch it myself
did you play the closed a few months back or the most recent one
the video is bad it s a diverse cast of people who i have trouble believing even play diablo explaining in the most generic way why the end game exists they don t use established gamer language or even come across as particularly informed or excited if you like dungeons get ready there are dungeons if you like wandering around the map get ready you can wander uhh do you mean exploration i don t think anyone actually likes wandering around a map yes yes that we have exploration could you go into more detail about any of those systems no alright then
dex going into dex into dex sure didn t make me feel good
just hope blizzard does not listen to the haters i love whenever this line gets thrown around yeah lets hope blizzard doesn t ever listen to criticism just passes anything negative off as the haters lol such a moronic take
this thread is fake af there s chance anyone who reads diablo reddit threads actually learned a single thing from that marketing video
disclaimer this was posted by a blizzard marketing account lol no cap though this reads like major copium
meh honestly the endless paragon leveling is what kept me on d3 for so long always wanting to get stronger it being capped means i ll be stuck with an even more gear grind but i am still excited about it
paid thread an other brilliant pr move by blizzard
the video was awful because it didn t go into depth about paragon at all didn t even show how glyphs paragon work and how leveling up glyphs boosts paragon skills they just showed stat nodes and now everyone thinks all paragon is stats they actually made it worse because they wanted to make a marketing video and not in depth endgame gameplay video that video just made paragon look awful and not what it actually is which is much better than just stat nodes
the video told us nothing new in terms of content or systems no details provided for stuff we already knew about no good marketing video
personally think it was a disappointment and end game seems like it s going to be a snooze fest after a short period of time
a big win it was awful there is nothing there at all bounties are back with the tree pvp will just be people working in groups farming all day for rng loot paragon system is garbage state increase with the other being nothing special more than buffing x builds affix run dungeons ext so if you look at the beta it s a perfect example of the type of end game we re gonna have bar the paragon board the gameplay loop with be old so fast the games fun i m not denying that but its going to get old fast with such shallow end game
what do you mean by listening to the haters i mean do you see people that complain as haters cause if that s the case it has nonsense
this dude works for blizzard kkkkk no way this is real
i m with you for the most part except where you said getting loot was not the main focus i understand your sentiment of your first diablo game was d1 or d3 but in my opinion d2 was all about the loot since the end game was mostly about chasing your grail items
annoyed the video wasn t linked so here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agdizgfd5kq
we learned nothing new it was fucking trash
lol these threads are hilarious op sounds like a blizzard employee
ah astroturfed shill thread that explains it
it was a shallow marketing video made for dads
the redhead said at around the mark that codex of power dungeons are endgame content that seems insanely out of touch we will farm them in the very beginning to get quick but min rolled aspects
it was for me it confirmed that cancelling my pre order was the right call
dex dex dex
during the end game beta i chose to focus on the tree of whispers rewards that was a great way to target your specific legendary unique needs i never got tired of farming those all over the world
overall big win just hope blizzard does not listen to the haters more power to you but all these things are making me want to buy it less and less player power cap open world pvp is this an mmorpg since when is the diablo franchise mmorpgs well i guess since now
just really hope they build in some and pvp elements the pvp piece of di is just like a shitty moba if that s what i wanted i d just play lol
nahhhhh this is astroturfing to the max lmfao
i wasn t a fan of what they showed of the paragon was just this or that nothing actually changes the skills there s barely any skill variations in the game i feel like the lvl characters in beta will be really no different in the build at max lvl
diablo no power cap is idiotic and trash the people who liked that must have been people with zero personality in real life its literally stupid and pointless and there s nothing to use the excess power on people who like greater rifts have a correlation with having started playing video games after they don t know what real endgame is they think everything either looks like wow or call of duty d2 was about super rare drops and trading which make the social aspect fun also the people calling it an mmo are right as it should be no one asked for man raids but the game should be social only losers don t want this if you like endless rifts and don t wanna play video games with other human beings you might be a robot lol
the video had zero substance
you must be joking hahahaahaah
it was minutes of info we already knew brother there was nothing new discussed lol
i gotta agree it s totally a win it showed me that it s not worthy
i don t know how you came to this conclusion after watching the video how they showcased paragon was so awful it has more interesting nodes than just 5s and the rest was marketing crap i am honestly not expecting endgame to be very good at launch but i think they actually made it look worse than it is
this video doesn t show everything the endgame is great i played from closed alpha all the way through i thought it was way more fun then diablo i don t know how people can have so many negative comments from such a short part of the video on the paragon tree it was showed for maybe seconds
the last think i wanted to see was pvp thankful it s optional
pvp appears to be cosmetic rewards only the comment in the video appears out of place or disingenuous i hope i am wrong and i hope we see a deeper dive into these things before launch
really good video no idea why some hardcore fans have to shit on everything blizzard d4 team releases
i will probably sink a lot hours into d4 especially if the seasons are well made but nothing of this video is catching me i mean i preordered anyways so who cares i m just happy they continue d3 seasons
i think the paragon board really looks bare minimum effort here and their sockel and glyph i mean if they would learn from poe they literally has skill trees one for the char and lets call it paragon board with options to enhance your time in poe so many fucking impaktfull options maybe they had no time to really work on that paragon board and we will c something inovative in the future aka seasons
havent seen the vid so you can have your opinion but i will say diablo has not always been about exploring and killing monsters loot is not the main focus exploring and adventure is great and amazing the first time you go through each diablo game but after that of the the player s focus has always been about looting killing monsters was just the pathway to do it we didnt do a million cow levels baal runs in d2 bc it was full of adventure it was about finding the best loot in d3 adventure mode was ironically created to avoid the adventure grinding loot became the main and only objective of the whole game
all this information was available prior to this video but glad you find it informative
glad you enjoyed it i personally hate these marketing videos and would have appreciated a little more insight into the details of the paragon system what they showed now about this system clicking some str and dex is not really showcasing what they are praising in this segment
me after seeing this video like i m still waiting for them to reveal the real endgame ain t no way this is it
everything in the video made me even more hyped who doesn t like a tree giving you quests
agreed especially about capping paragon nowadays in d3 you have bot accounts with 10k paragon it s not funny capping it makes sense especially when seasons are a thing and the whole game works as live service this way you will anyway come back to it with some actual content to do instead of just grinding endless paragon d x200b i m so looking forward to it
pvp on diablo i guess you didn t play d3 pvp
loot has always been the main focus wth lol
i just want nephalem rifts back from d3
let s be honest pvp is gonna be an absolute shitshow it s inevitable in a game like this it will lead to broken meta builds which means they need to nerf them which means pve players will get mad if it affects their builds too i ve seen to many games where devs don t buff nerf separately
the end game isn t the problem the video was a whole nothing burger everything they talked about we mostly already know there s suppose to be a developer live stream this month at some point and hopefully a handful for more videos that will shed more light
u realamarantine pvp mentioned as an endgame viable activity is too good to be true i really hope its as good or almost as good as grinding dungeons fields of hatred openworld pvp is a complete disaster in d4 and will be for a long time ask blizzard to give players a simple duel feature where you can challenge other players any time anywhere this way players can set their own controlled standards too bad they ll only start asking for it once the game launches and they wont have the epic pvp fights they thought they were going to have
barely any new information was revealed in the new video i m not sure what the big win is
you mention a video but where is this video
yea its crazy i can t wait to spend the end game playing through the same dungeons with slightly more enemies in them just to get strength from my paragon board very revolutionary blizzard
diablo sucks
we will see on release ppl complain about a video cmon fam
you had concerns about the end of a game that wasn t released y all are so fucking weird and spoiled
deleted
deleted
what video
please remember pre ros diablo paragon was capped at
link to video
what video
if they don t allow one shot builds in pvp im in and recommend to all my friends to farm in that area
just hope its not needlessly grindy oh nice hit next level perk walk speed
looking at all the comments people don t quite understand that the video is not for anyone who is on reddit you might think you actually are a big deal but you re not the game is slated to sell million copies this year alone even if the entire diablo sub decides to refund the game you are of that number there a millions of people not actually actively looking for information and the video is just going to incite a cool from them since they dropped on the game which to them is a sliver of their disposable income they aren t thinking maybe i should refund this game the cost of the game is literally nothing to them in fact this video might actually reach incrementally more people who will decide to buy the game unpopular opinion if refunding the game ever crossed your mind you are not their target audience and they aren t interested in your opinions and that s just the truth social sentiment will never be a stronger indicator than actual sales because this is a business
if you mean the min video they made gunna have to disagree
one of my favourite affixes is when a portal opens and more monsters come out holy crap that sounds like bland and meaningless so instead of monsters running at you off screen they run at you from a portal and tha ts a favourite affix
i like loot piata
i ll try to be optimistic and say that the video looked nice i m hoping the game releases as a good foundation that can be utilized to add some much needed depth to the systems and mechanics they ve set out already
we re talking about the minute video
one of my favourite affixes is when a portal opens and more monsters come out holy crap that sounds like bland and meaningless so instead of monsters running at you off screen they run at you from a portal and tha ts a favourite affix
i know i m minority here but it s hard for me to care about an end game in a game where reset happens every months hit that end game a few weeks in and if anything like poe by the time you hit a stride with your character everyone is already discussing the next season reveal and basically moving on poe gave me this seasonal reset formula burnout
not having ladder pvp with at least like 2v2 or 3v3 death match up will be a huge miss
this isn t true at all
the blizz cucks will defend every shitty decision made with this game it would be hilarious if it weren t so goddamned sad
i wouldnt be excited for pvp just look how it was in d3
as everything is now i do enjoy the game that being said the only thing i ve been left wanting is more classes i know probably more will come with dlc bit i was hoping for more base classes then add even more with dlc but i was having fun and look forward to grinding out some characters
video aside i hope they will not timegate content like you can do bounties a day or you only get loot from dungeons etc them going the mmo route leaves a bit of a sour taste especially cause they ignore this topic non stoo
bro getting loot is a part of it not the main focus something is really wrong i probably got too obsessed with d2 but for more the game is just about loot yeah definitely enjoy the story on the first play through but then is farm farm farm end gear and nothing else matters
love the video seems like we get to murder the lessers again paragon not so much turned off by the mainstat shit but i m not refunding i m gonna push through it
so which end game activity did you like most bounties at the tree of whispers dungeons you have to get a key and ride to terror zones pvp
it s strange how obvious is to so many people that we should restrict player potential in a virtual world that has no consequences on our lives but it is somehow inconceivable to restrict corporate potential in the real world where infinite growth requires the decimation of the environment and the middle class instead of just some more time nah that infinity is good and inspiring
fun fact tyrael from d3 changed his gender to whispering tree place where u run to turn in completed stuff for endgame rewards
sorry but what video
video infomation is to vague have to wait to see the actual gameplay turns out
can someone share the video no idea what op is talking about been unplugged since a tornado took out my house last week
my only thing i gripe about is that the npc talk from what i remember is all the same rather then be based around your character here we are killing lilith her son is rathma you play as a necro supposedly people are afraid of you and kind of shun your ways yet here everyone is like oh hey thanks for stopping by come sit by the fire even d2 had some change in script based off of your selection i kinda hope this changes further in iunno just thought that would be unique
really i thought video didnt bring anything new kinda we knew everything about what was showed
the copium
always form your own opinion don t let others tell you what you should or shouldn t like
it does seem awfully cranky around here today must be a symptom of d4 withdrawal
they ve just leaned heavily into their chosen audience if you re a mega sweat lord the game looks like a complete joke if you re a casual dad console gamer then it looks like fun
gif giphy hqrgg6ks7nkyy downsized how was it
i think it just depends how hardcore and knowledgeable the viewer is the more hardcore and informed you already are the more likely you are to dislike the video it s clearly made for masses and it i think it does exactly what it s supposed to appeal to casuals and people who aren t already invested in diablo franchise there s no reason to advertise the game for those who have already bought the game afterall
i wouldn t say the video was bad but it was painfully light on details and depth the features sound alright but there is almost no way to form a real opinion based on the information provided
i personally wasn t a fan and i ll happily share why below it felt painfully scripted i don t think anything they uttered was in their own words and it was super awkward to me they even shared incorrect information one of them while discussing the codex talked about how clearing a dungeon had a chance to unlock a codex aspect that s definitely not how it works most of this information has been easily available for the last few months even directly from the devs so to release this as some sort of new drop is silly unless it s consumed only by players who are just looking at this game post beta definitely possible but a wasted effort imo considering how much this same info is plastered on every content creator s channel i was hoping to get some in depth information and i ll keep my hopes up for april edit corrected date
is doomer anti blizz take and then there is this one
yes i plan to just try to enjoy the story and take it easy probably will be a little more driven when season starts
that s my plan as well just dive in completely blind once i m done and season is around the corner i start looking up lvling guides and whatnot and i will definitely use season to start a new class instead of making the same one
content creators desperately trying to ride the hype wave and make money couldn t care less about the optimal way to play just want to have fun with the game not working down a checklist
picking a class because it makes more numbers appear on the screen is such a shitty way to experience this and really spoils the experience i am absolutely picking druid because imo it s the coolest class to me i couldn t give a skeleton s pelvis if necromancers are more op literally who cares i want to immerse myself in the game and enjoy it instead of sweating over min max all the classes will be tough by end game and it isn t competitive either speedrunning your way to level in the first few days congrats you ve just forcibly condensed the joy you could ve had into a much smaller period but gamers will be gamers i guess edit getting some angry gamers responding so i ll add this to clarify that i m not trying to make you play it my way i just want you and everyone to enjoy the experience at a reasonable pace instead of bumrushing straight to and then inevitably complaining it was over too soon or there s not enough end game content it s like bumrushing your way through a star restaurant experience because i want dessert faster
yeah buddy you are not alone i have played both beta s and i have learnt enough to have a clue what my experience would be minus the fact we had boosted legendary drops in beta so it won t be as easy on live however you won t need any guides for a diablo game something blizzard has always been good at delivering arpg s that are fun to play and easy to understand this won t be like path of exile where you can t even clear campaign if you never touched any info guide before playing
i m completely with you levelling as fast and efficiently as possible has never been particularly enjoyable for me there will always be many people going faster and who can dedicate more time to no lifing the game i cant compete with them also i play games like diablo to relax the idea that the efficiency of every minute counting is the opposite of that to me that first play through is for the story learning the game yourself getting your build wrong this last one is a big part of the fun for me exploring parts of the game certain quirky builds and skills that you simply never use otherwise but they work ok at early game that s really the only time to try these builds working out how to go from a weaker build to a stronger build yourself and feeling the increase in power is perhaps more satisfying than picking up new loot to get a power boost guide followers and speed levellers miss out on this also i think i get a lot more value out of the game this way however long it takes someone to uber efficiently rush through to max level i might only be halfway there after the same hours invested they like the feeling of being ahead of the pack i like the feeling of being miles away from being bored of the game
im rolling druid thats how much you know i dont give a fuck about metas
i will be waiting awhile for day one issues to be fixed also trying to avoid story spoilers i don t care about meta builds and will theory craft my own skill layouts based on my experience based in playing d for something years and d3 ros since launch
yes this is the reason i love diablo i dont have to follow a guide to not mess up my character
i ve already theorycrafted my own build that i don t see anywhere else and i plan on running it from the jump my interest in these games comes from making my own invention work and i tend to do the same here
this is how i m playing d4 this june and after no guides and very minimal influence from streamers or game guides i did this on beta and i enjoyed it more when i play a game and follow a build guild or something
i m going to do it like i ve done diablo learn things on my own and have fun
really nice to see so many out there who want to play the game for enjoyment at their own pace way back in the day i was definitely someone who was all about endgame maximizing these days i find a lot more enjoyment making my own way through games and finding play styles that work for me play what s fun to you
tbh i hate that this is the byproduct of the current fast all consuming life we live back then when it was harder to get these type of info it was actually cool to meet other ppl with strange builds in games like wow for example nowadays a game have not even released and there are multiple min max speedrun build videos it just generates the same feeling as fomo i admit i am guilty that i have the tendency to casually look these up but for diablo i will try to skip and make my own builds when i have mostly seen everything or struggling hard will revise this
streamers and such ruins these type of games minutes to max level guides
when i play poe i feel that i cant play or enjoy the game without a guide diablo will be played without any guide whatsoever and i fuckibg look forward to it
absolutely love this post and what everyone s saying i ve been overwhelmed and feeling a weird guilt since playing the beta that i ve done something wrong when in reality i just need to play the game and have fun and do my own thing love this outlook and positivity here
definitely i always do my own thing for the first playthrough min maxing s tier builds is for later
i ve been avoiding maps and guides to do exactly this when seasonal comes out i ll have a look and see what can be done but for the first run through the story i m definitely just doing my thing the guides are incredible but it s like following a walk through for an old rpg it sucks the creativity and exploration out of the game a bit
after years of playing poe i will enjoy blind playthrough of d4 very much
yeah plan to play with legendaries found shopping the build will be fun to experiment for sure
only way to play games are only new once just enjoy it
i m hoping to recreate the necro minion build i was slaying with in the beta original didn t even use corpse explosion build guides are neat and all but i want to take my time and enjoy the game doubt we re getting diablo for a while so what s the rush
my 4week vacation starts may 26th anyway im gonna chill through the story shortly after release i dont want to waste time in que or in maintenance or whatever its gonna be a sweet hours
it won t be fully new the early access players will have done last minute qa for us d
i m with you speed running shit just makes it end faster
yes learn by doing enjoy the campaign experiment
i hate theorycrafting in general for games like poe i find it necessary to follow a guide due to the sheer amount of systems and choices but i feel that a non hc blind playthrough is going to be the best way for me to get into the game
this isn t poe you should watch the cutscenes and enjoy the game
i miss the first few weeks months and even years of d2 when absolutely no one knew shit about fuck even the official strategy guide was really hot garbage i haven t seen any of the guides you re talking about but i ll be keeping it that way as i try to recreate the golden times of wandering around aimlessly and wasting my time on builds that are broken
yes and in hardcore
im and wont open internet im sub optimal but my game will last will optimize after carac at max level
yeah this is me and i also want to play druid for no other reason than it appeals the most to me that said gaming as a whole has become very much a look up everything rush to the end community because of that people who want to enjoy the game blind and be surprised are the ones to get punished the most elden ring was very much this way and there are videos breaking down steam achievements and how many streamers played the top builds it confirmed that the majority of the community do not play blind and do play the meta that s cool with me except when the devs start nerfing the piss out of everything and tweaking boss fights then because you didn t rush through the game with a meta build abusing every system you are now punished same with mmos and card games did you abuse the meta and play fotm here are your free refunds respecs and items for the stuff we had to fix so over time i ve come to the conclusion that there are only advantages in playing the meta and blowing through content most games are being balanced around people looking everything up these days and you are simply being punished if you don t
this is the way so many people dont realize you only get to do a blind playthrough once you will never have another chance of playing the game for the first time so you should make the most of it you will have plenty of time later to figure the game out and read guides and do your meta builds dont ruin your first playthrough with that mentality ive also never played a game that became more fun after reaching the endgame which puts even more weight into what im saying every single game is at its most fun when everything is new and exciting and you dont know whats coming next after you reach endgame it just becomes a grind of repetitive content while you try to get better loot and achieve bigger numbers the fun levels just keep going downhill from there
what you described is precisely how i plan to tackle the game i platinums diablo on ps4 before i ever bothered to look at a guide i intended to do something similar for d4 i also intend to take my time on the first play through to really absorb the story and lore i don t intend to rush to the end game
yep me and my brothers teaming up to do the the game for a whole week straight taking the wife on holiday the week before as she understands the gaming no life every once in a while drafted in the mother to keep her occupied while i achieve nothing in the real world for days we will all go social media silent for that week too so i don t have to see a thousand top ten tips for beginners tip level up brings us back to baldurs gate and champions of norrath days before content creators
reading what is the best class and what is the best build is the most anti rpg and anti real gamer i can think off let me get everything chewed for me so i just need to copy like wtf the whole purpose of these games is build crafting and playing around till you find what you like best
most gamers who will play d4 will never of heard of this community will never look up a build guide or care about the meta game you are existing in an echo chamber
yep guides suck all the fun out
yea i dont understand people either i hear about fastest leveling route in beta and best skill tree in beta left and right whats wrong with people why not just enjoy and discover on your own for the first time why do people always want to be the fastest or use the best skill even if the game is not out yet just play the game for fun and dont look at other people sometimes i wish their was no leader board or competition at all and nowbody would know where other people stands just to increase the fun for people who think they must play the best class or what ever i feel so bad for them that they cant enjoy the game because they need to play the best class and best skill and fastes lvleling route and best way to farm items
yes that will be my approach as well
that s how i play i don t judge people who are all about numbers or speeding through content if it makes them happy and they find it fun good for them but i just don t see a point if i do it myself i want to explore everything i can try different things see how the story plays out check out scenery etc and i was never able to play a class just because it s meta in any game i m sticking with what i like even if it s on life support lol also i avoid any guides or spoilers for diablo like they spread plague
it ssems like any game with a character builder elden ring cyber punk outriders the now defunct avengers game hogwarts legacy and soon diablo there is almost a self impossed pressure to chase the best or optimal build out there i do miss the days of gaming where you just play a game and enjoy it during the beta i rolled a necromancer and picked a few skills and just went with what i thought would be a fun skill set i can t wait until the game comes out in june
if there s anything i learned in my years and years of gaming it s to not look up an efficient guide especially when a game is new finding things and learning on your own makes the game so much more fun almost every time there will be a time where we all will be using the most efficient strategies and builds but getting into that train too early takes every ounce of magic out of the game of course some people enjoy the efficiency route from that start and that s fine too
yupp already have a job i am planning to play the game for fun
nope i m gonna be jacked into the matrix on this shit
no lol going to research the life out of it first
pre beta i was all in on necromancer i loved the trailers and skills i saw for that class post beta necro who i had so much fun playing the barbarian and yes i m on that build calculator and looking the leaked database to see how best i can keep berserking up and i want that grandfather sword too
imo this is one of the major problems with mmos and even a lot of arpgs there is always this major push to be first with content because that s the only way you can enjoy discovery everyone that comes after is criticized and ostracized by the community unless you follow some internet guide lost ark is a prime example of this and there actually is no discovery at all on na servers you follow korean builds and korean raid guides or you play alone i miss that discovery feeling and am really looking forward to d4
me and my friends were on the verge of not buying the game but honestly they knocked it out of the park with the story and lilith just works as a charming evil rather than just an evil evil boss like diablo i loved the cinematic scenes and plan to watch every of them without skipping
man so there s some good dudes out there who make content for guides however i will be avoiding those guys like the plague at least for the first month or so to play the game as i experience it and experiment with builds myself at least for me the most fun i have in diablo games is when i explore builds and the world myself rather than listen to some other guy telling me what builds are best i will probably check out what they have to say after i go through the game a few times but yeah
i mostly haven t got a clue how to min max and optimise builds and i can t wait to just pick a dude and optimise him by what sounds fucking cool and enjoy how he turns out from my lack of enlightenment
i used to be big on looking at guides but recent destiny mod system and the new wow tree kinda made me realize that it s not that hard to do just play around and find what you like then focus on accomplishing that goal for the beta i went rogue and saw that vulnerable was an important thing so i just built maximizing that and it was awesome my dad has played every season of d3 and still looked up videos on how to build for the beta and i feel like most people are just too scared to try to do it themselves the search feature is super helpful for it
yup internet has ruined every game for the last or years pretty heavily i won t be ruining this gem
i completely agree with any game i never look up guides but this is especially true with arpgs because they re all about creating a build via skill combinations and gear you get to test what works and what doesn t and come up with some truly quirky ideas merely following someone else s build directions sounds horrible to me it would remove nearly everything that makes an arpg enjoyable plus players don t need to have the best build or seek best in slot gear i d rather have a build i legitimately made than a template for the best build and thankfully arpgs are largely forgiving in that you can be quite powerful with most any build even in d2 you could beat hell with a lackluster setup creativity is a giant facet to arpgs you create your own personal character following guides is just making someone else s character
the mentality people have of data mining games to be optimal from start to finish instead just enjoying the ride is the biggest problem with the industry
probably same unless somehow a guide to get a really cool piece of gear pops up in my feeds i m a sucker for getting pretty things
i that s how i play all of my games i ll turn off notifications from my favorite youtubers because i don t even want to see thumbnails or titles my bare minimum is to play games at least until i see credits usually i ll keep playing until i ve unlocked all of the secrets that i think i m going to find on my own or whatever then i ll look up stuff if i m still interested games where builds are a major focus take me longer before i start looking stuff up i like to really mess around with builds and skill combinations to see what works figuring that stuff out is an important part of the game design imo it s part of the puzzle and really a big part of a game s difficulty curve spending all of your mats on a build or upgrading a weapon only to find it s not that good or you immediately pick up a better weapon is kind of part of the experience just like envisioning a build and finding out that it actually works is pretty damn rewarding once i ve gone as far as can or want to with builds and such then i ll start to look stuff up that can be pretty rewarding too sure you find out about things you missed or hidden mechanics that you really had no way of knowing but a lot of times you might find that your way that you figured out on your own actually stacks up you might find yourself just tweaking your own builds with the information you gleaned instead of just outright running with someone else s that s pretty rewarding imo diablo was wild for example it was so slow to beat hell difficulty but i wouldn t look anything up until i did it myself the original release has such a hellish legendary drop rate and if one dropped it was usually for another class but i did it with a barb and had a pretty efficient build by the end then i went through with monk and built a combination strike monk which rotated all of his generators to get damage buffs he was actually really strong and crushing endgame then i finally started looking up builds no one had any combination strike monks that i could find at the time it just felt great knowing i had this awesome character who felt really good to play the rotation from each skill to generate more damage buffs just felt really good it was running quickly through the most difficult content and i couldn t find a video or guide online showcasing it it was mine and that just felt really good so yeah i define plan on not watching or reading anything about the game for a good while until after it s been out you only get one first time to figure out a game s mechanics on your own
well blizz intends on making builds much more permanent so i don t think it s wrong to start theorycrafting early it s actually kinda fun to just discuss with like minded players about one s class and abilities
i just winged it in the betas and manage to create a build without any guides or anything that i am happy with which was fun and it was strong as well definitely planning to do the same on release gonna try to not read watch anything related to my class at all and i even asked my friends to not give me any info about it that they might have seen regarding it
i m a min maxer at heart but half the fun is to at least see how far i can get by myself before running into a brick wall so no guides and such but i certainly did mess around with build planners and stuff to decide on my build and such preemptively
yeah same i use maxroll for d3 but that s after i ve played several seasons when i first started playing d3 i didn t know anything and just played the story and had fun going to save the min max for later maybe season
i never follow guides frn r these kinda games mor fun to find out stuff that works for yourself
definitely playing with maxroll open is like cheat enabled poweroverlwheming showmethemoney
i will study a little bit maybe read maxroll guide to get a feeling for the game otherwise i will probably get lost on all the different stats and mechanics of the game i will definitely enjoy making some of the builds or maybe get some crazy accessorie that will make me change it i don t know i think it will be fun
this is probably the best way to keep everything super fresh if you haven t had any spoilers gear drops aspects and the paragon system will really get you excited as you progress for me the theorycrafting and looking at what could be is a huge part of the fun along with trying to organize data into a usable product for others in the community in it a way it certainly spoils the surprise of the experience but i also think it keeps me actively engaged with the community leading up to release and also helps me feel grounded in the game with a direction and a goal beyond just hitting cap i wish you the best of luck know that you certainly aren t alone in your play style
totally agreed i won t be watching any of the click bait and hype content creators it always boggles my mind how they want to go go go and ultimately play the game like it s a competitive game i get the leaderboards etc but it s not like it matters at all at launch since it s not even a season
yeah none of that truly matters until you hit endgame anyways i always just enjoy playing the game and experiencing it for myself getting the story figuring out what s fun and all that once i get to lv rolling other characters and start messing around with endgame content yeah then i ll poke at those sites to see what s good interesting etc but i enjoy just taking the game at my own pace initially
i m with you op especially during big launches like this as it s really easy for people to peddle you misinformation when nobody actually knows what s going on sure some series vets will have a better idea than others but that didn t stop fextra life from pushing out some seriously dumb builds in elden ring last year once you have a solid grasp on what s going on it s easier to sift through the chaff and find the actually good advice
play however you want not how others tell you i ll probably take a look at some builds guides to avoid any really bad builds struggling unnecessarily in the first experience i won t be doing the rush to level min max stuff
yes i will take my time and enjoy it the only thing i look up is builds from icy veins not because i like to min max but because i can t be bothered figuring out what works main reason i could never get into a game like poe
yes i plan on playing the game the first time around with all my attention on the story and just enjoying the base game journey then on subsequent playthroughs i ll be getting into the optimization
there is no need for guide just play necro corpse explosion to win
ofcauae i will but most of these guides are old or known info for me thus far ill use my headstsrt days to focus on the game and not social medias trying to get me as a view
it s not poe so you will probably need some guide only to min max late endgame stuff
some games i take it as it comes but this im all in baby ive got my spreadsheets my build calculators im on all the discords and forums watching every youtube video although most im like i know more than you
i will play with no guides and experiment myself all throughout the campaign for my very first playthrough that being said if i hit a wall and i just can t push through because of balancing issues i will see myself needed to copy some meta builds in order to complete the game for seasons there is no question about it i will definitely use guides
yes i will look for a guide when i m in end game with or more characters
i used a skill calculator to plan builds for all the classes but that s it i m not following any guides and i don t care about whatever the meta decides is strong
im just going to dive in i do some planning but i just open the skill tree once i get a point and look ahead a bit or for an hour xd d4 s one is actually nice because you need to spend ranks before getting the core ability so you can take it in strides but one should look agead to look for good skill synergies
i m gonna go in play for fun and enjoy my time when i get to the more endgame stuff sure i may look at builds or suggestions but at the end of the day i just want to play for fun no sense in taking the fun out of it trying to min max every little thing unless that s just your jam
i m for sure going to make my own build explore everything and not rush to min maxed end game but i do think i also want to understand how the game works as well as possible beforehand otherwise on release i ll be wasting time trying to figure out shit like which affixes can roll in what slot rather than playing the game maybe after i ve completed majority of content i ll look up guides and see about optimizing for whatever the end challenge is
i ll probably read up on a lot of the theory crafted builds and items etc but when i start playing i don t have any build in particular in mind and instead adapt to the items that drop
i looked around a bit so i m not completely clueless in terms of certain systems and also i saved a few potential builds but all the builds are either ones tested only on beta or pure speculation but i m sure it will be best i don t fully commit to any i personally enjoy following guides but i feel it does lead to burnout quickly so i m not going all out i can save that for later when i get past the new game hype
what else are we to do other than theorycrafting while waiting d4 is not out theorycrafting planning is all we can do
i want to understand most of the mechanics at least e g what stats do how they impact damage what armor and resists do how the crafting system works and so on if i just play the game blind without understanding these things i don t enjoy these type of games as much on the other hand i don t need a build guide that tells me level for level where to put skill points and what specific items to wear
i will definitely look for some general build suggestions etc but other than that i will not look at in depth guides
i plan on going to lvl and then looking up something for builds or watch build vids as i play to switch to that when i get max lvl
a mix of both i want to explore the map and experience the story for myself and also try to make my own character build but also use some existing information to know what build options seem viable and which dungeons might have useful aspects i may also update my build based on interesting ideas and interactions that others have posted but the game seems very forgiving in terms of making your own build as you go along if you don t want to access any external resources
really no need to research anyway the only things that might call for if are lilith altar locations otherwise everything is pretty straight forward
first playthrough experience for sure taking my time efficiency maybe comes in later character runs even then usually not in a hurry to purge all joy out of a game worrying about that crap
i theorycrafted my own skill points and marked which aspects do anything to help it and i ll go from there you don t need some guide for hitting max level unless the tuning is d3 act2 sand wasps
nah i love build guides and will watch several the main reason being i want to play a build that just looks fun and satisfying and watching endgame gameplay videos of different builds gives me an idea on what i ll enjoy most saves me from wasting my time on something i ll ultimately just feel meh about what i never watch though is leveling guides i just need an endgame goal in mind but i ll get there in my own way and not speedrun it
optimizing is an endgame thing until then i just play whatever i enjoy
i think i ll look up what aspects are in what dungeons so i can jump on aspects i want quickly but that s about it maybe also altars of lilith locations because although i don t mind running around every nook of the map those statues are easy to miss
i will play the game as i cum on release
i don t really care about the story i ll get all of that by listening to youtube lore videos when i go to bed at night so i ll be using every guide i can to get to end game as fast as possible i ll also use every guide i can find to let me know which build is the most efficient to reach end game asap i play to listen to music and smash monsters i also play to help the community by power leveling and carrying people through content they might not be able to do on their own so i want to get as out front as possible as soon as possible so i can do that for as many people as possible
idk i d rather know what builds are good before going into it because in the beta i didnt like fire sorc and i d rather not go into the game with a build that i dont even know if i ll like
first run will be a chill one with friends enjoying the game at our own rhythm not rushing it
yeah im not spoiling myself until i hit endgame i will discover and toy with it myself
they said numerous times they want to add more endgame content with seasons
oh yeah that s to be expected the launch endgame is most likely going to be pretty darn different from endgame in like or so years
are we going to see big multipliers on uniques in diablo iv similar to diablo iii no joe shely explained that they want to reduce the overall scaling multipliers and damage numbers in combat in diablo iv their focus on implementing legendary powers is to create new builds or to have them change builds the philosophy of reducing the overall scaling multipliers applies to legendaries uniques and also sets in the future joe shely added that sets can be great for having a cohesive look and that they can be excellent for new players that don t want to create their own builds but they can have the negative effect of simplifying interesting builds that are available by taking up a lot of item slots x200b this alone makes me very excited for the future the absurdly stupid scaling and forcing you into sets in d3 is where the game lost me
i d love a boss challenge like ubers just super strong end game bosses we can fight if we collect parts
yes from what they have said so far they intend each season to have more content than a diablo season also i suspect that the initial release date is rushed so they cut a lot of intended content e g runes and crushing blow so there should be quite a lot of content pushed back to future seasons
we ll probably get a lot of new end game information during the end game live stream on april really looking forward to it
solid can t wait to see what the seasons bring
at launch diablo iv will have a gritty and grounded world a cow level wings or pets take away from that groundedness as they go down the line things will loosen up this makes me happy wings and pets are right out for now i m not against wings and pets necessarily but whenever someone implements them they are usually for and therefore they glow like the fucking sun cosmetics turn into equip whatever is brightest and it turns everyone into boring little light bulbs running around the screen we can t even see that legendary chest piece you have son your head is as bright as sirius
what s more important they hinted that renown and altars might carry over through seasons
hopefully they bring pvp arenas or battlegrounds
will there be a secret cow level at launch diablo iv will have a gritty and grounded world a cow level wings or pets take away from that groundedness as they go down the line things will loosen up terrible answer one of the rewards we got from the open beta was a cute wolf pup that somehow stays in a carrier while fighting demons
i am pretty sure they r adding man raids
dungeons arent progession trying to kill a boss that you cant kill and you have to keep farming dungeons untill you are able to is progression if they do not implement such system its a dead noddle i am a d1 d2 d3 player and sorry people these days expect a little to much back then i would throw my monitor out the windo and never get a new one
exactly when has blizzard ever released a game with a complete end game
indeed worse it served no purpose increase torment increase player damage increase torment increase player damage all so the numbers get bigger while doing the exact same content
i don t think we will we are only going to get some more details on the stuff mentioned in the video there is no other end game activities
that would be great
really surprised there are no battlegrounds pvp zone is going to die within a week free for all is just boring needs to be a ruleset with structure
d1 patches you don t need no stinking patches i mean serious why would you want this you want a complete game that never changes never gives you more value for the original you spent i mean even with the expansion d3 is a huge value proposition 1000s of hours for less than
releasing content in patches incomplete endgame lol
and you think d4 will be different how exactly
you should message the mods to get your dev tag
chances are they will carry over at least part way personally i hope for the altars at least you ll still get xp and gold for hunting them after all for renown they could do same but i wouldn t mind farming that as much since you kind of just get it for doing fun content like strongholds
it s not free for all if you re in a party of you can t attack your teammates
d1 did have patches even had an expansion released by a different company a division of sierra was called hellfire and was met with mixed results iirc the expansion was always planned but then they sourced it out and then were unhappy with the results still the expansion was planned from the start and therefore the game was not complete ummm sure 1000s of hours if you say so i did not play that much not anywhere near that got really burned out on it really quickly it was a waste of money imo
lol 1000s maybe the same hours times diablo seasons have rotted people s brains that s not real content
you forgot the s
if there was more to market they would have done it already
not saying it will happen but could be interesting having a bunch of man parties rolling around havin big group battles
show me on the doll where diablo hurt you
why are you here
stay a while and listen
in my opinion probably happy to help anyone who is esl tho keep practicing
or maybe they are a chatgpt script that has been told to write answers like a yo 4chan expert
ya make no sense thanks tho
thats what cross progression means yes
yes they are but you need to buy the game 1x pc and 1x ps5
yes they do i bought both and played both equally in the betas strangely in the beta the queues between the platforms were not the same despite playing together i would have a long queue on pc and switch to ps5 and have a much much shorter one ps5 also just recently added discord voice chat which made it even easier to switch between them my friends didn t realize i d switched platforms until i told them the game also has fairly functional voice chat though it sounded slightly worse than discord in case you just care about controller support or something like that i used a dualsense on both platforms and it worked great but the pc version keeps the pc ui which is actually very slightly different than the console ui with the placement of certain hud elements it s also possible that the hud elements actually just move to different places at lower resolutions my pc is at 1440p vs 4k on ps5
ps5 probably had queue priority i imagine there were more pc gamers and they probably wanted to make sure they got all the platforms tested
it s super hilarious watching automod go off without the game even being out there has to be a better way to use these pins yeah
do we happen to have an easy to find catalogue of previous days
stickies are automated if you don t like this sticky then wait minutes and a different set will be shown
if you click the announcement flair on this post you ll be able to see previous announcements it s mostly littered with these we ll end up making separate flairs for these down the line
it may not be the best thing ever but this and capping paragon is one hell of an improvement over diablo
i think some of the nodes look pretty good but most of them look pretty weak we ll just have to wait and see take the sorceress for example nodes i think look good dealing cold damage to vulnerable enemies increases your lucky hit chance you deal x increased damage to enemies that are both burning and chilled while moving you regenerate mana x faster while standing still you gain x increased fire cold and lightning damage every second up to x nodes that look bad all the rest why it s simple really the good nodes encourage different playstyles than all cold or all fire or all lighting etc most of the legendary nodes though simply encourage rigid playstyles a cold sorceress is going to maximize barrier why because literally every bonus is about cold frozen and barriers what we need is more stuff that encourages mixing playstyles up something like enemies that are stunned also become frozen this opens up a completely different build idea where maybe you try to maximize lightning skills but then take a bunch of cold affixes because you re going to try to stun enemies to get the frozen bonus from other affixes stuff like x cold damage or barrier amount to frozen enemies just become forced affixes anyone playing a cold sorceress ends up taking the fire ones are some of the worst fire skills do more crit damage when you cast fire skills uh huh so you re telling me i need to cast fire skills to get more damage to fire skills crazy how about something like if a monster is affected with burning all skills which have a chance to apply vulnerability now have chance against burning enemies this type of affix encourages maybe throwing out ice blades then meteor then frozen orb and then ice blades which will be off cooldown you can in effect spam ice blades by incorporating fire and ice for example most of these affixes honestly look like they just got lazy
these are pretty significant bonuses some of them even open up new build opportunities like the one that gives bonus damage to enemies that are burning and chilled all the stat nodes are just filler in between these big powers blizzard could have just made you automatically get main stat when leveling instead of having these filler modes but then we wouldn t have the glyph interaction with them which sounds interesting enough people are overreacting to how simple the system seems
druid legendary nodes look good
anyone complaining about lack of build skill changing nodes on the paragon board are totally missing the actual potential of the paragon board system no single paragon board is going to completely change your character it s not how the system is meant to function and you won t see the full potential until you connect multiple boards together with multiple glyphs socketed and leveled up the specific wording and details of the nodes within each themed board can easily be improved post launch and the system itself allows for the introduction of new boards in the future you will be able to mix and match multiple themed boards and it s a real huge step in the right direction when it comes to the paragon system
i would have thought to see more nodes that offer benefits to groups given the mmo lite game design
the question isn t are there nodes specific to specs the question is do the nodes change how you play gear the build without the node and the answer is no you would have already been doing all the same things and got the same gear and they just give you a generic damage increase for what you re already doing with some mainstat along the way all these nodes do is enhance the mandatory legendary gear you were told to equip for the given skill spec of you chose
dex dex dex
ffs people build is from skills items and aspects paragon is just a way too boost what build you chose which is good for casual players no need to complicate it like poe dont play the game if u keep whining
lazy boring and simple design tbh these fail to inspire actual build diversity and tradeoffs you need to overcome by instead dumping even more bad guy is under the effect of x deal y more damage mods everywhere
the paragon boards look like an overly complicated way to give you small buffs to your character it s just laid out in a terrible format
i like how the game is the design for skills interaction playstyle conditional to get benefit of buff instead of simple passive buff stacking traditional in arpg
also keep in mind that the datamined info is missing of the information so you will have a lot more to work with come release
here are the amazing paragon boards you ve all been cumming over saying that they re going to completely change the game and be the saving grace of the build system lmaaoooo delusional
sounds like a lot of rubbish to me
my honest thoughts as someone that has played most if not all seasons of d3 and d3 from release and also the closed beta is never ever think what we will get at release will be indicative of the game in months to and year and onwards think of this as the starting point i absolutely guarantee you that diablo4 may launch with this paragon setup but if you think it won t be overhauled redesigned rescoped etc during its lifespan then i cannot understand you look at d3 as an example paragon changed alot yes it s arguably endless now if adding to a single stat is your thing but the point is years or something on it s still being supported and improved with seasons d4 wil release in its state there will be expansions they will add new classes most likely and likely level increases i am betting we will get a few overhauls of the paragon board and adjustments during d4s life span people need to play the long game and not just the here and now yes some people will play it day1 and smash through it and complain about the end game let s be honest these people are likely to always complain most of these people get their actual enjoyment from doing this the smart move is to play the game until the content becomes repetitive enough for you to lose interest then go play something else until they add more content back to d4 that interests you as i said i have played pretty much most if not all d3 seasons does not mean i enjoyed them all or did not take breaks from the game as i found the content boring but blizzard has always been intelligent enough to add content fun enough to make me come back and try tldr what we get at release won t be representative of the game in etc months enjoy the experience come and go as they add more interesting things
the one thing i think is missing from these nodes or from the skill tree and gear in general are downsides some players don t like that at all but a lot of depth comes from them gaining something very powerful at the cost of something else gives players unique ideas on how to manage the cost of why the strength of a node is still a great upside matching gear and skills to not only maximize the upside of a keystone while also figuring out ways to make the downside benefit them too
i agree even tho tons of people in d3 streams and discords are complaining that the game is over at because you can t grind more levels
what would be best thing ever according to you just curious
in your example you already want to combine things in order to play well just with items and skill trees generally getting vulnerable already helps fire skills tremendously also the ice barrier can improve your fire skill damages as well at the end of the day you can only pick so many points and doing the points in different orders will create different play styles it s not overly complicated yes most top builds will be easily figured out but i think there is enough diversity with skills trees glyphs paragon nodes legendary equipments affixes uniques and class passives i assume as the game will be tested by millions of players they can use that info to further create more interesting parts in each of those without destroying the balance too much
ana x faster while standing still you gain x increased fire cold and lightning damage every second up to x nodes that look bad keep in mind the glyphs you can slot have tiers too some of the unique glyphs are cool the minor and regular glyphs you re referencing as bleh are minor medium i found myself using mostly the rare glyphs except for the rare occasion starting paragon board where there s a ton of bonus nodes in range that can provide an insane regular stat boost from one of the more generic glyphs plus glyphs are found so it ll take awhile to catch them all x200b x200b the only criticism about paragon that i have is that you more or less want to avoid willpower it s arguably the most useless stat by a lot
this is a very good post thank you
agree i m a fan of the skill change nodes in path of exile and grim dawn just a simple node can change your whole build i was also missing that in diablo it seems we get a new paragon board every season i hope they will implement these nodes in the future and thought that a balanced and solid base game would be more important to release first
especially disappointed by rogue s legendary paragon points almost all of them are boring do x extra damage when z happens or something along those lines
nobody was arguing that the bonus wouldn t be effective there was little doubt about it the issue is not a lot open new build opportunities though the perfect exemple was on another thread a rogue player was happy about a node saying up to damage for cc target near you because he said as a rogue i always had everybody cc all the time so that s great the issue here is exactly what we are saying yes it s effective but it s rewarding for doing stuff he was already doing in the end it looks fine it s diablo i m not expecting something really in depth it never was the goal of the license i m much more worried about endgame than the paragon trees
i mean it just seems boring all of it requires such a boring medium to apply if an enemy is vulnerable and you happen to crit it you get more damage wow i m so excited to have no input on what s going on the game is already built for you it s a fill in the blanks not multiple choice
yeah they really do i was going to do earth storm druid with the creeper companion for cc and looking at the paragon board there s some really powerful legendary tiles thunderstruck storm skills deal crit damage to vulnerable or immobilized enemies earthen devastation earthen skills deal more damage to crowd controlled enemies heightened malice when or more close enemies are afflicted by poison deal more damage constricting tendrils nature magic skills have a chance to immobilize for seconds and poison for if i can get all those tiles feed perfectly into my theorycrafted build since everything will be vulnerable stunned immobilized and poisoned pretty damn often i will have up to a chance when hitting immobilized stunned or vulnerable enemies to cast a lightning bolt on them automatically earth spike can stun hurricane inflicts vulnerability on top of all of my storm skills having a chance vine creeper poisons and immobilizes and i already have increases to crowd controlled poisoned or vulnerable enemies in the tree ideally i ll build some damage to cc into my gear rolls even in the early beta i was ccing everything all the time
this take makes no sense there are very few aspects that call out a specific skill and there certainly aren t of them to populate every slot with for a specific skill
im not trying to make a point im trying to show whats available and then for you to decide what you think of them i dont see it being build changing either it is what it is i guess
this is a hot take i m personally pretty jazzed by the one that applies to burning and frozen targets to me that s a point worth building around so your argument is based entirely on your personal experience and without consideration to other perspectives the answer is no for you
what dex means
complicate it like poe there is also gd tl last epoch the games that have better character customization without being too hard to understand for a blizzard games enjoyer and stop talking about whining this calls a feedback
well this is not poe paragons was always about smaller generic bonuses
what makes you think that this isnt most of it
they look pretty cool to me really looking forward to this game
it s ok you won t be missed enjoy whatever else you choose playing
no lie this is exciting news to me this design is unique elegant and concise while still adding so much depth to character progression into endgame but hey i m delusional look at me enjoying life and being excited and hopeful for things doesn t that just make your blood boil troll happiness in others
that would be the crowd that bots and grinds so they can be top of the leaderboard with insane paragon in a season how insane the current season is just weeks old and the top necro has paragon lol yeah no sympathy for the crowd whining about the lack of endless progression
i got no problem with capping the power but i don t want to be level or something for of my play time i like thousands of level to see progress so i would like if level is uncapped but you don t get stronger from it at some point
legendary affixes work kinda like keystones from poe
skill change node in poe i played thousands of hours of poe i don t beleive i seen them if they exist they are like no more than can you named a few
that will pretty much always be the case though there will always be some build that it will be a natural fit for with little to no changes you have to make some pretty significant changes to avoid that which also exist but they can t all be like that with your example it s great for that player because it s what they had already spec d into but what about other players maybe they start looking at ways they can integrate cc into their build or maybe they start adjusting their positioning if they are playing a ranged spec if there s enough room for anyone to ask how can i work this into my build then it s a good node imo
deleted
that is just a damage agains t cc d targets of which there is a plethora of mods already on nearly every item
it s short for dexterity
spend hours in character customization just to then instantly equip a helmet
copium
because we have seen a few items that are high ilvl that had unique affixes which is not datamined was not in beta we are also missing a lot of uniques legos which if we are missing those its clear that not everything in the beta datamine is what we will have access to the paragon board could or could not be an older variation of what the board was the skill tree changed from calculator once beta came out to what the old skill tree was before the beta so i dont think its too far off to assume there will be some changes to the paragon board on release maybe saying was wrong i was mainly just saying we are missing a chunk of information out there and if we are missing information then we will for sure have more to work with come release
lol
yeah a lot of botters and folks using add ons there s a point where you can t play zdps barb in a group unless you have maps for example
current season is stupid easy to level im at 1k paragon and have only played casually the alter of sacrifice makes you super powerful and efficient
this is why sc ladder is irrelevant
deleted
they don t change alot unfortunately i haven t seen any affixes that removes the freeze effect from ice spells and turns it into frost burn for example
my bad i meant keystones passive skill nodes that heavily alter the way your build works max hp but you have max resist on chaos for example
you won t get a well thought response to your excellent counterpoint from that commenter because they re just strawmanning they have no real grounds to be worried about the complexity of paragon boards because they haven t even given it more than a cursory glance
that would maybe be the case if you could pick every single board and then wonder how to make this work but you can only select a few and each as a theme if a player isn t interested in cc they won t take it and nothing will change if a player was already doing cc they ll take it and nothing will change in the end they provide small buff to existing playstyle but not create new playstyle doing cc was already baked into the class and you could chose to play like this or not again that s on par with what we could expect from diablo it s juat that after being hyped up as being the source of build defining power when people noted how basic the skill tree is it s understandable to be disappointed by the reality i m not saying some don t looks nice but personally i would have ditched of the passive in the skill tree and replace them with those from the paragon and give paragon something truly extra
overall im fine with it its better than d3 so its not nothing for sorcerer though it could really use a bit more options that encourage mixing elements
different builds focus on different cc types even within the same class if that s not lending itself to build diversity then idk what to tell you touch grass
oh ok so why do you repeat it shouldn t it be int str dex
i guess thats plausible i would however argue that the amount of nodes boards will stay pretty much the same only question is if they ll get any meaningful changes by release
honestly diablo is not fun without turbohud tho
yeah i know the top 150gr clears are all in the minute range lol
well i mean the xp needed to hit 1k paragon lv is really really low compared to anything pass like 8k yes you will lv faster than previous seasons but its still not gonna let you hit above 5k easily as a casual
if you play sc and you care about the sc ladder its relevant for you if you play hc and you care about the hc ladder its relevant for you
i honestly don t know if they care anymore there s also hacking on the consoles since they have an offline mode tons of people in those leaderboards with impossible items like rings and weapons with sockets an extra zero added to weapon damage etc every now and then you hear about bans but it never totally stops it from happening
literally fire bolt enhancement
do we have keystones like this in poe
ci chaos innoculation i made characters with over 10k es in my thousands hours of time i am saying this not to boost but to point out i know decently how to to build ci high es chars ci doesn t change how your build work it changes what gears gears stats ie es passive nodes you take i can name a few top of my head elemental overload or something that you gain massive elemnetal damage but cannot crit thats the design of poe keystone mostly chnage how you gears and put points into tree but very few are actually gameplay changing an analagy is cutting a tree you spend of the day sharpen the axe than rest of day have an easy time cutting down tree the sharpening part is the core of poe the cut tree is test of how good is of the sharpening skill changes come mostly from support gems gmp spell cascade multistrike and some uniques rarely from passive tree its call passive tree for a reason bonus are passive
you could make the same argument about almost any choice in any game though if you re set on playing one specific build and aren t flexible at all then naturally you re just going to pick whatever scales what you re doing the most i d like to think most players aren t like that though that they d pick their favourite damage skill s out but are flexible in what kind of utility they use to support it and how they scale it for those players and it s the same with legendaries uniques they should see affixes like that and think about how they can work it into their build and if it s worth the cost to do so and then on top of that you compare it to the alternatives that are available as well sticking with using the rogue as an example there s another node that boosts crit damage to enemies affected by trap skills so now they re given a choice of adding cc or traps to their build to scale more damage part of the beauty of how these systems all work imo is also just how deeply intertwined it all is that choice isn t just a binary should i add cc or traps there are choices in what skills you use to achieve that it opens up additional legendary effects you can take advantage of passives etc and it all just feeds back into itself also i m not sure if there is a hard cap on how many boards you can use but being able to use all of them would reduce choices not increase them realistically it seems like you d want to go for maybe depending on how much you re investing in magic rares glyphs that s low enough that there will definitely be some genuine choices in how you re building your building you character
most characters don t want all different stats
yea for sure
no i am saying botting makes the sc ladder absolutely and completely irrelevant
hm not bad i doubt it is useful enough to put skill point into it but it is atleast interesting how about other classes they can t enchant their skills
yes these passive skills alter the way your character is build and there are alot more https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/necromantic_aegis https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/avatar_of_fire https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/blood_magic
you are taking my message a bit too litterately since english isn t my first language i find it difficult to expres my opinion all i wanted to say is that i wish we had some passive skill nodes that could heavily alter our character something that devines a build something that a build could not work without more or less crit won t matter as much as changing your health into a resource pool you know what i mean
and then on top of that you compare it to the alternatives that are available as well sticking with using the rogue as an example there s another node that boosts crit damage to enemies affected by trap skills so now they re given a choice of adding cc or traps to their build to scale more damage x200b that s exactly what i said if you were playing trap you will use the trap board if you were playing cc you will take the cc board x200b i don t see where the choice is people don t chose what to add at this point paragon board are here when your build is done people have already made their choice at this point you already have you skill and passive chosen you already have made your choice of affixes from the codex and from what you looted you won t respect everything once you unlock your 3rd board because you get a node that boost damage against cc ennemies by you will take the board because you already cc the ennemies x200b some class got it better than others but for exemple sorc are the worst most of their board are focused on element meaning guess what board you will take if you have a fire build hint it s not the cold damage boost it was one of the feedback beta for some class most board are completly useless as they would have effect for your build x200b i think you see the board as something that will make build but let s be honest it the opposite you will take the board that boost your build because of the nature of the passives the board gives you
the only other class that uses elements is druid and he also has ways of interacting between elements changing earth to storm skills and vice versa
lol he caught you on that one
i know poe passive tree but none of these examples tranforms freeze effect into frost burn
none of what you listed change skills your original claim you are right that some can alter how you build or how you play but d4 alrady have these and much more of how you play type than poe as far as i remember the whole d4 system is base on conditional cc and how your triggered them also the type of effect you listed also existed in paragon boards legendary aspect or even stats in d4 below are some normal stats in d4 necroarmy _pet _type _inherit _thorns _bonus _pct pet inherite your thorns necroarmy _flat _armor _bonus _with _active _pet _type increase armor base on amount of pets pet _inherit _attrib _bonus _pct pets gain extra bonus base on your stats
fair enough sorry if i sound too harsh i think if you look into paragon board you will be presently surprise its pretty good i think a lot of people issue is from not used to what d4 is trying to achieve which is skill stats interaction cc status effect i like everyone else wanted d4 to be good if poe does something better just copy from them but after study the design playing the beta i sort of understand the direction i am fine with it for instance why do i care for more lucky chance or crit chance on its own not much boring but critc chance may tigger something else say give extra fortify that extra forified can then tiggered bigger overpower overpower than can trigger something say vuerability i think all these will make sense when people understand how all the interact work better
move those goal posts
like i said if you re just fixated on playing one very specific build and aren t flexible at all then it doesn t matter what choices you re being given and that applies to any game at all that sort of approach just shifts all the decision making to before you start really if you re flexible with how you re building your character ie you just want to play a flurry build rather than specifically a flurry build that scales poison with imbuements and traps then there s a lot of choice there and that isn t really true for sorcs there s a few that are for specific damage types but most of the nodes are flexible enough that they can work for both pure and hybrid builds the only one that is too restrictive imo is the one that references fireball and meteor all of the classes work in much the same way with there being some that are locked to certain playstyles like you re not going to take the ranged node if you re playing a melee rogue but then most of them are flexible enough that you can work them into most builds if you wanted to i don t see paragon as something that defines builds that s the skill tree the way i see paragon and the same applies to gear as well is that it s a system that not only empowers builds but it s also something that can make you rethink the choices you ve made in your skill tree respec costs are low enough that you can modify your build on a regular basis so as you get new boards aspects you can work them into your build if you want to
i m not specifically asking for elemental skills just massively changing passive skills in general
yep and i m glad he did because i got my answer that i wanted why are you implying that s a bad thing
not litterately ofcourse i meant to say the freeze into frost burn as an example i just wish there were passive skills that somehow changes the way your character works completely
hm perhaps it still does not look build defining but it rather adds onto the build but we will see
no
i don t see paragon as something that defines builds that s the skill tree but when in the beta people were disappointed by the skill tree having very little customization and build defining passives they were met by but there s the paragon board that will define your build because the skill tree passives are super disappointing chances to get a damage boost for 5sec when attacking a dazed ennemy most are very very boring and people were looking for the exciting stuff in the end both skill tree passives and paragon are not what define your build the legendaries are on the passive you have tiny boost in paragon slighty higher but legendary are stupidly overshadowing them that s where you get the damage boost the double the radius of the aoe etc if you love chain lightning but there s no legendaries boosting it greatly no amount of skill tree passives or paragon board will fix that when another skill have legendaries boosting it by and casting copies at the same time legendaries are of the customization and what really define the build the tree passives and paragon
oh ok i thought i missed something but i m kinda glad for more straightforward approach in d4 honestly after years of playing poe i feel i need a break from overcomplicated mechanics
lolllllllllllllll
i get that but i would really enjoy some passives that completely changes a build imagine having dot frost skills as a sorc or freeze lightning or trade your own health as resource as a necromancer imagine the build possibilities that would be nice not just crit chance nodes that doesn t change gameplay
lmaooooo
do you need to receive an email to receive the puppy on d4 release i thought it will be automatically in your cosmetics inventory when the game releases given you fullfil the requirement i had multiple level characters during beta and i received an email but it just you slayed the diablo iv open beta it didn t say anything about the free mtx
nah i didn t get it either but not sweating it i probably just opted out of promotional emails at some point or something as i never get any from them
i got the email on march from noreply e blizzard com subject line you slayed the diablo iv open beta
nope i didn t receive it it may be because we unsubscribe to a specific email setting
i didn t maybe they are doing multiple waves of mailings million puppies is a lot
i didn t either might have been an email setting
your account got the feat of strength achievement so i wouldnt worry about it youl be good
i got an email stating i received the wolf pack but will need to purchase the game to obtain it obviously
yush like a day or two after beta closed
if you scroll down it should have a confirmation that basically says you unlocked the title and wolfpack customization i d assume they use the feat from the d4 beta to track accounts that unlocked it so not getting an email shouldn t be an issue it s more of a confirmation that you did it
ohhh that s right don t think i have those on either i had better get my doggo tho
oh so it was you
this could further confuse some as they might expect written confirmation about receiving the puppy so im quoting they entire body of the email here it did not say anything you unlocked the title and wolfpack customization thank you for playing the diablo iv open beta sanctuary extends its gratitude dxcreed we hope you enjoyed the thrill of decimating new enemies and conquering the hellish exploits of the diablo iv open beta and appreciate your help ushering in the next era of sanctuary your participation is invaluable to helping us make the best version of diablo iv the outpour of demons from the burning hells is relentless and with hordes of players joining the fight during the early access and open beta weekends we couldn t be more excited for the launch of diablo iv on june we look forward to seeing you at the gates of hell embrace darkness stay connected
probably through the cash shop it is all about cosmetics after all
hair color changes your fur color so far that s it
fingers crossed for manbearpig skin in the cash shop i ll also settle for pandas
hope for u unicorn skin
i noticed on the video today when they were showing pvp the werebear looked like it had some glowing tunes on his body i hope that s a thing it looked fucking awesome
i can confirm you will be able to buy cosmetics of this nature for real money
im officially offended if there s no transwolf
i m not sure where it would be selected added so as of right now no
i mean it depends on your hair color so you can customize it to an extend
buff red panda approve
really hope it isn t anything insane don t wanna see anyone runny around as yogi bear
really because all i ve ever seen on my druid and others videos are the bland brown color this is quite nice if true
i m more of a crocabearamoose guy myself
that d be cool but also just small stuff like armor would be cool too
sign me up for a panda form
if manvearpig was in shop ez buy
fingers crossed for no cash shop can t we just unlock it for playing the game
don t be ridiculous i m getting the care bear skin of course
that s the dire bear ultimate ability and yes it looks sick it was available in beta at lvl
cool thanks
sorry i can t tell if this is a sarcastic response or not lol if it s not do you have any source on this
nah but i wouldn t be surprised if we get reskins of the wow druid werebears
chewbacca
what the hell you got against yogi you have a hatred for boo boo as well damn
on wolf form it s a really subtle change a lot more visible on the bear https://preview.redd.it/ew2zz985d9sa1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a73e4c985e115f8420d0243922a86625cb6902d5
mine had white hair and the bear was white
i always give my characters red hair and i was pleasantly surprised to have blood red fur on my werebear used a werewolf skin from an item once and the fur on them was also based on my char s hair
if we don t get doom slayer armor for barbarian and also dovahkiin armor and also mjolnir power armor what s even the point of playing the game
i m making it up but i also guarantee it to be true
nothing against yogi but if we re gonna do that we should be able to customise lilith and have her carry a picnic basket
yeah i d say its pretty much a no change on werewolf going by that picture at least werebear is quite a difference though
lol yeah there s no way they won t be monetizing this just imagine how much money they could make just by selling necro skeleton skins
it s a pretty bad picture but there is a slight change on the neck and even less visible on the arms best noticeable if you compare two upper pictures with red and green yellow colours
i have the 5800x and 6800xt and d4 ran smooth for me at 144z
absolutely
my rig has a 5600x and 6700xt the game run smooth at 1440p 144hz you should have no issues
yeah you should be fine i play with a 5800x and a 2080ti at 144hz 3440x1440 ultrawide and i get max fps on max settings
5900x here at 1440p fps at max settings were between fps think that it is not fully optimize yet so i asume you can run 144fps at max settings with a 6800xt by far
2k that should be ez as in 1440p 4k maybe at low frames but where the 4070ti struggles with this game there about fps i sincerely doubt it now if the stuttering i saw in the videos was due to the poor memory optimization my point about the may be invalid and 4k with that combo might even be doable
6800xt is an equivalent ish of but while is not able to run it smoothly at max the 6800xt will do it easily at 1440p since it have 16gigs of vram the game is not too heavy to run on most gpus but texture size and asset load make it very vram hungry so while in theory any modern gpu could run the game fairly well the vram gets in the way just a thing with modern aaa games these days
considering i got the game to run on an igpu irisxe graphics at fps i think you will be fine
bro sorry what mother board do you have
have exactly this and ran perfect
thanks bro i ll just buy the 2k hz monitor i don t want troubles whit the 4k and 60hz
i was thinking about buying a 60hz 4k screen but i still don t know if that s a good improvement 2k hz whit no problem should be a better gaming setup
that s a really good explanation thanks man
asrock x470
here is a video with your same setup at 4k max settings always over fps so at 4k 60fps problems too video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cygpby9sayu&ab_channel=radeoforce)
good question i would want to be able to push more frames rather than committing to 4k fps unless price is a big factor i don t know how much better 4k fps will look over 1440p at max personally i want to see fps minimum as an example gf and i are getting dell g3223qs to drive our new based rigs across the board that monitor and gpu will be a good combo the is plenty beefy to push 1440p likely maxed but it will struggle with 4k in some games and from a future proofing pov i can t recommend
depends on a lot of factors big ones is how large of screen and how far are you sitting away from your screen 4k and 2k on a and smaller screen is hardly discernable when sitting within 3ft of the monitor obviously at this point higher refresh rate is going to make for a much better visual experience with my setup i am about 25ft away from my monitor anything larger than a i don t like at this distance as i have to actually pan my eyesight or move my head to be able to focus on details in corners personally i don t think i would have a gaming pc with a monitor above even if money was no factor for this reasoning as such 2k at high stable fps is my main focus and would absolutely take the 2k 144hz over 4k at 60hz
but b550 would be fine and has less bios issues
bro thank you so much that video will help me
as long as the ppi density is good 4k is pretty sexy otherwise your reasoning is sound once more
i ve had this mb since i had my 2700x zero issues for
yeah theres a ton of other factors that can impact things as well especially if you consider a full overall visual experience but those are among the largest i don t think i could ever go back to gaming sub true fps or so tho especially on the genre of games i play arpgs shooters action games
and 4k with a solid monitor def looks nice on screens my cousin has such a setup personally i just like being up close and as such cant stand the larger screens as i said having to move eyes or head if i didnt have a preference towards small frame glasses that may be different tho haha
i don t think i could do a for that reason isn t that much bigger than you d get used to it but this is splitting hairs lol i also like the bigger screen because of vision i switched to progressives and have to tilt my head down to get the best magnification so i m always craving more screen real estate
if you use a skill that causes another skill does the free skill enjoy the benefits of skill point item enhancements the only test i saw on a video was using with a necro using the legendary that caused using mist form to trigger corpse explosion and the explosions triggered that way used level of the skill even if you had improved it to level i m not sure if that example answers that part of your question but it s the only test of skill triggering another skill that i saw
i have been asking this for similar legendary aspect skill interactions before for my necromancer build and i got the following answers you do not need skillpoints invested in the skill utilized by the legendary aspect the skill utilized by the legendary aspect is cast at rank regardless of any rank upgrades done to the actual skill the skill utilized by the legendary aspect does benefit from any other skill upgrade the skill utilized by the legendary aspect can further benefit from other legendary aspects that would affect that specific skill i can not hard confirm any of these infos but i had at least people confirm the above to me i had been asking about the bone prison blight legendary interactions as there are legendaries that a spawns a blight zone within the bone prison and b pulls all close by enemies into the center of a blight zone when it is created and apparently even though i do not create the blight zone via the blight skill it still counts as the skill being cast therefore both legendary aspects activating when casting bone prison i d guess the druid would have similar interactions
the thing i m curious about is do we even need to have points in the other ability like if i cast landslide can it proc a free tornado even if i have points in it
hey man xrembeast from twitch i am going through the exact same thoughts on this build i think it would make for some amazing game play if this was the case i guess when it goes live we can figure it out but no way to check to then my two main questions would be can it proc without points invested does it proc additional nodes with in points invested if a legendary changes the status of an ability eg pulverise becomes a earth skill with this now proc storm spells if these are all positive this build will be an absolute fuccking monster definitely one of the first thinks i will be checking out cone launch
there is a legendary aspect for earth spike that gives it up to a 5s cooldown and makes it literally unusable as a primary attack it s sole purpose for existing is to use with nature s fury and a basic storm attack same thing applies to tornadoes if you turn pulverize into earth and use nf you can proc a tornado but you won t get the chance to proc a second tornado without points spent on tornado you could also use the legendary that makes it track targets
i played quite a bit of druid in beta and as far as i could tell the answer is yes to every single one of these questions druid seems to be the only class that has this sort of modifiable spell schools and i love it for me im looking at a combo of four legendaries all earth skills become bear skills and foritify you unique pulverise becomes earth skill all earth skills slow for gain spirit every time your crowd control slow included and enemy
the closest thing in beta was necro blood mist triggers corpse explosion that got the boost from aspects and upgrade nodes but it was fixed at level the question is if this is how it was intended to work and if nature fury will work the same way basics have resource regen built in to base skill so yes it will give you the extra resources no matter what the boulder is now a core skill aspect made boulder work as a core skill and not a wrath skill so yes if you give pulverize the earth tag it will work like an earth skill same applies for the aspect nature s savagery which makes the cap stone also apply to bear and wolf skills
video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik6ogpkt93k&ab\_channel=macrobioboi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik6ogpkt93k&ab_channel=macrobioboi) the ce was level but it was using all supporting modifiers what this means is if it works the same way with nf then you ll want to keep any skills you plan on not self casting at level and also grab the supporting nodes some other things to test are whether the free casted skills can also trigger nf for skills like bulwark and hurricane what happens if they are re casted before expiry especially with the innate earthen bulwark node and aspect of the tempest aspect of the trampled earth turns trample into an earth skill i imagine it would be quite annoying if it were to proc all the time and shift your character s position i also wonder how symbiotic aspect will work do the cooldown reductions only apply to opposite skills in the same category or all this seems a bit broken with basic skills and high attack speed imagine permanently ccing someone in pvp by rotating between boulder and trample
however if i am not mistaken if you had the morph that turned corpse explode into pools of shadow then the legendary that did that would instead create the pools of shadow in comparison to regular corpse explode because you had the shadow pool morph through skills
interesting looks like it might also apply to the free storm strike you cast when using claw while using the greatstaff of the crone unique weapon do you know how these rank skills interact with affixes that grant ranks to a category or all skills
i ve asked wudijo about this and according to him the triggered skill being rank is apparently a bug and on release we could expect the be able to get the triggered skill follow our skillpoint distribution in it basically as if we manually casted it twitch clip https://www.twitch.tv/wudijo/clip/blazingtenuousoxthething-yggsnbo5hkpkbfsi?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time)
it sure can i had a mod that made a blight pool spawn inside bone prison only had points in bone prison but it would still spawn the blight pool another mod that made blight suck enemies in would also proc inside the bone prison cast so things like this definitely stack
you dont need to but since it gets both improvment nodes its easily worth the points
if a legendary changes the status of an ability eg pulverise becomes a earth skill with this now proc storm spells i have a feeling it won t work like this because you d theoretically cast pulverize and land slide after using tornado for example i don t actually know but just have a feeling legendary affixes won t apply to this type of thing
my understanding was that natures fury would obviously only trigger on the first cast as otherwise it would have a small chance to proc into infinity and shot any boss in the game
i dont believe they cast at rank
you definitely wouldn t cast both since it says you have a chance to trigger a free spell of the other category i m pretty sure that what would happen is that instead of always triggering landslide you d have a chance to get landslide and a chance to get pulverize theoretically that could be beneficial to some builds but i think that most people would rather know for sure what they were getting rather than having a weird result half the time
this guy knows whats up
holy archetype is missing class
cyber half demon unicorn hairdresser
paladin that has the option of using javelins spears amazon paladin hybrid essentially
practically guaranteed paladin crusader and monk guesses artificer maybe some angel or demon class doubt this one tho
i feel it will be a templar running around with a spear and shield and it will steal from amazon and paly crus for many of its skills
knowing blizzard they will play it safe and bring the paladin or the amazon back it s almost a given either of those will be the next class however i d love to see them swing for the fences with something completely new the witch doctor from d3 was essentially the necromancer from d2 it was a fun addition but with curses summons and spooky spells they felt the same monk was new to the series but monk is not new to blizzard as a whole and feels like a very played out class at this point crusader was literally paladin and demon hunters play like d4 s rogue so i doubt dh will make a return i woukd love to see something completely new but that s very unlikely
we have brute physical agile physical magic physical magic magic and spooky magic i would actually like to see something of a hybrid agile brute class i m voting for a monk esque ronin that comes from xiansai his abilities and style focus on being a traveling merchant fisherman swordsman abilities are designed around physical strength quick slashes riposte parry and flask magic think chan in drunken master meets cabbages vendor from avatar meets pandaren brewmaster his design is like a mix of the majora mask backpack merchant and auron from ffx it s a small island nation right off the nw coast of the the current playable map and makes for a pretty logical small zone addition
engineer class shotguns bombs mines traps alchemy and turrets always enjoy that type of character
warrior pally combo class i want my sword and board non magical and then make a holy one later
shaman
i would love to have a priest who s excelling at supporting your party members with buffs heals but can also easily solo with holy spells maybe he has two followers which he can buff and send into battle or sacrifice them for buffs like the necro can
i feel like this question has been been asked answered times
like to see an engineer or alchemist class
holy fire priest
van helsing
based on the prior picture probably a holy type warrior a fallen valkyrie would be cool maybe there s a revolt against inarius and he causes problems for the humans so some leave him to join the humans who knows i would like to eventually see a bard i think that would be awesome first one i d bet money on some type of holy warrior
i d love a grappler or hand to hand fighter doesn t have to be monk
doesn t really matter anything to make people get off necro and sorc
bard bring back the unfinished bard and let us slay demons with a lute playing thrash metal
dragoon

you see that picture that was going around of a potential spoiler for an angel type class of some sort
stanley the unkempt walmart greeter
javelins doesn t really go with a paladin aesthetic
i d be down for something like that tbh
yes holy lightning is already a theme with the crusader
yes mechanical buddies and a steampunk look
too similar to what the rogue already is
a wally
this times a million
i hope its an angel class maybe one of the lower angels that went to sanctuary with inarius and angels are most often seen using spears as well amazon would just feel too similar with the rogue and a valkyrie was an amazon summon would be kinda weird to now have a summon as a main class
to add onto this image which has been removed and theorized to show a class that s been cut there is a symbol on the original diablo hells ink tattoo sheet that has also been removed this https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/12axjkd/missing_classes/jeuzvpb?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) is a comment i made discussing it with another person a few days ago that has links to the image i m talking about and a further discussion of the mystery symbol
doubt it we aren t on the side of angels or demons should be clear after d3 suggesting an angel is the same as suggesting a demon
for the last time stanley we re not putting you in the game
i think they can holy lightning is already a theme with the crusader and would transfer perfectly into amazon style lightning javelin abilities the spear shield is already a paladin like aesthetic and would fit really well where you might have mostly melee abilities with some thrown abilities

yes that lol
that s gonna make the story real weird
but but i ll give you a sticker
on an ethereal item
if i had to venture a guess and you do have a blizzard account but not sure it was logged into while playing the beta i would think you lost out on getting the pup unfortunately but that is a total guess on my part nothing official
go to the bnet account page and see if your psn id is linked if it is and thats the account you were logged in on your ps5 when playing the beta you ll be fine i didn t need to login to bnet either because my account is already linked
pup is a cosmetic i guess for any all char not just the one u leveled
more than not sure it was never asked for during the beta i ve logged in through d2r once and i wonder if that just permanently linked the bnet account ps5 we ll see on the first i guess heh
awesome thanks was just heading to bed and saw this took my pc out of sleep mode and checked psn is linked
yeah i know the question is the connection between ps5 accounts and bnet acounts i just in particular want it for the druid every other class it d be more meh
no worries happy to help in that case i d be very shocked if you didn t get the wolf pup pack now here s waiting until june eh sleep well
oh i see i bought d4 on ps5 but due to pathetic hackers i have d3 on my xbox sx when i received the wings for the preorder it was ps only but i guess the pup might be bnet acc wide
what did you like about it legit haven t heard anyone say this not hating i pre ordered it long ago
i already preordered in january because it s a mainline diablo game it didn t take much convincing
which of the blizzard employees held at gunpoint to make that video are you and are you being held hostage again to make this post
really they showed nothing new in that video tho mhh
i pre ordered the collector but then cancelled since it doesn t even come with the game
nope i preordered awhile back but am pleased by the direction
low effort shit post lol
only the deluxe i a true alpha gamer preordered the ultimate edition i a peak gamer specimen that all gamer kind needs to look up to will allow you to gravel at the feet of my ultimate edition joke

lol i really hope we don t need to interact with this player base too much
pre ordered after the necro video and may not even go necro at launch lol
i enjoyed the end game video as i am hungry for any information about the game while i anticipate the release playing the open beta sealed the deal for me and pre ordered shortly after don t let others rain on your parade enjoy the hype the last time i was this hyped for a game was skyrim
that video was pretty much taking in circles most who frequent or visit this subreddit already had a sense for a lot of that info it was mostly a marketing video to show up in streams for people who don t really or haven t been following diablo news and progress there were a couple of tidbits less highlighted previously i wouldn t pre order just because of that video but it was nice to see all the same
satire
never pre order any game ever
i ll be pre ordering on like may 30th
to me it s more the hardcore mode i can t wait for i really want to try out a lot in hardcore and learn from my own mistakes without looking up any guides this will probably make the game most enjoyable it s also the best way to learn the game i m pretty sure playing the game like this will keep it fresh for a long time
paragon system is pretty cool and i like pvp really excited for the fields of hatred
i pre order after the cathedral paintings lol
yeah that video is practically anti marketing nothing like seeing employees who aren t interested in the product reading a bland script blizzard should delete it if anything
it did though the fields of hatred demo of the paragon boards
new for who
i paid beyond the price of ultimate because i m an alpha gamer you scrub
ultimate edition i will be refunding the edition i bought to join the closed beta and will be giving up my flesh for a copy of the games hopefully if i can beat the lines for it lmao
why laugh
what s wrong
the main point was to see actual footage of it instead of reading text about it it s not the same in fact why don t you play zork instead of diablo you like reading text
why do you think this is satire i m dead serious
why not
never wear white on a thursday ever
me too to all of those things i think the paragon system is going to be complex enough to keep me entertained and provide enough build variety preliminary calculators look good let s hope release backs that up
i ve heard others say that they could have generated more buzz by showing more about the cool parts about the paragon boards not just clicking a few tiles which had the unpleasant effect of everyone exploding into its just all watching a mattjestic vid right now it s really cool offers a ton of flexibility and is sufficiently complex to whet my whistle further
i lost interest in it so fast like did anyone watch this my company made me do a rehearsal sales pitch and they ripped me apart and i had to come up with a new strategy
it seemed like they re trying to market to casuals and us neck beards want to hear developers go into nitty gritty details a good example is that when my kids and i watched it i thought it was bland but they absolutely loved it
neither of those things were strictly new they ve shown both of those things before and in more detail than they actually did in the video irt paragon boards at least that said yes if someone hasn t been keeping up with the news streams betas content creators etc then it s probably the first time they ve seen this stuff
the ultimate supreme i m sorry master
the mother would be proud
it s funny
love the vibe here xd you can easily find leaks of lvl100 barbarians slaying thru the fields of hatred and even kill lvl100 boss in a couple of seconds on youtube tho it s still on if u dig deep enough you ll find it
okay now i m convinced you re joking thanks for the laugh appreciate it
because it incentivizes devs to produce an inferior game on launch and for them to release before games are ready because they already have s of millions of dollars if a game is released without pre orders then the success of that game will depend on how good the game is on release in the case of pre orders they release hype trailers get everyones money and then release the game incomplete buggy and in poor condition pre order are largely responsible for the terrible condition games are released in now
link
father gonna be disappointed though
which part is funny
link the video of the fields of hatred video can t find it
i thought pre ordering shows interest in the game and signals to the devs to do a good job at launching it no
they all should go back to develop snes games good old times finished products out of the box with no hot fixing ever xd miss those times actually
new diablo paragon system bla bla bla on yt
at least mother loves us father wants us dead
unfortunately not they don t need to worry about the reviews they are going to get because they know they already have a financially successful game on their hands this is why they release all the hype trailers years out from the game being launched so they can suck people into paying for something before they even get it and without really knowing what they are even getting
she might love us but only if we help her grand plan
of course they care about reviews this is a live service game blizzard is pouring millions into d4
i will help mother
of course they care about reviews that must be why we get perfectly launched games with no bugs server issues or lack of content or anything like that hey
i wanna kill them both imagine killing lilith which pisses off inarius
what are you even implying here
but mother loves us
ive explained it to you over and over again if you can t understand it by now i m sorry but i can t help you
did that druid just one shot the sorcerer
paragon boards have a lot more depth dex dex dex int lol
this video just made me not want to buy the game the marketing is horrible here
the person gave no idea about games
she speaks in her natural voice streamer voice on it s really special streamer voice then quick cut to an octave lower normal voice what is going on with audio editing in this video
is pvp the only way to get those shards for cosmetics personally i hope not
lol
incels really out in numbers on this thread huh
so basically more of what we did in the beta with nightmare keys functioning as maps in poe i just worry because dungeons were the weakest part of the beta
no matter how hard i try i can t watch more than seconds of this video
hosted by female druid
yeah that s a big yikes from me
removed
removed
out of touch every time at least i got my refunds mone back pew
so this woman is making diablo a zoomer with a small imagination future looks great guys
so the end game is recycled dungeons with mechanics and the paragon system is to stats by a single digit holy fuck blizzard is such a dogshit company it felt like a bunch of smiling weirdos trying to get my hyped to buy a shit scented candle
it will take so much more than that to not get bored at the endgame and if there is the slightest daily quest i ask for a refund
so the end game is recycled dungeons with mechanics and the paragon system is to stats by a single digit holy fuck blizzard is such a dogshit company it felt like a bunch of smiling weirdos trying to get my hyped to buy a shit scented candle
removed
so i understand people are taking alot of issues with the marketing video and it certainly could have been better but i think the biggest letdown for me was that each producer speaking on the video felt rushed and not passionate at all about the project they just seem scripted and tense i ll still be playing because i m a dirty nasty little fanboy but the video was discouraging and that s coming from someone who has defended d4 in its current state
shh druid is a baaaad man
yeah i dont understand why they didnt show the glyph slots and how they affect an area around the paragon board its the most interesting part of the paragon system and they ignored it completely
it s great just like diablo when you level up
are you stupid
the sad thing is that even wolcen s pst seems better the more i think about it the sadder i get realising the potential that game had only to be ruined by its incompetent devs
yeah everyone was saying not to judge d4s dumbed downed skill tree because the paragon system would save it
i ll be sticking to my policy of waiting a month and seeing if people are still enjoying it before buying it usually one month is enough time for the hype to be replaced with actual assessment
then don t buy it it s quite simple
please don t
we don t know yet what cosmetics are available for pvp currency vs other currency i e are the pvp cosmetics exclusive to pvp but they have confirmed you can earn some amount of premium currency by playing the game and so can purchase store cosmetics through playing so you can definitely get some cosmetics without playing pvp and also without paying money
cosmetics don t matter anyways no one cares how you look but how you kill
it s cosmetic so you don t have to participate if you don t want to and it won t affect your ability to be overpowered at least from what we know so far
i hope it remains that way and they re never available without pvping
yeahhhhh dungeons were super weak at least the story so far is good but just for a story and atmosphere we ll see i guess
show your face on reddit and let us roast you please
why are you still here then lol
what exactly were your expectations there s different dungeons and unique spins on them sounds like a lot more fun then farming rifts paragon was an alternate leveling system for padding stats also seems more interesting then the d3 version maybe if people didn t expect every aspect of this game to be groundbreaking they wouldn t be so miserable about it
then unsubscribe and play something else
jokes on you its gunna take like hours of grinding to get to that end game and blizzard will rightfully tell you no on your refund
lonely man covered in doritos dust and his own crusted cum makes fun of successful woman s appearance from behind a computer screen
that s a druid tyvm
gotta save something for next months video
go read the blog
look at the datamined info they didn t show it because they know how bad it is that s one of the most disappointing things about d4 you keep expecting the game to peel back a layer and show you a whole other level of depth like wow what we saw at beta must only be a fraction of the game then they do peel back a layer and another and then the end game layer and it just never gets any more interesting it s just really really bad versions of things that are mostly already unpopular people thinking well legendary affixes on items will only be a small part of defining your build nope it s damn near all of it well the paragon board is sick look at how it ll totally change your build one of the barbs legendary nodes is literally this to cause invulnerable for seconds with slashing weapons i mean fuck me how little effort went into this shit not to mention they straight up get things wrong in this video that s not at how all the codex works
because the overcomplicated system to get a few more crit to werewolf is largely dumb they are already under scrutiny for respects wait until people learn about removing and reassigning glyphs and that paragon boards are spec specific
clearly you are you don t have enough int
see that s what i ve heard too and this is what i was banking on obviously the other nodes weren t really put in the spotlight here and they focused too much on the basic ones that are to stat i ll be continuing to wait on the sidelines until i see more but this didn t make me want to pay up it just made me more disappointed
paragon just seems to be a form of leveling up why not just open that up from level and have it part of the main game to begin with me choosing basic character stats is endgame and not just game
that s a good amount of time to judge i ll be on the sidelines seeing how things go as well
i like cosmetics hate pvp the great conundrum
i mean if playing days early really makes it worth it but even is marginal for what s worth it
u wouldnt be able tf would a bad looking person write like what i did a bad looking person is happy when others push crap looking ppl
he is going to buy it back in may
you keep comparing it to d3 and i m not sure why you are doing that i didn t say rifts or the systems in d3 were any good so those points fall flat i m not expecting them to reinvent the wheel but it would be nice if their team had some semblance of inventiveness and interesting systems they are employing early 2000s level of game design and these carbon copy ideas that are better executed in other arpgs are unfortunate to see i dont want everything to be groundbreaking but for as long as this shit has been in development it would be cool to be able to at some point with even a system design choice go wow what a fun and creative idea sorry y all settling for mediocrity
also the paragon system has enchanting but hey they allready made up their minds anyway this sub is toxic and only represents a fraction of the playerbase thank god
one of the barbs legendary nodes is literally this to cause invulnerable for seconds with slashing weapons wow are you stupid if there s no internal cooldown that s basically godmode on a high attack speed dual sword build
i won t be a dick and just link you to the entire datamined legendary nodes for each class but i ll give you one of the barbarians keep in mind this is a legendary node it s the most powerful node on the board for that tree and it s the big unlock you are grinding for slashing weapons have a chance to cause vulnerable for seconds wow stunning omg so build defining the legendary node for a full wing of the paragon board for barbarians is literally a level item roll
you and me both they kind of took from the division here with whatever the pvp zone was called in there i can t remember i m not a pvp player but i d go in there and collect my currency and then go the spot to offload it by helicopter a similar mechanic they have here and i never once defeated anyone in pvp they were hundreds of gear levels above me and they d camp managed it not the highest of rates i imagine it cannot be worse than that here especially if you join a clan and sometimes have a group of four i also figure i have more equal starting footing here so a reasonable possibility that i ll be equal level to some of the pvpers but i expect m k playing rogues to wipe the field on a regular basis and if you are not that class you ve got to pick your fights
on the bright side there will be pve monsters you will be able to go after but it won t be a walk in the park since others will want said monster loot more than you something for the competitive folks
the cover of a book can only hide what s on the inside for so long
not a chance
why would i compare diablo to diablo is that a joke it s a sequel my dude by how you responded it seems you have no idea what you want you just wanted more i thought that video showed off a lot of cool new systems but that s just me
hes not saying its not powerful hes saying how bland it is
bro if it s like this for all the classes fat l that sounds so bad
that can be extremely good especially when i stack attack speed and spin to win
the dark zone im a pve player and i dont even try and fight i just run away from the rogues so d4 has this pvepvp area and same item extraction mechanic as well i dont see myself going into this pvepvp area
you never know it could be a lot of fun depending how they mix the pve pvp in that zone for someone who loves that type of content i m glad there s a reward for performing well and maybe incentive for good group play
yeah dude and as a barb str is fucking sick too that will be extremely good since it gives me increased damage
dark zone right lol yeah i will likely carry this tactic over to d4 but i ll try some actual pvp and see what happens
yeah to be fair the most fun i have ever had in pvp was being a healer in pvp in guild wars and ffxiv pvp and then freedom wars a little known hunting game on the vita that had super fun team based pvp maybe it ll be like that here some fun to be had from group pvp play i ve really never been a one on one pvp player as up until recently i m always a support class lol i loved being the target in gw and ffxiv and helping my team while staying alive most fun i have ever had in pvp i m not ruling out that it could possibly be fun here and i intend to try it with my pve class not rolling a second character just to pvp
i guess path of exile is doing it wrong too then
i don t like poe i don t find it fun but at least poe paragon boards lead to interesting nodes d4 nodes suck it s okay to admit it
i wouldn t know i haven t seen them yet
https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/ it s underwhelming
the game does have problems is not incompatible with the game is fun to play i am nearly positive that the vast majority of people fall into this category it s just the haters and fanboys who can t stand the idea of there being a middle ground between hate and love so long as the problems aren t ruining your fun then you do you
i think that means that you did like the beta but that the fact your progress was gonna be wiped srsly killed your motivation no crime committed here
i like the idea of the game i think the gameplay felt good i think issues with the game that many people identified will be exacerbated at end game and will limit how much time people are willing to put in the game given their history i m concerned that blizzard is more willing to pump and dump content rather than creating a lasting game that a dedicated player base would want to engage with for many years this leaves a bad taste in my mouth
i landed in a similar place i had very little time in which to try the beta my first hour of play i walked away thinking i really didn t like the game not just one aspect of course but many different things i evaluated as best i could with a measly one hour of play left me in that spot my second and last session in beta was picked up where i left off at the end of my first hour and went for about or so hours i walked away from the second experience thinking actually the game really wasn t too bad at all from there as i thought back on the experience i crystalized my thoughts more there are a lot of things i could evaluate and i m not going to get into the details in the end what i think left me with a better impression was the raw gameplay itself something about the pace and flow of the click slash combat and ability usage as limited as it was for me at such low levels of play time felt pretty good by the time i was done i went into it with as little expectation as i could and even low expectations overall i knew i would be buying and playing the game eventually at some point but after my second beta session and some after thoughts things felt good enough that i knew that on release day i d be giving it a go for sure like you though i wasn t really thinking i d be into the game and not having followed the development very closely i ultimately walked away thinking to my surprise that i wanted to play more of the game i ended the beta with a hankering for some more diablo gameplay i ve been pleasantly surprised by this and am happy to discover it certainly i wasn t expecting that result
the game does have problems imo and i don t expect all of them to be fixed by launch or ever so do you usually buy only perfect games
you need to do a better job at conveying your feelings about something i didn t like this but all i want to do is play it is an oxymoron it makes no sense your body of text clearly states that you had a good time and are looking forward to playing more nothing about what you said gives the notion that you didn t like the beta
there is no perfect game and i am sure every game has its problems but damn there are still awesome and fun games and i can t wait to play d4
look at the beta like a warm up frame in bowling it just doesn t count you got to make mistakes and get a feel for the game so when you start you are already spun up on the mechanics
if you don t like something but want more you just are fooling yourself
i agree for the most part the biggest issue is that i didn t feel compelled to play nonstop like a crack addict i m not sure if that s a me issue or something wrong with the game or both i actually did want to play more sunday evening but the game wouldn t load so i couldn t
yeah i did like that combat was slower with less enemies so it was more about positioning as opposed to just cycling through your abilities however i d like the dodge to have a shorter cooldown and or multiple charges i heard someone say they barely used dodge since they were always saving it for something and that could be fixed with multiple charges and short cooldown the skill trees could also be better but i m confident things will eventually be balanced with various patches and updates they did that a lot with diablo and i don t expect things to change
even game of the year elden ring had its critics i don t like to play open world single player rpg games anymore because typically either it s too vast and combat is not balanced at all during its launch or in elden rings case not as interesting as far as side quests go what did grip me was the combat and overall enjoyed it i d play a elden ring live service game in a heartbeat that is not pay to win their combat is exciting provided you don t out level the mobs which is what i hope diablo will be always challenging
imo there is something wrong if a game makes you feel compelled to play nonstop this is distinctly different than if you want to play nonstop compelled i need to just do this thing to get to the part of the game i want want there is so much to do and not enough free time to do it but that won t stop me the solution i have is to accept that i can enjoy playing a game reach a point i don t take a break and then come back and play more if i decide i want to and not loose sleep over it if it don t i will never find a game that i won t get bored of eventually and it s not the game developers fault for that it s my adhd brain lol
you play the campaign once then every other character can play adventure mode except it isn t called adventure mode anymore confirmed by devs the info is on the internet
tree of whispers is your adventure mode bounties if that s what you re after but they re not act area task specific anymore you choose what you want and can be anything from world bosses to dungeon runs for the bounty different tasks are worth more whisper points

this isn t confirmed but just my own guess

you actually can skip the campaign on alts as long as you finish the campaign once
i believe it s tied to your battlenet account so whenever you do buy it the pup will be waiting for you
that wording was a bit odd but i m sure it was just intended to influence your decision purchase now or else the wolf pup gets it i sincerely doubt they would be that scummy though i m sure the wolf pup is waiting for you in game even months after release
well if you don t pre order it you may not have it by june that s all it means
wtf i never got an email confirming i reached
probably but they don t want to say it outright so you ll pre order
this is correct it s already linked to your bnet but requires a copy of the full game to access
nice thanks
that is correct the prerequisite was reach lvl
omg lol xd yeah your prob right
hmm ok _ thankyou
also never got this email and i reached with multiple characters in both betas edit maybe we should have turned on advertisement emails in battle net
not in junk this is part of it that i got https://preview.redd.it/wcysqynyu7sa1.jpeg?width=937&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9758db14ed52a80020710de1a17ff4aa93ba7d16
can confirm this email doesn t exist i just got one with a white background to thank me for playing to the beta nothing about the beta rewards
whaaat are you pc i m console xbox
i never got the email op is referencing either but there do appear to be screenshots of it i m guessing it only went out to people who reached level in the beta and also haven t pre ordered the game yet if you already pre ordered it wouldn t make much sense to send an email encouraging you to purchase the game to be sure you get your wolf since you already did
nah i played on ps5 but i do have my bnet attached
i got it n i m on xbox as well
but i don t even think you can play in the beta without linking a bnet account somethings fishy here
that s my thought as well though it would have been nice for them to confirm what we got like they did for the pre order advertisements i had the same fear that they didn t track my progress
if someone else s choice of personal appearance bothers you enough to be vocal about it then you really shouldn t even leave your house i couldn t give half a fuck if someone was using a ricardo milos skin or a sexy barney costume spamming kickback dances their choice of cosmetic portrayal has literally no effect on me the gameplay does not change at all it screams massive insecurity to feel a need to control someone else s appearance
as long as only they can see it nothing hell there s no way for me even to know they have it
if a guy in a pink pony costume can join my shard channel world lobby he is ruining my experience by being out of place compared to what i expect from the x aesthetic i want this game to have or rather the game developers have led me to belive the game will have pretty much
in that sense shouldn t all cosmology be hidden from other players
yes it should i don t get this argument if cosmetics are in the game others should obviously see them as much as i like and miss d2 s aesthetic it doesn t work as well today especially for diablo where the dev team has the challenge of appealing to both casual players and the more veteran players that are here because of the diablo namesake that being said the d4 team actually tried in many ways and succeeded in some this game has a massive target audience you can t please everyone that applies to a lot of other stuff some people are upset about
at least there should be an option to hide cosmetics you see on others hide other players in general world of warships does this really well there are a bunch of silly glowing flashy camos skins sometimes with different models too in game however you can select categories you don t want to see and hide them you can hide all of them too so that you only see the normal ships with the base camo and there is no reason this can t exist in pretty much any game including d4
not necessarily if it s inherently consistent with the mood of the overall game but sure it could be an option to ignore other players cosmetics or transmogs
the reason it doesn t is to entice others to also spend money to get those cosmetics it s not a matter of if they can or can t it s a matter of which makes them more profit
i like the idea of the toggle i feel that would manage to please both sides of the debate
yea you re right unfotunately if the cosmetic content is somehwhat well integrated into the world that s fine for me but if it s now that d be disappointing
i don t know if there is a single game out there which offers that and the only reason for that is that a player wearing an mtx advertises it to other players i don t think blizzard will be the company to change that
it will be both
hah not for me but i kinda admire the crafter for realizing what is hot right now
these things would be so much more popular if they also made popular android versions too like i get that iphone is way cooler or whatever but still i love it and i want one but oh well
soooooo some art plastered on a basic case aight
don t call me until the limited edition lilith fleshlight is out and or limited edition inarius fleshjack

awesome i hope you like the selection
druids look exactly like every person that s complaining about how druids look edit someone is so triggered by this they sent me that reddit crisis help thing whoever it was you re fucking hysterical and you made my morning lmfao
i made my druid look like a school dinner lady and named her ruth
my issue is game si so zoomed in that druid taking like half of the screen
i know this might sound crazy but a game that has dedicated itself to be more personal with cut scenes in character dedicated customization options for hair skin and face not having a body type is insane not everyone wants to play a tiny necromancer or thick fucking druid it s just lazy
druid is clearly solid muscle not fat starting to think ya ll want peak human performance to look like chris evans or arnold schwarzenegger when people who actually win strong man and lumberjack etc competitions based on strength and endurance in real life look like the druid not like professional actors or body builders
there doesn t need to be lore to explain why their body looks the way it does it s just character design their body is just one tool of many to suggest features of how they act play so what does their design suggest that these characters are slow heavy hitters and probably have good innate resilience they don t seem like the kind to be dashing around the map with flips or spells but will be channeling powerful spells or swinging big weighty physical attacks i didn t play the druid myself so idk if the game play matches the design but it s clear what kind of fantasy they were aiming for at the very least
druids look like they keep eating the animals they re supposed to keep safe
my druid is modeled after maui shapeshifter magic user of nature you re welcome
at first the druid was a bit weird to look at but bro once i got and started getting full legendary gear he looked sooooooo sick
we need a d4 circlejerk sub
the druids have sumo wrestler body types i don t believe for a second they are eating that much
i care thank you op doing the lords work
so many obese vs strongman arguments it all comes down to people who like the appearance and those who don t there s no harm in having more body options and frankly i mean it for all classes not just druids
since none of the player characters are actual lore characters they should just put in a modern character creator i don t know why blizzard is incapable of doing this in any of their games when so many other games with much less budget have been offering it for years
any why is it that everyone assumes that they are body builders power lifters etc they talk to trees and turn into wolves how does that fit into your lore
what part of i transform into a werewolf is to be a thick boi if you ever played diablo the were wolf form looked anorexic slapping people with these like limbs like sticks and running fast as fuck boi also if we are going to go by lore then druids shouldn t be fat as fuck they should be a slightly almost as thicc barb but still somewhere between slim build they are more like irishmen built from even concept art and lore wise even thicker i m sure it was said somewhere that druids got stuck in feral forms and shit this is what a druid looks like https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/druids?file=druid\_artwork.jpg](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/druids?file=druid_artwork.jpg)
yes the diablo manual called them giants said they were bigger than other humans the diablo druid character was also made to appear taller than the other characters
i think they should just allow all body types then no one can argue about it
guys it s as simple as present options fat and slim whats the problem with that i know money time work etc but if the issue is being represented this is not the way to go right no one is asking for a fat wizard right and i dont see wizards doing excercise to be fit
tell that to the skinny ginger druid
i dont think people care about what s lore accurate more specifically i should say i agree with your point as well most people don t know it s lore accurate but knowing this information isn t going to change peoples minds also who says it s lore accurate because the druids didn t look like that in d2 it sounds like you made up a reason to make it make sense
you re assuming they don t maintain a physical life style meanwhile they literally transform in werewolves and werebears and fight on top of that living in the wild is incredibly hard and they probably are not eating that well anymore
except diablo had a druid and he was tall lanky thin and a redhead usually when you reintroduce characters and character classes from earlier in your own franchise you want some nostalgic resonance for fans of the original and that argument about eating a lot and not being as active the only thing that that would explain is why they are so physically weak typically native peoples who lived off the land were not fatasses it takes even more effort to get food when you re hunting for sustenance the only exception tends to be tribes with fish based diets for obvious reasons
it s not the body size that annoys me but the lack of face options druids are traditionally iconic in british and irish culture yet all the facial options are either for african or some weird roman greek slavic mix completely throws you off the name of druid might be pedantic but it s annoying as fuck
i think we need more daily essays on reddit bout this all so important issue i ve been losing sleep it s that important
being an offshoot of barbs wouldnt necessitate druids being bulky its just your headcanon saying they eat a lot and are sedentary lol
not going to body shame but barbs necros and druids with their rather extreme body types highlight how silly it is for them to give us many options for faces hair and skin color but impose body types on the classes we don t need the korean games micro fine tuning or boob sliders that make all characters look like teen supermodels but some choices for body shapes would have been nice even if they were pre made bodies barbs don t all need to look like the governator druids don t all need to be corpulent or all necros anorexic
someone should tag the developer and ask if there will be more options available for char customization at start of the game or later on or in the battle pass cosmetic shop body type hair face preset tattoos they seem to answer occasionally to questions like that i would but i dont have social media accounts so yeah
why dont they just give us a body slider for weight muscle or is that too much to expect of a small indie company
druids should look sturdy to shapeshift but i think most ppls problem is theyre making barbarians look non barbarian strongman bodybuilders p
the female druid look like lizzo i was expecting more of a serena williams
there s just a flaw with that logic you dont go from hulk to fat hulk at birth your great great great grabd father sure he was a barb then a year later he got super thicc while following deers in the woods you you ll just be fat
yeah yeah yeah that s great and all just add it to the possible body types that we could choose i really just want to have a beefy necromancer they look emaciated as hell
i mean it s a fantasy game where you can shapeshift into animals and summon the dead there doesn t have to be a realistic depiction of everything if you were using realism as a basis for how everyone should look then realistically everyone should be bone thin and starving because d4 takes place after malthael s apocalypse so it would be reasonable to assume food is scarce and most people aren t the size of modern body builders and strength trainers not to mention the barbarian s civilization has been destroyed and their people scattered i have no idea how barbs can constantly find enough food to maintain their size lol i will say i did like the druid s look in d4 but there is precedent for a skinny druid lol d2 s druid was pretty slim
except the original game has a skinny druid that kind of throws off you lore theory
then i guess necromancers should look like nikocado avocado because of all the time sitting on their ass learning spells lol
a druid can be lore accurate and ugly its not because its accurate that it makes me tolerate the look of a female druid good for them but ima skip that class
as somebody with a non hollywood body type i am happy to see different body types personally i believe any class can be large just like a druid even the rogue a large fat character is more realistic immersive than a 4ft11 woman drawing a 6ft longbow if realistic immersive aren t important to you then what s wrong with us having any body types
this isn t accurate the lore for a druid would have them running through the woods with beasts and foraging for nuts and plants they would be undergoing more consistent physical activity via trekking miles upon miles and have less available high calorie food sources i get that people like having a fat character but we don t really need to come up with weird stuff to defend it druid is fat it s fine
im so happy to see my body type represented cool bro can this community go back to talking about anything important
i m starting to think there s s bunch of blizzard drones in here sent to convince the community to accept less for the same cost we just want options i want an average looking dude not overly buff not strongman but some dude who picks berries and talks to bears vice versa i want a short necromancer whose a bowling ball and i want more hair tattoo jewelry options to many times a solid tattoo was ruined because of the face tattoo or jewelry was good except the ugly nose ring my own hair style doesn t exist in d4 and that s a bit disheartening we just want more options other games easily manage this including other blizzard titles it s not why can t we get more diversity in diablo
at the beginning and end of your post you describe druids as fat lazy and retired how are they still eating a lot if they were eating a lot it s not like they have access to over processed food society super markets and comfy living they have to live in the wild and eat off the land hunting and gathering their food that type of life style doesn t turn a barbarian fighter into anything resembling a retired sedentary barb because they are in the wild and if they acted like that they would be dead who the fuck cares about body fat percentage and every excuse coming from people trying to say druids aren t fat they are fat you damn well know they got into their cocaine binge fueled meeting room and said ok boys let s get some good press to show we can accept all body types instead of the headlines of us being raping degenerates they clearly have muscle and they clearly have excess fat if anyone should be fat let s just make all the casters walking blobs since they rely on magic instead of physical abilities my main complaint with druids aren t that they are fat but aesthetic wise their faces and hairstyles are fucking horrible for both sex
what the fk is the druid eating to become so obease tho i dont see how a surival druid end up like that ever ever seen an obese nature hibbie nop that druid guy is like calories a day to maintain that unit he has to munch so much forrest food and lets wolves gather the food or somthing
then what i expect druids to look like https://imgur.com/gallery/q8xodfq
i like how they look especially when wearing robes but it s a preference and i m lucky in that regard i m also fat
you people give waaaaaay too much of a shit about this
it s all about getting in line with the 21st century diablo druid is not fat it s actually pretty athletic it might look skinny to people from 21st century tho but since it was coded in the s it looks like exactly these times nowadays everything is fast food chains with trash food mcdonalds etc not to mention the absurd amount of millionaires that feel they need to spend more money for food but not for quality more often than not for quantity
i play druid because of how he looks
at least let us have green skin and hair for our shrek mains ooh and a donkey pet would be hilarious
we don t care about lore
who cares
i never in my life saw a fat warewolf shifter or an obese hermit tipically a hermit hunts his own food making it impossible to be obese
they look like actual strong men women with a bit of a healthy layer of fat perfectly toned muscles are seen on people that specifically dehydrate themselves to look this way
you know what s actually annoying not how the druids look because i fucking love diversity like this to bits yeh for sure gimme a thick strongboi and girl fuck yeah but the fact that this western mentally has somehow villified the word fat so much so that you can t for hte life of y all admit that while on that body there s a mountain of muscle over and under those humongous muscles there is a thick ass layer of fucking fat why are you so revolted by the idea of admitting that these strong ass human bears are also at the same fucking time fucking fat you can admit that and be ok with it it doesn t fucking make sense that you equate saying they re fat with saying fat is horrible yes that is how strongmen look yes strongmen are giants of muscle but also at the same time strongmen are fat as fuck and people here are anyway only talking about external fat when the reason why strongmen have barrel sized bellies is that they have an inordinate amount of visceral fat under those abs it annoys me to no end that suddenly people see barrel sized mountain men and cannot for the life of them admit that a big chunk of that besides the fucking muslces which are also gigantic is in fact external visceral fat
druids are strong mfs who aren t on a bulking diet and dont have a specific workout regiment they would just eat a lot probably mostly meat and they would perform the physical activity you d expect of a mountain man or survivalist just prolly turned up to they d eat a hell of a lot more tho they look exactly how they should fat and strong people bitching about druids look dont seem to realise that bodybuilders in competitions and actors on screen look the way they do because they re cutting leading up to whatever event they have to look that way for and they dehydrate themselves for it too druid ain t gonna look like barbarian just cause they perform a lot of physical activity not how that works eta if any of the lore directly conflicts with what i ve said feel free to correct me im not deep into the lore i just in general think the whole discourse is stupid i like druids look and i think it makes sense if you dont like the way a character looks thats fine i dont like how thin necro looks but his look does make sense
ok make them run slower then you know lore wise they are bulky
my head canon is they need that extra weight because turning into a fucking wearbear is extremely taxing on the body
tell that to people who designed druid in d2 imo d4 druid looks terrible especially female version is like a fat old witch
perfect now i have a good argument to me being a large fat man vikings where big and strong and they actually derives from barbarians from the roman empire time so my ancestors where literally barbarians now i am a man living in scandinavia i like animals and i don t eat meat this makes perfect lore friendly sense now i m basically an irl druid lol
i d probably more go like this they need the body fat for extra energy reserves since transforming the whole body takes lots of energy doesn t mean it s my cup of tea though i d prefer rogue body type on my female druid since i like to play dress up things i would could wear probably a similar reason why i won t go barbarian it s just a bit too much for my taste
thick with two c s
it s hard to answer according to lore just because druids are offshoots of the barbarians doesn t mean they will all still be big and muscular after so many generations almost everyone has physical laborers in their ancestry but that doesn t mean everyone has the same type of figure also we have no idea what impact shapeshifting has on the muscles and metabolism if they do physical activity in werebear form does it train their muscles in human form do they burn more calories in werebear form would werewolf druids have different body types from werebear druids
they should just add this stuff to character creation i want a fat sorcerer too instead of an emaciated looking one
people are complaining about the way druids look in game man people just like to complain about anything
i like to think that they are bulky and tall because the more mass they have the bigger and stronger their werewolf bear form becomes after all it s shape shifting not materializing an avatar out of thin air like an archon mage or something
i think what it comes down to lore wise is how exactly shapeshifting impacts the human form s body if you shapeshift into a bear and then lift super heavy weights does that then translate to improving your muscle mass in human form at an enhanced effect like as if you re goku training in a gravity machine or does any muscle use in bear form have no impact on the human form s muscles this is scientifically the only question that matters imo to determine the lore accurate body type for druids
druids can shapeshift into bears they have bear body types not complicated and nobody s complaining about a bear s body type p
i just embraced it like a little john friar tuck stereotype and named my druid nofkfriartuck
the druid looks like it moves tree trunks as a hobby
i ve said this before and got shat on for it i don t know why so many insecure people are so upset about fictional body types let druid be a big strong chonky boi for fuck sake
search on youtube or google strong man competition and strong woman competition male druid looks similar to guys like eddie hall or thor from gow but even biggest strong woman is not even close to how big and wide female druid is so imo male druid actually looks like strong man while female druid is that big just to match male druid
druids are the strongman to the barbarian bodybuilder
you ve got it so backwards my friend if you think druids are not as strong you need to go look at worlds strongest men that ain t fat that s muscle think about it if your 200lb trying to move 500lb that s of your body weight but if your 400lb trying to move 500lb that s only of your body weight 500lbs is 500lbs but relatively it s going to be easier to move it with the leverage provided by a 400lb body
druids look fucking amazing people are dumb they re clearly inspired by the polynesians and look fantastic as a result
honestly cringe how upset some people are about it first time i ve seen a female character have that build in a game and they want to talk about a lack of variety smh
i do play pen paper and i also have a druid there he looks exactly like the druid from d4 since he s a bear shapeshifter druid he will hibernate from time to time and lose a ton of weight like he searches for a cave sleeps in there together with his wolves and when he comes out some months later he looks more like the necromancer thin with very long grown hair ready to eat and to drink a barrel of coffee but he s on his peak prime performance at the start of d4 also due to all the demons hibernation is not an option this year so he stays in his marvelous shape actually i m very happy the druid in d4 is so close to the druid in d d the spells and verything i m gonna rebuild my druid with his style and spells no matter how much he will suck actually i think a druid pet build with earth magic bear might be very viable in d4
druids look awesome it s big boy season
just gonna name my druid maui stronk big boi shape shifter fits the bill perfectly
here we go again
barbarians are warriors that spend of their time in gym druids are warriors that spend of their time throwing lumbers around and also ate some funny looking mushrooms joking aside barbarians are strong body builders and druids are strong man
druids just look like classical strongmen basically bodybuilders but without the dangerous and unhealthy dehydration or steroid use you need to get that sculpted look
most people in the thread are actively avoiding to talk about female druids says a lot about the topic
i love the large lads and lasses of the druids feels like i can body slam and headlock all the demons of hell
the size does not bother me it s that the female druid is heavier and also looks way older than the other classes you can be overweight and still be objectively pretty plus as nice as inclusive size is most people play games to escape reality and i am overweight so for me it is escapism
i don t care if my druid is thick but where is the tails for were transformations
i love the thick boi look it s a nice twist
im lifting and i like druids they look like strongmen and playing them kinda was cool they are slow 17dmg but still fun abilities
the druids look like the mountian with a bit more of a tummy and i m here for it they look awesome
yeah it made total sense to me barbarians are about feeling that burn and sculpting their body into a litteral temple like body builders and druids while strong aren t about that boby builder grindset so they more resemble irl strongmen who tend to have more bulky physiques than muscular
i just want to play fat sorceress please
i like it i m rocking a dad bod and can relate nothing wrong with it in my eyes
barb body type is unrealistic go look at strongman competitions
druids arms build like dinner ladies arms could bench press diablo with those arms
i really like the way the druid looks

he is wide because there has to be a lot of good person
even though i ll end up playing as a male druid i had a lot of fun playing with her appearance never bothered me too many japanese and korean fantasy games have lead people to believe all games need the uwu sexy character no matter the setting while i like the archetype of a radagast type druid they do tend to be a more nature barbarian so big size makes sense https://preview.redd.it/nswret6853sa1.jpeg?width=2447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2da19a574745e5e5d3f56ae5ae35e8e84c78ed8f
druid bod is the new dad bod you say
i like the fact we ve got a diverse range of body types to be honest i d love if they added a priest class which would wear cassocks and then made it a really obese body type no muscle tone at all plays into the holy person who indulged too much trope
a few weeks could mean or it would mean we just don t know
we don t know when that is happening why would it matter honest question i don t like the idea of seasons but if they do something compelling enough for me to participate in it i ll just use a class that isn t my main i guess if you will only play one class i kind of agree with your concerns i want at least months with my first toon b4 i even consider it but we don t know so w e
if that s a problem for you you could just skip the first season and wait until the second nothing and no one is forcing you into a season your first character will always be there it wont get deleted when a season starts
i just think you re reading into it too much we all have the same limited information from blizzard sit back and wait for them to release more information before speculating or stressing out over anything
blizzard have never said few weeks that s people assumption all they have said is season will start weeks before launch and months is weeks it will take time to fix bugs exploits and balance if we don t want the first season to be a complete disaster p s yes i know they could have said months instead marketing
yeah but with language there are hints it would be way more common for someone to refer to weeks as a couple of months than a few weeks hope i m wrong but just figured we d get more like a standard seasons worth of time and things seem to indicate a significantly shorter period although you could be right
unless the person is making up their own language a few weeks cannot mean
why does it matter it doesn t a whole lot but i paid for the deluxe edition which has the bonus reward tracks so i m kind of obligated to use them and see what s up or waste it im just mildly concerned that i will just be getting to a good spot and then season will launch if i don t play it reward bonuses are bust and if i go and start it could just be a little disappointing to start over depending on the timing i just hope they allow for enough time for most folks to see and play through the campaign and some end game before rushing to start seasons
does the bonus reward track stuff from the deluxe edition work for season if you skip
to me personally it wouldn t make a difference if it were or even in weeks i ll definitely have a maxed character that s started the endgame i wouldn t be opposed to starting a new one at that point
it would be way more common for someone to refer to weeks as a couple of months than a few weeks try telling this to a new mother
well i believe it was stated that season would release weeks after launch and not a few weeks which could mean or
i ll be with you in hoping they make the right move here too note i just visited the site again the skip is for the seasonal bp not seasons themselves so i don t see how this happens within months of release
possibly i hope so
probably not since the pre order page specifically states season you have to scroll to the very bottom of the page to see the fine print
it would make a huge difference for me i may only get hours a week of game time hours is quite a big difference
my guess is weeks
then just don t play seasons they are optional
it won t take you hours to get to end game
same
i mean i probably spent at least hours on the beta and didn t nearly finish half of the content available not all players will be rushing
death trap has the following skill tree upgrades prime death trap enemies are pulled into death trap when it activates supreme death trap if death trap kills an enemy its cooldown is reduced by seronds the following that you are talking about is not an upgrade in the skill tree but a unique aspect that can be found on the unique pants called eyes in the dark eyes in the dark named gear s unique aspect unless it hits a boss or player death trap will continue to re arm itself until it kills an enemy however death trap s cooldown is increased by x
deleted
i find it funny you ask him if he ever saw a skill tree when you are giving him wrong info about one what he is describing is one of the rogues ultimate skills which only has upgrades and you can definitely take them both this is apparent on skill tree calculators just in case you want to check one out
oh i didn t read it the skill in question only that there was conflicting information about taking both or having to choose excuse me if i assumed they were talking about the branching ones i should take the time to read more details but i m accustomed to posters just generally having no clue about basic game systems
haha all good i replied in jest just because of the irony i know how it can be
around the launch of mop for wow skill bloat was so damn bad you had to macro half of them to even have a chance at winning arena in pvp then again people like skill rotations in mmos but this is an arpg and d4 is console focused so even if we wanted more skill slots it probably won t happen anytime soon less skills is better in the long run skill bloat js the absolute worst and signals bad balance in general imo
personally i like only having skills
tell me what build in diablo use more than skill
limited skills hotkeys is to accommodate console support if that was years ago no one would care about console since it wasn t a market yet and the old console games were vastly different than pc games nowadays companies focus on suitable product to release on all consoles pc for bigger marketing exposure and that s how most pc games started looking like mobile console games simply because companies are trying to utilize platform compatibility where same game can be played from with people using another platform the age of gaming will turn most games into console mobile copies assuming mmorpg s will remain mostly pc oriented because it s key feature in mmo s to have skills for every little thing and line them up on rows total skills for more variations of skill rotations since that s the most important thing in mmo s in arpg s is the opposite gameplay is faster with less total skills while the mmo s gameplay is slower but with more in depth choices of skill rotations
i am just saying we should have an option not to invest in a skill that we don t want to use we are still limited to
a limit on number of skills is the only way cooldowns make sense yes we can talk about cooldowns and whether they should be used but that s a different topic
yes you could still have of then in d2 and you would not feel inferior

you can have button to switch between hotbars there is even a very popular old mmo that can be played on console just fine
this isn t true d2r controller on pc and console supports a modifier key giving you more buttons
i know what mmos are i just don t like wow after wod i have also played thousands of hours on gw2 poe since and most other popular games like lost ark im stuck at brel im not saying arpgs need to be wow i just don t see a point of having more skills than slots that are impossible to avoid in other games you either have more or even unlimited slots while in d3 you are not limited to take any
only issue with the console support argument is that with buttons on the right triggers and the ability to push the analog sticks in as extra buttons that s more than the number of slots already not to mention that one of the buttons could be used to rotate between hot bars i understand that they use a button to interact pickup but the rotating hot bar thing still applies either way
yeah it s a good anount if they add a 7th it better be ultimate exclusive
true newer games all lean towards the cooldown skill system that probably serves better not sure i am not a huge fan of cooldown skill systems but it s not really a big deal once you get used to it
there is a reason behind obtaining all the skills in the game it s called making your own choice imagine if that was d3 every class has access to all abilities and all runes at all times except that you pick what you wanna use now which doesn t provide your character with personal meaningful choices you just play the character that everyone else plays having trees with limited points and choices to make give a lot more weight on the choices you make that is cool since d4 has mmo aspects it s really important to have these choices be relevant in the mmo scene just so you stand out of other players around and feel unique
there is probably also hotkeys on the controller for menu dash inventory etc is it not
as i said maybe move some passives to basic so you can avoid active skill no need to add 7th i am talking about concept here
i think this is it it s probably much easier to balance around a lower number of active skills
i am just saying we should have an option not to invest in a skill that we don t want to use we are still limited to
also i did not even mention that you can have to skills which also grant that skill free so you can put it on your bars its a nice concept to have some and then dump your points in passives and take active from item which means more skills anyways it just feels so limited i don t know it feels like system has a lot more potential than it is realized
select start but yeah dash probably takes one of the other buttons i mentioned still though rotating hotbars have been used on other console games heck stardew valley does it
yeah but they won t do that again i like some people want a 7th which i won t care as long as it s ultimate exclusive
yeah for balancing fewer skills is definitely much much easier to do unless you make of the skills be placeholders or sort of like why have warcry that gives dmg reduction for seconds but also gives move speed for seconds and resource generation for seconds or lets add more skill variety take warcry break it down to different skills called warcry warcry warcry and each give bonus instead of having skill with multiple bonuses they could have easily done that but the question is why i wouldn t want to prebuff with skills everytime i want to hit a boss d
well you don t want to have enough points take all skills that would be straight up dumb how do you think would it be better to have different skills at once how are you going to balance out them all then there is a giant difference between having skills and skills with skills you balance the game around skills usage more powerful and meaningful skills but less in total with skills you balance the game around skills usage way less powerful skills and probably meaningless but way more to use keyboard smash gameplay use everything dmg each to get your dmg output which one do you prefer
here is the thing if you have skills then you can balance the game around skills usage at a time which means more powerful and meaningful skills with less total number of them if you want skills hotbars well then you have to rebalance the entire game around that which means a lot of skills but each one of them is going to be fairly weak you have to add combo effects also fairly meaningless on it s own and gameplay like smash the keyboard sort of thing until you rotate all to get the same effect with the skills system
yep excellent point
i prefer having two or three different passives connected to basic skill cluster that way first three levels i do not have to take active skill just the passive and move on to the next cluster core skills or whatever
also in end game you wont use skills because you maxed only and passives but in diablo you could still use lvl teeth for better clear with necro with to skills not because teeth deals more damage but it clears better in waves it sure gives flavor to the game if you ask me and to your character diversity
but what is the point of investing in basic skill if you don t want it in build in certain scenario like pvp you can t avoid it ergo you do not have skills you have
this is also why i think d2 was so intelligent design you had faster cast rate and its a limiting factor on your smashing the keyboard thing also mana although you could bind them all you actually had one two button s to fire them
how are you planning to play a resource generating game without a resource generator skill but hey i might be wrong about this there is passives on each section after the base section so your argument of not having generator skill when the game is all about skill generators and skill spenders blows my mind
i am pretty sure you will be able to do that even in diablo but not for core basic ultimate skills i am not sure if you are aware that even tho you can only put points into skill yourself you can have up to level skill in the end game so additional points so if you have spare gear piece with x to something you could swap that for your prime thing and use a different skill without even having points into it and use the generic y to category skills to boost it up to at least level easily
because the damage of all of your skills scales with item power ilvl damage of your weapon so even with a base skills you would still do substantial damage and generate resource you mentioned diablo i don t understand what you are saying man really it s like bragging about why do i have to spec into howl i don t need it i want to have my warcries juiced up you steal a point from me of having to put point into howl to access the rest
well when it comes down to diablo they made that game almost perfect i am not denying that diablo is the banger of all but it was different times back then different technical difficulties may be the d2 devs might have wanted to do it differently than what it is but technical difficulties stopped them no one knows however a lot of diablo systems are straight up better than in most games in the past years like one for example loot system probably the best ever in any game absolute banger of rng that makes everything so exciting to find because you never know when and what you are going to find
then d3 blowed your mind
yes and that is exactly where i see huge potential for d4 and i think it would be more interesting to pick something of the item like you said instead of a basic skill
difference is whatever skill i take i can at least use it btw howl is very powerful skill especially for hc in diablo we had no limitations beside lvl in this weird mix diablo it looks like system from d2 where we have a tree and forcing you to pick a skill you don t have slots to use seems like plain garbage design tbh
no you just use whatever you want who cares of of your points are at the base skill think of those points as mandatory prerequisites to even have a skill tree to work with
think of the base skills as progress path towards the next block of skills it s not a waste because without these base points you wouldn t even have a skill tree to play with
you seen the intensified version looks pretty sick to me
and you couldn t be arsed to provide a video also how is this a technical issue question
i didn t even bother using it tbh i liked the move in diablo but it s just so stale and basic lol
thought it was my favourite visual in the game tbh
the texture doesn t matter it just doesn t act like a real flame just goes straight like a laser even when you rotate looks stupid
yes indeed
you want the flame to slightly swerve looks like a proper flamethrower to me the one argument i d actually understand is that you can rotate to fast which ultimately doesn t look to great if you spin around a bunch but i bet it s one of those quality of life things wouldn t want incinerate builds to be unable to catch up to rogues dashing behind you now would we
it doesn t act like real flame because it s magic
what are you going to do about it
they want each part of the fire once its expelled to continue moving with its own direction and speed that will be unaffected by any subsequent movement of the caster so if you spin around while continuously expelling flame each section of flame should be expelled at a different angle and the overall flame should end up forming a spiral shape around you if you oscillate back and forth while expelling flame the flame should look like a wave shape
no each account for the pc will need a copy of the game
my understanding is game licenses are associated with battle net accounts generally but i think there may be an exception for this game and console to accomodate for couch co op
you just need to be logged into their battle net from my understanding
yeah shouldn t have any issues whichever account you start the blizzard launcher with will be that specific account
you can t share in real time the same account on pc only at a time use this works only on console because they can hold multiple accounts logged at same time psn accounts windows can t do that
this is why i miss the days of the cd it shouldn t matter who is playing as long as there is only one instance of the game running cd key sn
it is a ps thing anyone can play the console owners games if they sign in on that machine not sure about xb
as long as the home xbox account is set and owns the game its works for another account logged in that doesn t have the game or have gold
cool same as the ps thanks for the info mate
can t wait for the diablo iv beta saved my marriage posts
add slim druids too
add respec concerns
the its ruined other games is such a lame karma farm like please
i want all my money back because the font in the game was not what my dumb spoiled ass wanted
the new one i see is i don t like seasons ladder resets
add fat sorceress
skeletons didn t even look that bad tbh
i feel like i see more complaints about complaints than actual complaints
don t forget the people crying over how the font ruins their immersion
lets not forget running back in dungeons suck goes playing diablo where thats all you do
i m gonna name my femdruid karen
need people crying about respec and saying how it s too high when they have no idea the value of gold or the time to takes to farm that much
im waiting for my turn to post i still have withdrawal from the beta i cant enjoy anything i watch diablo lore videos
ppl who believe it s ruined other games will only get hrs tops in d4 and then get bored guaranteed
i really don t get how the beta ruined orhe rtypes of games the beta was okay nothing special kinda braindead easy too
the same weekend as the last diablo beta there was also a free weekend for midnight suns since i already knew i was going to be main lining diablo on release i decided to give midnight suns a try i m really glad i did because i m really enjoying it never really enjoyed turn based games and it also being a card game seemed like it d be weird but i can t put it down this game will hold me over for a good chuck of this wait time for diablo
add
i wish they d stop crying missing the beta so annoying
i honestly passed on the beta because i figured i d rather just wait for release but i did buy d2r and beat it
i just want my female druid to look more realistic like all the skinny vegan self labelled druids i see on tinder
weird most posts in this sub have been shitting on the game for not being d2 or not being a real diablo wish i could see more appreciation posts
i m not canceling my pre order but the skeletons look terrible did it hurt saying the bad thing about the game
the ones who say it ruined all other games for them makes me laugh every damn time
only thing i didn t like was the character models for necro and sorc they looked horrible
instead of mentioning cancelling preorder i d have touched on druid lol
least they said the skeletons will have a different look
lol literally the post under this one is how d4 ruined other arpgs
honestly how much are people gonna talk about the game while we re on a month hiatus if anything these little thirst posts are just keeping it in the back of my mind while we wait
i hate that all games were already ruined even before d4 june can t get here soon enough
forgot seasons are bad actually
how do the skeleyons look bad they re fucking skeletons there s not much to work with there
every sub reddit is like this it s the sum of all the subs that make reddit interesting somehow
the sanctity of this place has been fouled
likes farmes
if only we had some mtx for giving them lipstick or wigs
gamers are predictable will say anything for some sweet delicious karma that makes them feel important in today s society simping it s not out crying the ghayme suxkzaerz then there s the who say whatever and get banned so we don t see their post for long those that care not for karma farming they aren t wanted around these parts on reddit
try grim dawn and last epoch to scratch itch
dae nailed the art style
d3 wasnt not made with a plan for necromancer summoner thats why necro in d3 with summoners is hardly a summoner you dont fell it like a summoner and now with d3 upgradet as d4 they took same problems aswell it will never feel like you play a summoner game is not designed for slow combat fighting few units at the time slow approach what ever you do dont try summoners
i was actually thinking that the skeletons looked like they were made out of glow sticks didn t realise this was something anyone else was saying i figure blizzard wants to try and sell me a grim dark more gothic horror skin for them
can t wait to explore sanctuary with my flat goth necro skull helm check scythe check boob straps check unfailing skeleton army check just give me some corpses to explode already
it was great and i miss playing it the skeletons looked fine lol
scoliosis slider to fix the necros shitty posture when that s my biggest gripe so far
d2 bad up arrows to the left
where s the font complaint i thought people didn t like that either lol i m also kinda done with seeing all the oh diablo iv you ruined everything else posts just stop
should add druid is over i am cancelling my pre order
i think skeles are fine should just be an option like the oddly super cloaked teammate summons it would be nice to be able to see if an enemy is fighting something or going to smite me instead
you forgot the karma farm what class are you gonna play first threads
i ll probably just undub and stop looking at this sub i did it for wow during bfa and shadow lands and made playing the game infinitely more enjoyable reddit will just always be full of the negative vocal minority
don t preorder so you won t have to cancel
it s basically a darker world of warcraft
no this is patrick
this sub is unironically filled with bots
i stopped abusing my wife because i couldn t pull myself away from the computer
hilariously i read like three comments about dudes just divorced so they re looking forward to the free diablo time
if they add slim druids then they better add fat versions for every other class which would be dope
guys let s remember my female druid isn t an anime character and this upsets me blizzard better make it look like the night elves i see in goldshire in wow or i m gonna refund the game s
i m just glad druids are getting beefcake representation in eq i always main d a druid but they were always some slim elf or human
i d settle for better male female face models
meh druid live in the forest and eat bear they are fine
deleted
i didn t know obesity was a fetish
anyone mentioned dungeon layouts yet
surely you mean we need more than skill buttons though yeah respec pops up a fair bit too
maybe it s just how they feel and people upvote because they also feel that way the sub will look like this until new shit come up they re just like us waiting to play and nothing cuts it anymore karma isn t real man downvote me to oblivion who cares
or it s astroturfing
disagree with it karma farm
i love that forums used to be about posting about something and gushing at your favorite thing with others and basking in the feeling of community or debating on how something could have some improvements but ultimately you all love it however now with reddit i guess it s a karma farm like you d think people would come into this reddit only because they like diablo iv but nowadays you get people that love it people that like it people that don t care people that think it could be better peope that didn t like it people that hate it republicans democrats haters master baiters and everyone in between and they all have an opinion and yours is wrong and all they care about is gaining reddit karma and wanting to gain karma is a bad thing i guess i m not sure where i m going with this but i m high so there s that all i know is i don t think i ve ever poster something in reddit for karma and if someone did good they ll get it if a majority agree with them or they won t also the druid male looks like me and i look damn hot and the druid woman looks like she knows she s hot but so does the necro all of them look sexy as all hell broaden your horizon s mah dudes and dudettes it means more sex for you if you like or just a better interaction and feeling with your fellow humans
i mean i enjoyed the game in the beta felt like a diablo game literally just yep feels like diablo it doesn t do anything crazy anything new doesn t break any gaming norms and doesn t do anything other games aren t also doing whether better or worse the ridiculous claims that all other games are ruined are absurd it was a pretty decent polished arpg and basically nothing more
it temporarily ruining other games makes sense you could only level to giving you the enjoyable experience of something new with much more over the horizon without the eventual drop off in excitement the first hit is free is a saying for a reason
my personal issue has become a minor issue but i don t want to grind altars every season but with mounts and dash rogue or teleport sorc it won t be too bad
fatsorc would be bis
fatomancer
they were absolutely terrible they couldve just taken the normal skeletons that are red glowing and made them blue glowing instead we had some travesty that looked like from another game they completely broke visuals edit https://imgur.com/a/btbvjr6 this is how they should have looked just in whatever blue hue fitting idk how to edit it so its actually blue im sure someone could do that in 20seconds i get that this https://imgur.com/a/krbz6ra was not enough and in some combat clips its hard to notice the skeletons were even there but there is so much better they could do imagine that red glow being the ghostly blue with the vapor like in the old footage it would totally be enough to stand out the red demon skellies stood out a lot from normal ones you could do something with animations and decals too that make it more noticeable what are you minions from their combat what we saw in beta just looked like some last minute slap on band aid
then you re gonna be upset that they announced they will change it are people really dowvoting me for repeating something the dev said come on guys pick a lane i thought you worshiped those guys and everything they ve done with the game
nah i think they did maybe just change the color from blue to something greenish or brown to be fair though i didn t notice it until it was pointed to me and from then on i notice it every time lol
really people are insane lol
i just can t take anybody who uses immersion seriously
the font really people are scraping the bottom of the barrel
hello i will be your punching bag the font seriously bothers me it s funny though because i would have never thought this could be an issue for anyone as well but this is the first time i ve been turned off by a ui it s the font discrepancy in d4 s ui that drives me crazy consistency is key
as a player who plays until bored and feels no compulsion to even finish a game once i lose interest i d be pretty impressed if i make it to
i m playing this game too the let s make friends life sim element of the game may be off putting to turn based fans just looking for combat
game looks cool but i see a bunch of ingame currency being sold on steam since it s a single player game this is a pretty big red flag what can you buy with this currency
i had nothing but good things to say about the beta
are the d2 players in the room with you right now that is the biggest fallacy in this entire sub i ve seen tons of thoughtful critical posts about diablo 4s systems in relations to skills items and character power i ve seen design criticisms in regards to class balance end game systems and respeccing i ve not seen a single person calling for diablo to be a diablo clone it s pure strawman
i see nothing but blatant praise for the game with basically nothing constructive or useful they generally are just diablo makes me so sad now that i can t play it nothing else compares like at least give some reasons why it s good but it s just useless fluff garbage posts praising the game
link them
i really liked how the necros looked
i think is more like i started going to the gym after i saw the druid now my wife has sex with me
well not surprised i guess
i honestly think they should it creates better roleplaying and opens the gates for the cosmetic options actually being somewhat worth it i just like making characters look how i want them to look
wouldnt make sense to have slim to fat options for all classes an obese or skinny barbarian wouldnt be fit for fighting theyd be either retired village elders or kids and necros use blood magic etc which id imagine drains a lot of energy from your body so makes sense they would all be very slim skinny rogues would never be fat or super jacked would make being sneaky and stealthy way too hard and so on
it s just going to be like female dwarves in wow that you never see because nobody plays them druids will all be male except for like females all with joke names about donuts and twerking
honestly if i don t want to fuck my character why am i even playing s
it s weird how they need a female character to be sexy enough to play on one hand for me class fantasy is that sorc woman but barb man maybe just habit from d2 but to moan about a game characters actual appearance like you ll bed them is wild
i like hairy chubby s am i m the only one
i instantly went for the female druid she looks amazing a buff woman calling down the fury of storms and blasting her advisaries with the might of the earth just seems so cool to me likely going to be my first playthrough when d4 releases
i like how not fat women are somehow anime characters oh you re not fat you don t exist
or i was imagining my driud would look like keyleth from critical role
cries in d2 bag space with mf charms
just dump all your grays bruh
d2 s inventory space was a fucking joke hated reliving it in the remaster d4 needs more space
mins is very generous used to be much more often in d2 d3 like every minutes
when you re max level you d be more selective either loot all for more mats or choose your loots and farm faster
dump anything that s not at least rare man
i wouldn t worry about that increased drop rates for betas were confirmed so i d imagine the actuall rates being way way lower tailored as much so you don t need to go to the town every single time you clear out a pack but i d love for a way to increase inventory space to be there regardless maybe on the region tiers or whatever it was called
hope they add a tab for gems
i m assuming the increased drop rates from the beta applied to the rares as well in which case it won t be as bad i had the same problem though during the beta i would need to unload at a vendor after every dungeon full of rares legendaries
more bag space is coming with the ingame shop
deleted
they really just need to have infinite bag space this is not
no
almost chance it s already very generous compared to any other arpg
i think the bag space is actually too big lol
drop rates were higher in the beta at least so relatively speaking this might be less of an issue in the real game
in the end game they said you would not need materials from grey or blue items so just ditch them also as people already pointed out the drop rate was higher in the beta you should be ok in the worst case scenario they will sell you inventory tabs
maby start to learn to not pick up everything thats my call
tis called the glorious stash brothers sisters we need not carry our loot on us for we have the stash ooooooorrrrrrrraaaaaaaaa
lol my first thought
dont need gold as much in d2 and d4 best way to get gold is pick up trash blues yellows
i m not toting around bags full of blues either
except it s like 10min since inventory is full after one dungeon
with rares being the best gear you can trade and turn into legendaries unfortunately that yellow you don t look at could be worth a ton in d2 people would not i d blue claws pally stat sticks but some are actually bis like for trapper or foh
this is the only thing i wanted changed after playing the beta that seemed feasible having the gems in my inventory just felt so much worse then in d3 and with other bag tabs already implemented adding one for gems would be a huge qol upgrade
easy per tab and i can see them make millions over it
honestly wouldn t surprise me it s not an add power to your character feature so i could see them doing this for sure
he s talking about inventory space not stash space
large charms just reminded me or grand now i don t feel bad about the tiny ass inventory i m d4
dump those too
or the fact we have tabs now quest items won t take up space and gives you the ability to do multiple before turning in we also have some things sorted for us which is nice how they left gems out of this is the only thing that drove me a little nuts but still i was able to put about or more things in my inventory to sell before i had to go sell amazing compared to d2r just as long as we don t go to the black hole bag of d3 i m fine that was just to much space imo
still different where as in d2 you would only pick up very limited good stuff except early oj to get a bit of gold and where is in d4 you pick up most of it just for materials for a long time because mats are very hard to get but overall they do feel abput the same when you account for that
really wish we could filter the greys and blues from even showing up
you can there s literally a loot filter built into the game settings
are you sure i think you are wrong here did you enable this feature they filtered only the sound for me not the visuals i think it was an accessibility feature for people with bad eyesight so they can better listen to item drops they are interested in
yep all i saw was the ability to filter sounds not visual labels would be great to see that i overlooked an item label filter
players specially perpetually online peope whi hang out in forums all day all have stupidly unrealistic expectations they sit here and gas light each other with low resolution critiques and ideas of how it should be with no serious consideration of real world constraints then they get mad when whatever game they have in thier head doesn t come to fruition it s a cycle as old as the internet
diablo has over years of player feedback seasons trial and error as you call it many issues that poe last epoch have solved should be copied such as move only interact on left click and attack without moving which this game doesn t have also no minimap bad ui for pc a lot of bad design decisions are being straight up copied from d3 such as damage multiplier items that all stack multiplicatively no thresholds so you don t need attributes to equip gear but each point of mainstat is a braindead increased damage so you just stack is as much as you can list could go on
your argument about poe having more time kinda isn t legitimate to be fair diablo and blizzard have way more time in the arpg genre to draw experience from but in general i agree with your posts core message
when you spend all your time thinking about what other people think about d4 you re gonna have a bad time if people have feedback let them
on the flip side diablo has had over years of comments as well as countless other games to draw inspiration from what works as well as what fails that this is the best they could do gives me worry especially given the time they have been working on it along with the experience they gained from d3 and ots issues especially since they are copying many of the same mistakes and removing a ton of the strengths of what made diablo what it is
diablo as a franchise could have very well rounded systems but it doesn t yet there is a universe where diablo devs decided to rework d2 systems and polish them and diablo expand on them instead we are getting this with diablo now it takes diablo systems and polishes them i don t want to say diablo systems are better or something its just this years of development on poe argument is nonsense and its not like poe only benefited from years you literarily cant play without using the lootfilter to remove of the drops in late game
when d3 came out i hit the physical gamestop at midnight to go home and install on my laptop with on board graphics and played through the lag til i went to work this time around i prepaid and have a amongst other things that s going to make this experience so much more enjoyable than the last just seeing how far i ve come in one diablo generation has raised my expectations for my own personal life now extensively my expectations for the game have already been met
i think the game will have one of if not the best starting base of any other arpg i think people just need to be patient if blizzard stands by everything they ve said about introducing new game features each season providing regular updates and balance patches and having players vote on the priorities for the game direction this will be a game worth coming back to each season and we ll be able to contribute to what it becomes be reminded most of the people in this reddit are not the core consumer casual couch players blizzard is catering to they re trying to please many types of players but the core consumer is not interested in a complex game they want green arrow good demons bad
how are our expectations insane we can look at the other dev teams that have been doing most things better than diablo for ten years and which blizzard could get inspiration from we can see that the budget blizzard put into the making of their games is incredibly higher than the budget of all these competitors and they re still not doing as good as them we have twenty years of feedback to blizzard that blizzard keeps ignoring x200b what s insane in our expectations diablo s skill tree has less variety and build possibilities than the skill trees of almost all hns released these past years and all these hns took less time to be made than d4 had way less feedbacks from their community way less money to work with way less people working on their games etc it s just a shame
none of the posts here will be taken into account by the dev team let s set realistic expectations
i feel like blizzard should not have to start on square one they have the biggest budget by miles they should take lessons about what works for poe and what they could take and put in the game that works with diablo as well they aren t last epoch some of these things should already be fleshed out they worked on it for years already
it s diablo this is an iconic franchise
keep coping dude
yeah because blizzard have a long history of listening to the community these posts are getting worse by the minute
dungeons are boring and worse then rifts in d3
d4 has some shaq sized shoes to fill considering it essentially made the genre what it is today and d3 didn t exactly deliver after firing the d2 team
mmm yeah i get it except blizzard has years in the space and fucked up diablo in preparation for this game poe doesn t matter to any diablo player it s not even on our radar anytime i see gameplay from that game it looks terrible and outdated the reason people are so hyped is because d2 started it all d2 was the glory days just like destiny was now they are bringing it to the current day generation and it s glorious that s why also reinventing the wheel is never easier than making your own version of what already exists i d hardly call poes ideas their own
i hate that people keep bringing up the minimap map overlay thing it s a design choice only because you don t agree that it s a good choice it doesn t invalidate the choice this dev team made for everyone they don t include overlay so you focus more on the environment having map overlay is really immersion breaking in poe endgame also d2 you are only focusing on finding the exit chris from ggg once mentioned players will optimize the fun out of the game that s exactly whats happening you are breaking the immersion in the world for efficency purposes and to be honest same happens with a lot of problems you are mentioning you are all cherrypicking because you don t want to like the game d3 has also terrible font for ui e g thing is again it s a design choice don t agree you don t need to if you dislike a game because the font they are using fine don t play it they are doing it for readability and ultimately ux stop pretending that you know what you are talking about and let the experts do their job they literally did a blogpost about ux research and i definitely trust the ux people on the team with decades of experience in their field rather than some random internet dudes even if i disagree with some design choices enormous flasks on the floor
and i m allowed to give my own feedback as well
i feel like d4 is what d3 should have been
people keep saying shit like this but you know what yoiu get when you try to include everything every player wants and every popular mechanic from every game from the last decades you get star citizen there a reason new entries in long running games tend to strip back to the bare bones version on release this is universally true it s not greed or incompetence like most idiots assume it s real world time cost and resoruce limitations
i agree they need to have a foundation with all the things you said but unless the endgame is a copy paste from other diablos arpgs it will require direct player feedback to refine it also saying they are coping many mistakes is an opinion i do think there are areas of worry but nothing that feels completely flawed at it s core in my opinion they could have had more endgame betas to help with this and that s a legit criticism but even then nothing compares with millions of players playing the game for feedback
that this is the best they could do gives me worry not me i wanted an mmo lite diablo with slower paced combat and traditional diablo classes it s exactly what i was hoping for they addressed a lot of my concerns from d3 useless paragon combat pace too fast etc as i said i don t want players designing my game i m good
and that s the problem are you making a big mac or a waygu burger
i think this will change and may even be purposely bland to allow them to add additional types of skills to the tree in later expansions think sorc getting arcane skills as new nodes along the tree will that still compete with the variety of other games in the genre slightly will it still appeal to blizzards core consumer absolutely
how do you know all this without playing the endgame most of your opinions are based on very little information you could be right but you also could be very wrong too much assumption we need to play the endgame before stating some of what you did as fact
i can assure you the major topics that people bring up get to brought to the dev team you can tell by their recent comments directly replying to a lot of the top rated comments from reddit youtube will they listen no clue but they do see them
use some brain power for a second without the bias blizzard hate this has nothing to do with them listening to the players for moral reasons it s about money if the game sucks and they don t listen they won t sell enough battle passes each season it s in their best interest monetarily to listen to feedback but nooooo blizzard bad mentality lol these post are so far removed with how the real world operates around money
i d rather play the d4 beta dungeons than any rift in d3 no hate just a preference
ah well i just gave my feedback to your feedback soon enough we have achieved world peace
d3 was 10x more difficult than d4 when it launched players cried because it was too hard so they made it into a literal meme game that s uber casual
except they are simply needing to iterate on designs they already know instead they are throwing them out wholesale for their own ideas most of the devs have worked on d3 so they should at least know their failures from that game and solutions to them instead they are copying many of the same things from that game that were problems then no one is asking for feature bloat people are asking for the features that are normally in arpgs and for many that were in the series proper to be included and expanded upon from a developer that has had years to do it with astronomical resources
you don t need a ton of feedback to be able to see the repetitive nature of dungeons nor the repetitive boss design those are apparent right now well before the end game and they are the design the endgame is based around
well i think expectations weren t that high simply there is nothing really exciting or fresh in the game at the moment there are solid foundations but that s it have a look at class abilities sorc and rogue has nothing new that s the first thing second they lost a lot of skills that wizards or dh had in d3 when i first used archon or even as basic things like arcane blast or dh chaining shot i was amazed it was that wow feeling here we have less skills and they have less interesting design that d3 ones that s huge disappointment then you have no runes to change skills and abilities and powers that actually change skills a bit in of cases do not change that s visuals that s another disappointment if being a regress when compared to year old game isn t a valid criticism then i do not know what is the same logic could apply to most other areas of game it should have stayed at least more year in development
yeah i think they re putting the game somewhere in between like a red robin gormet still catering toward the it s expensive but we can go out this weekend kind of customer instead of the food critic i don t think that s a problem for them just a choice they made and have to live with you can make a complex burger at one or two highly regarded restaurants and still be successful or you can make a decent burger with some level of care and sell it at a thousand locations around the world
personally i d like the tree to be good on release when i m paying for the game not good after years of additional work
my opinions are based on what i have aka the video they gave us they re the ones who chose to show me that video and receive feedbacks from the content of this short video what the hell do you want from me learning telepathy so that i can read in their minds and see if they re hidding other things from us that they haven t shown what s the purpose of this subreddit if not talking about the stuff that the devs give us and form opinion about it also it s really weird to me that you re saying i shouldn t have an opinion because i haven t played the end game myself yet but if it were someone who was like omg omg that so freaking good diablo end game will be the absolute best you wouldn t tell him anything you re fine with people having opinions on the end game if their opinion is positive even though they haven t played it themselves but you re not fine with me having an opinion on the end game because it s a negative opinion it s as simple as that
ok bro just look at blizzard track record these last years do you need to see wow numbers they made money by blowing on activision s horn and chain scamming hearthstone players apart from that being a blizzard can has been a nightmare since the 2015s
i think the dungeons are mostly fine i just wish it was randomly generated like last diablos even if it only resets the layouts every few hours
hahahaha that s literally what they ve done in d4 but it s not a carbon copy of poe with a diablo skin over the top so the spergs are losing their minds
you don t need a ton of feedback to be able to see the repetitive nature of dungeons nor the repetitive boss design but that s what diablo has always been about it s a dungeon crawler and how are the bosses repetitive i found their movement lists quite varied
what part of arpgs isn t repetitive it s legit the game design lol this comes form someone who has 10000s in the genre maps are repetitive but it s still fun the worry here is that the dungeons will feel tedious and not fun that s a legit grip and that s where the feedback will need to come in that can be fixed
yeah totally but it s a game designed to make money first provide enjoyment second and mostly only if it contributes to making money if you and millions of others refuse to buy the game because the skill tree isn t good enough they ll change it but this won t happen because for most people the skill tree is good enough today you re not the target audience nor are of the people in this reddit it sucks we can t get a perfect game but if they stand by their promise of taking player feedback and allowing voting for priorities maybe the game will be great in a few more years
i do agree that bringing it up is valid but without using the end game items paragon boards and seeing what people come up with how can you have a super informed opinion on the endgame being too simple
you mean dragonflight finally listening to its players and fixing of the issues from shadowlands did it a take a mass exodus for that change sure and they deserved a ton of hate for it but you last few years and the last year has been much better
it s been a dungeon crawler within randomly generated dungeons the layouts of floor changed as well as the sizes of each floor this helps change the pace of what you are doing the bosses are extremely repetitive with the mechanics of where you find them along with how you fight them they are all behind a locked door generally all on the 3rd floor of a dungeon which you need to unlock by doing some sort of repetitive task to achieve gaining keys carrying boxes killing all monsters then you go down are locked in a small arena with them and proceed to kite them around for a bit until they are dead if instead they were varied to be on the floor somewhere or had unique arenas had unique environmental effects weren t locked in an arena with them so you had choices in tactics to face them along with them having varied attacks to avoid during repeated runs that would help to alleviate the repetitive nature instead every fight is duriel in very similar dungeons over and over no matter which dungeon you are in
we will have to wait and see it could be that different zones have different dungeon themes but we won t be able to tell until it s released
i love when people suggest ideas that would make arpgs more fun for them or modernize them in a way that would make it more exciting for players other than diehard top down carpal clickers the arpg diehard fans always just say that s how it is like most of the stuff that makes an arpg an arpg is literally antiquated design limitations that have apparently pigeonholed developers of these games into forgoing any modern takes on action game development perfect example is what you just said what you find arpgs repetitive that s the point there can t be any new ideas or design changes to this genre it s been like this for years and should stay that way such a boomer gamer take and i m basically an old gamer at i just want games to be modernized and more fun not stuck in past design limitations based on silly takes like that s how it was is and honestly it s hard to go back to diablo style gameplay after playing games like dark souls or even battlerite and v rising
yes arpg s by their nature are repetitive the point is to mitigate that feeling as much as possible so the repetitiveness doesn t overpower the want to do it you do that with randomized content so no playthrough is the same you have differing playstyles through character customization so you can play different ways you enhance that with randomized layouts monsters affixes events and boss mechanics right now dungeons have nearly nothing to mitigate that feeling of repetitiveness i am hoping this is fixed but considering this is what they took away after years since d2 and d3 not to mention other arpgs they can draw from that is what makes me worried
in any case i m going to play d4 and grind it out but that doesn t mean i won t be critical if blizzard fucks up as bad as some of us are afraid they will if our lack of blind devotion is not to your liking the internet is definitely not for you
i m all for new ideas my entire post is saying i don t want them to copy other arpgs even at the cost of it not being great out the gate
i love when people suggest ideas that would make arpgs more fun for them or modernize them in a way that would make it more exciting for players other than diehard top down carpal clickers the arpg diehard fans always just say that s how it is maybe it s because you re coming into a series known for something and suddenly saying that it should become something completely different
the nightmare signals are what they re counting on to fix this issue will it be enough no clue we won t know until we play them that s my point people are having these extreme opinions without even testing the very thing designed to fix the issue if i had to guess i will say that it won t be enough and will require changes to reach a point to be on par with poe endgame and that could take a year i m ok with that as long as the game nets me hours of fun and continues to refine it each season
i agree on being critical it s how the game will get better how you re critical is what matters asking for poe is not the way people should do it giving direct feedback on what they have in the game is
just the wording you used is so arpg stockholm syndrome i understand the tone of your post but just the nature of saying arpgs have to be repetitive or whatever made me think of the million times my diablo fanboy friend tells me that s how arpgs are after i suggest something that could be better but isn t based on arbitrary design decisions like wsad on pc makes no sense to me that s not included when i can have my controller plugged in and switch between them on the fly and the game feels way different and more actioney and modern using a controller anyway my bad i wasn t tryin to stick it to you as much as just put it out there that arpg fans seem to have a mentality against changing or modernizing the games too much
copying good ideas and making a more polished and accessible version often watered down in complexity is what blizzard does and it does it well it s only fair that people voice their opinions of what is missing from their typically blander package systems wise compared to the often more complex alternatives that s not them saying we want the game to be a copy of other titles they want the product they already enjoy to offer them even more which is great considering this will be a live service living off of community feedback to some degree
i am worried that their takeaway will be let s just make rifts again as a result people are having extreme opinions only because these problems are apparent within the first levels of the game in the opening area i honestly hope i am wrong but with everything they have said and shown so far it seems to me that this terrible design will be prevalent through the endgame and nightmare sigils will not nearly be enough to counteract the design adding all creatures are now lightning enchanted or monster drop 3x more loot for example will not make the dungeon itself more interesting to run if it is the same dungeon you have run 1000s of times already
thats exactly what a lot of people did triggering massive butthurt d4 family responses this kind of feels like one and stop bringing up poe these games aren t even the same genre and they definitely don t cater for the same audience
my reply was in response to the above i like the item hunt personally but i m all for new ideas and think it could still use innovation
them not doing rifts maps is already a different route for better or worse they won t be doing what you said i personally would like a new end game system as i plan to play all the arpg seasons and new spin on each is preferred
i m all for the constructive criticism post so anything i said here is not directed at those it s the poe comparison post and there are a lot of those as well
i m a fan of the item hunt i just want the combat to feel more fluid modern on pc i hope they add wsad lol i just want it for bosses
this is a good guide about damage https://maxroll.gg/d4/getting-started/damage-for-beginners
probably best to wait for now they have said they are doing a balance pass before launch anyway when in game you can enable advanced tooltips this puts a x or next to the numbers on effects this lets you know if it s additive or multiplicative as an example an x crit damage would only be better than a crit damage if your existing crit damage is already higher than x when you have the base would give you an extra crit damage when you have the base would give you an extra crit damage x when you have crit damage would give you an extra crit damage when you have crit damage would give you an extra crit damage overpower is likely only going to be useful for characters that can reliably proc it with talents because it only has a chance to happen and there is no overpower chance items or effects in the game that we know of the tooltip says its chance cannot be changed
i think its difficult to say right now sometimes skills or aspects dont really follow the same rules so they probably need to be tested also less than half of the aspects were in the beta so there is a big chance that some of the ones you want are not known right now what i can say is that there is a distinction between additive and multiplicative bonuses additive bonus is displayed as multiplicative bonus is displayed as x3 multiplicative bonus is stronger of course stacking many exponentially increases the result
don t bother calculating for now the things we don t know are the legendary aspects they haven t put into the game yet the aspects that come with the tier above legendary how skill intensity will factor the functions of each skill the endgame resource economy for each class how important int for crit chance is for some melee classes like barb a smart barb imagine that there s far too many variables to do a reasonable calculation pre launch
amazing thanks a lot
the data mine shows that druid has legendary paragon passives that increase the chance of overpower by for earth earth while vulnerable and werebear skills that s what i m going for right now
and what would you say about this calculation say we have crit damage and we have to decide between multiplicative x30 crit damage or multiplicative x30 base damage you would always prefere adding your base damage right so base damage increase is better than crit damage increase x200b https://preview.redd.it/h977dnpshbsa1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01d615877d828464a4bb7c23af5217ce4b8618e1
what aspects that come with the tier above legendary aspects are the powers that are available from codex or on legendaries uniques affixes are not aspects as they cannot be removed and are static to the unique items is that what you are talking about
at exactly crit damage both x and are the same value when under you want but when over you want x if they are the same number when i said the base what i mean was that is the default amount of crit damage you have there is no stat that modifies your base crit damage like there are in some other similar games so for your calculation above crit damage crit damage crit damage crit damage x crit damage crit damage of crit damage so both your values with crit damage would come back as
nah i was under the impression sacred and ancestral legendary gear aspects cannot be placed on normal legendaries
okay but what interests me the most is the comparison between base damage scaling and crit damage scaling as in my calculation demonstrated
i m pretty certain they aren t new aspects just the sacred ancestral versions of the same aspects so rolls will be higher and can t put a normal aspect on sacred ancestral gear etc
oh yeah i see well most different named effects are calculated and then multiplied with other named effects however also our damage comes from skills and the skills are a percentage of our weapon damage so we have to factor that in taking to a level skill will give it extra base damage if your skill was going to do damage base then crit would make it do if you take that skill and give it ranks it would do base then crit would make it if you had an effect that says x increased damage with skill and its base damage is and you have crit damage then you would do damage because it s multiplicative if you have a skill at rank and give it ranks then it gets of base damage but that is added to the already base damage from the other ranks this skill with a rank damage of would have a damage of and crit with crit damage for but this is actually only a increase in overall damage damage compared to rank so the skills damage increase has diminishing returns per point
yes i guess so because you can t transfer legendary aspects to other legendary items so i guess as you said that sacred ancestral aspects will have higher ranges but same effects as legendary affixes
thanks a lot for your time and helpful answers appreciate it the situation for my question is do the example i have one item slot left for an legendary aspect i have to decide if i get an aspect with base damage in general for my char or the same crit damage for my main damage skill now coming to deal damage with my main damage skill from the results of our calculations i should always prefer the basic damage aspect because it always will have a higher end damage result am i right
that is my understanding but i could be wrong
enemies will scale to each player individually not sure how quests work but when a friend joined my fresh char he also saw the cutscenes
this game is basically a copy of elder scrolls online so you can look at that one for answers to how d4 will likely work the way scaling in eso works is the entire world and everything in it is lvl if a player is lvl he is behind the scenes upscaled to lvl in power so he can take on lvl enemies if a player is lvl he is similarly upscaled to lvl and this upscaling gets weaker and weaker as you get closer and closer to lvl so by lvl you have almost none and game feels a little harder because your character s actual gear and build matter whereas in early game upscaling is so strong you can get by even with garbage build and gear which works well because at lower levels is when players are learning to play but all of this is hidden from players if you are lvl and being upscaled to lvl every enemy you see will show as lvl if you are lvl and still being upscaled to lvl all the enemies are showing as lvl if you are lvl and playing with a lvl together the same enemy you re killing will be a lvl enemy but you will see it as a lvl enemy and your buddy will see it as a lvl enemy and you will both be upscaled to lvl to be able to kill that lvl enemy
i d imagine if you re well optimised you will snap them as the higher level
it s an open world there are zones not acts
thank you this helps alot
yea more skills and better build options will be how you get an advantage
i mean there are story acts even in beta there were story quests marked as act2 and act3 but we couldn t reach them since they were in their corresponding areas
wait what you think ball lightning was too fast doesn t compute it s very powerful but i stopped using it because of how slow it was
ball lightning specifically had the possibility to spec enhanced ball lightning that increases it s damage rate by of attack speed it probably needs to be balanced to be pretty bad without an attack speed build
to me it felt like it would pass the enemy too fast would only get maybe attacks off which just made it feel very lackluster
i experimented with that i equipped a 1hand weapon with much faster att speed but i did see any difference in the damage rate i assumed it was bugged in the beta i d say to balance it either slow the travel speed down or increase the radius of damage wouldn t need to be balanced if there s aspects in the late game that we don t know of will just have to wait and see
ignore the troll i agree it did seem like it moves too fast even spammed its hard to kill anything with it i wasn t a fan of it if anything i would have been fine with it moving the same speed or faster if they increased the damage radius to something like a radius of yards
if it was any slower it could teach them a language as it passed by it was glacial but if you felt the opposite to each their own i guess
i also agree that ball lightning travels too fast and the attack speed enhancement is based off of your attack speed bonus not your natural attack speed
ignore the troll so you disagree with someone and call them a troll
you definitely want that spell to be slow
i m actually shocked that you thought it was too slow i m going to rewatch some footage now to see if it looks fast or not maybe i ve forgot or was just disappointed with it
that makes more sense it will probably be more effective in the late game
claiming that you want that spell to go fast is so willfully ignorant of what it does that it can only be trolling
seems i struck a nerve go away troll
no the issue isn t the opinion it s the way they express it
ah more downvotes because people don t even understand what i said oh reddit of course you do my point was simply that it is really slow
i mean it s subjective i m not looking to win but i don t see how you can say it s too fast shrug
for example ball lightning travel speed seemed way too fast go ahead and tell us how we misinterpreted that on a spell that deals more damage the longer it stays near an enemy similar spells were nerfed to travel faster in d3
at this point i don t think you ve played diablo the spell is clearly too fast and clearly not powerful because of that you re not looking to win but in a similar context your clearly wrong good luck with your slow balls
holy lord i know that the more slowly it passes the more damage it will do assuming a mob doesnt move no shit it s also so slow as to allow enemies to move out of its way and therefore i can attack it faster with other spells but keep getting those upvotes headpat
it s you re good luck figuring out why this spell is still too slow as to be useful join my huge block list
you re really struggling with the fallen huh headpat
dude you re clearly the common denominator in all those unpleasant discussions you should reflect a bit but if you won t can you block me too we ll save time
ti max settings at 1440p no issues with fps cap
i was running beta maxed on 10gb at 1440p had it capped at 120fps diablo games were never demanding games for other games it is eternal battle red versus green while i don t like some moves from nv as a company i like features like rt and dlss drivers stability etc btw i won t even answer on eventual posts which will probably follow my post how amd drivers are quite stable and there is no problems now that was in a past etc all i can say to those ppl i am happy for you and happy gaming i would go with even with price difference which is almost double where i live for those cards but that s me
i have 5800x3d with a and at 1440p max settings the game was using 24gb of my 4090s vram fps was basically always at the cap i set for it but the vram usage is somewhat concerning because 20gb is a ridiculous amount all my other mates running lower spec systems were also having their vram starved at 1440p and had inconsistent frames one friend running a with a 3950x had consistent performance but it dipped in towns below until dlss got enabled one friend with a can barely play the game
both are overkill for 1440p
7900xtx will last you longer due to vram amount but overall performance is worse so you need to make a choice d4 should run flawlessly on both gpus had problems on
nvidia for dlss and ray tracing for other games i use amd cpu s but nowadays find there gpus to be lackluster have a ti myself
if you gonna keep the amd cpu i would go with amd gpu i heard using amd parts does something for performance that you wouldn t get using nvidia mixed with amd
the is the superior card for rt and it also has dlss which is better than fsr that being said it depends on your local prices i got my 7900xtx for cheaper than the cheapest so it was a no brainer for me but if they re equal in price go for the
your should handle 1440p max
played the beta maxed out on would recommend
either are overkill for d4 but it depends where you are and prices both cards are pretty much equal in raster performance but the has better features raytracing power consumption and temps this gen compared to the 7900xtx i commonly see lower priced s around xtx prices i wouldn t spend extra on a premium model like an asus strix for example its not worth the extra cost
is not worth it grab a cheap i ran 4k with over 100fps and dlss off dlss makes games look shitty compared to native on my so i assume frames would have been in the high s if not i d grab a and sit on the cash saved and get a series in nov performance leap on next gen will be massive vs the leap
for 1440p either both are gross overkill if 1440p is your concern save your money and get a 4070ti or a 7900xt i m going with a but i ll be gaming in 4k and the ti struggles a bit with it
performance are very similar but because 7900xtx has more vram you can crank up the textures and use fsr to its fullest
just wait for
overkill for 1440p
for fps 1440p at max settings i was playing on my xt no dips smooth gameplay
with a you are in 4k territory comfortably i would get a 4k oled tv or monitor if you are set on a
nvidia everyday better software and speed of updates imo
the game i believe will have dlss which is pretty amazing if you ever need more fps
gtx here got stable fps at 1080p medium with dlss set to quality the gtx should do similar
beta had memory leak i believe that will be fixed until release
were there specific tests how both cards behaved in d4 so far across all titles they are pretty equal performancewise in some amd is better in some nvidia is better but i doubt that you will see any difference on d4 with highest settings on 1440p
dlss isn t available on gpus prior to the series so that would have no impact on performance at 1080p the wouldn t have many issues however 1440p is substantially more demanding than 1080p which really pushed the even on low
very nice to hear thank you for letting me know
sorry my bad it was with fsr i think your friend should be playing at 1080p lol its not a 1440p card tbh i upgraded to a rtx right when beta ended should be better
np at least i hope they will fix it
hell ye congrats on the upgrade hopefully game runs even better for you now and yeah he should be at 1080p but he prefers complaining rather than solving his issues unfortunately
haha i see
we all have one friend like that lol
once i set textures to medium the game ran pretty flawlessly no discernible difference to high either on my 1440p screen
i think what you are calling performance problems was actually server problems diablo is constantly swapping your character between server instances this was most apparent when entering or leaving towns where you would get big rubber banding or invisible walls they improved this the last day of open beta but it still stuttered leaving these areas
only had lag because i was running out of vram on my after lowering the settings it was smooth sailing i m not sure if you should expect a decent framerate with a year old gpu and 1440p resolution on 1080p i could see it
13600k 1440p uw all maxed out no problems except serverside rubberbanding i really was suprised over the lot of negativity voices regarding the performance
played with a i7 9750h rtx mobile medium setting over fps on average i ve seen dips when loading dungeon and changing areas and some cutscene and some other moment the red circle event on the map when a bunch of mob appeared now it s hard to tell if it felt less than advertise since i have a hard time seeing the difference over 60fps i can clearly see when a game is below i guess the dip was somewhat frequent and make it feels like it was often laggy
you either run texture quality medium or you add about gb of virtual memory page file
i found that lag was directly related to how many other players were around solo dungeon no lag open world regular combat with other players nearby bunches of lag town horrible lag oddly enough world events with other players participating were relatively lag free things like bouncing backwards would happen and sliding like my character was running on ice i once bounced off town gates of a smaller town like times before the gates opened the town was a stronghold that would convert from to a town with waypoint after you beat the monsters there i think this was an issue on the server side and not my pc
i had really high fps but it was extremely stuttery borderline unplayable at times
same here had a bit of issues running on high like op described with some stutters and the frame didnt seem real after changing to medium had no issues
10gb or 12gb variant of
high details textures chomp vram like there is no tomorrow amd works miles better for d4 due to more vram unless obviously you have something like for 1440p or higher
you do realize that the majority of people probably like percent of pc gamers are not running a pc anywhere near your specs
those are the main components of the rig i m building and capable of crushing the game dunno why you d expect any diff lol you hit the nail on the head with the rubber banding and that is why a lot of people were groaning
this is good advice
10gb variant
do you read the question from op performance on pretty ok rig that s what it is ok little more than pretty ok but answer for his question
a lot more than pretty ok there s a world of difference between his gen old hardware and your current gen high end rig he s asking if people with rigs comparable to his run well or not because obviously enthusiast components aren t going to struggle to run the game smoothly
i assign force move to my space bar then whenever i want to walk i just press the space bar clicking the mouse button still works the same it will walk forwards if you click on the ground or attack if you click on a monster but of the time i want to move i just do it with my thumb naturally placed on the spacebar
d4 fully supports controllers on pc this time around so there are alternatives available i haven t looked into it but accessibility focused controllers devices may also work since they often use standard protocols and don t need to be specifically supported by games
use ergonomic mouse
wasd absolutely needs to be added to d4 it effectively reduces prevents rsi and is a familiar control scheme for many tons of isometric games utilize wasd including a few arpgs even diablo immortal plus it would be purely optional like controller so classic click to move would still be the default control scheme more accessibility options only improve a game even further click to move and key to move give me pain from the extremely repetitive nature of arpgs while wasd games have always been completely comfortable controller works pretty well yet lacks the accuracy or a cursor so for me and many others wasd is the most ideal method of control hopefully it s added soon while i want wasd more than anything in d4 right now i don t think the devs are branding us losers at all joe shely said in a recent q a prior to beta that wasd wouldn t be included at launch but that they would look into it further therefor i think it s something they want to add especially now that many people have requested it since the beta it should also be largely easy to implement as controller movement already exits rewasd with another third party program can get wasd to mostly work in d4 but it has ui issues and delays i tried it and it took awhile to get working even once it was it felt janky and not like true wasd support we need native support so players aren t required to purchase third party programs and waste time setting things up just to get perhaps the single most common control scheme in pc gaming to work in a newly released game i fully respect click to move and controller but wasd is just as important
how would you even make wasd work when you can only move toward the cursor i mean you can sort of simulate with a gaming keyboard or keypad but you can t get there can you what am i missing
pc controller
hold left click down and your toon will follow your cursor hit shift to stop and auto attack release shift to move again
just play on console the pc version is just a bad port
i ll be enjoying wasd in my other favorite game for the time being
no wasd go use a controller like a scrub
op is both physically and mentally disabled it seems
middle mouse button for me
aye got one my hand is basically super spread this thing is huge allows me to do what i do for super long periods of time massive amounts of clicking back and forth and back and forth and strafing is very difficult after a few hours tho
they made it work on that diablo mobile game we dont talk about so it s clearly easily implementable
smarter people than me tbh have figured it out already i don t know exact details what i can say is move forward with the cursor is like super awkward to me x played too many mmos even if that did work like wasd it doesn t it still is like incredibly revoltingly weird coming from wow ffxiv w is forward on screen generally
controller isn t a style most players are used to including me that s going to require novel hardware to be bought and doesn t help a lot of people who function better with spread hands that isn t going to encourage players to jump from wow ffxiv any other mainstream game into d4 but that s fine for path of okay and that s not expanding the community to make more money even from a pure profiteering angle that s bunk again asking for a basic accessibility feature is apparently the end of the world gaslight gatekeep bs
that defo will help but the problem comes with playing sorc rogue they demand strafing with constant clicking behind me to move backward and then clicking on a target to keep hammering it which is like a basic gameplay loop of them but repeating that over and over and over again for hours is just not good it really really stressed out my hand and forearm it actually began feeling weird after a bit during just the first weekend
controllers aren t something i m able to really use i m exclusively pc and have no controllers and am not even comfortable using them tbh that s prolly why i just never bought consoles controllers not comfortable for me having my hands spread wide helps me personally a lot like my mouse is kinda funny vs my hand size
top tier dumb comment right here
personally i think that wasd mouse will provide a huge advantage over just mouse or controller especially in pvp and that s why it is not possible
you can always rebind the left and right click actions to something on your keyboard you only need the mouse for aiming
who s figured out wasd here i d be really interested in how to move somewhere other than where the cursor is
you can always play a melee class if you don t want to spend your energy tediously kiting
they should add wasd support if there is demand for it see no reason they shouldn t

if you are arguing it wasn t designed for console first and ported to pc you might actually be around iq
lol it s not an advantage if everyone has access to it
but controller already has auto aim which is stronger than ever in d4 in a pvp situation controller would miss less missiles than click to more or wasd as even a good m k player misses occasionally while controller wouldn t ever miss unless dodged or blocked controller also has similar movement to wasd so it already has good footwork
https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/11wftl3/diablo_4_wasd_mouse_aim_guide/
yeah that s my thoughts too what a huge bummer like this is not a good thing
oh wow just checking this out very quickly this looks promising for real thanks for this link o_o
thanks that s interesting the switching back and forth between controller and kb labels would drive me insane maybe once there s an option to hide them
i have this for more than a year now it took me a week or two to get used to it once you get the hang of it its a game changer for playing games
well it can take some time untill u found another one which fuck old one out of your head but this is just 2months break so we can use that time to stay awhile and listen some old friends or family becouse we will not be there for awhile after launch
i know this thread is more of a joke but still i don t get the people who a legitimately depressed because they can t play d4 it s just a game if you are feeling depressed because it won t release for more months you really should consider seeing a professional because it sure isn t healthy
it s a serious problem in gaming people put an unhealthy amount into gaming and it becomes a part of their life they can t let go of addiction is no joke
i m not depressed about not being able to play it personally the month wait is letting me reflect on my time with what i played
dopamine good demons bad
my guess is that it will ship on or before june 30th
tomorrow
i forgot about that thing more junk for my shelf
literally says on the store page where you bought it from
you don t even need to use a bleeding spell you just need to have 2h sword as one of your two expertises and all of your direct hits will apply bleed regardless of what weapon or spell you use
yes druids also have something similar but against enemies they have poisoned one way out of being slowed and among other cc s is to proc unstoppable
yaaaasss boyz ww bleed of death and 4x weapons cc dmg
every class will have almost perma cc in the endgame
really isn t a lot
yes you can permaslow with just one point currently i would not think this is op though because many classes also have great access to slows or chills there are some legendary effects that can increase the duration of cc also for cc with time on it it s probably worth noting on bosses you can not slow them directly slow will be converted to stagger instead when you fully stagger the boss they will count as under the effect of all crowd controls simultaneously it is also possible for elites all monsters to become unstoppable sometimes haven t worked out the full logic but they seem to get unstoppable after coming out of a hard cc such as a stun or freeze
in the beta my barb had multiple cc sources and could put a boss into stagger state to times before it died
another wway is to specc more points into the thorn passive and you get auto bleed on getting hit which is also nice given how strong thorns are i will probably incorporate points into that in every build while levelling
wait can you elaborate how this works do you get to select two expertises i thought the expertise was a bonus depending on what weapon type you are using
your companion wolf rabies also benefit from this passive meaning you can have permanent passive slow as druid
it s a bear shout that can be changed to wolf shout with imprint makes all poisoned enemies rooted
with poins it can go up to slow but as melee i m not interested in the slowing effect at all i just want them to have cc status so point is enough because then point in pit fighter and in no mercy will make me have crit chance against slow enemies
that isn t really relevant to the question op asked it could be and still apply x damage to cc d enemies as long as they re bleeding and other such against cc d enemies effects
they can spend more points but the main point is that damage modifiers can do additional damage to targets under the effects of cc have you ever played action rpgs to understand why these kinds of interactions are important their question literally had nothing to do with the strength of the cc
almost all of it s usefulness comes from increased damage to cc d enemy affix
what is the math for figuring out when a boss will stagger
deleted
yep it is but the class quest for barb at lets you choose a weapon type to go in the technique slot this causes the expertise bonus for that weapon type to be always active regardless of what weapon you re actually using so you can use whatever weapon you want and then pick 2h sword for your extra expertise and get the bleed on all your skills lot of flexibility and combos should be cool on cb you could double dip i e use a 2h sword and have 2h sword in your technique slot for a bigger bleed but that s something i d expect to not go live
have you ever tried to eat your own head op asks is my understanding of english correct like the explanation is quite clear why do i need to confirm that hamstring does in fact apply crowd control it very clearly says it does thats why i didn t answer the question
i don t know the exact math each stagger effect would pop up a stagger number but the text is less emphasized than damage numbers and hard to read i noticed my challenging shout taunt effect was the largest chunk of stagger more than slows stuns from aspect or ground stomp s stun
strategic challenging shout node gain thorns equal to of your maximum life outburst gain x thorns also gain x thorns for each bonus maximum life you have i e fortified life
where did you get that info from because the tooltip says differently overpower scales the way you described btw
that is interesting i thought the technique slot was just for an extra bonus on a specific weapon type i really don t want to be forced to run 2h sword but the crit damage is pretty good
because you said isn t that much as if were relevant to anything being discussed in the thread
yeah you have to specc into this skill and passive skills
strategic challenging shout gain thorns equal to of your max life outburst gain thorns also gain x thorns for each bonus maximum life you have i e fortified life
so how s that a negative it s like complaining you have to wear gear to get the benefits on them ofc you have to spec into those things if you want the benefits you wouldn t go thorns without accommodating gear and spec for it like with anything else
it s not it sounded like thorns would innately scale with hp and fortify and i was not aware of that but it doesn t the tooltip even says it would scale with strength which in my testing also didn t work
interesting didn t even bother to read the thorns tooltip
the same content can be both solo and group content in a group you ll clear dungeons and get loot faster than solo and leaderboards will likely exist for both group and solo players also if the best gear is locked behind group content it essentially makes groups mandatory if you want to optimize your character and develop to its full potential i used to be an avid raider and m player in wow and for some time that worked for me but looking back that is not how i want to play games anymore i had to schedule my gaming time and there was a lot of downtime involved waiting for people afk kids phone food bathroom etc not enough players too many players etc this doesn t work for me anymore but i still want to have access to the best gear for my character and not feel like a second class player because i prefer to play solo or group in a less organized and regular way where i don t have to spend all day every day in a voice chat to be able to do challenging and rewarding content grouping in d2 and d3 offered advantages clear speed safety etc without ever excluding solo players this is my preferred model for d4
raid would gatekeep solo players
disagree group content has no place being locked out of content becuase it requires a group is cringe all content should be soloable but if you want to do it in a group go ahead in d2 me and my brother always fight ubers together even though theres no need to same in poe there is no group content but we will fight bosses together or do maps just for the memes its a system that works noone is locked out just cause the boys aint on but you can play together if you want to
raids don t belong in d4 world bosses are ok but queueing up for specific raids does not fit this game at all
op instead of farming downvotes why don t you stick with destiny since that seems where you belong with your two brain cells or lost ark
there s nothing wrong with group content but it should not lead to more efficient gear progression than straight solo play
only group pve content should be world bosses if we get one per zone that is enough
i agree but but if and only if there is effortless matchmaking it could work and be fun for raids
i could see raids working if there is no special gear locked behind it like a specific legendary or unique only dropping in that raid but there could be achievements and stuff could be fun
what if they added raids but also added a way to summon computer controlled player characters to be in your group so that people can solo raids the way the computer controlled players are summoned is based on an item summon crystal that you can find different qualities of as well as upgrade enchant by farming loot in solo areas the idea being that you ll need certain summons for certain raids to complete and you might not know at the start what the best summons are to beat certain raids so people are forced to experiment with them so it s not like easy mode you always win the raid whenever you generate ai characters you need strong summon crystals to beat the hardest raid content which might take a while to find or grind for on the other hand with player characters you could potentially finish the raid sooner and easier than with the generated ai characters
why not just have group content drop more loot not better just more solo player can gear himself out at his own pace and sweaty types can bumrush group stuff to kit out faster
doubt it there will most likely be some incentives for raiding or group play but my guess is that it will be like fields of hatred pvp in d4 doesn t gate you from getting all the same loot that you can within pure pve content it s just a different means of attaining it i imagine functionality for group plus content will be similar
i agree all content should be soloable gatekeeping content behind forced grouping is evil
yup group only content sucks in poe people do groups to xp farm or even have mf groups thats fine because its normal content and not specific content only made for groups grouping should already have the benefit of clearing faster or gaining more xp faster but everything should be soloable with the same possible benefits
ya terrible point world of warcraft had raids its massive some of the biggest games like destiny etc in the live service space have raids you need a group people love it they work plus if the raids work like world bosses you can get matched up with randoms anyways there will be solo content just go play that things have to exist for the game to survive they are going in a direction of mmo elements which need community things to work
i think if you expect this live service lost ark lite esque game to be completely soloable for the lifespan of its existence you re going to be disappointed if you want a true single player experience you will have path of exile
actually quite the opposite i don t know if you played the beta but it fits quite perfectly from my perspective but i m just a guy who is here for the shared world rpg experience i play destiny i ve played d2r and d3 finished all acts for both and i appreciate what they brought to the table but i m also not blind to blizzards ambitions for d4 as it stands today just my cents tho
rent free
i disagree
yes i agree an in game lfg would be necessary destiny to this day relies on 3rd party apps for raids and it s to no one s benefit imo
i feel that grouped players will already get more loot per hour because they will clear content faster than a solo player is likely to and they benefit from class synergies as well making content easier they also get an xp bonus though admittedly that won t matter much later on but playing in a group will already offer advantages
you doubt that group required raid would gatekeep solo player so how would a solo player complete a group required raid
this is not lost ark lite this is diablo lost ark is a traditional wow style theme park mmo d4 is an arpg having an isometric view does not make them the same game
you re in the wrong but that s okay enjoy the downvotes and go back to lost ark where you belong
lost ark and its continuingly dwindling player base are there for you it s free log in and play now if you want a true single player experience you will have path of exile if you want a true mmo lite you ll have to go play la or you can play destiny a game that underperformed so hard that activision blizzard opted out of their contract with it
actually quite the opposite i don t know if you played the beta but it wouldn t fit at all from my perspective log on kill things log off no searching around for groups
i doubt they d gatekeep solo players out of loot that is acquirable from group content see fields of hatred are pve players gated from pvp loot exactly
you realize the irony in trying to define a game and deny evolution for a franchise that is in itself an evolution and hybrid of game types before it if diablo wasn t born of hybrid features it wouldn t exist games evolve features and qol and content types are sources from other games too diablo immortal already broke that mould and is a diablo title that is an online mmo game and diablo is mostly a hybrid of many of the core features in that and the classic game structure of the other diablo games many of the new features and mechanics of the world loot and dungeon systems coming in d4 they had been implemented with diablo immortal just because a ton of people are ignoring it doesn t mean it wasn t an iterative step in the franchise s progress shaping trying to fight change and evolution at this point is just a futile and losing battle
you said that already don t be so fragile officer
you should play poe if you want a single player arpg game yes it has a fairly niche playerbase and it s not at all accessible to new players but it seems right up your alley and destiny the game that reached more players this month than it ever has in its entire existence since that destiny https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/player-count
key word your perspective the devs aren t tweeting about raiding this week because of your perspective here s a couple other key words always online i love the direction thr studio is heading with this ip hope you end up enjoying it too
ok then why have raid you can get your loots like everybody else then
couldn t have worded it any better but no he does not realize the irony as you can see above
i m curious why you seem to think d4 will fail as a live service game without group specific content when poe has a very similar model and you re recommending that others play that if they want single player if the model doesn t work with single player content how is the other game you re recommending continuing to do well
why have other players running around in towns and in certain zones within the open world why have world bosses why is water wet
poe is a completely different arpg experience if you played the d4 beta and thought oh this reminds me of poe then you really missed the forest for the trees this is a completely different animal it s more comparable to lost ark than poe
i did play the d4 beta and i thought that it was completely fine as a solo experience comparing it to poe there are certainly things both games do differently as well as things they do similarly i don t feel like the differences make or break the idea that group only content is necessary for the success of d4 also ironically one of the main reasons i quit playing lost ark was because of all the forced group content it had
it was so fun in a group i loved making new friends through a beta i already have people on my friends list to run d4 with thanks to the beta experience and i m thankful for that i think there is room for both playstyles and i think solo players will have plenty to tackle on their own
i just don t think they re going to actively design content specifically for groups there may be content that gets cleared by groups first due to party buffs making the content easier but i don t think they re going to add anything that isn t doable solo could be wrong i just don t see what they gain from it
well they seem to be implying the opposite via their twitter accounts they are talking about future raid content as of this very week maybe you are right but maybe you are wrong
there is no cow level
not at launch https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-iv-group-interview-unveils-new-information-future-of-diablo-iii-332278#secret-cow-level-in-diablo-iv at launch diablo iv will have a gritty and grounded world a cow level wings or pets take away from that groundedness as they go down the line things will loosen up eventually probably
there will be a secret redditor level where all these toxic troglodytes who do nothing but lurk and shit on diablo will replace the cows depicted as morbidly obese year olds who run around with nunchucks and bow staves saying the paragon system sucks omg druid is fat and i refunded my pre order when you slay them they scream my immersion
moo
if there was why would they tell us
we don t talk about it
the first rule of the cow club is we do not speak of the cow level
you need a body part from cane and one from tyrael
i mean i would definitely expect it to be a dungeon modification option
cow what
i bet the cow level will come as a cosmetics option for just a small price edit i would pay for it
i expect the cow king to ambush you like the butcher does
whoever creates a new post about cow level is a cow
please stop with these attention whoring posts about cow levels
it is not confirmed yet but there is a rumor you will unlock the secret cow level whenever you encounter a bunch of fat druids clumped together in the fields of hatred
i don t really care if there is a cow level or not but i sure will miss the pet for a automated gold pick up
no the cow level is just an urban legend based on fake screenshots from some website back in
cow levels don t exist
mooo momoo mo

thanks
that would actually be amazing
moo moo moo moo
moo with me moooooooo x200b mooooooooooo
uh i actually want one
first time seeing one and i as well would like one mald elsewhere
sorry it is the whoremoooos
the joke here is this is still a tooltip in d3 from launch it was true at launch but not anymore so most people are anticipating we eventually get one just like we eventually got one in d3
i saw a treasure goblin in beta i wasnt able to see what it looked like only on the map and also saw the trail of gold it dropped
the saying is from d2
they are really ugly now i like it
i kinda hope we can get a goblin pet like in d3
can relate send help
dude this is my life right now i m literally watching youtube videos that review the same points that i already saw on reddit the day before this is just getting ridiculous
the more you think about it the longer the wait painful really
take my upvote we got a big lol
this is my new addiction after diablo beta and like the beta i m starting to run out of content lol
lmao personally attacked open world games channel on youtube is good because he posts every minor detail that there possibly is on updates
i have hit the low low of watching people react to people reacting to news just to see if they have anything interesting to add
i giggled
how are people still playing it on twitch
honestly felt like i was going through withdrawal when i came home from work and found out the beta was done was looking forward to two whole days off too
so this is hardcore uno hmmm
i m just waiting for the developers update later this month to see how many much of our feedback they ll take onboard
preach i m like paragon something in since the beta ended just to feel like i m playing
this is real i have developed this condition
big same
i m at cards right now
im already foamimg out the mouth
give me
emotional damage
trying to get excited for the new poe league while wishing i could play the d4 beta again
and the memes are stupid
at first i m calling people silly because they said they re experiencing withdrawal now i can t get rid of this itch even after playing last epoch and grim dawn
guilty as charged got terrible withdraws no other games do it for me anymore
between this and silksong i dont know how im supposed to keep my sanity xd
see i m lucky i never got into diablo so after the beta i got d2r and d3 and am just playing through them for the first time great way to kill the time until d4
i saw d2r on sale for but i haven t played it since my instincts tell me it will disappoint compared to d4
kbm4console
pitiful life of a blizzdrone
i am playing last epoch in the mean time and having a blast the combat isn t as polished as d4 s but i created my own custom build without looking anything up and it works wonderfully
i ve resorted to playing minecraft dungeons
gif giphy jsrez6gjgjnha
tell me about it i keep going through youtube in hopes of finding new info and then when i figure out the video im watching has nothing new and i ve heard i die inside a bit
lol doing this with asmongold d4 coverage atm
the struggle is real
right here sir
endure my brother
literally scrounging for scraps at this point at least until the dev update later this month it wouldn t be so bad if i had something else to play but like absolutely nothing sounds fun after those betas not even elden ring and that s fuckin saying something
dont just keep watching twitter official diablo there are the real news
yep watched quin s hour long review and then watched asmon s hour take on it
oh i am covering everything have no fear
ha just finished it myself waiting for more content now
looks like the fields of hatred have opened early
i simply don t care whatever blizz say before release it takes time after release to tune an arpg to cater to its players to power creep to a good level and to prune the useless systems the system is not important at all you mostly need the basic elements to work well and the details can and will be tuned even if they implemented something it may still be removed trading auction hall was core of d3 but it s gone how paragon works changed miltiple times
people have elaborated and suggested changes for over a year it s not happening
both sides are the same like your post here is doing exactly what you hate that they re doing just the other way a lot of people on here act like everything in life is like american politics
i want my bubble and i want it now
these types of threads are why this sub is terrible just stop
i ve seen posts like yours like times a week on this sub it s cool that you disagree with someone s opinion but constant posts complaining about complainers isn t bringing this sub back to the content you d likely appreciate you re just stoking the flames which is fine with me i just want to let you know though that it s just antithetical to your adult mature idealization for the sub
gif giphy ih7kfwoxksmgthvntg
and provide a fix why lol blizzard won t see them anyways
as someone who likes both diablo and poe i just find it funny theres so many people who seem to despise poe and think it s far too complicated and the tree is a mess just to sit here praising the even more complicated nearly copy paste design of poes skill tree in the paragon boards
idk between the fatphobia and constant bickering it s one of my least favorite places to talk about d4
looks like every time someone gives slightly negative feedback he she is a poe leg humper or a d2 fanatic surly nobody who play s every game or non of those would have anything negative to say at all s stop to farm free karma by ranting about this topic is what i would recommend this subreddit is heading down a toxic path and its because auf threads like this without any value there is no feedback here at all at least criticism has some value even if it get downvoted to hell in this sub
i don t really get people complaining about paragon board to me it s the most interesting part when it comes to character building to some stat might be insignificant but it also looks like it might be the primary source for those stats and that s not including all the non basic nodes
its always the d2 fanatics but you never see the d3 fanatics and honestly theyre just as bad if not worse i like d2 and d3 and yes agree everyone freaking out about the end game paragon video is hilariously silly but i just cant help see the irony of the hardcore d3 fan boys screeching about d2 players they ultimately just want another d3 and thats just as bad
they need d4 to fail in order to validate their personal stake in poe d2 these are people with very little going on for themselves so they ve made a video game a major part of their identity any time a new game comes along it literally threatens their sense of self worth and the stress of that causes them to lash out at those they perceive to be supporting their downfall
i have started ignoring opinion posts and just reading factual ones
the people that focus on the filler nodes of poe skilltree and completely ignore the build defining keynodes are some of the dumbest people i have met on the internet
your argument is nonsensical you point out that the poe board and d2 had boring to stat so what s your point uh the point is that that was boring then and dex is boring now i don t play poe or d2 and i think dex dex dex isn t very interesting either
trash post by a child
poe and d2r players only show up here and make trouble when they can t find their fidget spinners
yesterday was the best thing to happen to diablo since the beta sucking off blizzard isn t going to create better results for the game the game lacks customization who does not want more customization i have hope for diablo as a franchise after the backlash yesterday hopefully it lights a fire under the devs
stop makins sense
i posted much the same though mine was far more ranty lol and was met with literally the same answers you re getting now i hate these types of posts wahhh i love poe oh sweet let me turn this into a flame war meanwhile people are posting that ded game blizzard can t dev paragon board full of so bad wah and their bs gets echoed magnified there are some very smart posters here many are often adults just be prepared to sift thru the chaff and you ll get some useful feedback occasionally i don t think anyone knows what the paragon system will do being that only a handful of people truly know what it will look like on launch which is why the shitposting is so annoying so you re not alone but it will likely not stop there will be something for the haters to explode over after the discussion too i m sure
i m just tired of everyone being negative like why is shitting on everything via youtube so popular i ve seen gaming subreddits get up in arms over way worst stuff from other devs that the negative nancies on this server appear to be getting upset over literally nothing
poe new league starts tomorrow they will be ba k to their dungeon hating the new league
good point you convinced me
looking over the reddit it s about complaints about complainer posts to criticism look for yourself the angry childish posts like the op are far more prevalent
there is no such thing as primary stat in d2
i m pretty sure there are special clubs where circle jerking is the main event maybe you should try that instead of internet forums where you might meet people who disagree with blizzards direction with d4
well doesn t this post reek of insecurity and a need for validation of one s opinions not everyone who has criticism about d4 is a fanatic of d2 or poe if you can t see the game has issues you re just blinded by a personal issue we don t need to know about but you should look into and get addressed because the ways in which it manifests are unhealthy
the irony is that a lot of the d4 haters are actually annoyed because they are just as if not more passionate than you difference is they can see the cracks already and are let down by the perceived shallow design it might end up exceeding their expectations or maybe they are right on the money but if they didn t care about the franchise they wouldn t be here in the first place i played d4 beta and honestly found it boring felt too d3 ish with lots of same same systems as other games and basic elements feeling pretty meh time will tell once content and endgame open up but i haven t pre ordered and i didnt initially because i had no faith in blizzard and although better than my expectations it still felt quite sub par to the deep desire i had for a probably unquantifiable and unreachable goal since a lot of why everyone loves d2 is pure nostalgia and that sense of identity people apply to themselves as a d1 lover d2 is objectively below average by today s standards and the gameplay loop is boring but it does scratch an itch a lot of people have poe is definitely a much better game but it s depth and complexity is also it s curse i barely play each league because i m just exhausted thinking about what to do my place in the world and my relationship to games has changed over time so i just can t invest that much brain power to caring enough to play anymore maybe d4 finds that middle ground blizzard is known for taking games and making them more accessible after all
i think we all just need to agree blizzard makes bad games now and move on
complaining about complainers who complained about the game is complaining i m done complaining about complainers who complained about complainers
i ve definitely seen way more posts like this than d2 or poe comparison supremacy posts
if the mouth breathers would just read one of the alleged posts a week and f off op wouldn t even think of creating this post any poe player complaining about filler nodes is insane and as long as d4 get paragon nodes that have an larger impact as well nobody can complain until after release if they are too few too little impact or overpowered
i don t personally mind the tree i just think it s wild that the discourse around the paragon board is the to stats they both have it it s a core element in arpgs
can you please post some examples of this nearly copy paste design of poes skill tree in the paragon boards don t mean to be offensive i play poe too i played poe so much that it skill tree is no longer complicated to me
slighty negative feedbac they out here hatin like they have to play the game in order for their families to be able to live that s no slightly
at least criticism has some value when it s just a rant of exaggerated criticism it has no value
these posts of people complaining about people complaining are the equivalent of viral videos that have been stitched together with a video of a influencer watching the video and pretending to have a reaction low effort knuckle dragging mouth breathing behavior
there are no d2 fanatics it s a myth you guys are gaslighting yourselves and getting angry about it it s fucking insanity
agreed d3 doesn t need a repeat
pretty interesting take d2r and such run on ladder seasons that typically last like months most people who have been playing this game that long only hop in the ladder and play for like maybe weeks tops get as close to as they want and then stop playing most hc players don t get too attached to their characters and therefore i don t think the time sink is as great as games like wow and what not as you can quickly just start gearing up the next toon x200b i personally like to have lots of different arpgs to play so i mean having multiple release in a year is awesome and seems to be a great year for the genre but saying that people who are complaining about d4 and comparing it to poe d2 have very little going for themselves is pretty far fetched when there are generally a lot of valid criticisms that these players are making i m looking forward to launch but at the same time best believe i ll be playing last epoch d2r and poe also when their ladders reset there s a reason seasons typically overlap
yet here you are
ironic
i don t think it s boring i m saying it s a main stay in all arpgs so why are people dogging d4 for having it
it s probably under their divorce papers
do you mind briefly going over what happened yesterday i wasn t around and missed it
you re delusional the response to diablo has been overwhelming positive even on reddit where a disproportionate number of people with a negative opinion of the game congregate blizzard has already learned that there is a massive disconnect between the hardcore audience and the majority of people who play their games i bet you re one of those people who think that d3 was a flop
sucking off blizzard isn t going to create better results for the game dude you re not god s gift to the world not every opinion you present deserves to be celebrated and praised the game lacks customization who does not want more customization i want million dollars who does not want million dollars see i can do it too how about you present some pragmatic and useful feedback
yes it is is called vitality because the rest of stats are a meme
yes and complaining about complainers who are complaining about complainers complaining about the state of the game is what you re doing let s get meta
my personal opinion of it is that its really fine it s nothing new in my eyes being really just a modern refabrication of poe skill tree i think it s strange that our stat point investment comes half way through our leveling process personally and it serves it s function but could have been designed far more interestingly i very well could be wrong but from what we ve seen in datamines for otpimizing i think it s very boring as it appears you will be heavily spreading accross many trees for legendary nodes and glyph access when i wish they designed them better in that there d be equally feasible options in maximizing a tree which again i could be wrong but from data mines and what we know legendary nodes and glyphs extra dedication only near glyphs seem like they will far outweigh a lot of the rare nodes
the entire paragon board behaves in nearly an identical way rather it has more meshed grid than the small paths of poe to travel through but in functionality and design is incredibly similar rather than one giant tree poe it is just sectioned off and uses access points between the trees all of the large pathing between what call cluster grid sections are primary stats just like in poe cluster grid sections are essentially replacing the offshoot nodes of poe there s glyphs in d3 that essentially replace poe jewels and behave in very similar ways transforming adding or calculating off base points invested in an area around it it s not a copy paste in the visual sense but in the entire design of it and functionality but at it s core behaves the exact same and is really just in my eyes a modern refab of it
the irony of telling someone they don t have to play a game if they re going to complain about it while you complain about negative comments that you don t have to read rules for thee and not for me and all that
there s a lot of angry little d2 players what are you talking about lol they re everywhere and they re angry
or the soap
blizzard put out this video and it has 10k likes to 10k dislikes https://youtu.be/agdizgfd5kq if you read the comments people are not happy many people are just learning about things that were already data mined and they aren t happy with it
i bet you re one of those people who think just because blizzard made a ton of money milking people in diablo immortal it makes it a great game be careful what you wish for because if blizzard decides realizes they can make more money from power micro transactions in d4 they will in fact add them they do not care about you lol they are chasing money and designed this game with monetization in mind first not gameplay
it seems a nerve was touched
typical reply from a d4 andy energy is used by es sorcs dex is used by many builds strength is used by some builds and also to wear certain gear what else do you have to say
completely ignorant look at glass bowa lol
i m not defending d2 stat system just want to point out that primary stat didn t exist in d2 and also titan build favors strength more than vitality so not all build will dump points in vitality
i didn t tell no one not to play idk what you smokin or why you puttin words in my mouth everybody can do whatever they want but they should learn how to give constructive criticism and you should learn how to read better and not miss the points of people s arguments
i don t see them i don t believe it really as much of a thing at all i believe people are being way hyperbolic and over exaggerating maybe of the posts comments have anything to do with diablo diablo or path of exile combined there are more posts comments about these posta comments than there are of them to begin with
they ve been angry since d3 though i played d2 at launch and wasn t a fan of many stuff but it was a good game for its time i m still not clear what they hate so much about d3 i found it an improvement because simply there was more variety and things to do cooldowns were implemented for skills and pots i thought being able to spam healthpots was cheesy d3 eventually ended up skill spammy and i really hope d4 combat in endgame doesn t turn out that way but i also don t see much innovation either for a sequel to an aaa game
blizzard put out this video and it has 10k likes to 10k dislikes funny i could ve sworn youtube stopped showing the dislike counts did you make that number up
weird to agree with me after pretending blizzard is shook by pissy reddit threads yesterday
guys never had a mb character in d2 lol
it s literally every single post i look at but i guess that could just be confirmation bias
you can install a plug in for browsers that will show you the dislikes on yt videos did i make it up come on dude
we had extensions to bring back dislikes for years at this point its not rocket science to install a extension to your browser
extension for it i believe
they will be shook by bad pr and yesterday was a disaster for them it s a good thing
haha who knows i browse this sub a lot and rarely see it
those plugins don t reveal the actual dislike count read the description youtube doesn t expose the dislike count in their api anymore there is no way to get the actual count anymore unless you are the video uploader read the description of whichever plugin you have it should tell you the same thing if it s honest it s simply guessing based on old scraped data now over a year and a half old and usage patterns from people who use the plugin
we had extensions to bring back dislikes for years at this point they were removed in november years you say how many years its not rocket science to install a extension to your browser the numbers are hardly accurate they re shown based on guesses from video scraping before it was removed it s not rocket science to understand that the numbers are not being exposed by the youtube api
again you re delusional
oh i remember a few days before beta blizzard released this video https://youtu.be/qhi1lbmm2sa, it was a pr disaster but guess what millions still played the beta and liked it that it became the most successful beta in diablo history now when same thing happens this june blizzard would be looking for more of this you call disaster
dude you are being intentionally delusional right now to avoid criticism of some game lol are you serious
may not be exact but sample size data exists
its april now that gives us more then year so years by defination as its more then a singular year the numbers is better then pure bullshit no numbers just because some son of a bitch youtube suit didnt want videos having negative ratios the extension fullfill it purpose as it makes it easier to see what videos are pure scams and what might have value
dude you are being intentionally delusional right now as i said go read the description of whatever browser plugin you installed to show these dislike counts it s not magically querying them from youtube s servers to avoid criticism of some game lol are you serious if you had legitimate criticism you could describe it using accurate information criticism based on false information is just noise making it harder to find any meaningful feedback
this is a whole new level of delusion and shilling for blizzard lol are all the comments on that video also fake the legitimate criticisms have been pointed out a million times they just need people like you to stop shilling for those criticisms to be heard lack of sense of progression limited skill tree uninspired affixes prefixes on loot lack of character power related to hand crafted items stale dungeons questionable ui join the people who actually care about diablo as a franchise and help improve this game
this is a whole new level of delusion and shilling for blizzard lol you talk of delusion and in the same sentence accuse anyone of being a shill if they don t support you making wild claims about the number of people who agree with you your tinfoil hat is a little too tight methinks cutting off circulation i will say a third time check the description of your dislike showing plugin lack of sense of progression limited skill tree uninspired affixes prefixes on loot lack of character power related to hand crafted items stale dungeons questionable ui join the people who actually care about diablo as a franchise and help improve this game as i said earlier you are not giving us a gift by gracing us all with your presence none of your criticisms have given any detail about what specifically you don t like and how they could be better you re just raving
no minions at all for me won t need golem taunt when tendrils pull everything in stuns slows and applies vulnerable
it s too early to speak on this so factually there could easily be some uniques and legendaries that make a full minion build viable or not we just don t know yet
i don t play the game to be good i play the game to have fun i m gonna rock a zoo build while you play the meta
then i ll be playing a bad build i don t play blood surge or a shadow dot build
in every game not just diablo pet based builds are just a nightmare to balance you will almost never find a viable super late game pet build because of its core passive functionality it s more a question of how long they are designed to be viable and the many intricacies that blizz settles on in the how not really a user error
not a shitpost genuinely attempting to help i don t see how the examples prove your point there are a lot of builds that can make minions very tanky but i still don t love them for say an ashava fight
blood surge with thorns was my idea use all possible blood spells like hemorrhage and blood wave and sacrifice all minions that can t use blood surge however i don t know how paragon points can contribute to the build
no one knows if minion builds will be viable or not this is just pure speculation their unique class trait deals with minions so blizz can t just let them be useless
but the necromacer is not designed to be a zoo keeper with all three minion types out at once wrong i made a zoo build with zoo perks and legendaries and stomped the entire demo in hours i don t even know half of the legendary necro items and i found zoo gear
disagree i think you can run a very strong pet based necro but only if you fully spec into pets
it s overrated there s only two good classes
you have a point mine is i need zombies fix skeletons to do dmg while i m recovering mana plus distracting the mobs necro without zombies fix skeletons often stuck in the mobs because they are focusing on you with zombies fix skeletons they are often dispersed
i understand the point you are making and agree that there are advantages to bieng selective with the pets you choose to have with specific types of builds for example with my blood necro build i have elected to have a blood golem and sacrifice my skeletons and mages having said that i also believe that you shouldn t dismiss a build that utilizes or even all types of pets there are skills passives and paragon boards that benefit these types of builds as well understanding your desired build and selecting pets skills legendary affixes and paragon boards that compliment those choices are certainly key
so this build kind of disproves your point argument but i do understand that it may not be as op in end game https://youtu.be/cv3nbaa1hli
my main issue is that sacrificing only warriors still takes the skillslot for mages and vice versa and sacrificing only one gives a pretty meh single bonus which will use up more skill points on the sacrifice passive and or the legendary aspect to make it worth it so for me it s pretty simple i only sacrifice the golem to free up a skillslot and put the golem passive points in the replacement skill or i sacrifice both warriors and mages to free up the a skillslot get passive points back of which i might put some in the sacrifice passive ultimately though i don t feel necro has that many interesting skills to use if you only free slot and keep the other i dislike bone prison because it s a nuisance bone spirit sucks all valuable essence up explosion tendrils are ok since they also have their unique resource but fall off vs bosses without corpse support curses are boring support mist is a boring defensive some minions instead might be better diversions necro feels like a puzzle especially since the nice legendary aspects are pretty spread out over all slots instead of all offensive not necessarily bad but hard to theorycraft without playtesting imho
i didn t know doing a build similar to a d3 necro pet corpse build wouldn t work in d4 or the pet bone build in d3 who knows pet build may be viable late game we don t know till official release happens
we already know how minions scale and it s bad because they only get fractions of the benefits imparted by gear
me too my highest lvl character in d2r is a summoner druid hes slow as fuck at clearing and my mercenary does most my damage but i don t care cause its fun and what i want to play i will do the same in d4 i don t care if my summoner necro isnt the best i will play him cause its fun and what i want
it s not about one or the other it s that certain pets work with certain play styles just randomly tossing out pets without any thought behind it leads you to have a bad build
exactly but there are many ways to use pets that still scale directly with gear they just happen to be things like sacrifice mixed with keeping some around for utility
d2 summonmancer was borderline immortal
because the number of skill points and the number of gear slots you can apply aspects are finite you can t just simply whip out all three pets and expect to do well or even be able to use each one to effectively interact with your other four abilities
you can look at the paragon boards here https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#).
i think you are just trying to cope that it s not going to perform well it s been well documented that the minions do not scale well into end game content during end game cbt they simply don t scale the same with gear as your core abilities
your experience at is not indicative of end game builds
so please tell me how you plan to circumvent the item contribution for pets
where are the zombies at in current necro didn t see any when i played
i mean it s fairly obvious the zoo build really only benefits from minion attack speed increased quantities etc the problem is that once you apply all those aspects you don t have any much space leftover to buff your essence spenders with aspects or skill points not utilizing your core resource effectively will eventually become a larger and larger hinderance people will invest super heavy into pets then wonder why they start to struggle and it s because they likely gimped themselves by ignoring massive aspects of the class it s an opportunity cost problem if you are ignoring a massive opportunity from your essence spenders it s a problem
yeah having skeletons take up a single slot for both is a blessing and a curse since it feels like a waste to only use one it s all build dependent though like you might want bone casters unless using overpower skills then swap to the overpower buff from sacrifice there is also some flexibility like being able to pop out frost mages for pvp
well we know from cbt players that a full pet build doesn t perform well at end game which is not remotely shocking if you play pet classes in literally every game like me people seem to thing i m trying to rain on their parade but i m honestly just posting tips that will help them think about pets in ways that work in tandem with the necromancer developers will never just allow you to sit back while pets auto pilot a victory for you so you really need to start looking at including them into a cohesive build if you plan to tackle challenging content
yeah because there s multiple minions lol
again then i ll just have a bad build i ll have the golem taunting into an area to make decrepify easier and take heat off the warriors i ll have probably reaper warriors wailing on them because they won t be taking as much damage i ll have cold mages slowing them further and generating essence i ll be casting bone spirit on full essence and working bone splinters and the mages to regen my bulb depending on how summons survive with their and priest buffs i ll run army of the dead to bring them back to life or bone storm for more damage if i don t need that if that s bad i ll be bad
kind of getting at the issue because pets are passive ai controlled units even when you have active interaction with them most games tend to make them have to fall off hard at a point because you can t have someone doing cutting edge content by standing there and having minions do the work one of the biggest issues is minion survivability and especially with certain games they need to choose will we make the pets immortal or instantly die which is usually the latter but it s just very very tricky at least to make primarily focused pet builds rather than supplementary ones
i think my point is that if someone has another build other than the ones you mention they can still find a way to incorporate some of those elements and still beef pets up i had the legendary for blood surge and loved it but ignored the pet options to make it stronger however i still found them plenty useful and that i had the flexibility in the tree to beef them up we do agree that you can t just whip pets out and that they will always dominate with no points spent
why don t decrepify bone splinters and bone spirit effectively interact with a taunting golem cleaving hard hitting warriors mages that slow and regen essence a nuke that does splash damage and a relatively fast generator that can make mobs vulnerable
i know but it is not on the level that is comfortable with me
games not even out you have no idea did you level to and just decide they suck lol
the cbt did not have access to everything the game has to offer js
you know that argument works against you too right right your experience at is not indicative of end game builds being as that you can t read the basic perks that buff all minions and curses affixes that scale with minion count in available content i doubt your wisdom about unavailable content
i m sure there will be legendary items and uniques that buff pets in one way or another as well as passives and paragon points
there are good builds on yt u still need aspects to make it work well
the problem is there is a cap on the number of minions gained from aspects which is hard capped at to one and to the other you actually need your minions to be uncapped for them to be as infinitely scalable as the damage contribution from gear
i m not saying you can t have pets interact with one another but the number of skill points required to fully invest into all three minion types ends up making your essence spenders absurdly gimped on top of there being limited numbers of effective interactions between pets
it s not either or my beast mastery hunter in wow got a lot from pet damage but i wasn t just standing there either there are multiple approaches one would be having mobs that ignore the pets or shoot through the pets for example but it s not impossible and even then part of the trade off might be that you re very hard to kill but you can t kill as quickly as other classes for softcore that might lead to one class choice versus a different one in hardcore for example
i never said anything in favor or against about the example builds i posted they were strictly examples there are loads of variations with or without pets that can work i was just posting examples of how having minion type trounces trying to keep all three minion types on the board because not all skills work equally well with all minion types i could post many different builds with different possible minion interactions
because it won t compete with someone doing triple or quadruple your damage using a smarter build interactions between pets and player abilities you seem to think you have infinite gear slots to equip legendary aspects but you can t equipe enough to make all three minion types viable
cbt exists and i know how math works dataminers https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#) have also ripped everything from the game files
you don t need a cbt to understand the math behind item scaling and the contribution to pets from said items
you can look at all the paragon boards skills and aspects here https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#). your pets also only gain contribution from gear so if you increase your physical damage by your pets only gain increased damage which is the only damage type that can effect all three minion types there is literally no method in which your pets scale at the same rate as the players they get less and less relatively effective as the raw damage stats on your gear improve
it s all right here https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#). go make a build and see just how many pet specific legendary aspects you can apply in the limited gear slots you can stick them there is a max of gear slots and aspects are limited to specific gear slots based on classification it also has all the paragon boards
yeah but where are the zombies my necro could only raise skeletons
i appreciate you trying to explain your take to everyone commenting from what i m understanding is because of scaling and limited gear and minions not benefiting from of your stats that other builds will be better late game because you can stack other skills more effectively but this is speculation because we don t know all the glyphs and we don t know all the legendary and unique properties to gear for example d3 ring that combines all your dogs into powerful minion instead do you agree with that lmk what you think thanks
i only have one realistic essence spender bone spirit my golem does an aoe taunt this gives the reaper warriors a target rich environment for their cleave the mages slow attacks which hopefully makes the reapers even less vulnerable due to their lower life it makes a single area of decrepify more viable which allows faster essence regen which powers more bone spirit now i freely admit that summons simply may not be strong enough later but that s not because they can t complement each other
sure but there was never a wow build where your primary majority of your damage was from your pet i would say it s common for games to treat them as damage buffs more or less but they almost always act as a form of supplemental damage and not the main part of the build because they don t want to design an afk playstyle also especially in wow i m assuming you had active moves that your pet performed usually what you see is pet builds being fun options for leveling and of the overall game but quickly fall off
maybe i ll debate you more after release i don t think the original thesis of can t be effective when building for all minion types is true built my necro to but again didn t try this until then
i m not competing with anyone who may be doing more damage i just need to do enough damage to get the mobs to zero before they get me to zero you ve given no explanation for why that can t be sufficiently interactive again maybe pets don t scale but that s a pet scaling issue
lol how are you speaking so factually on this the best build in the game could be one where your spam bone prism and your skeletal mages are combined into one giant skeletal mage that attacks them for damage you have no idea what all the item and build combinations are i m not saying you re wrong but you re simply speculating you could be right but you or anyone has no idea yet lmao try not to be so stubborn on something you don t know all the details to it s close minded and the math behind item scaling and pet contribution there s always a way to make something comparable let s say you go all in on bone spear and it does damage a second or you go all in on having minions and they each deal damage a second it s pretty close to being the same shit
it s so easy to pass minions x is to me
legendary aspects that we know about
tree of savior haahahahahh
yeah we do it s all been datamined you can check out the combinations of aspects paragon boards and skill points here https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#).
deleted
yeah that s the active interaction you mentioned earlier pets get buffer and nerfed but i d be surprised if a beast mastery hunter s pet did anything near only of the overall dps i m not playing the current expansion so i don t know their status right now
you can t change how much stronger your minions get from stats on your gear as your gear gets better they get weaker it s just a byproduct of scaling you could increase your thorns for example by per tick but they only scale at of that rate so it s only damage there is no getting over diminishing returns on gear like that when the player receives of the item stat contributions it s a losing battle of attrition where as the player gets stronger their pets get relatively weaker
that can t be sufficiently interactive idk man you don t make any sense to me so i m going to stop replying
except that is not at all how the damage scaling between bone spear and skeletons work if you add a piece of gear that increased your physical damage by your bone spear will do more damage but your minions using physical damage will only get a damage increase you are simply fighting a losing battle where your minions get relatively weaker as your gear gets better
because i don t need to speculate on build possibilities for anything dataminers have already pulled everything and you can go view it here https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/#).
i like your spirit but that s not how the math works sadly what amuses me the most about people seeming angry that i point out the flaw with pet scaling is because i love pet classes i m not trying to shit in pet builds because i don t want them to work i m just trying to find the ways my pets work the best
please tell me the name of the developer because unless it s something other than blizzard we know with almost certainty that this list is complete if you actually played blizzard games you would know that based on 100s of beta ptr builds that they don t hide shit
this is diablo
yeah again it has not all been datamined that s information from version of the game we ve been over this
golem gathers mobs with aoe reaper warriors hit gathered mobs with strong strikes and cleave cold mages slow mobs to help protect reapers and generate essence decrepify slows mobs gathered by golem and lowers their damage to protect golem and reapers bone spirit nukes target and splashes to mobs gathered by golem taunt bone splinters makes mobs vulnerable and generates essence so one pet gathers and tanks mobs warriors do direct and cleave dps mages do direct dps slow and generate essence all happens in a decrepify aoe which part of that doesn t make any sense to you
you so smart
yeah that s datamined information just like the cbt and open beta it doesn t have everything will have to offer you can t argue with that
ok tell me every single legendary in the game not just the codex stuff we get from dungeons
no hahaha i m kidding i just realized i missplace both words
there are 100s upon 100s of beta and ptr builds in blizzards past that have all been data mined if they were to hide game assets this would literally be the first fucking instance of it happening the only thing they ever hide are some random story elements like cutscenes and those are deliberate and obvious they simply insert an old cutscene as a placeholder to keep the story from being spoiled all of the gameplay elements and items are always in the test builds you seriously fucking know nothing about blizzard as a company of you think they are trying to be sneaky
what part of minions getting like contribution from gear doesn t make sense to you there is literally no way for your minions to scale at the same rate as the player it s a mathematic impossibility unless they change the scaling currently the only way to buff their damage directly is with minion attack speed but even that is a band aid fix to their relatively poor scaling with gear
sure i can you are under the delusion that blizzard was hiding shit from data miners i ll come back and laugh at you after launch
it was already listed in the gui version i posted but this is a link https://lothrik.github.io/diablo4-build-calc/database/) to a list version instead it even includes all the end game dungeon modifiers
my sincerest apologize omnipotent one i didn t realize i was dealing with a total badass we all bow to you you re so cool
there is literally no way for your minions to scale at the same rate as the player it s a mathematic impossibility unless they change the scaling that s just not true that depends on the base dps of minions vs other skills but also on how different skill bonuses stack just as an example if bone spear does base dps and minions do base dps then physical dmg will give you more dps on bone spear but dps for minions boom minions out scale bone spear of course in reality the calculation is quite a bit more complicated but the point is there is not enough information to reasonably conclude zoo builds will be worse do you know the base dps of the minions do you know how minions scale with player level do you know if essence will be a limiting factor when spamming core skills what about dps uptime on bosses for caster vs minion builds it s pure speculation nothing more
the fact that i can have minions with zero drops might come into play
alright calm down kid it s not that serious
doesn t work for me i click the stuff but nothing shows
the stat contribution from your gear imparted to your minions is not speculation it s hard coded into the game files for every damage increase on your skills the minions only get because that s how item contribution scaling works for minions
does it work on mobile
