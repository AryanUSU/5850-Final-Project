he was just when he was wrongly arrested for the murder of an off duty correction officer and now years later the brooklyn man cried as he was exonerated in court tuesday morning john bunn always maintained his innocence in the crown heights shooting that killed rolando neischer and the attempted murder of robert crosson he served years in prison and was paroled in but he kept up the fight to clear his name he was convicted based on false evidence supplied by disgraced nypd detective louis scarcella at least other men have had their convictions overturned in association with scarcella s misconduct and at least other cases are under review
they stole that man s life god bless him i hope he gets a fat settlement
first words out of my mouth would be where s my fucking check just because he was exonerated it doesn t mean that he won t have a difficult time finding employment and he spent years in prison he missed the world outside his cell having some big changes probably he s coming out into a world he might not even fully recognize anymore
no amount of compensation will make this man happy again almost years of his life in the wrong place away from his family
god know s how many people around the world are locked up serving a long sentence about something they never done
louis n scarcella skar sell uh born is a retired detective from the new york city police department nypd who initially came to prominence during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s earning frequent commendations before many convictions resulting from his investigations were overturned during his retirement as a member of the brooklyn north homicide squad he and his longtime partner stephen chmil built a reputation for obtaining convictions in difficult cases since scarcella has received extensive and sustained publicity for multiple allegations of investigative misconduct that resulted in false testimony against crime suspects meaning that innocent parties could have served long prison terms and guilty individuals could have gone free because of wrongful procedures
death penalty fans take notr
i hate hearing about these cases because i hate learning it happened in the first place such a sad thing have your life stolen over lazy police work i learned a valuable lesson when i was in my 20s i thought i was protected by innocence when i agreed to talk to the police then i caught them in lies in the integration room and realized they were trying to pin it on me dont talk to the cops
this is why i no longer support the death penalty so many of these wrongly convicted ppl being released these days how many have we allowed the state to murder
there should be a payout which is based upon how many hours you spent in prison under false pretense a guaranteed something like an hour seems like a minimum that s hours if it s years exactly which comes out to but even that seems low hope this man finds happiness though i m sure being vindicated must feel amazing
how much compensation do you get in a case like this your life has been ruined your name tarnished any businesses you have would of failed and went under million a year doesn t even cut it i would still be pissed off with million you ve lost a third of your fucking life to a system that is inherently racist there is no getting back time poor souls like this my heart bleeds for
prosecuting attorneys need to be questioned and possible held accountable for situations like this if they knew he wasn t guilty but where trying for that w like alot of those scum do than prison time is the reasonable response
his prosecutor better watch out

nyc jails prisons were fuckin hell in the 90s hope my mans can find peace after all that time there
thats not interesting thats just cruel
how does one life after this
the look of rage and joy at the same time
sue the fuck outta them like you should never have to work again and then some
so when they going to give him back years this man will never be the same and have struggles we will not nor should not understand i hope those who locked him up suffer the guilt they deserve in this life and if there is anything beyond the grave
man literally had half his adult life wasted i hope he at least gets a fat settlement and never has to work again
that s the look of motherfuckers gonna pay and they should
this man deserves to be paid out for this
so he was wrongly incarcerated based on false evidence supplied by the state at years old he should never have to work a day for the rest of his life acab
geez how do right this f me
anyone else see bald richard sherman
villain origin story
seventeen years of hell yeah i d be popping veins too
the system needs to be torn down to nothing only then can we rebuild
state needs to give him millions of dollars he lost the best years of his life and building a life that musta felt good though nothing but the best for him from here out
there should really be punishment for false accusations
bro better be set for life state paying him and his lawyer fees returned
face of a man who will never forgive nor should he
camera phones are a godsend man people had been complaining about police brutality and corruption for decades but everyone always took the word of the police the camera phone phenomenon proved without a doubt that cops were in fact corrupt and brutalised innocent people
i ve seen several stories like this the guy is always black always fucking racist legal system
i was born in the man was wrongly incarcerated for my entire life that s depressing as hell i hope he gets paid enough money to be able to retire and live comfy the rest of his life
people like this deserve multiple millions of dollars straight out of the police pension
if this happens they should be compensated with at least 1m they should not have to worry about money again and instead of working a job enjoy leisure for the rest of their life that s the only justice i can think of
i think if you falsely imprison someone the person who issued the sentence should have to do the same sentence in the same facility
technically he s owed murder for time served
i feel so sorry for this man i can t imagine what he s went through
this is why i am against the death penalty
this guy should be a multi millionaire
most of these cases i see the person winds up getting around mil and i think that s absolute bullshit i think when you take the best years of a person s life the one and only life we have to live you oughtta come out with at least million and even that won t be enough to make anything alright i wouldn t go to prison for even five years for million and i m far from wealthy life s too short for that
no amount of compensation will cover this
i hope he gets compensated for his life being destroyed
so called and asked for their news can you return them
i d be sueing the system for them years loss of life sitting in that place
this is why we must abolish capital punishment mistakes are too frequent and we should give this man a million dollars for every year he spent in prison
no amount of money can restore that man s life those responsible should be jailed and all of their assets liquidated then given to him as part of his settlement
yet people still crucify someone at the first allegation of a crime
he is going to need every type of therapy forever if he wants a chance he s going to have to try really fucking hard
if looks could kill s
looks like he s ready to kill someone
who was it who was in jail for like or something and got released with the same stuff
i remember seeing an interview with him a while back very emotional interview https://youtu.be/3rdmjxrhxrg)
i hope this man has family who can help him reintegrate into society technology has changed soooo much he would be behind in so many ways i also hope he gets a settlement to help him out
so the double tragedy is they will probably never catch the real killer
do they get anything as compensation or is this just left to rot and the victim has lost years for nothing
nightmare literal living nightmare this is for murder imagine how many cases are wrongfully convicted that dont get the attention of a murder case
you can see a lot of pain in his eyes
pls tell me he got a huge payout for this
i don t generally care about reparations but this man needs to get paid for how he was wronged he s still alive his life was ruined at taxpayer expense we need to make it right
any compensation or what that s like a quarter of his life gone literally the prime of his life
people s lives are being stolen how is this ever permitted
the wronged was finally released at this moment i hope the government can give him some help after all he has been in prison for so many years maybe he is not familiar with everything outside and even has fear
uh was years ago not
r orphancrushingmachine
give him million and call it a day
that is the face of a man that is both angry and relieved to finally be exonerated
they better pay him a huge amount of money
he will be compensated with worth of mcdonalds gift cards
i hope he sues the nuts right off that department
i d have so much resentment
i ve thought about how i would react if i were released after being wrongly jailed for years like this guy i would be so insanely mad someone might have to die i know this makes no sense i m an atheist i don t believe in karma
millions in compensation or get the fuck out
i m bout to sue the breaks off this system my family is straight now as i would be thinking as well
i rather set guilty people free then imprison one innocent man and have to see that yard stare
this example is my main argument against the death penalty i know incarceration is expensive but taking an innocent life is unforgivable
let me guess amerikkka
and this is why the death penalty is a bad idea
america is a garbage country land of the free my ass
greatest country in the world
please don t support death penalty we should not take away the times anyone has here but instead the punishment should take place in their timeline
this is why i no longer support the death penalty
and this is why i can t support the death penalty
this is why i have a hard time supporting the death penalty while i do believe there are monsters out there who shouldnt live the fact is there s not always an absolute guarantee that the judgement is correct x200b especially in a case like this where falsified information led to this
richard sherman
they should give 1m per year that he was wrongfully arrested his entire life is gone i don t want to hear anything else
cool now him like mill or something
looks like he s going to make it true now
that s a man happy to be recognized as falsely convicted yet angry that the prime of his life was stolen from him
hey people do the math was not years ago this is old as hell and op is just karma farming
no amount of money will fix this shit that sucks
i know it wont give him back his lost years but i really hope he is being compensated for this
i m happy for him and sad at the same time
million for every year
man fuck our legal system
no amount of money
just pay him thats all pay him
i am assuming it did a lot of circles in its short life
go fuck yourself this butterfly maybe ok thanks
wonder what the worm looked like
i wonder if it s harder for him to fly because of the different size of the wings
this butterfly has just been banned in florida
why is everyone talking about trans people this is closer to intersex
it s interesting to see the difference in colors i m assuming the males are more colorful to attract females
tao butterfly
must be easier to catch when they fly in circles
bilateral gynandromorph sounds like a cool band name
i wonder if they can mate
don t mind me i just want to get a comment in before they get locked for transphobia
go fuck yourself doesn t quite have the same burn here
banned in florida
republicans now accuse this butterfly of grooming children and want to ban it
mfs will see an intersex butterfly an amazing natural and biological wonder and then be immediately compelled to be transphobic and hateful cant you just enjoy something for fucking minutes without being a cunt
that ain t no butterfly that s vivec
the b in lgbtq
get that bug a bud light
love seeing these genetic anomalies
nature is so cool
happens to other animals as well i saw one on a red cardinal
i went to the harvard museum of science on a private tour when i was doing entomology research i was shown a case of these that was behind the scenes i was told the single case of less than a dozen of these butterflies was worth more than a full t rex skeleton
damn nature never fails to impress me
the bud light of butterflies
deleted
what are the butterfly s pronouns
straighten up and fly right
morphology don t lie psychology on the other hand
can it fly with those lopsided wings
if i had a nickel for every gynandromorph i saw today i would have two nickels not that it s alot but just odd it happened twice the other https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/12da1k0/gynandromorph_solenopsis_invicta_ant_found_in_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
it s fashion sweety look it up
it s not a woman it s not a man its a butterfly you ll never understand
damn woke butterflies better throw away my bud light s
conservatives nature is woke ban it
these are outlawed in texas and tennessee possibly florida
hilarious seeing people use a butterfly to justify human gender dysphoria
i can think of a certain subset of people this would make irrationally angry
don t tell the gop
if republicans could read they would be very upset about this
harder not knowing what ya are out here in the streets
this is going to cause a a lot of fuss from southern butterflies
it s natural
tonight on fox news groomer butterflies are after your children should you worry
this butterfly probably won t stfu about its pronouns
not in tennessee it ain t
that s not natural you re either male or female the year old book says so s
republicans about to boycott butterflies
desantis right now that butterfly is causing the collapse of society force it to change back
better not let a trumpublican see that they ll pass a law banning it
remember there are no such people as trans and god doesn t make mistakes s
why are so many people ripping and insulting the south and conservatives it s a fuckin butterfly
this butterfly is banned in texas and most of the south
great now republicans are going to be calling for extermination of butterflies
also known as a freak of nature as it is not normal
lgbtq breathing intensifies
lol some person who is aligned with hateful and malicious values towards certain communities is gonna be so confused
i have a friend like that
don t tell the republicans about this butterfly they will call it fake news and then ban them
nobody tell r conservative
still more female than dylan mulvaney
has anyone thought about shooting some bud light cans about it
the republicans want them banned
don t tell kid rock he ll shoot it then complain like a baby about it
but there are only two genders s
if this doesn t get a million upvotes on reddit
don t let the gop see it
it can literally go fuck itself
he just like me fr fr i m intersex
poor thing
it s now the official spokesperson for bud light toosoon
too bad it s dead
the white house has entered the chat
redditors are obsessed with everything to do with gender
he she
woof conservatives are not going to take this well
don t tell the conservatives
damn liberals making butterflies transgender s it s sad that this can be a sarcastic joke
but theres only two genders sarcasm
gop heads exploding over something without a single gender
show this to every republican
banned in texas tennessee and idaho
great here comes kid rock with his ar
butt her fly or butt him fly
the republican party denies it s existence
quick ban it from playing high school sports
see it s natural
should go fuck itself
this butterfly made a choice to clamor for attention s
did it just nag itself to death
then why did noah need to take two bilateral gynandromorphs on the ark he could have saved that room for another dinosaur
tranny butterfly should be the mascot

looks like a gas leak that got ignited not good
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/339454-11-injured-in-two-gas-leak-blasts not much info but apparently all lived
gas utility worker here natural gas is odorless by default and we add something call mercaptan which is a sulfur based solution to give that egg smell in many developing nations this is not a mandate which could lead to situations like this
what is truly crazy is that if you look closely frame by frame homey is inhaling fire with that first hit which means that they were all breathing huge lungfulls of undetected gas
jesus he went super saiyan
ummm did we just watch someone die
an incubus song comes to mind
anyone got a news article
wtf
what is going on here
flame on
love is in the air wrong gas leak
did they all die
come on op provide some details
and this kids is why we make the odourless natural gas smell like rotten eggs
this new the boys season looks sick
fire force irl
i feel like this would happen in hollister american eagle or arospotale
alternate headline phoenix discovers superpowers
can someone tell me what happened after the fact
i find this fascinating as a fire engineer rip though my condolences to the family
and people won t believe that smoking kills
wtf looked like a movie scen i sure as hell wish it is and is a fake video oh my lord what a shitty way to go
i remember being a little kid in the 80s and being absolutely terrified of spontaneous combustion that and quicksand were always big sources of fear for me i wonder how many of those cases really were just a gas leak
the human torch was denied a bank loan today
dude looked like he just inherited his super powers instantly
and that s called a gas leak
looks like a gas leak
this looks like a gas leak looks like he was trying to light a cigarette
serious question what country is this i know in america commercial natural gas has an odor so you can tell if it s leaking
that s the so surreal it feels like it s from a movie
this looks fake as fuck lol
pov you re taking a little coffee break at work and decide to scroll your phone and look at something interesting but instead you see people s lives ending thanks op
did all three perish
looks like there was a gas leak in the building once he lite his cigarette pop goes the weasel
is there a story to this
you can watch the whole room ignite in slow motion wild
smoking kills
did he survive
okay i wasn t the only one watching the wrong guy right
gas leakerino
jesus christ that dudes throat prob caught fire
wow at first i thought i just witnessed spontaneous combustion everyone pleaaase make sure to have a co2 and fire detector on your property
clearly this is a human torch situation
this appears to be in pakistan most countries put odor sulfur dioxide in their natural gas so that a gas leak is obvious natural gas has no smell unless the odor is added in other words you would have smelled the gas in your country and you would have gotten tf out before it blew up
that wasn t just the man does anyone have any info of aftermath
the gas air mixture has to be at a near perfect stoichiometric ratio for such a deflagration we have to assume that everyone there has been breathing this mixture for several minutes so the flame front likely traveled into their noses mouths and tracheas possibly lungs too if their first response startle response was to inhale bad for them
so they can t smell this gas leak right but why
are they ok
the entire lore of fire force can be explained by a series of bad gas leaks
fun fact most gas is odorless after being scrubbed over and over by the time it reaches the company they than add a smelling agent that smells like natural gas for exactly this reason it smells strong at a low lel so people go holy shit it smells like gas even though the lel is below ignition ranges
well that was terrifying
that guy behind the counter doesn t get paid enough for this kind of burnout
man he was really dry
if you watch it frame by frame the person behind the counter actually had time to be afraid which i am assuming sucks but what i found interesting is if you watch closely you can see the hair and hands for some reason on everybody are the first thing to actually ignite
the flame is the soul s breath the black smoke is the soul s release ashes thou wert and art may thy soul return to the great flame of fire
maybe they were making butane hash oil in there before this guy lit the spark
must be on that keto diet
what kind of fire force shit is this
this would have made a great xfiles cold open back in the day
gas has always added smell to it for detection what cointry is this where its neglected apart from the fact that the entire shop burst in flames the employees and customers are inhailing gas the whole time since the leak began
seeing how the entire room went up in flames there must have been a gas leak of some kind because as soon as he lit up the room was also immediately engulfed in flames
for a brief terrifying instant i thought i was witnessing an actual exhibition of spontaneous human combustion
am i the only one who thought this was spontaneous combustion no i ll see myself out
this is straight out of a mutant superhero movie like when they show video clips of others before they re discovered swear i thought he went nova
where was this
another reason not to smole i guess
would be nice if i had not just seen someone die today but you know
bro fucking exploded
getting the air sucked out of your lungs
holy fuck
jesus you know that fireball was moving fast cause it went from on him to spreading out that was mostly likely a big blast after the video cuts out cause that looked like some others said a gas leak though how the fuck did no one notice that or at least start getting very light headed
gas leak
i legit didn t think this was real at first damn tho poor guys
are they ok
looks like he was wearing whole lot of cologne
holy cow is this real this is terrifying
damn that s disturbing
smoking is bad k
men and all surroundings caught
blows up pancakes with mind is the vibe this video gives me
is it normal not to smell the gas
that fire was over
can i get backstory like wtf just happened lol
you meant everything catches on fire in a instant ya missed the beat
nice clean burn no piston knock detonation spark gap is good
slowly sets vape down forever
the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and spontaneous combustion can occur s
oh the guy in the center is smoking a cigarette that is why he looks like he went flame on fantastic four style glad they all lived through that
flame on
latom
bro thinks he s in fire force
wtf is the dude on the right messing with looks like it burst into flames simultaneously
flame on
can t fool me this is footage from a bootlegged version of fantastic and that s the human torch
w t f
r pathofexile righteous fire on accident
is gas leaks odorless i feel like they should feel the air being different also where s the alarm for th is shit
their contracts with the devil activated so they became their respective ghost rider forms fixed the title for you
this is terrifying i cant imagine how painful that must have been

wow you missed a chance to rhyme and make this an ongoing banger of a comment jam she s still a milf years on
i d say literally any of the advertising for season spoiled that not to mention the golden globe win for her acting in the second season
it s been years since season came out this is hardly a spoiler
it s not a spoiler that she s in season
rhyme on with on i see you are from the kid rock school of lyrics writing
stifflers mom has got it going on she s still a milf years on yup sounds good to me when i sing it
when i retire i m going to make a game called jumping to conclusions
they do this because they alledge it increases women s safety as they re mostly near exits and entrances i d imagine the wide spacing is for helping with children
background https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women%27s_parking_space women s parking spaces are specially designated and identified parking spaces in parking garages and parking lots to be used by women they are usually near exits to increase the safety of women to facilitate parking or to facilitate walking to shopping or employment destinations
it s statistics women are more likely to be the victims of robbery so they have they re own designated areas to walk to their cars at night
how do they know if you are a woman or not
don t you dare try to act like that doesn t make sense
why edit pretty basic question i think not sure why downvoted but ok touchy subject
probably gonna get downvoted but isn t this like having rich people specific parking because they re usually the victims of robberies don t the bad guys just congregate there why not just improve all the security rather than section off the likeliest victims
hi guys this dosent have anything to do with a post i m just about to go to sleep so goodnight everyone
they have these in thailand too https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/vvq72e/in_thailand_some_of_the_big_parking_garages_have/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)
i heard cuz their butts are bigger what
i showed my wife thinking i was funny she said it s for mothers with kids clever
women have strollers grocery bags struggle to carry diaper bags etc and need more room they allow for more space nearer to exits so women can easily see if anyone is hiding next to near their vehicle and allow them to leave quickly
that s actually funny
this completely reasonable and probably more pragmatic than giving every woman a gun to be safer
r facepalm
as a german this is actually the first time hearing this haha
honest but brilliant
god dam has germany ever had a dad idea
based germany
based germany
the spot is similar to a maternity parking spot in the us i m not sure what the big deal is really
shesh women are awful drivers isn t it obvious jk
my wife would be thankful for the bigger parking spot not salty about it lol
less room for an assailant to hide
do a quick google search on car accidents in regards to gender and this will definitely make you laugh lol
its bc they can t park for shit
i d feel safer in a parking garage
if you saw the rims on my car after my wife drives it your d agree this is brilliant
so park here and say that i identify as a woman got it
look at her acting like it doesn t make sense
they are wider to prevent situations of can t get into my car cause someone parked too close which is crucial in an emergency not because they think women are less good at parking
this why men get paid more
note to self park close and identify as a woman
its cool as a single father i would rather lug all my shit and kid a mile to get to where i am going just so women can have a special place to be targeted by perverts e qual ity ftw
are they insinuating that women are horrible drivers and need more space or that their butts are so large that they need more space
the spots are clearly larger
in the usa they have larger for everyone
lol
hahahahahahahahahaa
i think she would like it if these were men only parking spots
why are they bigger for women because women are supposed to be worse at parking or for women with kids and families near the store entrance
it s the best woman moment
what about the guy with the ginormous balls that uses a hoodie as pants cmon we need to do better people
good makes sense
well done
lmaoo she knows why
as a man i would park there no matter what how would women act if we have parking only for men also would a heterosexual couple be allowed to park there
am i a chauvinistic asshole for noticing that significant number of women in my personal life struggle with parking even though there are obviously plenty of women who drive and park without a problem would it be an awful thing if hypothetically that was one of the multiple rationales for having a few larger spaces located in safer areas of the garage in consideration of a significant percentage of men being dangerous predators honest question
insane how seemingly progressive countries still just enforce blatant sexism against men
men got tired of ladies crashing into their expensive cars let them crash into each other instead
women cannot drive it s a fact
hopefully american parking authority adopts thus intersectional policy for american parking they should add additional race qualifiers to make it even more inclusive
less accidents that way
didn t know germany was based like that
deleted
equality
they know women can t drive over there or anywhere
lol that s because women can t park
gets privileges complains
americans would boycott the fuck out of this
german sexist w
can i identify as a women until i finish shopping
i didn t know germany had a large asian woman population
ahahahahaahahah have you ever seen women try and park a car they need lots of room and make sure they can back up and repark times
and she still parked like a bitch
women are bad drivers everyone knows this
here s your clue
what do women think about this
so what s the real reason is anyone going to explain
it s cos you suck at parking bitch
i identify as a delivery van and park wherever i want
well they ain t wrong for it
did you hear the crash in the background
women they are so smart
is germany a failed country
she s cute
lmao
germany keeping it old school
probably why they parked so closed to each other and all over the lines they can t drive for shit
i d imagine that absolutely nobody is going to give a shit if you as a man park there but this is germany so who knows
and i suppose they have a problem with that too lol
should be obligated everywhere in mexico there s a say mujer al volante peligro constante
make all parking lots costco style best for parking
you ever see someone try to back into a parking spot in a crossover
let s be real it s so that gretel doesn t hit hansel s porsche
god i love german engineering
i mean i get why they re doing it and it sucks something needs to be done but maybe segregation isn t the best long term plan for society unless i m misunderstanding how these work
shots fired
i wish all parking spaces were wider costco is the only place i feel ok
how dare the germans take into account the scientific fact of women s lower spatial awareness sexism i call sexism s
hahaha hahahaha oh the joke writes itself
and that s just parking
switzerland had some as well have seen that near bern a few years ago but it wasnt for easier parking it was closer to entry exit and directly under the cameras in case someone was lurking in the dark trying to steal their car or worse found the idea quite nice actually
switzerland as well
they are not bigger it s for security they where mostly nearer to the exits so women feel more secure and don t have to walk through the dark spots where i am waiting to reap there skin
good
maybe you could say men have smaller parks
you probably get a lot of creeps lurking around the women s parking garage
it will have these little mats that go on the floor so you can literally jump to conclusions
these are load bearing walls jerry
what s the deal with architectural design
people talk about this all the time but what i want is to see more of the interior of kramer s apartment we never get to see the full layout of his place and the way it seems to be structured is far weirder than jerry s is for one thing kramer s place seems a lot more spacious he has room for a hot tub and the place seems carpeted it seems strange that kramer and jerry share apartments in the same building and on the same floor but their interiors feel and look completely different there s weird wood paneling in kramer s place while jerry s place is painted kramer s living room looks like a totally different design and layout kramer s couch is flush against a wall while jerry s couch is in the middle of the kitchen living room area kramer can fit the entire set from the merv griffin not mike douglas edit show in his apartment i don t think jerry could do that in his own apartment i wish there were more scenes inside kramer s place because it feels like a totally alien landscape compared to the relative normalcy of jerry s place
can we get a deep analysis of gilligan s island
is it possible for the hallway to bend
since when so kitchen cabinets go through the wall
in episode 2f09 when itchy plays scratchy s skeleton like a xylophone he strikes the same rib in succession yet he produces two clearly different tones i mean what are we to believe that this is a magic xylophone or something ha ha boy i really hope somebody got fired for that blunder
designed by art vandalay
the whole apartment shape is goofy obviously for filming reasons this render is missing his bedroom past the bike which would not fit as well unless the exterior wall was not flat im pretty sure the hall way out of his door was just a box shape this maybe an exact set copy and hallway shots used a separate set
it pissed me off as a kid that he never used the mountain bike or computer ever for the entire length of the show
it works like this https://www.theagencyre.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/seinfeld2.jpg).
this has a bigger impact in the memory of my childhood than finding out my father was cheating on my mother was it all a lie
it s not a lie if you believe it
wait until you see the golden girls house
good ol snopes confirming this question with images i was hoping to find too i ve seen renderings where it works but then no images of the hallway to actually show if that makes sense in context https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jerry-seinfeld-hallway/
that s a shame
get out
design by art vandalay vandalay industries
this post shows the actual set https://www.reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/co9i6c/on_set/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)
i don t know there are some pretty wild floor plans in ny lol
why do they call it apartment you re not apart from anyone
everyone knows it s impossible for a hallway to be angled
bold of you to assume an old nyc apt building is using level floors and degree corners i ve seen some that look like mc escher drawings
https://i.redd.it/3l2998pe2dt91.jpg
no it s legit famous architect art vandelay designed the building using non euclidean geometry
you mean to tell me it was all staged
it also makes no sense why the door and hall would have been on a diagonal in a upper west side nyc brownstone
you re right no apartments in new york are that big
it could have existed just fine it s the hallway that couldn t have existed
y all wouldn t believe some of the mazes that make up nyc apartment hallways
don t ever think about the 4th wall on tv shows which presumably has artwork on it you never see
jerry s apartment https://www.theagencyre.com/blog/seinfeld-jerry-seinfelds-apartment-upper-west-side/)
to be fair it s also missing the fourth wall
i ve seen realtors do nyc apartment tours and it totally could have existed eta https://www.tiktok.com/t/ztrcsjaft/ jerry s next door neighbor maybe
did it occur to you that the corridor could be at an angle
maybe it s not a straight hallway perhaps newman has a concave wedge to complement jerry s convex kitchen footprint
jerry these are load bearing walls they re not going to come down
not with that attitude
most random post i ve seen all day somebody debunking jerry seinfelds apartment
the cabinet depths are overly exaggerated in this mock up if they didn t extend beyond the plane of the wall then you gain lots of space i feel like the angle of the entry is off i don t recall it being degrees you also get a better view of the hallway in the episode where the neighbor down the hall that jerry never really noticed and didn t let into the elevator had a bird that died which also ate cuff links
here s a rendering that shows a better and quite feasible layout https://www.arch2o.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/arch2o-25-perfectly-detailed-floor-plans-of-homes-from-popular-tv-shows-4.jpeg
do we see that the hallway does not bend at the doors also why would the cabinets extent through the wall i always assumed that the bedroom was behind the wall that has the computer desk
we ll it s a good thing it was a sitcom
this is gold jerry
it was a sitcom not a documentary
considering i had a triangular bedroom while living in the east village i know the people who split up these apartments whenever that was got pretty creative
worse was the friends penthouse
this could be said for a lot of tv homes i think back in the 90s there was something said about the brady bunch house in which the top floor would have been considerably larger than the bottom floor if you mapped it out
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
maybe the hallway bends as needed
almost seems like it was some kind of set strange
unless the hallway turned
well yes it could as a set because it was made up for a tv show you see kids television used to be filled with made up stories that were filled with actors just for entertainment of course that was before the reality shitshow took over
film set can t function as a real apartment more at
maybe it existed in the nexus of the universe
this is wrong in the episode with manny the puetorican apartment handyman they show the hall and there is a clear bend in the hallway
not that there s anything wrong with that
welp thats it im boycotting seinfeld now u r_slow_travel exposed the system its over is this what you were looking for
20k upvotes on a factually incorrect post there are photos and even a 3d tour of the set where the hallway is perfectly visible and makes sense
can the hallway not turn at an angle to go past the kitchen the walls marked in green don t have to continue straight as long as the cabinets aren t truly so deep as to protrude through the walls as shown here there should be room for the hallway to run parallel to the kitchen walls
it was a karl farbman and conrad collaboration side note i ve always wondered why jerry would stay in this apartment if he was so successful in later seasons i think the obvious answer is to keep kramer as his neighbor but it wouldn t make sense in real life circumstances
isn t this more accurate https://imgur.com/q0kw62t)
why does the hallway have to be stright it could follow a weird path
seriously next it ll be kramer s apartment like he couldn t have transformed it into a tanning salon a jacuzzi spa a pizza restaurant a cigar lounge a talk show set a hotel that place was a regular snoopy s doghouse
oh it s possible if you knew my man conrad connie con whichever you prefer i ve seen him turn a seemingly wood desk into a fully functional bedroom suite filled with shelving and a smatter of male curiosity hidden in the drawers
there are scenes in the show that show that the hallway has a bend fairly close to the door so it just mends with the contour of the kitchen
of course it couldn t existed it s missing a whole wall
what s going on in there our apartment is bending spacetime and defying known physics jerry
that s a shame
i m reading all these comments in jerry s voice
this picture shown is about nothing
that is because it was a show
https://reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/d2a345/jerrys_apartment_layout/
very interesting
thanks for ruining my favorite show next you ll tell me that light treason isn t really a thing jerks
i mean but it did exist
jerry s apartment was just a tardis just that simple
and they never even mentioned that the apartment complex was 4th dimensional and the hallway exists as a snapshot into the past or future where the apartment does not exist and the doorway is sort of like a portal in time
the pilot apartment was also completely different
do you think there would be a market for a building that had hotel rentals that were done up exactly like the shows of certain tv programs you could have the seinfeld the friends the bunkers i bet you people just want to be in the atmosphere just for a kick
damn that is mildly interesting
its actually could but ok
acktually
do one for the shining hotel you ll be surprised
it s still real to me
i always assumed the bedroom was to the left of the bathroom
my brain which is too literal looked at the design of the apartment for a couple minutes trying to figure out what the issue was and then finally aahhh they mean that the hallway couldn t have existed
because hallways need to be straight
do they show the hallway being straight it could easily have a degree turn otherwise
yeah i learned that when building the lego set
there s an episode of how i met your mother where marshall and lily head out to the suburbs to inherit her grandmas house and when they return to their new york city apartment suddenly everything is much smaller than it used to be and they don t fit anymore they find themselves having to step over the coffee table instead of going around it in my opinion that s the true size of their apartment it just looks bigger on tv the camera adds square feet that s how all of the sitcom characters are able to afford all of these massive luxurious apartments it s not rent control it s a dinky apartment that s being shown through a television lens that distorts the apartments true shape and size i think this is what s happening with jerry s apartment as well it s distorted it makes me think of those doll houses that open up like a book the kitchen doesn t actually extend into the hallway it just looks that way on camera
these people never seen belgium or dutch apartments shit is wild out here
no shit it s a tv show
hall ways don t have to be straight
this is just one rendering i mean it can be drawn https://www.theagencyre.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/seinfeld2.jpg) to have existed
if the apartment actually existed it wouldn t be the same proportions we see on the show sitcom rooms are stretched out on the 4th wall for ease of filming and studio audience viewing if there is one
or maybe you haven t been to nyc cuz i ve seen worse
it was probably staged
the full house house is a better example the house is narrow from the outside which is very typical of san francisco homes once inside the staircase that runs parallel to the length of the house has a large hallway at the top of the stairs that goes left and right running much further than the width of the house that we saw from outside makes no sense
thank you that ll be 10k a month nothing included no pets allowed
hello my poor ugly bald flightless mother i have returned from the skies to visit you
i don t know why having the love and trust of a wild animal is so touching but it always hits deep beautiful bird
people who think animals have no emotions do not pay attention this is wonderful
that s awesome
amazing animals always seem to remember love and kindness i m blown away by dogs because of the pandemic i didn t see my friend s dog for almost years i ve known her for years and took care of her when friends were away but she gave me the most amazing greeting when we reconnected
they are so majestic and big lovely clip
the wholesome content i m here for
how can the visits be both regular and infrequent
good boy looking for his scritches
i love the idea of this big ol bird being like you know who i haven t seen in a while
i thought the bond i had with my pets with beautiul as we all g et seperation anxiety from one another i returned home yesterday after days in the hospital and it had been years since i had to stay in the hospital for days my dog and my cat havent left my side since ive been back its adorable when you are kind to animals they put their trust into you and it is one of the most beautiful and humbling things on this planet
this is absolutely amazing incredible us humans should stop eradicating this planet by destroying our planets habitats this made my day who would of thought a vulture coming back regularly years later so cool
i love you thiiiiiiiis much condor probably
i m not crying you re crying
all animals clearly are conscious how couldn t they be when they express love like this
i love animals just as much as i love eating animals i wish i could go vegetarian but i ll pass
an absolutely beautiful thing i mean look at that eternal gratitude a stunning bird excuse me i now need a tissue
so heartwarming
remember that bunny that got rescued that got picked up by a wild bird just as the family let it go i like to imagine in another reality this bird was the one that got that bunny mother nature be fucked up like that
i wanna be called handsome by this guy
regular but infrequent visits lol
and all of this which was outstanding was filmed vertically fml
this made my day
gorgeous dinosaur
give seed
the bird s trying so hard to properly hug him
how can something be regular and infrequent
so sweet
r mademesmile
wholesome
wild windows sighting
that foos like look at how big i ve gotten spreads wings
what does regular infrequent mean
awesome bird horrible translation
wash your hands afterwards pls
these sons of bitches believe that the condor is their animal that condor animal is on the bolivian flag and represents the culture of the andes not those who come from europe and steal our culture
awesome dude is like the real life peacemaker
reminds me of beaky buzzard from looney tunes
that s a dinosaur
sounds like the guy from hydraulic press channel
so beautiful
wholesome
argentinos siendo bros
increble
all fun and games until a different andean condor lands nearby one time and he approaches it not knowing
animals are awesome and sometime humans are too great video
boluuuuuuudo
sooo great beautiful
nice quote i m stealing that the check is in the mail
you have alerted the horde
it s because we all know animals can t truly feel love but we like to think they do
the older i get the more i see the people in animals especially big cats
before videos like this were ubiquitous people thought that way also we re the only tool using animal was a thing when i was a kid just watched a bird break an egg with a rock earlier also we re the only animal that understands death naw i ve seen far too many sad videos to believe that
all you are seeing is a video of a man petting a bird with some some very unlikely back story which may be a complete gibberish made by a karma whore
those whthose who think animals don t have feelings must have never raised an animal that makes it close to them this is my personal opinion o think animals don t have feelings must have never raised an animal that makes it close to them this is my personal opinion
i used to bird hunt with my buddies dog bella almost ten years ago when she was a puppy i ve spent some random time with her here and there over the last decade and just recently after not seeing her for six years she ran right up to me butt wiggling and all with her old gray face and body didn t matter that it had been so long as soon as she heard my voice and saw my face it truly felt like she remembered me
same i used to live near my parents and their dog loved me so much then i moved away but came back to visit about every months or so then covid happened and i didn t see them for a year and a half and it was about years before i saw their dog again she lost her shit and was jumping all over me then would go run up to my mom like omg do you know who this is it blows my mind that people can t see the humanity in dogs
if i visit someone once every two years on the dot that would be regular but infrequent
maybe it s a migrating bird and only stops by during a certain time of year
once a year at the same time would be regular but infrequent
every months or a year it happens on a schedule but doesn t happen often
example if your family only gets together every year at christmas you are getting together regularly but infrequently
love for another has no boundaries
so much hate bro it ll only bleed further into your life you posted school shooting content under r interestingasfuck get some help please
que dise bro
animals can t truly feel love spoken like a true sociopath
ya you win for the dumbest comment here congrats
wtf um id risk everything to bet youre wrong second how does one compare love love like how a narcissist loves or how i love fresh socks to put on after a nice shower what about some monkeys or some wales or tons of animals that mate for life you need to stop relying on some shit you read somewhere in some antiquated textbook and take a look at some evidence on video of the relationships animals have with eachother and with humans the bonds are not second rate to humans who lets be honest have some pretty fucked up versions of love nobody is bragging about
why was this down voted so hard omg
let s play the game of spot the republican
it s probably the other way we like to think they don t feel love but we know they do when seeing such videos
how would you know what animals feel lol
came here to say something similar for example i recently learnt that some slugs have shown evidence of having emotions we have so much to learn and so much to preserve
also we re the only animal that understands death naw i ve seen far too many sad videos to believe that the video of the elephant using her trunk carrying her dead baby broke me for a day
i tend to not look at those they break my heart
my mothers cat mourned her for over a year she barely ate lost weight her coat drastically thinned she was miserable
you re right but i stand by my comment
yeah it s easy and lazy if something feels good it s easier to believe it then challenge it also makes you extremely easy to manipulate
when i joined the military i left my dog to my mom since she lived alone and i couldn t take her was gone for years but everytime i stop by she jumps all over me and if i sit down she ll lay on me

dogs are amazing
oh i get it was confused for a minute thanks
it s there to pick up coconuts and take them to another continent
makes sense thanks
and that s why they have to steal our culture
shut your damn mouth
i m going to rape your women who are hot and i like damn bitches
my christian friend thinks animals don t have souls lol
how is what i said sociopath like simply saying what i was raised to believe that animals feel a weak version of love but can t truly love like humans if they feel love like us feel free to prove me wrong
you can t argue with a bible thumper his stance is telegraphed
wrong jesus gave us love it wasn t invented until he died for us haven t you been paying attention to those wonderful inspiring messages from he gets us
because it is blatantly incorrect
i always pickup snails on the sidewalk and move them to the grass or planters nearby it costs nothing to be kind and thoughtful
slugs have emotions like for instance the one attacking my early salad was pretty salty when i intervened
i m sure the slugs i watched earlier were pretty darn happy when they caught some baby toads and swallowed them alive and whole
i mourned my cat for over years unfortunately its demise didn make me lose weight
amazing
buts what s the average air speed
hate for another has no boundaries either your choice your life life evolves with or without you make your choice
sure you are champion would you like a cookie
r nonononoyes i can t believe he made it lol
r maybemaybemaybe this had everything
wow my money was not on the gazelle cool he made it
oh man i love nature but damn was i cheering on that buck to get away from that big nosed scaly fucker
crazy how fast that gazelle could swim fast af boi
this is a gazelle but i guess you can call it a buck maybe a buck fiddy
damn gator almost won that battle
at the buzzer
wow that was incredible timing amazing humans are interesting though we side with the prey and not with the predator not long ago i got between a young deer and two big coyotes that were ready to attack the deer didn t move and neither did the coyotes we all just stood there eventually i moved them off and the deer still didn t move literally had to hit in the ass to get it going in to the forest that was a first my thought as a human was to protect and then i started thinking we re heading in to big snow and those coyotes needed to eat i very very rarely get involved in nature that might be the last time not my place
i can t decide if i d want to see him get away or eaten
plot twist it s now tired and vulnerable to a land predator nature you scary
the crocodile has to eat too
if i was the boat i would be trying to cut off the gator
if they really wanted to help the gazelle wasn t it easier to just block the croc with the side of the boat
small gator only reason that guys alive a bigger croc wouldn t have second guessed it and hammered it in half the time
am i the only one that was rooting for the crocodile
best post in ages
i didn t think a buck could swim that effectively or fast across a river especially to out swim a crocodile i was rooting for the buck and sad when he was almost caught then relieved when he made it onto land again this short video was more interesting than some entire movies and tv series including season of game of thrones and much of star trek discovery
i had to drag my finger to fast forward too much anxiety for me to watch at normal speed and not know what happens
he was eaten the very next day
now that gator doesn t get a good meal what heartless people
as one mammal to another they should have driven over that crocodile and turned it into fish food
that croc had em dead to rights if the fucking humans stopped interfering
the boat is the only reason the gator didn t eat when it goes underwater it can hear the swimming animals but kept going towards the boat probably due to the noise of the boat taking it off course
whenever i watch a documentary about predators i m always bummed for them when a hunt fails but when i watch a documentary about the herbivores i m always relieved when one of them gets away very conflicted here
time for a cool down
why do people always cheer for the prey croc got to eat to they can t help it
why did the dumbass even go in the water he was at the shore when this clip started
run forest run
woah i haven t seen this in almost two days so glad it got posted again
i guess the croc learned its lesson after getting his face almost bitten off by that straight thug ass zebra and decided it s time to go after more docile gazelles but he didn t realize those things could outswim michael phelps damn that thing can gazelle paddle like a mutha fucka i didn t think he was gonna make it
now what is that alligator going to have for dinner and who will feed the baby alligators why won t anyone think of the babies what s wrong with you peoples
looks like a red lechwe
hooo he got away that was pretty exciting to watch
the buck doesn t stop here
nice
if the croco was older probably would have won
wow
that s some michael phelps shit right there
i truly don t believe the crock was that into it
wow
yes
i knew crocs can swim fast but that gazelle has some serious skill
incredible camera work
colour me impressed
the wife said it s me trying to get that puss
wow it won ace
i wanna know it s heart rate during that
damn nature you scary
aaaaand later the crocodile dies of hunger
how about you turn the boat around and get between the two
never would i imagine reading a thread of people rooting for the gator here in a water fight probably all alabama patriot fans too
baby croc du du du du du du
the croc was way too small
this needs captions
that was terrifying
that s nature i wasn t rooting for either of them
oh thank heavens
upvote because it got away
interesting how the croc would come up facing the boat every time it appears to be going of the sound rather than the direction it would just keep going straight or eye sight same thing it also appears to swim the right way under water and only change direction just before breaking the surface so heading in the direction it previously saw its prey then redirecting as it breaks the surface towards the sound it thinks the prey is making for a visual confirmation and then course correcting and going back down for another burst of speed or i might be reading to much into this one video
gator almost had him but i think on that first or second leap the gazelle did right after the gator got to him he caught the gator right in the chops with the heel kick seems like it stunned him and created enough time and space for the gazelle to get away
yes made it
i literally said put loud oh no he s gaining on you oh god no yes buddy yes book it onto land
one of the best chases ever
not today
that was enough to give me a little bit more anxiety watching that i know that poor gazelles lil heart was beating so fast
not today
damn made it
poor crocodile
i don t think that croc was big enough to take down that buck anyway
i didnt even know bucks could swim as fast as that amazing what motivation a pursuing croc provides
yes yes yes no yes
dumbass crock was like fuck the gazelle im gonna eat the boat
for a second i thought this was going to be like that one with the truck and the security barrier
that was just awesome
i couldn t watch this without intervening on behalf of the prey with maximum prejudice
you changed the outcome by measuring it gazelle was just running anyway as a prey animal predator croc bro got distracted by boat noise and shouting had to check if he was attacked himself or another predator going after the meat without the humans he could have made a beeline and gotten himself a dinner death roll
is that considered the butterfly stroke
that poor crocodile was denied its food by the evil disney brainwashed libs i demand justice
a buck swims for it s life away from a crocodile there i fisked it
why does everyone hate crocs i mean they gotta eat too
i think he could beat michael phelps
glad you got crocodile right
r areweinhell
that buck is going to have some impressive calves after that swim lol
you don t see the size of the croc till he attacks a young one that s why he swims so fast and a big buck gazelle if he was still in the deep water when he got caught tho
amazing
freaking gazelle knows how to swim butterfly
if the boat had not distracted the croc it would have been dead
croc was tiny
best movie i ve seen this year
i m michael fuckin phelps ya dumb crock
i legit don t understand why the alligator can t just be vegan like why does it have to murder a innocent animal
huzzahhhh
the suspense is killing me i hope it ll last
poor crocodile i m all for ending world hunger
croc turned out to be smaller than expected
poor hungry croc
the croc swimming reminded me of david hasselhoff from the first spongebob movie
there is absolutely no way that little croc could take that thing down
bell burger that s something i would try i think
mmm haven t had an rc cola in a minute
id straight fuck up bell burgers and a large rc rn
give me friggin tostatas for bucks
jesus those prices i m envious
frijole
anyone remember the enchirito from the 70s that was my fave as a kid
used to be good too my childhood was filled with taco bell and pete s fish and chips in mesa az
rc cola hell yeah
right across the street for the port a jon corporation where a mutual friendship was made
it s so exotic
back when the meat didn t arrive in a dehydrated tube
my dad saw a bring back the mcrib sign and commented on how much he missed the bell burger i guess it was the taco filling and lettuce in a bun like a sloppy joe
i loved bellburgers
my favorite part of those old menu boards is the pronunciation guide below the name of each product it s hard to see in the photo but underneath taco it says tah co always made me wonder how many people ordered taycos before they decided to add that feature
with real meat
haven t seen taco bell prices so low since
thats a lot of frijoles
cents for a coffee that s outrageous
it s crazy they invented all those foods and then they got so popular in mexico
bell burgers
even though it s not officially on the menu my local taco hell still accommodates my order of pintos and cheese as a side to my tacos supreme since we moved here md in and they are so nice about it i often get a hey old school and a high five when i pull up to the drive thru window i ll admit i m a gen xer who did my time working at taco hell during my senior year in when i was my son worked at that same restaurant as a teen so he told his co workers with eye rolls about his old school mom they were so kind they recognized me even after my son had stopped working there and still accommodate me this was my favorite comfort meal to take home bitd after dealing with an awful shift with sh tty drunk customers honestly one of the worst jobs i ever had low pay lots of yelling and my face always felt like a greasy spoon after i got off work i m very aware of the irony in ordering a meal from a chain ff restaurant that was just such an awful place to work years later i grew up with a narcissistic mother so i guess i am used to the abuse and unhealthy ness
compare it to the door dash menu i just paid for soft tacos
it went down hill when grandpa bell sold it to pepsi
mmmmm bell burger
looks tasty
ummm what never seen this before i think my brain is melting what a world
wasn t there segregation back then
holy 3am shit
taco bell existed in the 60s
they knew it back then it s all about the tostada
made with real meat not dogshit paste
at the time a well paid middle class worker might bring home us per week to pay for gasoline food housing and other family essentials not much room there for fancy meals out and even franchise tacos and burgers were a stretch we skipped our local original dennys dannys and taco smell those were for rich folks bankers teamsters factory managers etc yikes
cents i only heard of such things inflation sounds more like governmental extortion
disgusting even then none of this is even mexican food
funny how some white people think taco bell is mexican food
it s like dollars to eat now if you don t eat off the value menu
inflation is a hell of a drug
i want bellburger right now bring that back
coins were actually worth something
with correct pronunciations written below each item except bellburger
enchirito ftw
back when they were still thinking inside the bun
wait when i first began going to taco bell they were all each
i would so eat the hell out of a bell burger
yeah and that s when burritos were actually burritos instead of the tiny smear of beans they give you now and shreds of lettuce i just won t eat at tb anymore because of the incredible shrinking burritos
i don t see the one for diarrhea
my dad is and reminisced about it to me he said it was the taco filling and some lettuce in a bun so very like a sloppy joe
also called a bellbeefer and it was pretty great
del taco runs a taco burger once in a while
dollar general in the us stocks it
that as the first thing i noticed
my yankee dad ma born bred loved having an rc cola with a moonpie as a snack when he was on road trips for his jobs in va wv oh nc he used to pay me and my sister to clean all of the fast food and convenience store wrappers out of his business car when he came home so our mother wouldn t find out
for some reason in chicago a lot of the pizza places will just give you a free liter of rc if you get a large pizza to go
yeah cheap fast food used to be cheap and fast it was indeed often meager there were no supertriplestackbaconcheeseburgers but even at a minimum wage of to you could roll up and trash down with the coinage in your pocket source i m old as fuck and bellied up to this menu more than once
i miss the old cup of beans
with the black olive slices on top my dad used to order them
i remember carlos mencia joking about it in a stand up on hbo in the 90s when i was a kid what d they do get an enchilada to fuck a burrito
green chili enchirito my friend
i went to hs in mesa there was a place called the wall we would all hang out at between taco bell and dairy queen
we used to live in an exotic northwest california area rich in farmlands worked mostly by chicano laborers food at latino eateries there was great but tourists always ate at a taco bell for the familiarity i guess familiar crud may not taste good but ya know what you ll get hey just add more packets of salsa right
i m worried about how much i laughed at this comment
i loved the burrito sucreme as my younger brother called it
yes and no the federal civil rightd act that legally ended all racial segregation was passed in the same year the first taco bell franchise opened was their still segregation sure in practice if not legally in some very hardcore southern states areas there still functionally is some racist bullshit in places one thing about segregation is that it wasn t everywhere segregated schools other public places were unheard of even before then in a whole lot of the us
it is not mexican food at all it is taco bell
sloppy jos
and cheese yum
so what you re saying is that we can make them on our own i know what i m doing this spring break
a few select restaurants offered the bell beefer surf and turf deluxe which added fried shrimp and a scoop of tuna on top of the beefer s lettuce as well as a line of taco tartar sauce holy shit https://tacobell.fandom.com/wiki/bell_beefer
i loved the bell beerer
most safeways and quite a few fred meyer krogers around here do as well
it s kind of weird how everything is the same price now fast food items are priced down to a science
it used to be a literal tub of beans with mucho queso so good
i think you mean bean cup yum
i so wish i had an award to give you this comment made me laugh

what the hell give me that
that was the way pull into mcd s and hamburgers fries and shakes were all although you could throw and go for the cheeseburger if you were a big spender   
i haven t seen that written out in a long time threw me off for a moment
looks real derpy but still awesome
imagine what it would be like to hear music for the very first time
even a wild animal can appreciate good music

bang
that deer is habituated not cool
she could have apples and other food that deer might want out of frame on the ground by her for all we know and her playing music has nothing to do with it
reminds me of a dad joke how do you catch unusual deer unique up on them
this is how a deer waves a lighter when the ballad hits
u savevideo
the deer is like what is that
woman playing harp is frightened by wild animal
some disney stuff right there
hunters furiously searching for a pen write that down write that down
buying a deer blind and blasting the disturbed version you know for science
you just gave deer hunters the soundtrack to play from their stands
we are on that whimsical forest creature type beat
so the legends are true
coincidentally perfectly framed too
this is some disney level shi
amazing
that was really cool too bad she didn t know the deer was there you can actually charm deer with melodic music some birds too they are curious creatures if you sit still long enough singing lilting melodic tunes you can get them to walk right up to you
pretty much deer in a nutshell
damn that s interesting
smart girl honestly
lol that was good
it s just going to get its homies to come listen
im a fawn of this pun
here is the real final version without the deer interrupting https://youtu.be/8msxdpqcrvm) you can see her harp touch the branch a few times unintentionally this has been my ted talk thanks for coming

not only that their hearing is likely much better than ours so what they perceive may be on a whole new level
also yeah the deer version looks weird but i think it was a test to see framing sound lighting and focus prob a first take just a case of bad forground focus and bad lighting this is my midnight sleepless raving thanks for coming

thanks for explaining that i just thought it looked really weird appreciate it
i like how it looks like mama is teaching them how to dance
walking with rhythm to attract a worm
stupid sexy woodcocks those worms
been out in the yard doing this for an hour zero worms only neighbors
i don t remember this scene from dune edit i should have put lol at the end of this sentence
the babies copying momma had me rolling stupid adorable
somebody come get er
it s theorized to attract worms another hypothesis is that the walk discourages predators from attacking false signaling reticent behavior while the woodcock s attention is focused on foraging
swiggety swooty coming for that booty
i thought they were just grooving
how much wood would a woodcock cock if a woodcock could cock wood
me and the boys on the way to shenanigans
i love how the little ones are making no impact yet doing their very best
looks like the worms aren t falling for it today
this needs music stat
shut up and dance with me
wood cock is good but great tits are better
if u put a drum and bass beat to this the bird dance would be
i watched till the end better tell them they need to do emphasize more jiggling
i cannot handle how cute those baby woodcocks are
my first thought was that s a bird not a woodchuck i need more coffee
walking in rhythm movin in sound
not to confuse with the way they walk in dune
look at the little ones so cute im gonna die
mom walking into the bar looking for her husband she s pissed
he knows about the spice
what is love baby don t hurt me don t hurt me no more
i like to move it move it
and that kids is how i met your mother
sure that those baby birds have absolutely no idea what they re doing just wiggling about
the babies
that second baby doesn t quite get it
obligatory walken https://youtu.be/xq7z57qrzu8?t=124) every time this comes up
the babies though look at the babies
how does this attract worms
i believe they have rocked down to electric avenue
if you walk without rhythm you won t attract a worm
got better moves than me
video needs music
amazing how the mom can keep her head stabilized the entire time
couldn t help but play the song walk this way by aerosmith in my head while watching this
babies are mirroring mom
she s teaching the kids
aww teaching the babies
one hop this time
oh sure i try gyrating like this during fishing and i m banned from the aquarium this world has gone to dumps i tell ya
it looks like mama is teaching them how to dance
didn t see any worms so it s just dancing
god those babies are cute
well you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a worm man no time to talk
my country may be a mess but our birds are funky as hell silver linings
can someone please add a song with a nice beat to it
givin them worms the ol razzle dazzle
the babies doing it too
i love how the babies are doing it too
teaching the kids how to groove
don t know why but i was waiting for the bird to catch a worm with this technique
https://www.instagram.com/p/caajt8ehoqb/?igshid=ymmymta2m2y= this guy on instagram called animalsandsynthesizer took this video and added tunes to it enjoy
i like to move it move it i like to move it move it i like to move it move it we like to move it
the kids are like i dont know what you are doing or why but somehow i like it
look mom i m helping
someone better put the audio of a song over it or i will lose my faith in the internet
am i the only one insanely unsatisfied by the fact that we didn t at least see a worm head pop up
swiggity swooty
man these birds are tiny and then they have mini versions of them
they are just dancing worms are byproduct of their coolness
well you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a woman s man no time to talk
the bouncing babies
get jiggy with it little funky dude
this is actully soo cool
iiiiiii can t dance i can t talk only thing about me is the way that i walk
they getting down with their bad selves
the one video on the internet that actually needs catchy background music
same result as when i lure women
assuming this is arrakis these guys must be huge
teach me how to dougie teach me teach me how to dougie
i fail to even be able to take a guess as to how this would work
moms twerking on tik tok be like
i ve never seen a wood cock
mother teaching her children how to twerk
those look like sandpipers to me
aye aye aye aye aye
i like to party everybody does make luv and listen to the music you ve gotta let yourself go go go go go oh
as the saying goes morning wood gets the worm or something like that
i wish i could move like that
is she goated with the sauce
welcome to the party we don t give a fuck about it
me testing the floor so i can get midnight cookies without a midnight beating
elvis would be jealous
also known as the timberdoodle bogsucker hokumpoke and labrador twister
you ever seen this video with uptown funk playing over it hilarious
did these birds just hear walk like an egyptian
my mind is playing the starting beat of butter
they re gonna lure more than worms dancing like that
brrr skibidi dop dop yes yes
look at those cuties lmao they re so adorable
bless the maker and his water bless the coming and going of him may his passage cleanse the world
i ll always up vote this

proof of global warming
there s gonna be a lot of hotsauce spicy food jokes in this thread

this is why the ocean s temp is rising the earth is killing herself wake up sheeple s

horrible little fuckers
from being a tick to become a thicc
they re evil pure evil and must go
comfort eating it probably feels bad inside
so when do they get full they look atleast times their body mass
it sucks
absolutely repulsive
i want to burn my screen now
yes forbidden fruit gusher
when i was a kid i remember my dad once being so excited that he had finally managed to eradicate all the fire ants in the backyard except when the fire ants were gone the ticks moved in holy cow there were countless of the little jerks we had to get off our dog that summer every time she went outside it was insane when the fire ants finally moved back in we just let it happen they were most definitely the lesser of two evils
ticks are one of the most disgusting bugs to ever exist not only are they fucking gross looking parasites they can carry lyme disease i m nearly and scream like a little kid when i find one in my house or worse
me over the winter
jesus christ fed on what
this really ticks me off
the tick farmer gently removes his subject for photos of progress a smile and a little pat on its head as he places it back where it lives under his armpit for more growing time
oh lawd he succing
this is similar to my growth after eating carb
fresh nightmare fuel
parasites are the assholes of the planet there is literally no point to them existing wish they would all die already
why do they even need that much
forbidden grape
ew
and the fact that they cannot be squished the only way i have had any success in killing them is the good ol toilet bowl and even then i don t know what happens at the other end
like my wife after we got married
disgusting fat fucks
crunchy grape
let s see days
me when peanut butter is around
til i am a tick
interesting i ve seen people like that
i thought this was a political statement about the fed for a second
all that for a drop of blood
disgusting little shits
hate ticks had a rough brush with lyme back went from no ticks on me to oops i missed one to omg that s a grapefruit sized bullseye
fat fucks
i loath lyme disease
average american
i thought this was a meme about the fed that is the federal reserve system lol
nicocado tick
what was it fed radiation
imagine that on your rectum wall
i got bit by one of this fuckers they are pretty bad
they should have hired a real fat tick for the last photo rather than hiring brendan frazier
i ve seen them feed until they explode
basically like any chick after a break up or getting married just balloons lol
if you think about it for a second what is the chance of surviving after beeing fed days you arent going to hide anywhere with this mass still scary
hmmmmm grape imagine making wine out of it mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
this isn t soviet russia and this isn t our blood give it back foul tick
happens a lot quicker should change days to hours
my least favourite thing on the planet
fuck these motherfuckers straight to hell

tick gains
bloody arachnids
forbidden bean
forbidden gushers
well i don t like that either
inflation really out here affecting everyone
looks like a semi
seriously wish god never made these
burn this whole post from existence
a tick to become a thicc
true story when my sister was a toddler she found a gwape on the floor and was about to bite into it before we asked her what she was doing yep it was a fully engorged tick
i was eating but i m not hungry anymore
end the fed
why is he not blue
come on now where banana for scale
mf ran off with all our blood
saw one fall off a barn cat a few days ago fully bloated it tried to walk away but i got em my animals all have tick meds on and this is the first time i ever saw one not dead on them it s not what they take it s the nasties they leave
damn fred grew fast af
me on vacation to literally anywhere
i ve encountered a fully fed tick before it met its end by blowtorch a really interesting sight in my opinion
kill them all with fire
tick chungus
engorged
forbidden date
ah nature s fruit gushers dracula s favorite snack on the trail
these critters serve no purpose and i enjoy burning these things alongside the fireplace
my friends ex wife did the same thing
that s me at christmas
i wonder if ticks are beneficial to anything why do they exist
i never knew they were all the same tick thought maybe they were a female and male version
forbidden grape
need a banana for scale
the tick isn t growing it s just full of your blood
suddenly my metabolism doesn t seem so bad
that happens to me the second i go on vacation

now that is pip
i wonder how much it cost especially compared to today s tvs
reminds me of the pie telly we had in the 80s it had a built in stand and wheels so you could wheel it into the other room if the main room was being used for something else
cool idea and i want one but why the other two are so tiny
why would you need one of these
i want one for it s aesthetic
r crtgaming
imagine that was top of the line in it s time
the big one is for family guy clips the smaller ones are for simultaneous subway surfers videos and minecraft parkour videos to maximally destroy your attention span
let me get my microscope so i can t watch the other tvs
it s just tvs in one enclosure are we really supposed to get excited about this
interesting fact the black section on the side is actually a hot drinks dispenser and can offer coffee or tea by pressing every button on the front twice

if school lectures were as smooth as that i may have actually learned something
i wanna see hank s reaction to this
we are inside a black hole that was the singularity it was a star imploding on it self ripping a whole in time and space i m that universe and creating a new universe and the cool thing is there are million and billions of black holes in our universe that have created new universes and it never stops
that was beautiful gonna have to memorize it

big bang tells nothing about creation
to ask why of anything outside human control is likely meaningless because why implies motive and consciousness and after more than a few decades inquiring thereto i ve yet to discern any universal mindfulness ymmv sucker beware any holy institution that demands donations hey
but catholicism and the big bang are complementary i hope you know that it has been for many many years
hit the little save star at the bottom
i dunno why i was downvoted her intelligence creativity and understanding of the subject was amazing but this is reddit and most of the users aren t
i agree i ve been finding this since my deconstruction it tries with gusto to say there is a mindfulness when there in actuality is nothing there was no one there it s far more interesting without a god to say it did it
gods are so much fun humans have invented so many even more deities than demons is that good
this strikes so much anxiety from all different angles for me
that s why there s so many gore pics of train fatalities in india
lol the daredevils seating or death
no thanks that level of population density closeness makes my skin crawl
absolutely not no thank you
the bo smell coming from that train whew
you don t want to be part of this
frontpacks instead of backpacks pick pocketing issue
those front hoppers got great timing
surely they can do better is this lack of available trains or sparse routes
im sure their covid metrics were completely accurate
where s all the waman
this is the result of corrupt politicians and civil servants wasting budget and not developing train networks to accommodate the demand
i can smell them
some people in the west simply cannot fathom how it s run in other countries when you travel you count your blessings rather quickly as a young teen in the us i found a lot to complain about now i tell people how great it is
mother nature never fails to amaze
how many people die from train accidents in india each year
absolutely none of those people are wearing deodorant either
how do less mobile people get on the train do they ask others to quickly throw them on with their wheelchair or walking stick when the train passes
it could always be worse dose not apply here
lmao the first few guys who jumped on before the train even stopped fuck that i m getting a seat
india needs a triple decker caboose
fire video thanks
american karens would make this a nightmare
is there not enough trains to wait for the next one
million square miles with almost billion people both india and new jersey have the same population density at people per square mile except new jersey is just a tiny state
the dudes jumping on while it s near full speed are my heroes if you re going to get a seat you re going to fucking earn it
not indian just mumbai railways
i can smell the rancid bo and it is pungent
what an overcrowded shithole
i m happy women get sitting preference
i d rather live in the worst state in the usa than the best city in india im sure there are lovely places in india but you probably have to travel into the mountains where nobody lives to see them
this is just sad and we still have struggles like this
imagine the smell of street shitters waiting for a train on a hot summer day
are women avoiding the rush hour i don t see a single woman in this crowd granted this train situation doesn t look really appealing for woman it doesn t look appealing for anyone but not a single brave female soul interesting
come on you don t even need to go to india for that before covid this is pretty much how it is with bart in sf i was one of those that had to commute to sf through bart if i get a cent for every time an indian dude pushes me away just because i lined up in front of him i d get at least ten cents which is not much but still infuriating that it happens ten times
fuck that i ll wait for the next one
and this was the first class compartment
my friends and i would put our backpacks on like that and pretend we were pregnant edit when we were in elementary school
i can smell all the indian spices from their potent but delicious cooking
damn
my love to that country went from minus to more minus
jfc what a shit hole
the smells
unfortunately my experience with indians is that they can be very unconsciously selfish and rude in such situations where they must share public spaces its a culture of me and my family first i ve experienced it so many times ans specifically with indians unfortunately
indian trains are notoriously overcrowded there was a picture of an indian train with people riding on the roof and between cars that is normal
couldn t pay me to go to india
why don t they control their population this is ridiculous
nasty ass country
wasn t till half way through the video did i realized that the first guy on was a legend superhero
gif emote free_emotes_pack disapproval this evokes so much anxiety in me i can t stand being in a us city for very long if i had to deal with this every day i would go crazy
reminds of that short animated movie about a rat
it s ok i ll walk there
this is not for the disable
looks like getting on the shuttle park city from the hotel
as a british man i would like to tut and grumble at the non queue system
gross
literally survival of the fittest
that s looks like an absolutely awful way to live
i need to get one of those bellypacks looks cool
imagine having to battle like that everyday for the train i think i d give up work
wow what a pos i looked at this and i said wow what a pos
that s a big nope from me
mad skills bruh
i ll just walk
thank god for wfh
okay hear me out this looks so fun and not stress of anxiety inducing
and in the us they won t sell a baby swing with anything less than a point harness this video makes me wonder how many train related deaths india has in a year
fuck that not to mention the smell
nope i m mashed potato
so how do they call what i call a backpack i man s belly
why does everyone wear backpacks on the front frontpack
remember there s an old star trek episode where the planet they visited was so overpopulated they just stood around like packed sardines this is india
i only see men
nucking futz
forward facing backpacks to avoid pick pockets i take it
just some more information this is only a mumbai local train a metropolitan city financial capital of india spread over km carries million people daily source wikipedia
so being spiderman at that point would be best
as a swiss train rider i get ancy if people come near the door i m lined up for this is nightmare
found this in consequential accidents it acknowledged that up to people have died in untoward incidents in the past three years https://www.orfonline.org/research/towards-zero-deaths-imperatives-safer-indian-railways/?amp
its like they re spawning through a jpeg
oh my god
yay i wish there was more ublic transportation like this here s
this is why wpd has so much content
no women
as a new yorker this has given me levels of anxiety that i never though i had
all that armpit wafting in your face
digitized pigswill
damn this is sad
no wonder my boss was a psycho
how many people die per day from train related deaths there
what s up with the backpacks on their stomachs
crazy ant it
aw man i want a frontpack
this is madness madness
indian here pretty normal just don t miss your train
no women
this is beyond crazy
in china they have train smushers who push people in to close the doors no matter how many people are on the train
what i want to know is how do you get off if you are stuck inside
love when he put it on his head and beat his chest a little like haha i am the king of the blanket watcha gonna do about it huh
what a great dad fun and teaching critical skills
lol i love the casual chest beat in the middle he puts it on is head and he s like aw yeah this my shit
that s adorable good papi little guy even turns around to playfully give dad his leg then proceeds to mimic dad by putting it on his head
the feels when you see gorilla kids have better relationships with their father than you do
remember that bit in the simpsons https://youtu.be/t8swmlqu1pu) when homer tries to give maggie a cardboard box to play with then ends up hogging it for himself and puts it on his head
picks up the little guy and gives a leg nibble cute
i think we just saw them invent hats
puts on head scarf and still drums his chest as if to say i am still the man here just with extra sass
i liked when the baby took a flying leap at dads shoulder and just bounced off
awesome wicked smaht
i m aware of the conservation efforts that zoos bring but it pains me seeing gorillas in captivity they are far too close to humans
his face tho when his baby took the cloth xd
what a good dad
relatable
ahhhh life without reddit so simple
i wanna go back to monke
that s soo wholesome
it was textile dropped by a visitor
more effort in a few minutes than 70s dads different times
try to catch it try to catch my towel
amazing animals just sayin
never let them win make them earn it
i m guessing violence towards your offspring with silverback gorillas was probably not favourable from an evolutionary perspective
jeepers he is absolutely massive
what a great dad
this is good d jeeco probably
well that went dark
get over here so i can nibble your leg a little
they ve entered the hat age
don t be mad at zoos be mad at the big high ups that ruin their homes
ikr i was thinking that too on one hand i m like fuck the zoos then immediately remember their natural habitat is a war zone
am i the only one that gets an indescribable weird feeling because of the fact that they re so smart and similar to us
i m aware of the conservation efforts that zoos bring what do you think i meant with this statement
i never said you did not know about the conservation efforts i was talking about something else
false this is an animal crossing fossil
wow thats really nice
that is amazing
great deku tree
it saw romans
wise mystical tree
it s absolute bollocks
what secrets does he hold
i ll be god damned it s real
a weirwood tree from game of thrones
serious fantasia night on bald mountain vibes
watch some jackass cut it down amh

he a war counselor and smith
serious game of thrones vibes
the talking tree is old as dirt but i wonder if anyone ever made a talking tree character was based off this specific tree
how is there not a single lotr or ent reference on this post yet
i am not altogether on anybody s side because nobody is altogether on my side if you understand me nobody cares for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
it s just begging to be destroyed in the next war
if you are over and own a computer
i want to take shrooms and hang out with this tree
wow that tree was here shortly after the world formed years ago amazing
like eustance bagg from courage cut down that nice talking tree always hated teh toxic asshole
lol
they sure don t make them like they used to
i have to say that s pretty damned interesting i love globes
i just built one out of lego this looks harder
you know what this was actually interesting
this is when companies took pride in the products they built and weren t just looking to make money
cap it s not flat
too much work why didn t they just invent amazon back then instead and just order one from vachina
just slather on some more lead paint and mercury good job mabel i know you re six months pregnant so here s a shot of vodka and a cigarette to calm your nerves for the next set of globes
i just love how well dressed they are for essentially assembly line work
i thought since they didn t have to worry about the environment back then they were just cloning worlds into miniature worlds that s why they cost so much
i made one of those in elementary school in the 80s paper mache and everything
did they cost more than a car honestly how many people worked at the globe factory this is intense
i d love to be there if this were not
idiots don t realize there supposed to be flat s
the plaster guy has the best job
the good times
they also exposed people to harmful chemicals without ppe not necessarily on purpose just because nobody knew until they developed cancer or other ailments ignorance is bliss
this was also when globes were likely pretty hard to come by i imagine it was pretty earth shattering hah to see a globe for the first time when it took this much work to make one automated processes led to cheaper good and more availability so more people could access them is that really a bad thing
yes it was it was a flat map likes supposed to be they had to cut it to fit conspiracy confirmed s
ooh thanks for posting
i have a dvd from the early s that has all the tv funhouse commercials and cartoons very edge stuff even for the s when most of them were released
most businesses work this way unfortunately go look at who owns all the food companies yeah you can see like different logos at the grocery store but trace them all back and it s like four companies
i d read it didn t air because they went after ge which owned nbc at the time
it s not called conspiracy theory rock the song was titled media opoly and you can still find it on youtube
norm macdonald really was fing relentless with the oj jokes back then absolutely hilarious stuff https://youtu.be/2ssvig4noqc) and deserved
this and sinead o connor tearing up the picture of the pope two things never aired again
this is great thanks for posting
also see bo burnham this is how the world works or george carlin years ago truth is these regimes get stronger by allowing a little dissent simply pointing out the problem doesn t solve it
the best part is that these very same issues are at least ten times worse now
every time i point this out some idiot tells me why fox or cnn isn t biased in any way they want us divided because then we can t unify divided we are easy to control when the american people realize that as a whole we get this country back on track
they brought nuclear into this for no reason the pcbs were dumped into the hudson river from a capacitor manufacturing https://www.riverkeeper.org/campaigns/stop-polluters/pcbs/) plant edit also westinghouse https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-21-fi-7879-story.html)
interesting how they re keen to throw nuclear power under the bus but not coal or crude oil
higher quality version here https://vimeo.com/93040968
amendment to be and poor house rock by simpsons are really good too
i always think this when i see a musical act on a late show or snl or the intro outro music of some popular show on a specific network olympics march madness
they sucessfully predicted today s corporate culture sadly all media is owned and controlled by a few powerful corporations it s saddening and terrifying
u savevideo
nbc proved their point for them
i wish people would understand that a huge amount of all those studies you see are likely funded by companies manipulating data or only showing half truths etc and they work unfortunately because of politics some of these things get mixed up in left vs right when in reality it s just greed vs everyone else
bravo thanks for posting it was beautiful
ripped and saved so good
i distinctly remember this i can t believe it only aired once
so this got censored cause it true
propaganda american news is propaganda
when snl made comedy good times
how were nuclear plants releasing pcbs like as general industrial waste they re definitely not in the nuclear side of things because nothing is allowed to be released from the nuclear side also loved the end talking about firing norm mcdonald
wow thank you so much for sharing this rare gem
this is only seconded by the fake commercial for keds shoes after the heavens gate cult killed themselves while all wearing the same make and model of nikes i ve still not found that video
westinghouse is a problem
it definitely reaired when i watched snl on comedy central in the 90s
it s funny when big corporations try to hide stuff like this it smells of guilt i don t believe in lizard people or fake moon landings but some conspiracy theories on the political level are definitely true
this video also has misinformation nuclear scare from some of their bits which what they are talking about never came from nuclear plants
i m not surprised ge owns owned nbc and i bet an exec saw the skit and heads rolled
this isn t even a conspiracy theory this is literally the inevitable end state of deregulation
half of reddit is too stupid too believe this because anything with the word conspiracy next to it is automatically dismissed
it s been on youtube for over a decade https://youtu.be/nh6hf5_zypi)
if they don t want you to see something odds are you should absolutely see it
so corrupt
rip norm
after u mousezez posted that conspiracy theory rock clip from snl they never posted again
reminds me of the in living color skit where jim carry plays a cop training his officers that the worst enemy of an officer is a video camera
fox news doesn t even try to hide it
fun fact the industry has consolidated ten fold since then
funny how a lot of these conspiracy theories are just common knowledge now it s important to be objective it s also important to remember that just because you ve identified a conspiracy it doesn t mean you re wrong or crazy
why does this surprise anyone what was true back then is true now
yo holy shit combine this with when rage against the machine was banned https://www.revolvermag.com/music/see-rage-against-machine-performance-got-them-banned-snl) and was an interesting time for snl
still think there is no fake news
when it not just the theory any more
motivated self interest rules virtually all animal behaviors true for all animals nature favors tribes with limited influence lions for example only kill what they need to feed their pride of course females do all the work they don t hoard surplus to use as leverage mother nature didn t count on the serious imbalance caused by win lose scenarios being played out on a global oligarchy corporate government passive citizenry stage now that we have added social media outlets tribes can instantaneously reach out and prey globally and we are sheep to the slaughter unless we do something to break the pattern of mindless following sorry to get so heavy propaganda only works on the weak minded and we have bred an entire generation of people that think everything they see on youtube is true real even this platform is suspect but i will do my best to sort out truth from lies tricky you may remember this story members of the whitefoot tribe always tell the truth and members of the blackfoot tribe always lie but they all wear shoes that hide their feet how to get them to take off their shoes is the challenge then you can see them for what they are thanks for listening
not even a conspiracy just normal ass capitalism
capitalism run amok is scary they always call america the land of opportunity but i feel like we have less opportunities in this country than we used to for an average person to succeed if they just work hard enough so many invisible ways we keep the poor folks in there place and the rich get richer and richer to a point well beyond excess
and yet mfs still won t admit capitalism is an the problem untenable unsustainable b b b buh but socialism c c c can t work smh
america is china with a better pr team
it s not even a theory it s a fact the fact it s banned confirms that
i miss when the left was anti corporation
how is this a conspiracy theory it s conspiracy true
conspiracy theory my ass that was well researched journalism
i remember seeing this no surprise then no surprise now
get a gofund me n run it as a commercial lol
wallstreet
i never thought i would see this ever again
based
if i recall from russianbadger he said that general electric made the gun for the a10 warthog
saved
upvote and award cuz this is getting buried
holy shit
i am ssurprised it was even approved and aired at least once
the president in this animation highly resembles clinton lol
same in every country btw media and press gets millions to cover up things and make them look good
hey talking about stuff that was on a podcast but you can t find anymore jeff garlin had a podcast i d say years ago in one episode he interviewed michael moore in front of an audience jeff coaxes moore into telling a conspiracy theory relating to the murder of nicole brown simpson perhaps that one of oj s sons might have committed the murder and oj was innocence covering for his son whatever the details of this disavowed conspiracy theory i don t care much i simply want to rehear the episode because it was so damn funny again not sure on the details don t remember it well but i m pretty sure i didn t make the whole thing up but i cannot find it anywhere anybody else remember this or have a link or have i mandala effected myself
the news and anything else you see on a screen is entertainment first just remember that
conspiracy theory anti capitalism
yeah conspiracy looks like they re spitting straight facts to me all they say is accurate can t air that oh no
haha fuckin norm macdonald wasn t surprised when i heard the voice good shit and i m sure some heads rolled for that airing even once they had balls good for them
i forgot that they mentioned why norm got fired
the s were so cringe with their unfounded distrust of nuclear energy
holy shit that was brave not only to say all that on the air but to overtly condemn buying products from their sponsors that s insane that it even got to air once good for tv funhouse i can t believe robert smigel had a career after that
that was as interesting as it was uncatchy
interesting
i m surprised it even aired at all
this seems like a good place to ask as it is kind of related there was an snl episode where george bush played by will ferrell was hiding behind his desk in the background there was fire from war or something this was pre i m pretty sure i saw this episode but have never been able to find it again does anyone remember this episode or was it all in my head
it would be a shame if someone made it go viral
that s not a conspiracy just capitalism lol
got to wonder why
nice
jeeze really gone woke these days
when are we all going to stop work and demand the government fix just one of our problems
give it an upvote maybe comment even then forget it and nothing changes because we are willfully ignorant
thanks wasn t depressed enough this morning
literal reasons to drs gamestop for
when snl had some integrity
yep
dear all of you the for giving me a little hope from a lost soul
it s funny because it s true

i remember watching this in a media and advertising block in my senior year english class
george carlin should be the talking mc
did james downey and robert smigel write this it sounds like the original singer of those pbs shorts in the s
u savevideo
camouflage was probably easier before color was invented
they also have barcodes along the sides because in sweden they scan da navy in
that right there is a pile of rocks no ship to see here move on
that s john cena s boat you can t see me
how to avoid visual detection be in the right place and don t move how to avoid nasal detection don t smoke anything outside how to avoid radar detection hang much seaweed off the sides
fortunately eastbloc navies including russia s likely don t station geologists as lookouts will that change now will those navies raid their nations rock hound societies and faculties will the west grant refugee status to fleeing geophysicists
you can t sea me
how much dna do we share with howler monkeys
i ve always been a quiet man
nigel after all these monkeys finish that infernal caterwauling nip down there and fondle their testicles there s some aught odd here very good sir
size does matter he whispered
so it s like driving an oversized truck but for monkeys
it is pretty common for animals to have smaller testicles if they are the only ones copulating with the females of their group gorillas for example too have small testicles you only need big testicles if you need a larger quantity of sperm because your sperm needs to compete with the quantity of the other males
i swear this is just a passive aggressive meme sub
what researchers at cambridge was just watching howler monkeys and went that s a pretty loud howl let s look at their balls
let s see the nutsack
i d be howling too if some limey was fondling my retracting monkey testicles as well
since they can t drive jacked up trucks they howl louder
it s always the quiet ones
women from every species have known this for thousands of years
so human equivalent example having a needlessly loud exhaust on your none impressive car
i m no qualified researcher but i m pretty sure we had plenty of data from a more accessible primate women everywhere all at once
andrew tate must share dna with howler monkeys
likely the case in most primates
for anyone who thinks we re not just over evolved monkeys
same for us with those loud ass car engines that people rev in the middle of the night
so this is why dudes make their trucks so loud
but they re average right please say they are
til humans are howler monkeys
r likeus
same in humans interestingly enough
r likeus
this shouldn t be surprising given it s distant cousin the human does the same
kind of like us the higher your truck is raised the smaller your banana if ya get my drift
the same goes for human men and trucks
this translates to the loudest and most attention seeking humans
i ain t with the talking see i m just trying to focus cause the loudest n in the room is usually the brokest wale
that says a lot about reddit trolls
i m sure there will plenty of people drawing parallels to humans which might be true i dunno i just reddit
aren t human s dna only away from being monkeys anyway l
sound familiar
this says a lot about society
just like those dudes who make their cars trucks loud purposely tiny little peepees
man that s why i m so quite all the time
same with guys that drive lifted trucks
apparently is not only for this monkeys
does this also correlate with what size dodge truck they drive
yes we also see this phenomenon in politics
applicable to social media
republicans now a days
like dudes with loud as fuck cars small dick having ass mother fuckers
til marjorie taylor greene has small nuts
this happens with men and cars
til that people are still obsessed with the size of other peoples genitals to express superiority in their own way
sounds like the southern protestant white american male
just like with humans the more men spend on vehicles the smaller the testicles
it s called the republican effect
most comments are about trucks or republicans reddit if nothing else is consistent those damn republicans shakes fist insert topic of the week is all their fault lmfao
they call those conservatives
this explains so much about trump
it s amazing people are still ripping on trump with this shit ohh it s like trump and the republicans while at the same time saying how tired they are of hearing about him it kinda sums up the who left side of the political spectrum really
reminds me of little guys in a big truck sort of
just like antifa members lol
kind of like pick up trucks here in the us a similar indicator
why does his face remind me of donald trump when he s at a microphone
and this relates exactly to dudes with jacked up trucks
he just like trump
the republican party should change their mascot
left is clearly marjorie traitor greene and right is lauren bonobo
that explains all these rednecks with unnecessarily loud trucks
same with reich wing tweeters
now that is some useful information glad research money is being put to good use
same applies to american politics
politicians hate this news it hits too close home
same with the proud boys
the one on the left looking like marjorie taylor greene so i d say it checks out for a woman she sure gives off some major small dick energy
proof that the luney bunch of current republicans have very small genetalia

this is one quiet monkey https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcs0rlvpy9hhuyvhtuilr3faf6slebtid9uvyq&usqp=cau)
speak softly and carry a big stick
roaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar
humans use expensive sports cars
i thought they were seals for a moment
explains why my dad is always yelling and why i m always quiet
nothing unusual here i d say hahaha
yeah that s about right
there you go disproving evolution theory some things never change
so big black bmw audi of animal kingdom
looks like we still share some of the same cultural traits
just like some ppl
yay another piece of research that people are gonna use as an excuse to body shame
i knew it
i have large testicles but small penis can i trade
we have trucks
this doesn t sound like a real fact but still funny
how high are their registers is this like that eunuch soprano male church choir thing
so it s just like in people always the smallest one in the group talking shit
tiny testicles but huge dick though i yell a lot too
surprising
jarvis divert all power to vocal chords
does this research also extend to those wannabie street racers that have loud mufflers and exhaust
fear the silent monkey
haha haha hahaha i know a few blokes who would be very offended by this
i know a few humans like that except other things are smaller to
tracks with men who drive gigantic trucks loud vehicles
not surprising at all the more souped up or expensive the car the smaller the you know what
so next time someone at the pub bar starts giving it some just repeat this loudly to your friends
they had no idea at the time that he was never coming back i mean something that looked like him came back but it wasn t him
yea it was a white man
i wonder if her boyfriend was the one that took the picture space boy is gonna be gone for the next months
nice yacht
i ve always took pictures of the moon and stuff i ve always thought about it what it d be like going to the moon or at least in space it s gotta be scary but absolutely beautiful at the same time lol
that s one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
cute funny how derpy they look when they are not triggering your creepy crawly instinct
my wife has arachnophobia this might be a good micro exposure for her
jumping and wolfspiders are cute also really intelligent animals
deinopidae always reminded me of an anime character after spotting something they love and haven t seen in forever
i love how i only know how to pronounce the jumping spider s scientific name because of the scene in spider man
i stayed in the olive valleys in the south of spain sierra nevada area one evening i was watering the veg area of the garden when something caught my peripheral i instinctively turned and blasted this very light almost translucent fast moving object spider about 8inch square sprinting towards me over this white rock court yard area i got it first time and fulll in the face before the lance of the hose hit the ground i was already at the side gate and swinging it closed on route to the small house at the back that was the last evening watering i did massive nope yes i did run although i dont remember feet ever touching the ground he was not acting defensively he was aggy af
now try pelican spiders and nephila trichonephila
fuck them all
great chart
wow i hate them all equally
like the spiderverse
and here i am worried about thigh gaps circa two thousand and late
this chart is very important in iding spider species as coloration varies even among siblings in the same egg clutch
i can t unsee the buckteeth help
how come the cutest one is the only one with nope in its name
everyone has lovely eyes
eresidae is the only face i can trust
i love how the jumping wolf and net casting spiders have huge eyes it s all the better to see their prey since they are active hunters
portia is that you
so kawaii
fascinating i wonder which ones are venomous or bite yeah i m too lazy to google things these days
nightmares alll of them
said the same thing until i looked up each one lol
wishing you luck
r damnthatsterrifying
pelican spiders oh damn that is interesting
no way jumping spiders are awesome you ever have one come at you hell no if anything they see you and nope the fuck out lol
ok correction jumping spiders are awesome can t say about the rest especially goblin spiders idk that hairless orange texture bugs me out lol
lets normalize crediting the artist for their work and if you don t know the artist either figure it out or don t use their art to karma farm
this is beautiful
seriously incredible
this is why i m no longer allowed in the library
i m sure the book author just loves to have their work doodled over and cut up
looking at that while tripping would be incredible
beeeeautiful i would love having one of these but i hate knives so i can t make one it s very pretty
super aswesome dude
im sure the book author cares that a copy of their book on the other side of the world is being cut a bit
pretty crazy we both posted the same thing at the same exact time you forgot to include your source according to the rules though
the cut to deep dish fish dj has me rolling
he s got some little ampullae of lorenzini
ethereal snailfish right super cute
fish really went
it s interesting that lighted seems to have been displaced entirely by lit in the last hundred years either way absolutely lighted post fam
a pre lit cigarette was this the pinnacle of human achievement has it all been downhill ever since
there was a vending machine on my college campus that had a prize built it i bought a bag of skittles once and the screen flashed congratulations you have won i stood there confused for a second and then it spit out in quarters i ll tell you this much i never used another vending machine other than that one my entire time there
loosies
so it was legal to sell loosies at one time
real life popeye s girlfriend
have you seen this ah yes the clickbait of our ancestors
pair this with a machine that dispenses a shot of whiskey and a fortune would be at hand
my dad used to talk about vending machines that would roll a new cigarette for you also he never mentioned them coming pre lit though
we really have gone backwards as a society if you can t even buy a lit cigarette from a machine these days
selling loosies quick someone get a cop to put that vending machine in a chokehold
i would so use that right now
one penny adjusted around cents nearly on point for pricing
freedom was pretty cool glad i got to witness it
wonder how many places burned down because of a malfunction
i haven t jonesed for a cigarette in about years but something about this picture made me crave one crazy how addiction is just always around now
so cool why did they stop making these lol
what could possibly go wrong
i would like to see these in dispensaries
i d absolutely take up smoking if i saw this buy one cigarette out of curiosity and then smoke it to avoid wasting it
need one of these that does blunts
dispensing pre lot black cats would be a very different thing today boom
george floyd lost his life for selling singles
yeah that s a fucking fire hazard if ever i ve seen one
that dress looks sexy on the model too
this kinda shit is what makes me question literally every fad or trend good or bad that ever occurs in popular culture they honestly thought this was innovative back in the day wild
that s lit fam
are those the asbestos filters if not i m not interested i like to protect my lungs from the harsh chemicals in the tobacco
deleted
deleted
i d kill a whole family of koalas for a cigarette right now
that s actually pretty cool
what could go wrong here
i can think of a few dispensaries racing to find one of these right now
i need one in my home
that s a fire waiting to happen if i ve ever seen one
gold flake for lighted cigarette is that exactly as it sounds does anyone know
the good old days when doctors would prescribe you craven a to clear out your lungs
ok wow so cool
doctors recommend a lighted cigarette
something about have you seen this on the side of the machine is cracking me up it s hyping itself up in the third person
if anyone has one of these machines i wanna buy it
dispensaries need to bring this bad boy back
so much better than having to buy a whole pack when you are trying to quit
lit
these would make a killing at bars today sell em for a dollar a cig
can we get one of these for some kush pre rolls
matchless penny darts holy hell can t remember the last time a penny bought anything
i wonder what dumb shit we do now will be posted on reddit in the year people drinking kombucha maybe
it didn t even get choked to death
in is equal to today let s round that up to cents per cigarette given cigarettes per pack that s a pack of smokes in today s dollars for
what a fucking time to be alive
here we see ethel getting herself a lighted black cat cigarette from a machine black cats are recommended for women by doctors everywhere to keep their figure looking sharp
it commited a felony
i don t even smoke and i want this machine
oh that i could live years ago lord
wasn t a black man murdered by police for doing this recently
using an attractive female to advertise oh the inhumanity
how were they lit inside the machine wouldn t they have burned
one penny
that is fucking awesome i smoked in airplanes until
lit bro
how else are pregnant women expected to keep their weight down s
lighted was lit before lit became lit
i was thinking about this briefly and i concluded that advertising a lit cigarette implies it should exit the machine in a burning state it s called lighted because the application of heat is a secondary process
it is interesting but also pretty obvious when you think about it back then we lighted things continuously throughout the day every day whether it was cigarettes fireplaces lights or stoves so it was natural for us to shorten the word through slang just as we do with so many words today
also there s a few indian reservations i go to and they still sell singles
hhaha
i ll tell you this much i never used another vending machine other than that one my entire time there
like many words contractions eventually are found to make speaking easier
slice bread will ya why i oughta
i m genuinely curious
the answer is a resounding yes
someone get a cop to put that vending machine in a chokehold
isn t that how a gambling addiction starts
when i was a kid i loved to push buttons while waiting at a seafood market i spied a vending machine and had to press the buttons imagine my surprise when a coke rolled out i spent the next years of my life pressing buttons on every vending machine we passed i also liked to check pay phones for quarters but that wasn t nearly as exciting
is that a way of saying oral sex
it didn t become illegal until the tax laws changed that s the only reason it s illegal now but you can still legally purchased single cigarillos in a tiny plastic tube that are already pre taxed to be sold in singles also there s a few indian reservations i go to and they still sell singles as well as just bags filled with loose cigarettes lol because they re immune to the tax codes it s legal
yes in ohio even as currently as years ago or so
i m just waiting for the machines that dispenses one line of cocaine to go with the cigarette and whiskey thank you very much
brazil has this already with the national drink as opposed to whiskey
me when economy
i know you re joking but i kinda want the real story now how many of these malfunctioned how many fires started or was it because kids were smoking or something else i m genuinely curious
only today in the s those didn t exist
call the cops on this establishment from you good samaritan
you do understand bic lighters weren t always around right
people pushing their political views down everyones throat for no reason
huh did i miss something
that wasn t george floyd it was eric garner
my brain really wants your comment to say lighted was lit before lit became lighted but that clearly isn t right stupid brain
i think it s lit to have lighted upon this etymological discourse
there should be a lit cover band called lighted
that s lit yo
i m illuminated maybe i m illuminati but not like the unlit kind this is nothing you can use i m just confused
there s a place near where i live that does that just ask them for a port otherwise they won t sell it lol
here in nj they call em loosies
that s the only reason it s illegal now
i was going to ask if this machine were found in new york today if a cop would choke it to death
bot
what are the odds
so pretty much the same people do with huntsman spiders
your snake is ready to be shipped
do firefighters in every culture have mustaches must come with the training
he was quick efficient and never harmed the cobra respect
this dude has way more faith in a piece of paper than i do
i feel brave doing that with wasps and bees
i like that so much better than killing them
the tried and true method of the paper is honestly hilarious
ok this is how you remove insects and spiders not cobras jeez
hello fire department my cobra is stuck in a tree
danger noodle in plastic jar and paper
clearly not the first time he s put a cobra in bottle life skills people
beautifully done i love how carefully he tucks its tail
just let me know your gonna repost my post i wouldn t mind https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/12b3d1a/snake_rescue_in_pondicherry_puducherry_fire_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1
i hope the bottle cap has some holes poked in it for the snake to breath
easy as that
ahhhhh wow
ain t his first rodeo
i didn t realize the fireman mustache is universal
i ve only ever seen this method used on spiders
that s exactly how we relocate huge spiders found in our homes in australia
it s amazing how such a skilled hunter and stealthy danger noodle can be also this easy to capture
this is what the firefighters show up in india wearing they don t wear uniforms just street clothes
will it suffocate
alright i have an honest to god question i know it s probably a cultural thing and i m not saying my ways are right but in the area i live in if a venomous snake enters an area where people live we kill it without hesitation i guess my question is why risk your life to save something with only goals are to survive and kill
danger noodle just wanted to hang out no big deal i felt a little sad seeing it all coiled up and upset at the bottom of the container
u hear bird they call on seeing the snake
cobras are supposed to be smart too this could be a real fuckaroundandfindoutable moment
it starts evolving
i knew the plastic jars i sold to scrap dealer would be put to good use eventually
i wonder what their annual budget looks like
was it non uniform day
nope
maybe wear some gloves and pants next time just a thought
that guy is so calm my crying and screaming would freak out the snake and i would die
my ex thought i was pretty badass for doing that to harmless spiders
well i guess it s settled to be a fireman in any country you need to have a mustache
i deal with a lot of venomous snakes around my house and know what i m doing my hat is off to this master bravo
mans isn t wearing proper ppe for this
when you order a hose pipe off wish
now add vinegar and pickled beats
give me a jar and a piece of paper i got this
where are the air holes
this guy snakes
this was not his first rodeo
hi are you through with those cheese balls yes great can i have the container to catch deadly snakes in
probably the most unnecessarily dangerous thing i ve seen all day
here lemme just put this hat on you real quick
not his first rodeo
who else thought the cobra was going to back out his head and strike
matthew at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
snaxx in a boxx
every civilian that are not qualified to handle any type of snake empty buckets or containers new or used manila folder
those birds know wussup you crazy
angry noodle
funny how he tucked the snake s tail into the jar at the end
someone used a variant of this in florida just replace snake with alligator and you ll undetstand
now you fucking punt that shit into a lake
fun fact once they catch the snakes humanely the catcher walks away and leaves the snake in the jar as punishment for being a meanie
what it s being rescued from i don t get it
gloves for the love of god
very intersting
for the snake to breath
or park town prawns
removed
do firefighters in every culture have mustaches
snake safe
i think they give you a learner stash to tape on while your real
i think they give you a learner stash to tape on while your real one grows in from all the manliness you ll be participating in same for the chicks that join
initially firefighter s mustaches served as a primitive anti smoke respirator now surely not but tradition is still continued
if you re actually curious my dad is a firefighter and he has a mustache because that is the only place his department will allow him to grow hair he has to go in for regular respirator and face mask fittings and they require a clean shaven skin seal probably wasn t the historical reason but it has sure persisted the stereotype
inidan men always have a mustache
this snake spectacled cobra is worshipped even within the interiors of india no one harms this snake as people are aware they mainly eat rats which destroy crops
dexterity
exactly i d be worried it would attempt a strike through it
i love how carefully he tucks its tail
removed
came here to say this
you think a snake rescuer wouldn t know that
nah just dutch soccer team replicas
dude was definitely called in the middle of his kabaddi game
as long as the bottle has holes no but snakes can go much longer with less oxygen than other predators due to a much much much slower metabolism and the fact that they intake oxygen at a slower rate so they snake is fine so long as he s not hurt
in india snakes are considered sacred we even have festival to celebrate it called nag snake panchami we try not to kill them unless they pose a danger every life form has an equal right over our earth it s not just humans
depends on how frequently the snakes enter your area and what other purpose they serve snakes keep the population of rodents and frogs in check for example
snakes are protected species under wildlife protection act so killing them keeping them as pets hunting eating dealing etc etc things are unlawful if you find you got to report to wildlife protection they take them release them in the wild
i mean why kill something that s just trying to survive especially if it isn t a matter of life or death for me if i can move it out of the way without hurting it or it hurting me might as well we have the gift of intelligence and i d argue that it comes with some noblesse oblige
killing it is illegal unless it strikes someone all wildlife is protected by law in india and you wouldn t want to end up in jail
it s not about budget mate it s about what can be acquired at the time of rescue to keep the people snake safe
he put a snake in a jar effortlessly what did you do
if you live in pondicherry you wouldn t either
why
i read that as gloves for the glove god
just another day on the job
bot
bot
i like that so much better than killing them
indians in general have a mustache
i once heard a fire fighter at my church say that they couldn t rock more than a mustache due to the seal on the respirator
all snakes are more helpful than harmful i only draw the line at moccasins in the us because those assholes will actually chase you everything else just wants to be left alone
my guy that bottle is not air tight
soon to be portrayed on the big screen by willem dafoe
i will never eat a bug oh if you get hungry enough you will do a lot of shit you didn t think you could
i would have made a meatshake instead
repost for the xxxth time
eww
i can t tell if this is clever or psychotic
feels like canabilsm from a certain point of view
daaaaammnn
from my point of view the deer are cannibals
nope no way not a chance
i have climbed this although it is quite scary looking here there are conveniently placed hand holdings in the staircase you can lean against the slope and climb easily one thing that is dangerous here is the monkeys do not go when it is not the season of this trek otherwise the monkeys will snatch your bags and could pull you off the staircase we had to throw snacks to deflect the monkeys while we climbed up p s that was a near death life experience imagine surrounded by five monkeys who are constantly trying to pull you off on the left is death right too if you try to go down monkeys will come if you try to go up they will follow
i was there in last rainy season with my group it was foggy u could not see the valley below due to clouds and fog so we were in the middle on these stairs and it was pouring heavily and it was of slippery all of sudden we hear few monkeys when we see above us it was a group of monkeys staring down on us it was a weekday and hence there was no one on the fort all i saw was people while going up we got shit scared because of the monkeys from the group were very huge and scary with marks on their faces as we started the descent again those apes started moving slowly towards us and we all stopped again discussing what should be our strategy and all of sudden an indie doggo came out of no where barking and scared those monkeys to the point they ran away we quickly began the descent and the doggo followed us he accompanied us several kms till we reach our vehicles we were so grateful of him we offered him every food item we had with us and left him a huge bowl of water
this is how i plummet to death
nah bro even lord shiva can t convince me to go there
it s one of the scariest things i ve climbed one slip and there is a high possibility that your either paralyzed for the rest of your life or dead it s even more crazy when it rains people still do it but worth the experience
these fort treks in maharashtra scare me to death
it s the trusting others not to domino me to my death that makes this a challenging concept
one thing that never ceases to amaze me is that in worldbuilding games you would never build something like that because it is to unrealistic and yet people have done it irl
social media has ruined every tourist location in india
that s an incredible view
there s gonna be that one asshole at the top who lost his balance
my legs are exhausted just looking at this it s okay till the pullback and you see the distant background on the right
how do i put this oh yeah fuck that
this is the staircase i see in my dream
bad place to have to use the restroom
pretty sure that stairway leads to mordor
if someone slips that ll put all the people below them on danger
it s not the ascent that kills you it s actually the monkeys
i looks difficult in photos and videos but it s quite easy it is overrated though lot of crowd on weekends and you can t enjoy the nature s beauty in peace
if its alright with you i think i ll pass on this
guys who ve been there do you return by the same route wanna know how the climb down looks
reminds me of cirith ungol
one man starts rolling down and it s game over
i fail to see how invaders can even scale such a fort in those times the only way to do so is a war of attrition also unless there s a secret passage out of the fort it s a nightmare for the defenders to mobilise for a counter attack against the invaders i d assume this fort was meant purely for defense as a last stand against the invaders
that s an insane amount of trust everyone has that one of them aren t going to slip and kill the others hard pass for me
i will never climb that with these many people only if i m only one there as i don t trust others to not fall on top of me
breath of the wild
the angle is a bit misleading it s definitely narrow and steep but the climb is safe to do if you re fit grab some lemonade before you start climbing the steps there s a surprising amount of room on the top you d always find groups of people there
ah yes hello i reserved a session for noping around complete with a bucket of gummibears and a sixpack of yoohoos
that would be annoying as fuck simply for the fact that i m sure i would get stuck behind somebody that was really slow and out of shape
my parents explaining to me how they got to school back in the day
name checks out hariharhar like its cackling at you
if you slip you not only kill yourself but the people below you too
i live in india and i know how despicable safety standards are here only a few months ago newly constructed bridge in gujarat collapsed killing more than hindu pilgrims i will never go to this fort
ha fuck that
i know my life worth shit but bro i love being alive
it looks like the stairs have hand grippers
dominoes yeey
nope
all it takes is one person to slip and they would have a pretty sick k d ratio
accurate depiction of how our parents say they went to school
the trail of fuck that
am i the only one thinking that if one person from top slips then it ll be like domino gif emote free_emotes_pack dizzy_face
wait is this the same place where that one guy was speed running but in the rainy weather
um that s a definite nope from me does anyone else look at this and imagine someone at the top falling and knocking all the people below over like a bowling ball
wow something actually interesting and not political bs on this sub
one person taking a tumble could cause a horrible domino effect sheesh i couldn t
those two guys standing on the top side of the stairs have balls of tungsten
terrible fort look at all the people breaching
absolutely not
i should visit a psychiatrist i wanted people to fall from there just for laughs god save me
the fort is being stormed what do we do not a problem wait for the first guy and shove him backwards
there is a reason why we believe in reincarnation
god damnnnn i saw this same exact thing in my dream i was stuck midway through the climb
maybe if i was alone that is too many people to trust on something that high knowing how stupid some are
i have little to none trust on humans you must trust your life on strangers above you and hope they don t include americans
that s what i love about india everything is managed extremely professionally
i wonder how many people die there every day
but why
i think that this belongs on r oddlyterrifying
wow excellent trek now this lowly american would not attempt it but kudos to those sleuth footed individuals
is there anywhere in india that isn t crowded
not showing the fort in the clip should get you removed from the internet
safety first in india
not for the faint of heart
ants climbing anthill
if you want challenging trekking routes try climbing mount k2 in pakistan
let me guess this is for some stupid religious practice
u savevideobot
if one of them fall it ll be a domino
nah not for me not a chance
if one go down all will go down
maybe not so many people all at once is that possible the hell
imagine how many people would be injured if someone at the top trips
damn that is steep as only takes that one person to fall
it wud be fun climbing down with people climbing up knwing one mistake is enough to wipeout you and everyone
human domino waiting to happen
who s going with me
places to avoid going with idiots
no thank you
we trek this fort in the rainy season though
falling would be interesting
didnt led zeppelin write a song about this in
saala idhar bhi itni bhid koi toh jagah india mein kam log wali rakho
would love to do something like this
this gives me anxiety and i m not even doing it no
one slips and its over for all of them
that fort was really awesome have been there it even have a long history
ngl id try
why would one do this
umm as someone who s afraid of heights this seems like my ultimate nightmare i d shit my pants lol excuse my language
nope one guy falling falling from the top can take out like people
how many times was this fort taken in battle i don t know how you can get more impregnable in this maybe just starve them out
i went there but at that there was very less crowd so i climbed
i love trekking i went many hilly areas of north and northeast india
also a fun fact the wikipedia page for harihar fort has the only example of subjective language that i am aware of on the website the act of climbing this very staircase is described using the word wonderful instead of terrifying
i ve seen some rolling down the slops when i went for trekking shit was terrifying af i was so scared to go up after that
so the first google suggestion to harihar fort is death
one tumbles rest will follow tragedy waiting to happen
that is one hell of a bit end of level boss i wonder where its weak spots are
isn t that an ekranoplan
the km korabl maket known colloquially as the caspian sea monster
why does it have boobs
that thing looks like the main antagonist of ff13
if we just keep putting more of these shitty engines on eventually it will fly
here is one https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9407688,48.3789272,198m/data=!3m1!1e3
that plane is freaking ugly
looks like the soviet version of an imperial star destroyer
i m surprised they didn t try to use it in their current conflict couldn t be worse than any of their other crap
name of the aircraft
pretty dumb idea
needs to be turned into a nightclub for burning man
i love seeing what people used to think would be the next greatest innovation i wonder how the soviets thought this would give them the upperhand
and it looks like it s in such good shape too
this guy took trying to hit all the buzzwords to another level
i m impressed at short a distance it needs to land even if this is high tide
accurate rep of the current state of their air power
if a cruise ship and a fighter jet had a kid
it s not an aircraft boat hybrid it s an ekranoplan or a ground effect vehicle it didn t switch from swimming to flying it created an air cushion that it would rest on while traveling this allowed for high speeds without needing to produce enough lift to fly eventually the concept turned out to unstable in high waves and was too expensive to research further
caspian sea monster not a plane not a ship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy4drfbnnxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy4drfbnnxg) apparently they could not handle big waves so they were useless in bad weather
ugly turd of an aircraft
judging by the performance of russian equipment in ukraine i d say its biggest weakness is its maintenance crew
yeah awesome feat of engineering
isn t caspian sea monster the bigger one
those are missile tubes
i have nipples greg could you milk me
it doesn t actually fly more than a dozen meters above the water it stays in ground effect
i was going to ask about the extra drag each additional engine makes then remembered western engineering when it comes to precision and materials we are miles ahead and thus more reliable and efficient machines
that might be this one
it s russian
yes and even less effective p
the rubber bands are perished
the youtube channel mustard has a great mini doc on this beast it s actually pretty impressive ground effect lift is crazy
as far as i remember the whole idea of the inventor was not related to war but he ran out of money his only way to make his dream come true was to slap some missiles on top and tell the millitary that it will be super effective against aircraft carriers
high speed assault on a carrier group get in close and then go all macross missile
we never found out really the soviets ran out of money and parked it long ago
gotemm
logistics
well not so much as a feat but more like half a foot of engineering really as they never became stable enough to be put into operation at all even with over years of testing and revisions it never worked properly also one of them self destructed while in testing
looks more like the lun
damn right they are but why put them on a plane you d think some sort of weapons would be better
because its purpose is a mobile launch platform for cruise missiles
i was tryna double down on the joke about the missile tubes looking like boobs guess i didn t land it
a chimera what two species were intertwined to produce this beastie
although i can relate to his general attitude that is terrifying can think of a few subs it can be cross posted in
that s the look of a fish that has seen some shit while fighting in the trenches of wwi
looks like a fish i d like to chill with nice one fish
cute
this fish has been around for over million years it s considered one of the oldest living fish on the planet chimaeras are related to sharks and rays and generally inhabit the deeper parts of the ocean
slightly different spelling but i had the same first thought question
like which ones i think it is a very interesting fish so i m giving it a go here
maybe r oddlyterrifying or r thalassophobia i m not positive of their rules but it s water and it s scary
i think oddlyterrifying is a good match but thalassophobia can t be about ocean life or a marine creature i looked at the rules thanks so much
and r thedepthsbelow and r scaryocean
fish be like i m deep as fuck yo
emo ahh fish
and who knows what else we will discover
sure there s no sunlight but there s nothing to see anyway or do it s just you and your thoughts and all the whale carcass you can eat
looks like a ghibli movie
that one fish at the end of the vid had a cute little smile
wow that s incredible and exactly why my deep ocean fear seems justified lol because a coastal fear is real
tsunamis kinda fascinate me idk how anyone survives them
dude needs to work on his cardio
why do i suddenly want to go to battle
this is going to cost me like grand isn t it
zanfona that s a hurdy gurdy
my toxic trait is thinking i could play this instrument
sea of thieves vibes matey
long shot but anyone got a name for this song composition or whatever it is
witcher soundtrack intensifies
look up storm seeker metal band with a gurdy
this is what plays after years of training when you track down the knight who killed your father and challenge him to a duel for vengeance in some muddy shit covered street on a misty morning

pirates unite sea of thieves is calling
this is a hurdy gurdy and a musician who plays this is and i m not joking here called a hurd gurdler edit guess they aren t called hurd gurdlers
makes me want to dawn my armor and go on an epic quest to stop an evil wizard but i die on the way from dirty drinking water
sounds a little like the got theme
someone decided they don t like getting calluses on their fingers or strumming the bow geez i wish i could play the violin like a piano and voila
deleted

hurdy gurdy hurdy gurdy hurdy gurdy hurdy gurdy

couldn t stop watching
i thought i heard some eddie van halen in there somwhere
for some reason i can only hear this on the context of a celtic folk metal music and for every next second i am waiting to hear someone growling or screaming
i didnt realize you could play staccato and backwards on that that s super cool always loved that sound
i remember reading about germn diaz tro as the jimmy hendrix of zanfonas
also known at the hurdy gurdy
it s still quite common in the occitane music there is an example https://youtu.be/ryh3dy99h7s
the page plant unledded tour in the s had a musician nigel eaton on tour with them that played a hurdy gurdy solo that was mind blowing
vielle  roue
i think zanfona is just what the spanish call the hurdy gurdy they certainly didn t make it first
that s a mf hurdy gurdy
thought this was a hurdy gurdy

watches zodiac again
hurdy gurdy
wow
do you think he can pat his head and rub his belly at the same time
just play the gam of thrones intro already ffs
fake must be cgi no way an instrument like that actually exists let alone with a name like hurdy gurdy
this music is really cool but i would love to see a remix of this song with electronica dubstep i think it would make a really amazing song
this shit is trash if y all find this hypnotizing then u probably got molested by ur uncle
hurty gurty a horrible hybrid combining the worst aspects of bagpipes and the accordion with a fretted viola
most complicated method of producing a somewhat horrible sound i m a big fan
would this be a similar to using a pitch bend on a keyboard
kewl
check out le vent du nord from qubec nicolas boulerice plays the hurdy gurdy
by the outsider i can t use my powers
i ve seen this before really cool looking and really expensive looking
cliff stapleton is one of the masters of this instrument recommended
game of thrones vibes

looks like something midjourney would conjure up
give me two of those
lol just what i needed sock drawers
i think i just fucking nutted all over the inside of my underwear and my dick went from rock hard to flaccid in seconds lol
too much time spent on what exactly belongs to beetlejuice perhaps
the beauty and the beast vibes
i agree
have they tried asking the small army of people pulling on the ropes to just stop pulling for a minute while they try to apply the brakes
these guys are fucking nutz
they need to put boeing brakes on this thing
wonder how many have died under those wheels
i can hear the f1 tv commentary oh dear he s locked the brakes and flat spotted the tires gonna need to pit asap
arresto momentum c mon guys
this is how i imagined ancient vehicles were operated before the invention of brakes
imagine designing that thing and not thinking to install brakes
bhnchod itna bara temple banaya he to ussey rokne ka bh koi tareeka banate
i do not understand that india is the most ancient civilization on the planet and still thinks like fire was discovered yesterday
osha approved lol
juggernaut is the anglicized name for the hindu god jagannath the lord of the universe the idol of jagannath is carried in these contraptions https://blog.oup.com/2017/08/origins-juggernaut-jagannath/
i ve been to india times since hyderabad delhi bangalore never did see anything stop
india the land of hygien and safety
why would you put a temple on a trolley
i wonder what smells worse the smoking tires or all the people
hopefully they managed to stop india in the end would suck to be crushed by it
come on tirvarur time to put gears and brakes on that chariot maybe a combustion engine while you re at it
no steel toe boots
and thats just a basic indian village
seems necessary
i thought that was my neighbor moving his trailer house down the block
still don t get why they re barefoot doing this man definitely scraped the crap out his foot
barefoot
that thing is as difficult to stop as a juggernaut oh wait
presumably they did make brakes but there s only so much brakes can do to stop a tonne chariot guys momentum is a big factor
plot twist they relocate it on top of a sinkhole
what if that temple decides to collapse run over a leg or two
all gas no brakes edit oops xd
this is exactly what the british saw and called juggernaut it s derived from the name of the deity jagannath
if they go slower than mph then the whole temple will explode
they can t stop they need to get out of the way of the ton chariot behind them s
and stupid killer combo
and thrust reversers
it has breaks but due to momentum takes time to stop
that was my thought too i just assume that someone has tripped at the wrong time and gotten horribly crushed under those wheels
bro ye temple nahi uss temple ka rath hai
break bhi hota hai usme pr size itna bda hai ki momentum ke wajah se jldi rukta nhi
says the people wearing a cross and thinking armageddon is a factual thing that will happen in the future
lmafo
it s a chariot that belongs to the temple it s our tradition to put the deity in that during the festival and pull it through the area of the temple
the fuck is wrong with you
traditionally people do not wear shoes or sandals near a temple or in the campus of the temple so that is why you saw them bare foot
it s a practice to remove footwear before entering any areas of worship in india not a practice more like a rule
one little break in the brakes and you re breakless

armageddon is a factual thing that will happen in the future yes armageddon is going to happen in the future it s not a religious belief its a fact
lol so funny
upbringing
do you care to elaborate i would like to make some preparations
you dont have to prepare for that if your life expectancy is less that billion years

for those wondering she likely had a procedure called the stellate ganglion block done to fix this it s an experimental procedure that can be used to fix parosmia rancid smell and taste from normal foods and possibly normal loss of smell and taste from covid from what i understand the procedure is used to reset nerve damage and that s what fixes the problem i have had parosmia for a year and it completely destroyed my way of life and forced me to only eat breads and rice i had to avoid being around foods that had just about any amount of seasoning on it or i would start to get headaches and extremely nauseous i also lost most all of my muscle mass from lack of protein hours ago i had this same procedure done and after a year of not being able to eat with friends and family i m completely back to normal i can t begin to describe how bad quality of life had gotten but i m so happy i m back to normal now edit thank you all very much for the support and best wishes it means a lot for those of you who have smell taste issues from covid that have lasted more than months and anxiety and depression are kicking in i highly recommend finding someone local who can do this procedure for you it s not a success rate and it can cost you around usd if you get desperate just know this might be able to help best of luck to you all
losing your sense of smell is very very depressing it s hard to imagine it unless it happens
i m like this every morning when i pour that first cup
stops crying ok now who farted
i lost taste and smell for months with covid i had the same reaction when i could taste again i was so worried i lost it for good
as someone who had the virus and actually worked covid units it s heartwarming to see someone recover like that thanks for sharing
wow this is a commercial for appreciating the things we take for granted good stuff
what s her secret it s been a year
long haul covid sufferer here it took months after the first bout for my taste and smell to come back and they re still muted and wonky i got diagnosed in december two days after my first vaccine when they first became available probably missed coming down with it by two days if i had been able to get vaccinated even earlier i love food i lost lbs in that months if it had taken two years to get my sense back i probably would have eaten my gun glad this woman finally got her joy back
covid is a real b tch i hate it
which triggered snowflake is going through and downvoting anyone who shares long term negative effects they suffered from their covid infection i m sorry you were brainwashed into believing covid was the same as a cold but get over it i struggled with blood pressure and a resting heart rate so high that i was turned away from donating blood because they didn t think it was safe after my second covid infection took me months for it to go back to normal people underestimate how much your sense of smell impacts your ability to taste too glad this poor woman was able to recover
hi folks just a quick comment my wife lost her taste and smell from covid as well for almost a year and a half she contacted it at the very beginning of the pandemic and was pretty ill from it losing her taste and smell she felt hopeless she grew up in denmark and we went there for a visit to see her family and took a chance and went and saw an acupuncturist she spoke specifically about her obvious issue to the acupuncturist she came home the same day with smell and taste i was shocked though i am open minded i am somewhat guarded with alternative healthcare as we walked about it was spring i was wondering if she could smell the flowering bushes we walked past she gushed about the sweet smell at the same time i detected the smell same with food smells about i was intentionally holding back my comments about smell to she if she could smell them she could we were both shocked she could smell and taste like before having covid and it remains normal i did notice an article some weeks later about a person suffering from loss of smell and taste due to covid that had a nerve block put in her neck suddenly that person got her taste and smell back it was like a reboot of sorts as i said no clue what happened with the acupuncture but i saw it first hand she regained the senses immediately maybe this nerve reset is the way to go she felt reborn thanks
does anyone know what they actually did to get her sense of smell back it looks like she had some sort of procedure
i had covid years ago things still don t smell right and it isn t as strong as it used to be car exhaust and coffee smell the same
man it s wild i had covid twice the 2nd one being really bad and never lost my sense of smell or taste so wild how it affects everyone differently
i know the feeling i lost my smell and taste for over a year everything is just bland and gross taste like those plain rice cakes lol
we take those kind of things for granted i feel happy for this lady
i lost sense of smell and taste for a few weeks it was awful this poor woman so happy for her just to be able to taste and smell is a gift
i felt completely violated when i lost my taste smell from covid hearing horror stories of people s senses not returning for months years i was petrified makes you really appreciate those senses when they return
well today i cried because i tried to have some peanut butter and it tastes like rancid shit still and now i m crying again because i wish i was her rn i ve been stuck with this paromsmia shit for two years with zero improvement sorry to be pathetic about it and bitch feel free to downvote
show this to every damn antivax mask covid denier it can be so devastating even if you survive
i honestly know how she feels long covid has ruined my life it s taken away joy out of my life so many weird symptoms so long so hard may god damn those responsible for this virus
my smell and taste went off for short period when had coffee was only thing that changed so much i couldn t drink at all as it tasted like bleach for about weeks
so depressing i lost my smell in everyone described the symptoms and smells perfectly on here and it sucks so bad i know for a fact that it s caused mental issues because i ve always loved food now food smells like shit nobody understands or even cares i m tired of even remotely explaining myself on it i figure this earth is doomed either way so i may as well ride it out whoever is responsible for covid has a special place in hell reserved
my coworker got covid when it first started and lost her sense of smell and i believe atleast most of her sense of taste years later she can taste but can t smell anything
i lost my smell completely for two weeks i had covid sinuses weren t plugged and could breathe just fine through my nose but could smell nothing things taste like pure sweet or bitter or a mix of the two so essentially any liquid that was sweet all tasted the exact same just sweet no other flavor so coffee all it tasted like was bitterness and it terrified the fuck out of me if i went the rest of my life and coffee tastes like a fucking brick how depressing it would be i was a lucky one where my smell came back shortly after recovering but i feel terrible for long covid patients who never regain their smell or anything else covid stole from them i also worried like if there was a fire would i be able to smell smoke or chemicals etc if i was eating rotten food i wouldn t know either didn t occur to me just how important smell is until i had covid
months i couldn t smell or taste the day i took a poo and smelled it was like being reborn i understand what this lady feels just wish it was coffee lol
yup keep pretending that covid is just a little flu and that the pandemic is over
something as simple as that we take granted alot folks alot
after covid i know my sense of smell deteriorated i can smell some things but it s not how it was before i ve learned to live with it
it took me like months to regain my sense of smell after covid that shit sucks
i lost scent and taste for a week i can t imagine years
probably thought she d never able to regain her sense of smell damn
never got a test so i don t know if i had covid but i too went very long years of not being able to smell anything including coffee it was so nice that morning i woke and could suddenly smell coffee again i cried tears of joy
the reactions to her suck like awww and the somewhat forced high pitched yayyyy as she is crying and having this deep moment sucks
i lost my sense of smell for days when i had covid and i got very emotional when i smelled my wife s perfume for the first time after i can t imagine two years losing your senses is traumatic even for a short time
i lost my sense of smell and taste dec still not back and still not right some days i ll have a good smell day at like but most other days it s close to nothing or altered some days i can kinda taste while on other days i rely on texture and memory for flavor my hope is to get the stellate ganglion block procedure losing those two senses is depressing
i got covid in sept it took almost years for my smell to be normal i couldn t use my favorite shampoo or dawn dish soap i got pregnant in dec and it made everything worse in jun i had what i called a flare up and i couldn t drink tap water anymore it was honestly terrible everything smelled wrong rancid chemically wrong it would make me sick and for the first few months after covid i couldn t eat i am so happy this women can smell coffee again and i understand her relief and happiness
my wife and parents low key made fun of me when i lost my sense of smell joking that i was being dramatic for saying that i lost a tether to the world but like it s absolutely true they stopped thinking that way when they lost theirs
after i got covid in december hit me hard i completely lost my ability to smell or taste for about months then when it came back some foods were morphed and tasted putrid coffee chocolate peanut butter and eggs they just tasted absolutely disgusting it took a little over a year for these specific foods to taste normally some crazy stuff with covid man
thanks again for spreading viruses like it was your mission in life conservatives
yeah my daughter said her own armpits smelled like dog poop to her but they always smelled good to any family member she asked had to be so disturbing she finally got over it after a few months
god i only lost my smell and taste for weeks and that was enough for me to start getting emotional over every meal i missed being able to taste and then when my taste and smell came back i could only smell food as chemicals or off rancid it was extremely frustrating everything s good now so i feel for this woman
yeah baby you smell that shit walk hard the dewey cox story https://tenor.com/bcm8a.gif)
coffee rain and a great italian restaurant would be the scents i would not want to live without
that s the same thing i do walking past a coffee shop with no money
but covid is a h0ax
her medical bills must be in the fucking billions
ever since i had covid i ve had an aversion to all dark sodas except root beer even clear sodas taste terrible i can t eat cilantro onions or garlic any longer because of the weird flavor along with having a sweet smell and taste sensation for quite a few items i ve had to give up certain hygiene products because of the sweet smell no longer wearing any cologne and my laundry always smells musty to me even though people tell me that it just smells like laundry soap
it s crazy how much we take good health for granted the idea someone would be brought to tears by the smell of coffee is powerful stuff happy for her
i lost my smell taste when i got covid it was horrible to say the least my wife made my favorite meal and i could not taste nor smell it after that it was impossible to look forward to any type of food everything in life became bland for lack of a better word it s amazing how something so simple can wreck your way of life i only lost this sense for days and i was depressed i couldn t fathom years this video hit hard
mine was completely gone for like months after then it slowly started to come back save for eggs smelling super sulfuric and deli ham tasting rancid also now i can pick out onion and garlic out of anything no matter how small the amount used
my nephew said coca cola tasted like cheddar during the week he got covid the first time it s all kinds of weird
i can t help but wonder what happened to the it s just a cold idiots
tbf i have the same reaction every morning with my first cup
holly macarony jeez fuck yeah got covid years ago lost smell for mth after that everything smelled like shit still the same a bit better for some smell i will for sure look out for this thanks op you have my upvote from canada
damn two years even having it for weeks sucked
how many people watching that woman thinking it will never happen to them and they don t need to wear masks wait and see lc will catch you too
damn didn t expect to get hit in the feels like that
made me cry so happy for her
lol shitty hospital coffee has always made me cry too
just like the flu gone in a week cases max
it took two years for mine to come back as well luckily it was right before thanksgiving and everything tasted amazing
i never lost taste or smell but i did lose the ability to sence how hot spicy thinhs were i could literally eat a ghost pepper and it was like eating a mild jalepeno this lasted for about months before returning gradually
my bosses wife has not been able to smell or taste anything since doctors claim nothing can be done i gotta send him this
but covid isn t that bad anymore they say hope that her situation continues to improve
just like to casually say fuck you to all the dipshits who made the covid pandemic worse than it had to be
i haven t been able to smell almost anything for the last years if i hold it up to my nose and sniff as hard as i can i can sometimes get something faint and my sense of taste is still there because i can taste how horrible liquor is but i have no idea what a normal level of taste is to compare it to
basically how i felt after two months of that bullshit the whole experience was very strange
it s amazing the things we take for granted
ya smell that that s the smell of napalm smells like victory
does anyone know the context it sounds like she received some type of treatment if the nurse or doctor was wondering if she noticed any difference in smell
i lost my taste for like months holy fuck did i underestimate how fucking shit that is
i have a candy jar at work i saw the videos about people not being able to taste or smell and there was a part of me that called it bullshit then one of the most honest and true friends ever came into my office after the big part of the pandemic and saw his favorite candy i always kept in stock for him runts he had just gotten past covid he ate a little box of them and the look of disappointment on his face really showed me it was so real
i haven t been able to smell anything for years because i have nasal polyps i can t even breathe through my nose of the time it s pretty amazing how perceptions around loss of smell has changed over the past few years i remember once i went to an ent about ten years ago who said something like it s not so bad is it it s just a minor nuisance i m very happy for this woman
hooray godspeed
i had parosmia months horrible thing my mother s food smelled like shit
my dad has that condition i m gonna recomend this to him he misses how meat smells
had covid in december and still can t smell taste everything some stuff has come back some hasn t i like much spicier food now because i can taste the heat i m hoping it all comes back before too long i miss smells
years in a hospital damn bankrupt
any info about young people who had their first episode of hypertension and remained hypertensive after a covid diagnosis
years wow i was down for months but damn years
fucked part is covid is still around and it still sucks infecting ppl so fast i have it now and don t believe the day cdc quarantine cuz ppl are spreading it past the days pray for my elderly father who happen to get it regardless of me taking the utmost strict quarantine never leaving my bedroom and disinfecting everything fuck the government
i took zicam nasal spray once in i lost my sense of smell and taste since then saw doctors and apparently you shouldn t ever spray zinc into nasal cavity and told that is a permanent loss there was a class action law suit too for many who used zicam i m a healthcare worker and got covid shot early on weeks to the day after second shot my smell and taste came back i still can smell and taste and it s wonderful not back but about i m so enjoying eating again
i went through this i nearly died in january i was even in a coma at one point i am still recovering today still on light duty at work and i refuse to pursue disability
when i lost taste and smell i ate raw garlic on toast my theory is that i got my taste back really fast because my body was like bro ok it s enough garlic it s enough garlic its enough garlic and gave me back my taste to stop the pain
the ole long covid
when i got covid i first realized i had it when i couldn t smell the smelly guy at work anymore a year later and i still can t smell very well food has been less enjoyable
if you want to see another bad case of long covid check out physics girl dianna leilani cowern https://m.youtube.com/channel/uc7ddem33syatdtwygo2cwda) she is a public figure so using her name should be fine she used to do a bunch of science videos and science education on youtube along with her other work mit bs and then a masters is physics she was doing a lot to bring in people to learn about physics and bringing a lot of girls into science unfortunately she got long covid and then a developed a fatigue disease with it along with other physical symptoms she s basically bedridden to the point her husband had to become her full time carer and her sister simone giertz robot youtuber engineer has come to help it s super scary stuff imagine being fine one day getting covid thinking you ll get over it and then ending up bedridden
i feel her pain everything s been changed
more people seriously need to be talking about long covid
mild nerve neurological damage back to work slackers
covid is crazy some people have crazy side effects like this then there are others like myself and most of my family that never seem to have gotten it
i have similar symptoms from long covid the amount of stuff i can t smell anymore oddly though it s opened a lot of more doors for me for eating food i previously hated and public restrooms are so much more bearable still i look forward to when this treatment is conventionally available
i legit have a hard time imagining getting sick from covid much less losing smell and taste for two years or dying just how widely results from getting sick with covid vary is simply insane and blows my mind sometimes the first time i got it i only knew because when i went for my regular checkup i was informed that i had caught it recently and the second time i was a bit ill for a day but nothing outside of the scope of a normal annual flu cold
people call me crazy when i do everything i can to avoid getting covid simply because i don t want to catch this manufactured virus that destroys our body
in a place we live with so much misery our palate smell and enjoyment of food and beverage is one of its few escapes to lose that leaves you with so much less joy
i was like this with marmite marmite was my taste coming back indicator and i cried like a baby all alone in my kitchen when i tasted it again
lost smell for a weekend nothing compared to her and folks here the swell of negative emotions listing even non food related things you love to smell beach cut grass when you can smell outside on a loved one during a hug it s a big deal
this was me smelling shit for the first time months after getting over covid years ago never been so grateful to smell shit

hi my name is professor longdich van ballsach of berlin university quick facts about this wonderful species i have done years of research on these caterpillars and the reason they have this transparent translucent skin is because of the cms incorporated into the dna cms stands for curumbine micellular senopia a natural evolutionary genetic mutation according to scientific studies these caterpillars using the cms to their advantage have the number one effective mechanism of survival in the world for any mogrodite species they use this to great effect to camouflage and evade detection of predators at night when sitting on leaves or hibernating some of them have a purple ultraviolet glow almost a neon colour when viewed in total darkness this is due to the vascal plumbite chordium which enables them to have a significant portion of their outer layer of skin in a natural fluorescent colour which under light and when viewed by our retina causes it to appear transparent another huge reason why this is unique in nature is due to the i don t know what i m talking about thanks for reading

bitcoin has been proclaimed to be dead times it is still here https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/ despite that there is currently a bear market bad times and the price is far away from the all time high the mining power that secures the network is stronger than it has ever been indicating that trust in the network is greater than ever https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate good recource for beginners https://dncomply.com/bitcoin-basics/
the story needs a follow up to where these bitcoins went next what did papa johns do with them would be interesting to know
everytime i am reminded of this story it is against my will
https://dncomply.com/bitcoin-basics/ it s important to understand the difference between bitcoin and everything else bitcoin follows a pattern hype new all time high crash stabilizes on a higher level than before repeat has been like this three times and will likely happen again
lol you are not very educated crypto currency is not crashing it already crashed it has cycles like every market just much more volatile year to date is up more than any other form of currency stock etf etc but people like you are the reason that i can currently get a great deal on pretty much any crypto currency right now so thank you
is it opposite day already

what happens when the fly is inside its new home
device for catching flies a for effort for the marketing team
dude just leave a glass of ginger ale out dumb bastards drown themselves in it
does it do mosquitoes and can i install a frog or lizard in the middle so it gets to eat em
if this works on mosquitos i ll gladly pull up a chair and grab some popcorn
showed this video to my mom she told me that the plastic thing moving above the fly is time and that fly is you watching pointless video on the internet
that s awesome though i initially thought that the fly would be chopped into pieces interesting to see the point when the fly actually realizes that it s fucked
bro was just washing his hands and face i m calling peta
some of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet those are the luckiest of all
the reason why this works a fly percieves time at a much higher speed than we do their perception would look like slow motion to us this makes it easy to see most threats since nature tends to evolve speed over patience but if something moves this slow combined with their rate of perception it would look completely stationary why be afraid of something that isn t moving science
brutal
cool now do the same with mosquitoes and hornets fuck those things
hello fly lets play a game
i feel disappointed but kinda relieved i thought i was about to see a fly get dissected squished it was like watching a train accident about to happen but then it doesn t lol
removed
i need one for my co workers
christ man i asked you to make a trap not fly saw dungeon
the mill of justice turns slowly but it grinds exceedingly well
fly dad went out to get spoilt milk and never came back
not at all lol
it s like a bond villain created that device
you can really feel the terrror
have you ever had an infestation i feel nothing for those lil turds
needs more blue flash zap noise at the end
as much as i hate flies the panic displayed mad me severely sad
anyone else thought it was gonna get sliced up like bread at a bakery
help meee
what happens in the middle
let me tell you something wait let me tell you something
whenever someone asks what happens when the fly goes inside the middle everyone starts making jokes about it but i am actually wondering what happens
i saw this posted like a week or two ago but it doesn t kill the flys there s an opening in the center and under this device is a bowl that holds them to be released elsewhere i thought it was a grinder too but i was sorely disappointed when i looked it up edit i stand corrected the bottom is a starving chamber still better than being mashed i guess
i didn t know there was a hole for them to escape to i thought it was a slow crush through the grooves and still didn t feel bad for that little fucker
the only thing missing is the amazon link
it s like a saw trap for flies hello jeff goldblum i wanna play a game
i actually couldn t even watch the whole thing that poor fly
what s the name of the song playing in the video
i started having some problems with flies and was all excited to get this it came in the mail but i didn t have a problem with the flies anymore clearly it s so good it starts working before it even arrives
yeah i feel terrible where can i get one
nope not one single bit do i feel bad for that fly
incorrect
this is like a saw trap for a fly
at least with a fly swatter it s quick and they don t see it coming
reminds me of a trap i saw in a saw movie
no it doesn t
this is a straight up torture device i ll take
it most certainly doesn t
now do vlad putin
this thing is genius
device for catching flies it s exactly what it says it is
he got it a lot easier than i thought he was going too honestly
i would fire up my bong and watch that all day
shut down all trash compactors on the detention level
i feel so bad that i d like to feel worse where can i order one
i heard it let out a tiny hellllppppp meeeeee scream
amazing how humans can engineer such magnificent murder devices
all cute comments aside this design is dark genius
nah not really
i thought i was about to see some saw trap shit until i realized there was a hole for the fly
hello fly do you want to play a game you waste your life going bzz bzzz bzz now you must fight for the life you wasted away
feel bad i was waiting to see it get crushed
you can see the panic set in
i thought it was going to fucking smash them between the two walls with the most brutal bloody death possible
speak for yourself i love this fuck flies
not feeling bad at all since they shit on my food
you know what you call a fly without wings a walk
nope kill em all
this is possibly the greatest invention of all time
very anticlimactic thought that lil mf was gonna get fokkin shredded
did a fly make this post
nah fuck them
i m already picturing a horror movie based on that trap yikes it is a cool design though
yes and the music makes it even creepier reminds me of the trash compactor scene from empire strikes back it would be great if a talented soul would add that music
into the fucking abyss kid
i have never felt bad for a fly after watching this that hasn t changed
this is like a scene from saw
nope i never feel bad for those damn flies
they dont die they are collected in that center cavity
i thought he was about to get chopped up
what kinda saw jigsaw future serial killers manifesto shit is this you can practically hear the do you wanna play a game
was anyone else thinking that fly was about to be julienned
fuck flies and i wish i could have seen the gory goodness of that thing getting crushed
i was totally expecting it to cut him apart by crushing him guillotine style
when s the part where we feel bad for them
i thought it was gonna get cut up
c 3po shut down all the garbage compactors on the detention level c 3po
i thought it was going to get crushed or electrocuted the premise was there
needs a wilhelm scream at the end
there is no universe where i have sympathy for flies
this is so freaking horrible as someone in louisiana where do i get one
was expecting some ghosts kinda action and have the fly sliced in half and am disappointed
hell naw that s fucked up that s on some indiana jones level shit with the crushing
someone add the help me help ahhhhhh from the original movie
shut down all the trash compactors on the detention level
this is like a james bond villain death trap
he s over there washing his hands before his meal like a good boy ready to munch when that death trap bumps him in to reality
am i a bad person for really wanting one of those traps
i was hoping the fly was going to get chopped up into pieces
better han stabbing yourself in the gut and dying way slower

pink mist is probably a good way to go

we re gonna need a bigger boat
he moved his toes quick enough
that was amazing
it wasn t an accident it wasn t a boat propeller or a coral reef or jack the ripper it was a shark
there s always a bigger fish
lol let go of the line dude i think he won
i never knew tuna was that large
i think i just shit my pants
bucket list to see a great white in person
nom nom nom oh hai mark
shark yoink mine now
and i ll take that
he can t with three barrels on him not with three he can t
it s crazy how well their camouflage works
bucket list is to cage dive and see one of these bad boys up close
thanks this will for sure be in the opening scene of my nightmares tonight
i m pretty sure he was aware the meg was there before us
me anybody got extra pants
spat the bait once he saw the boat
this isn t interesting it s depressing fuck that lazy ass shark
it s a fuckin meg
big fish
can someone please provide link to the original version of the video with sound
yeh we are not meant to be swimming in the ocean p
maybe let that one go
daem
how do people ever get back on a boat again after something like this
i d have dropped a brown load right there on the deck
shark not today human
i saw it a few dozen times in my florida years sharks are opportunistic keep your hands away from the water
looks like it s fish head soup tonight
yeah no f ck deep water and f ck that dude has tungsten testicles
r natureismetal
well that sucks tuna got stolen
is that in a pond in australia
watching that guy lose that tuna hurts
tuna got up that mornin one way or another somebodies gonna eat me today
nope you just need to get the fuck outta there
exactly right
agree with you
lions don t like water if you placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source that make sense
that their is an innovative shark mate follow the boats
he still leaned out there way further than i was comfortable with
deleted
removed
some of those tunas sell for millions some people would jump in with the shark for that type of money
ok first off a lion swimming in the ocean lions don t like water if you placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source that make sense but you find yourself in the ocean foot wave i m assuming off the coast of south africa coming up against a full grown pound tuna with his or friends you lose that battle you lose that battle times out of and guess what you ve wandered into our school of tuna and we now have a taste of lion we ve talked to ourselves we ve communicated and said you know what lion tastes good let s go get some more lion we ve developed a system to establish a beach head and aggressively hunt you and your family and we will corner your pride your children your offspring
same here
tunafish lisa you re tearing me apart
same if i ever win the lottery
that their is an innovative shark mate follow the boats the dumb humans always pull the fishys towards the boat seems like we need to do more studies in shark intelligence to me cause what i see is some incredible use of problem solving
i don t think sharks has even a concept of stealing
wear a condom but who are you trying to fool the shark is the big spoon
meglodon
if it s australia when it s the kiddie pool
bot
bot
bot
only the first tuna of the season is bid up to ridiculous levels for publicity the rest are nowhere near i can buy bluefin steaks for lb cad
why didn t this movie get a fucking sequel absolute tragedy cheers
not so sure it is innovation as much as nature and evolution the shark has multiple senses that can detect the distress of the tuna struggling against the fisherman from miles off sharks are immensely in tune with their environment and can detect minute changes and home in on the source being curious and never passing up an opportunity for food is a more likely answer here
guessing by their brain size probably not https://i.redd.it/83r0xhj9xn131.jpg)
meg a lodon meaning big tooth or large tooth
what is this from
i was joking i guess i have no clue sharks may have begun to follow salt water fishing boats but i doubt it lol this type of thing happens all the time to be honest once every couple of years i ll be fishing a freshwater lake and have something small on my line sometimes an aggressive species attacks immediately and you get confused and think you have a bigger fish or they attack by the boat and you can literally watch the aggressive species swallow your catch and than you bring em both on board lol
can t birth bright ideas like stealing with an ovarian shaped and sized brain now can we
the other guys i believe
my new mission during my morning cycle is to offer water to squirrels probably won t work tho and i ll look like a junkie lol
funny how he takes a moment to enjoy the water at the end
he s so thirsty
humans being bros never gets old
a tiny bit of humanity is back a real tiny piece felt bad for little fella
i love how cute these videos are but it makes me so sad to think about how it s so hot or dry or fiery in the video of that one koala that these animals have to go outside of their comfort zone and rely on begging humans for their water bottles
must do it all the time if it can recognize a water bottle one of these times it will be vodka and the squirrel will be in for a big surprise
you get that little squirrel a fucking pond so it never has to go looking for water again
totally awesome especially waking up water never tastes better
i m concerned that the squirrel doesn t have a reliable source of water and has to beg from humans
soon as he s done drinking he s outta here
i can t believe this is the second squirrel post in a row i m replying to and i m happy with that because they re fantastic little creatures as this video shows
if it helps this squirrel is likely far beyond being fearful of humans and just knows we re suckers the squirrels at the grand canyon are relentless
smallest memeber of r hydrohomies
when desperate animals ignore their fear and can clearly communicate their needs to humans that squirrel needed a drink
how shitty is this squirrel s environment that it begs for water from humans or did it just discover that bottled water is cleaner and tastes better than pond water and isn t scared of humans because it s a park squirrel
thank you human i will remember this when we invade
i won t bitch about this repost because it s so cute
first day when i went homeless i bought a bag of peanuts with what i had and spent the entire day in the park just feeding squirrels bros climbed my arms and all was happy to just be gone then and there pure bliss best day ever
mf needed that
poor little fella was parched
awe poor lil guy he was seriously thirsty to be asking a human for water unless the guy is the squirrels owner meaning the guy has been taking care of the squirrel since it was a tiny baby
i would have a new pet squirrel if this happened to me
i recently noticed a squirrel trying to bite out a nest in a hollow tree in my backyard so i helped him out a few nights back by cutting a nice big entrance for him and now i have a squirrel family
tiny little tree pup
whoever it was that gave this squirrel water thank you the universe will remember your kindness
so precious
he was as polite as he was thirsty such a gentleman not like all those rude monkey videos that just come debow people s stuff
baby asked so politely
aww so precious he trusted a human to help i wonder if humans had helped him before or he witnessed this behavior in another squirrel
that poor baby he knew he needed help i hope he never goes without water again
that squirrel needs to get a job and pull himself up by his bootstraps and buy his own water
his lil toe spread
i cant be the only one who thought use the cap
my parents had a squirrel that would come in the garden and beg for food it was really friendly my mum became convinced that it was her recently deceased aunt and started feeding it the situation got so ridiculous it would follow my dad to the shops along with their pet cat and dog and the squirrel would sit at the dinner table whilst my parents made it toast for breakfast
poor baby
dude just chugged down some water and stood around for a few seconds like any human would massive hydration
what a sweetheart subhanallah
squirrel domestication eta years
at least you know he s not rabid
human is the worst thing that happened to the life in this planet
plays suh i wont some wohtah plays
that squirrel needs to get a job
this is so so sad
man global warming makes shit so cool
damn they have really good balance
this would be perfect for r humansbeingbros
so cute that wild animals are begging hoomans for water so cute we are destroying the earth awww
awe he learned how to drink from a big boy cup that day
r humansbeingbros
that s how i got the squirrel flu
little guy definitely is a r hydrohomie
i hate squirrels but that was so cute
aww it s little arms adorable
yup so cute a dehydrated rodent
tree rats they would emptyy my bird seeder in under a minute and just eat the sunflower seeds tossing the rest over my deck
i was gonna be pissed if he didn t give that squirrel a sip
my new favorite video
sad humanity did this now they have to rely on us unfortunately most don t have the compassion
i was originally thinking that d be a cool story to share at dinners but how do you say it i fed a squirrel one time like fed doesn t really make sense is there a drink alternative for fed you could just say i let a squirrel drink from my water bottle one time but that s too wordy and i think the story hits harder when you have a short and sweet introduction to it god is this what a mid life crisis is
fuck that squirrel man lol that s a rare animal in chatgpt world these days
best video i ve seen on here ever so happy they gave it water and that squirrel is so cute
sweet baby i love him
i had birds beg for water in the desert they would do a dance for water wish i would have recorded it
ok who told this tiny animal that humans carry portabale water because that person was a genius either that or this squirrel is a genius and really observant
that was so sweet to watch
how does the squirrel know that s water
he a r hydrohomie
nice legs tho
can someone send this to humans being bros lol
he was waiting for the other squirrel to pickpocket them
first thought awww lil baby asking for some hydration second thought what a truly evil world a squirrel asking for water receives bottled water aka commodified necessities when so many in a similar situation get the same fuck you nestle water should be a right not a commodity
kinda annoyed he didn t understand what the tiny creature wanted until the other person pointed it out to him
fuckin addicts always begging normal every day people
sandy cheeks misses bikini bottom
there something off about this idk
squirrels are pretty intelligent and friendly creatures in my experience
how does it even know theres water in that bottle
kindness to all
i can t feel good about this vid while thinking about the other squirrels in the larger area who missed a source of water
how selfish didn t even say tank you
what a wierd behavior i wonder if the critter had some poison
alvin
great now they gonna want rights too
these same few videos show up all the time on reddit interacting with wildlife is bad for the park and it is bad for the wildlife nps has signs up on every pull out saying do not feed the wild life do not touch wildlife do not approach there are fines for it it s called wildlife molestation leave no trace it is simple as that also good luck with the rabies shots when that squirrel bites your finger because it mistakes it for a peanut

very cool thanks for posting
i also like the idea of a hungarian art historian judging the obvious artistic merit or stuart little
the painting was sold for at a charity auction at the st vincent de paul auction house in san diego in the mid 1990s to art collector michael hempstead he sold it to an antique store in pasadena california for which was the going rate for a berny at the time the painting was purchased from the store by a set designer on behalf of sony pictures for in hempstead recognised the painting in the film stuart little in which it was used as set dressing in the background of shots inside the main character s house hempstead considered tracking the painting down and buying it back knowing that prices for berny works had increased since he had sold it in addition to stuart little the painting also featured in a number of soap opera episodes including some of family law the set designer later purchased the painting from the film company to hang in her house on christmas eve hungarian national gallery researcher and art historian gergely barki recognised the painting whilst watching stuart little at home with his three year old daughter barki recognised the painting from a black and white photograph he had seen as he had no recording software he was unable to pause or playback the sections with the painting but it was shown frequently during the film barki believed that the painting was unlikely to be a print or copy as it was not well known barki sent emails to different production companies and crew members in an attempt to track down the painting after two years he received a response from the set designer who owned it barki was invited to travel to the united states where it hung in the set designer s house to confirm its identity barki met the set designer in a park in washington d c and after unscrewing the frame with a screwdriver borrowed from a hot dog vendor was able to confirm the painting was genuine ultimately the set designer sold the work to an art collector who put it up for auction in december the painting was listed with a reserve of and was sold on december to an unnamed hungarian collector for because of the publicity generated by its unusual rediscovery it has been described as the most widely known hungarian painting sleeping lady with black vase https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleeping_lady_with_black_vase)
title edit sorry there was a typo it was years not
oh yeah i forgot dr house was in this movie
there is a book by malcolm gladwell called blink where the author talks about these instant recognitions of originals fakes masterworks by experts this is such an extreme case of total immersion and familiarity hardwiring into the brain to be able to say that s it in a moment in the oddest situation just as you would recognise your parents or kids in the oddest of places you brain knows what it sees before you do abd you have to run to catch up with how great story
i appreciate the circle and arrow i was confused at first
thats cool and all but the fact that the movie has a talking mouse who can sail is quite rare as well
wow i forgot hugh was in this movie
i m loving the revival this subreddit is having this was a genuinely interesting story
i saw the circle around the only painting in this photo and was starting to figure it out the arrow sealed the deal and cleared up all the confusion
it always mildly infuriates me that most world renowned artists whose works now are worth so much died impoverished and unknown
stewart little blows my mind because these two assholes decide to adopt a mouse instead of an actual child
let s not rule out the possibility that they re using hollywood film sets to smuggle priceless art somebody had better get crocodile dundee on the case just in case barki met the set designer in a park in washington d c and after unscrewing the frame with a screwdriver borrowed from a hot dog vendor this is a fascinating level of detail
that rat mouse bastard stole the painting
stuart little fact he likes to collect priceless works of art so he can destroy them for his own sadistic enjoyment holy shit i fucking hate that rat
i fucking hate stuart little i know what you re thinking this is some kind of funny joke but no stuart little is a piece of shit a damn rat got picked over actual children at an orphanage and he s supposed to be a hero and i can t even tell you how many damn times i ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise stuart little is already parked there in his stupid little fucking convertible he took my wife and the kids and my house and my job i swear to fucking god i m going to kill myself and take that goddamn rodent to hell with me stuart little has ruined my family last summer i approached the miserable mouse in the street and asked him for his autograph because my son is a huge fan the fucking rat gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell later when i gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me turns out the mousefucker didnt write his autograph no he wrote you re a piece of shit and i fucked your mom i m now divorced and planning a huge class action lawsuit against the white devil that ruined my life your time is almost over stuart all the people you ve wronged will rise against you
to have all of this information and not the information of how stuart little spells his name is wild
https://media.tenor.com/1nc6rtscqeuaaaam/thats-it-yes-thats-it.gif
evil fucking rat stole it
it disappoints me that the set designer didn t choose to share his massive profit with the historian that informed him and the world of the pieces true authenticity and worth set designer sounds like all take and no give scummy
god i love art history
i watched this with my son on saturday this coincidence is coming to be the final straw of weird coincidences happening more and more frequently
i kind of want a modern remake of this movie i was just a kid when this came out and i haven t really watched it since but i m assuming the cgi does not hold up whatsoever
damn that s interesting
i have no idea how i would have found the painting in that picture without the circle and the arrow pointing to it
fun fact m night shyamalan wrote that film
r uselesspinkcircle
house was in stewart little
that s amazing love the posts in this sub
wow now that s interesting
that s a much more pleasant discovery than what happened to that stagehand in million dollar man
kind of reminds me of the prized boy with apple
the art historian travels all the way there to meet the owner and has to meet them in a park could they not have had him over for a coffee and maybe a slice of cake or something
damn thats interesting
this is by far my favorite stolen art story
i love how in the movie stuart is portrayed as a mouse but allegedly i haven t read personally so i m not sure this is just what i was told as a kid in the book he was just a human that was movie stuart s height
stuart that guy
this reminds me of that one guy who called in to the pga because he was watching a golf broadcast and heard a non native bird call
this is why you teach are and culture in schools
why does my brain refuse to accept that hugh laurie was the dad in this movie
i love cool stories of niche interests like this
the little shit is an art thief r stuartlittlefacts
that damn rat strikes again
r stuartlittlefacts if you went there you would know this little rat bastard is a monster he probably collaborated with the nazis and stole countless art how many more missing paintings out there are in this rat s cave
ok now i m wondering what my own undiscovered masterpiece is worth for the record mine is a missing piece by juilan underdonk the father of texas art apparently a great aunt on my mom s side went to new york and bought the piece before he moved back to texas it s not in his portfolio but the signature is his and the style is his as well
geena davis was in the scene who looks at a painting
this sounds strangely similar to the plot of crocodile dundee
is that house
now that really is interesting
finally some damn interesting content
so you re saying he wasn t watching the movie
it s rat bastard the movie
before reading this i thought this was a post pointing out that the man from the paintings dick was out
the ultimate shyamalan twist imdb stuart little https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164912/
love a good story
i thought i was on r shittymoviedetails for a sec
and then they put a shinny ass vase in front of it
wtf hugh laurie was the dad in stewart little
the little bastard strikes again stealing fine art now r fuckstuartlittle
interesting indeed that painting lead quite the life
wow great story
wow
i just now at years old realized house was the dad in the movie he was so nice
stuart
why was there a mouse living in an orphanage like who came across a talking mouse and thought that mouse can talk it must have no parents i d better take it to the orphanage and then just leave it there as if it wasn t a talking mouse
some police agency i m remembering australia but that s foggy memory had a practice in child pornography cases of isolating some distinctive feature in the background of the video and publicizing them a painting hung on a wall over uncommon wallpaper several nicknacks together on a bookshelf and asking have you seen this mildly useful
just goes to show much laundering money there is art
thanks for the circle i would have missed it if not for the circle
wish people would stop using the unicode bold and italics symbols they re for mathematics not text and screen readers can t read them correctly
can i ask an honest question why is that worth anything i have exes who can paint prettier pictures than that three of them like it s just kind of an ugly paining in my opinion so why is it worth anything
i m not sure where we re supposed to be looking i wish you made it a little more clear
and it s shit
not a very good painting looks like something a year old would do
op there s no w in stuart
what a bad painting
wasnt this just posted two days ago lol
if this isn t the op from the other day nice to farm for upvotes
yeah i saw the same video on youtube
gena davis perky tits tho
shut up
you know that is made up story to gain value for this piece of art
her arm looks quite hairy
deleted
holy fucking shit i forgot tom james was in this
ah yes peak american dad reference i am also a cultured
now this is actually interesting
why does that look like samurai jack
now do the ghostbusters painting
i knew there was something wrong with that mouse he s an art thief
this is an incredibly cool story
let me guess ze germans
not as good as boy with apple
little hey little ho
hey stuart i don t have your fuckin painting good luck in the sequel oh thanks
everyone talks about the painting but are we just going to gloss over the talking mouse in a tuxedo that thing must be worth millions
thank goodness for the circle and arrow
cue that dicaprio meme
funny thing is if it was already found and in a collection and they had asked to use it for the movie they probably would have been denied for fear of misplacing or damaging it
is it worth as much as boy with apple
yeah i remember watching a youtube video about it and other art pieces that were randomly found after years
don t you mean mmcskim
just don t french fry when you re supposed to pizza
eat it while it s cold
they only have shakes mcflurry
boy they must love their mcdonalds in sweden
mcskin
there s nothing quite like the motivation of having diarrhea after eating mcdonald s to get you to ski down the slopes at your full potential
mcdonald s used to be cutting edge
mmcskim
did they really need to put the arches before and after
this is where they sell the custom skis with the mcdonald s logo on them
this would give me so much fryxiety mcds fried only have about minutes where they re good before they get cold and turn into floppy potatoes with salt i feel like this would cut that time down to minutes and that s not enough time to do anything but up end the bag into your mouth and hope for the best
one large frozen coke please
though this was the very last hidden mcdonald s in russia i m high

i always thought his career percentage was higher still top ten all time but it s sort of like kareem s sky hook they were both incredibly effective but didn t get picked up on by other players
i misread his name as crayon barry at first and thought a who the hell names their kid crayon and b this guy s dad definitely named him crayon
hey man if the shooting stance works for you do it lol a point is a point lol
this has been proven to have a higher than shooting normally and i think a former nba star said he would never do it because it looks stupid
one of the weirder things in sports a better way of doing something extremely important but no one willing to do it
its the g league but imagine someone doing this in the nba at a high percentage that would be insane
lets get tropical
i like his brother razz better or his sister wild
rick barry has another son
my 2k ft animation every year
i saw a video sorry couldn t find it to source that broke down the science of the granny shot and it s objectively more accurate because it incorporates more muscles and has a symmetric linear motion if i recall the same video i think it was a youtube mini doc showed quotes from pro players saying they don t do it cuz it looks stupid seems like one of the only times in sports people are willing to sacrifice a win because they don t want to look stupid
i also do that same style shot from the line but everyone at the bowling alley just gives me dirty looks
someone should ve taught shaq this technique lol
gran eee instead of kob eee
how heartwarming

looks like they both take after the granny

my favorite story about the granny shot was how much better wilt chamberlain shot while doing so but wouldn t because he didn t like the way it made him look https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/the-wilt-chamberlain-effect-why-we-make-bad-decisions-even-when-we-know-better/amp
shooting like hey arnold
you ll never catch me shooting a granny shot
everyone underestimates the granny shot that shit is lethal
the sad thing is anybody and i mean anybody regardless of athleticism can learn to make of free throws using this underhand shot the pros just won t do it because of appearances how badly do you actually want to win
the sad thing is anybody and i mean anybody regardless of athleticism can learn to make of free throws using this underhand shot the pros just won t do it because of appearances how badly do you actually want to win
imagine steph curry nailing his half court shots like this lol
rick had him when he was fifty the dirty dog
slam dunk
there are stories about wilt chamberlain practicing this method since he was an abysmal free throw shooter his accuracy improved significantly and his coaches encouraged him to shoot that way in a game but he refused because he didn t want to look silly so he kept on missing his free throws
we called it the granny shot when i was growing up only something you did playing horse but rick barry is actually a legend
is canyon really any better though is there a brother butte maybe a sister peninsula
oh come on this was fckn hilarious
i feel like lateral throws in football could kill other teams if the whole team were at a professional level at it
apparently this is statistically the best way to shoot a free throw but players can be stubborn to change something like this especially when it s perceived as being funny
e l e
zero love for this unacceptable
canyon barry is the son of lynn norenberg barry and rick barry

he shot underhanded free throws during his point game
the the big man can t shoot episode on the revisionist history podcast dives into this good episode i recommend it
same for shaq
malcolm gladwell s podcast revisionist history has an entire episode about exactly this it s a great listen
how can any pro player be such an abysmal free throw shooter besides the fact that they are professional basketball players isnt there a saying practice makes perfect i always question how players can shoot poorly from the line when they can practice that shot which is always going to be the same as much as they want
what is the goal of professional basketball players and the nba to make fucking money looking silly prevents the money from rolling in you might be a better at playing basketball but that s not the point the point is to make money
and still ended up being the greatest player the nba has ever seen
i can t shoot like that man i got more scoring to do after the game wilt probably
damn we called it a granny shot growing up in wisconsin that s a term i haven t heard in a long time
i mean at least peninsula could shorten to penny i m also reminded of the lesser known geography themed beatles member gorge harrison
thank you though it would have been better if he were named mountain or knoll which would then truly be hill areas
should i have understood that or are you being too deep
i ve been saying this for years can you imagine of some guard or forward that is fouled all the time had a percentage of like everytime he draws a foul he s guaranteed to score you wouldn t be able to foul anymore no one would say anything if he gets pts per game in free throes
he has other sons that are in their s
til i had always read that he shot unusually well from the line that game to help him get to that explains why
if that s the malcolm gladwell podcast that is probably where i heard about it
the podcast everyone keeps mentioning talks about this taller players tend to have trouble with free throws because they shoot with a flatter arc since their release point is higher most great free throw shooters are smaller like steve nash or john stockton and shoot with greater arc this allows the ball to land more softly on the rim if it is not a perfect shot shooting underhand allows taller players to imitate this greater arc on their shots pretty interesting stuff
he was an incredible athlete his stats show that i dont think the stats would be so crazy in todays nba you could goaltend i think back then nba didn t even have a point line when he started
i could repeat exactly what you wrote only i d insert california
that s the only way i have every heard it described
hmmm this could become a new exciting trend i like peninsula penny there s already river cliff dale delta glen i think there are quite a few that could work arch arroyo ayre bar barchan bayou caldera channel col cuesta doline draw esker guyot horst isthmus that s more of a pretentious middle name to sound upper class lol karst levee maar marsh mesa moraine oasis potrero ravine ria sandur shoal strath summit terrace tor tuya vale
scooter
carey and browny
i m amazed that his pride prevented him from continuing
it is
i remember watching shaq he d try to throw it straight in saying he had any arc to his shot is being generous
same for oklahoma and missouri
same for virginia and alabama
so i m seeing archie roy california dolly guy level and terri as viable nicknames though names like caldera and morraine and vale are cool enough as is
wtf kind of madness did i start

that s exactly what i m saying i mean caldera is at least as cool as seven or north ffs and i m surprised karst isn t already a german staple baby name kar is a respectably masculine diminutive a kid could live with lifelong without much teasing and horst sounds suspiciously like a dutch or nordic name that already exists oasis is pretty much locked and loaded to be a social media influencer if you give credence to nominative determination
lol ah luv don t fret we ll spread the blame around when potrero starts to make it big in the latin community and mesas morraines and ravines start showing up in your kids classes at school
grove i like but i dare you to name your next kid slue slew edit boulder bigbootyspanker though has a ring to it depending on the subs you frequent
noice that s my dad s name i guess when he grows up they can call him current edit then there s uncle wave he was just ripple as a kid 2nd edit how many forests might have been called copse before they grew up i mean kids are mean grove might also work but somehow it sounds cooler than copse stand would fall somewhere between but it totally depends on how clever the mean kids are and how big their vocab is
a stepping stone to his body count
and they all know it and they all admit they would do better but don t want to look foolish
haha my kids name is forrest
that s times a day for a year or a day for years and mos that s a lot of pussy
i thought my measly was a high number too lol
lol what are the odds so grrove then til he s of age and has saplings of his own
my friends mom claims to have had sex with wilt what s wierd is he knew that about his mom when he was back in the late 90s
r ihavesex
anyone that counts their bodies is such a pussy
wild
i have one body wait what are we talking about
man some of us don t have to try haha pretty easy to count the handful of poor souls who have joined me in bed haha
this is like when henry cavill said if you like someone just ask them to dinner always works for me
this is the biggest inspiration whatever it is you do right now is the worst you will ever be at it keep grinding
malcolm gladwell introduced people to the admittedly fuzzy rule even if you have an aptitude for something complex language music physics you will need on average hours of work with it to master it feynman was talented and was aware of the work he put in he understood that it takes a huge amount of work that is something that other top physicists know but don t always talk about
yeah dude s wrong on this one there are definitely people with a built in talent for this yes you can toil and study but there s always a bigger fish
most people are ordinary motivation is often mistaken for intelligence
at one point in my life i had to stop being afraid of failing i had to learn to believe in my ability to learn and that failing is just a proof for that i m learning
this is just false unfortunately there is an iq threshold needed to work with complex physics if you have an average iq you re going to be lost well before you take a quantum mechanics course if you are a standard deviation above the mean then you can maybe get through a college physics degree with a lot of extra work but it s still impractical most physics majors have an iq of about and above graduate school physics programs are almost entirely filled with to genius level it would be cool if everyone had the ability to understand physics like this but that s just not the case we all have abilities that are better and worse than the abilities of others
sorry but that s idealistic rubbish
i d agree with him except the there s no talent part he s saying if other yrs old just practice long enough they ll be able to play violin like a yr old savant a tall lanky woman will be able to eventually bench press as much as a stocky man someone born with physical and mental challenges can become a mlb pitcher there s all sorts of talents isn t that exactly what evolution is favoring certain talents over others why don t fishing birds have gills they ve learned to hold their breath underwater but that s not the talent of breathing water great idea but super simplified
the good ol talent doesn t exist x200b and then there s yo kids playing violin like masters
as a iq person i totally agree
what a load of shit some people are naturally gifted at specific skills and talents and others aren t if i practiced basketball everyday i still won t get in the nba and if an ordinary person studied quantum mechanics all their life with no real natural talent they might be able to understand it better than they did but they ll only be able to understand it in someone else s terms they won t be able to make discoveries and find new ways of developing the subject
u savevideo
richard feynman had an unbelievable ability to take complex topics and break it down so that the average person could understand it he is a bit disingenuous however because he knows as well as you and i that he was not an ordinary person in any sense of the word but he liked others to believe he was i m certainly no expert on feynman but it appears he desired acceptance from average people and enjoyed their company more than that of his fellow scientists and that s completely understandable
the miracle ability is being able to get off reddit and do my fucking school work ammirite
memory and ability to learn are not equally distributed to all people
my take on this is what hits home to me someone who is burdened with other things in life and cannot devote the time and energy required to learn something is not lesser or worse than someone else just because someone has the means and ability to go to college devote hours of work to a subject matter continue to learn and then make a living off of something is better than a lazy person who never had the opportunity there are plenty of intelligent sharp people who are motivated but need the support structure around them to thrive
boy could read when he was speaks languages at no no no special people dont exist
people think you can just dance bro no i was training everyday for hours
brad pitt said the same thing
not really it s more like if henry cavill had said if you see a beautiful person your interested in simply spend a lot of time and devotion to getting in shape and becoming famous then you have value to offer when asking them out then it would be comparable to what feynman said
i love this take and it s part of the reason i went back to school to finish my degree just wish it would apply to my poker skills tho
that s so not true wanna bet take a walk and tomorrow i and my friend mr hammer will cripple u and then you are free to try to walk again this is not a threat btw we just check out if your hypothesis is correct and you re cut out for being a scientist too
it is the old nature vs nurture debate steven pinker argues
even though it has been proven that iq is not a good
except this dude in particular tested with an iq in the 120s still gifted sure but well below the genius level generally expected for some one who made substantial contributions to the field of quantum mechanics hell i tested higher than that and you you wouldn t know it maybe more of an indictment of iq as a tool for measuring intelligence though so i should also mention the importance of interest if you re genuinely interested in a topic of study than it feels much less like toil doesn t it and so you re tolerance for studying that subject will be much higher
no matter how smart you are there is always a bigger fish that s no reason to not apply yourself
a few people however are remarkably more intelligent than the vast majority i imagine those people have a hard time understanding the unremarkable dullness of the rest of us
so my college grades prove how smart i am gpa in your face
unfortunately your argument suffers from survivorship bias https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/survivorship_bias). the whole point feynman is trying to make is anyone can do complex things if they could dedicate the time and effort and i think there are plenty of examples out there to support this even though it has been proven that iq is not a good indicator of intelligence reportedly feynman himself was not a high iq person
ironically feynman himself scored on his school iq test
iq isn t simply innate if you practise logic puzzles and mathematics your aptitude will increase as will your measured iq studies of separated twins show iq has more to do with the environment they were brought up in that genetics yes anyone could become a scientist is a bit too sweeping but with the right interest and motivation most people could understand many scientific principles
what about the people who can t tie their own shoes but can memorize and imagine and draw shit in incredible detail using their inner eye he is talking about an ordinary person not someone who neglected school his entire child hood and could never make it to university if you take a bunch of random kids and send them to elite private schools and tutor them their entire life to become a physics major do they still need a special gift
but iq is an average across many people it is not deterministic and should never have been used that way yes on average university physics professors score two or more standard deviations above above the general public but individuals vary immensely i know that you know this but there is an essentialism about iq that is mislaid just like there is an essentialism about the no testing people it is the old nature vs nurture debate steven pinker argues got him a lot of flak from the humanities folks
agreed maybe an incredibly hard worker with incredible interest in the topic could be successful or points lower and they d feel like they were average when in reality they are still significantly smarter than the average person
and here are all my sources
so architects with good visual thinking are not ordinary persons and are born this way too define ordinary and gifted
he s talking about being a scientist not about being a professional athlete or anything else anyone can be a scientist if they have a deep interest in something and work their butt off to understand it completely sure it helps to be brilliant but that s not a requirement

feynman once said there is no stupid people or people that can t learn unless it s reddit s own colonel_hd_sanders that guy is a fucking moron
maybe more of an indictment of iq as a tool for measuring intelligence though so this is probably closer to the truth feynman demonstrated an ability to visualize and articulate ideas in physics in a way that even other experts with much higher iqs could not also from an early age he was interested in the world in a way that was unusual for a child his age e g he didn t want to be taught the names and functions of objects in nature to easily categorize them like a typical child but instead wanted to learn about their features functions and interconnections on his own to really understand them the irony of that clip is that feynman might have been the least ordinary person even among physicists because instead of just having a higher aptitude for problem solving and mathematics than the average person like most physicists he seems to have seen and approached the world it in an entirely different way and with a much greater innate level of enthusiasm than most people
but there is a straw man fallacy there the iq folks only assert that on average higher iq s lead to better education and earning potential no one believes that talent is meaningless or that hard work is pointless it is a nuanced balance though interest whatever that is is a huge factor
yes and vice versa i once had a vet tell me my dog should never eat beef because beef is people food
the frozen o ring in the glass experiment during a meeting comes to mind a dumbed down way to explain a complex problem
how much though you give a mild counter example feynman was not a super high iq guy but that doesn t really buck the trend which is what iq indicates iq is not a determiner it is an indicator yes
why do you think some survived while others did not could it be that electromagnetism filtered out people with a 90iq
it has been proven that iq is not an indicator of intelligence no it hasn t that is a patently ridiculous and false statement iq test have been proven time over time to be not just accurate predictors but the most accurate predictor of performance in any field which requires a modicum of intellectual ability iq test have been attacked recently because some races don t perform well on them are there aspects of intelligence iq test don t measure of course but using that as a basis for saying an iq test is not an accurate predictor of intelligence is like saying the olympic decathlon is not an accurate guage of athletic ability because it doesn t cover swimming and bicycling
yes you are getting at the nuanced understanding of iq aptitude is right smack in the middle of the nature and nurture understanding of complex human potential
this is also false iq researchers have shown repeatedly that iq is almost entirely innate with small variations due to environmental pressures
savants are extremely rare they don t buck the trend iq is about a trend across large groups
google is your friend nothing i said was controversial and will be easily found if you re interested in the topic start by listening to the leading iq researches and then look at population studies of iq by major
that s exactly the point there are natural dispositions and aptitudes where i analyse and design user system interactions with ease some of my colleagues find it next to impossible to design a simple form the same people nevertheless keep a distributed multi layer architecture in their head as if it was nothing others again sell our work results to customers in a way i can only descripe as bewitching
and singlespeed27 is bullying kids online that aren t neurotypical and insults them with vulgar language you should be ashamed it s and that is your first response the internet never forgets and even people in thousands of years will be able to look up your comment
proof positive that the ability to earn a degree should not be construed to mean that the holder of that degree knows diddly about squat
i ll check but i m always skeptical when it comes to iq stuff i was tested at and i m fucking useless lmao
i have to push back on this not just because it doesn t feel right but because all the evidence i ve seen points to the contrary you have improved that skill by practicing it nothing more nothing less any mental task such as memory imagination or creative thinking can be improved and enhanced through training and can diminish over time if you don t practice it https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/london-taxi-memory/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/london-taxi-memory/) https://neurosciencenews.com/skill-learning-brain-13013/](https://neurosciencenews.com/skill-learning-brain-13013/) x200b as you can see from those sources the brain physically alters itself by growing and forming new connections nobody is set in stone from personal experience i used to be very bad at visualization almost incapable then i started trying i learnt how to imagine anything with ease and when i read books it s almost like watching a movie and when i dream it s ultra realistic to borrow a term from the art world likewise i was brought up deeply religious but when counter evidence presented itself i un learnt the whole thing which used to be a huge part of my life and every thinking process x200b so people can learn and unlearn things fairly easily it s mostly about believing in yourself https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/stereotype-threat-and-the-intellectual-test-performance-of-africa](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/stereotype-threat-and-the-intellectual-test-performance-of-africa) x200b https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14498781/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14498781/) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7263763\_reducing\_stereotype\_threat\_by\_blurring\_intergroup\_boundaries](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7263763_reducing_stereotype_threat_by_blurring_intergroup_boundaries) x200b as you can see when women black people or latinos are told they perform similarly to white people they perform equally well or at least better than if they are told that others like them perform worse this illustrates the importance of self belief and never ever conceding to naysayers and people who try to tell you it s innate or you re not capable it s not magic it s time and effort and willingness to learn
hey hey hey now i m just quoting feynman
jesus it s been a while since i saw somebody embarrass themselves so badly
the point is not that you can t learn a thing but that some find studying certain fields harder then others let s take arts yes everyone can learn the basic techniques given enough time but some will basically inhale them and apply them effortlessly while others would have to train years and years and years to reach a similar proficiency same goes for music everybody can learn to play the guitar not everybody will be a great guitarist
hey hey hey no bullying people that aren t neurotypical cmon now
thihi yea tru can you believe this guy like omg
i m talking about you
meep meep
more pics please
can t wait to start using my bird buddy again got too cold there for a while
what a cutie
love seeing these when out and about i meep meep and sing the songs for the next twenty minutes
nom
i long ago lived in a low cinderblock shack with a corrugated tin roof out on the mojave desert across the road from a palm oasis in hot seasons i spent nights on the roof in a light sleeping bag atop a foam pad a roadrunner escaping the oasis regularly ran across me at dawn waking me early alas the bird never chirped meep meep maybe if i d had a canine companion
happy meep cake meep day
came here to say that
mesmorizing amazing the ingenuity out there
i wanna lie down on it while it continues to lay fabric on top of me
the entire machine is complex as fuck stretching straightening and even washing the fabric to layer it all out so beautifully in the end
kick ass for sure
how much of that will go to the colorado river
arizona and nevada what is that like inches
also the earth has gotten greener since the year the end is probably not as nigh as we previously believed
map
what s with the general lack of data in california usually nature doesn t make straight lines and i highly doubt that the snow decided to neatly avoid california s border with oregon
swe et
how has lake mead been down then genuinely curious like as of today it s down and still trending down
i think you have a math problem here
colorado river basin https://azgs.arizona.edu/photo/colorado-river-basin-quenching-thirst-30-million-people)
big big storms hope it s not a one off wish this chart also listed the actual snowfall though if a spot in say az typically gets a foot a year the increase is pretty negligible in terms of water a foot of snow is about an inch and a quarter of water but some is waaay better than none we got thrown a bone this season
floods incoming
ah good old global warming
why doesn t anyone ever talk about retaining or directing this water to places that need it
global warming
damn global warming
what a year to be a skier
a good bit of the sw corner and se portion of ut all have that river running through them and they all have that snow pack so it should be a fun rapid trip this summer
almost none the short version very very very little actual water is represented by of normal snowpack in arizona that bit down there is the salt river basin the average flow of the salt river https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salt_river_(arizona)) is cu ft s the average flow of one small tributary of the colorado the gunnison river https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gunnison_river), is cu ft s that s the area represented by on the above map in western colorado the long too much info stuff for actual measurements of what is up in arizona rather than percentages of normal go here https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/updatereport.html?report=arizona&format=snotel+snowpack+update+report](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/updatereport.html?report=arizona&format=snotel+snowpack+update+report) for the april snotel maps for arizona go here https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/gis/images/az\_swepctnormal\_update.png](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/gis/images/az_swepctnormal_update.png) for all of them use the drop down called basin filled map percent of median current pdf format here https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/snowclimatemonitoring/snowpack/snowpackmaps](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/snowclimatemonitoring/snowpack/snowpackmaps) here is colorado s snow equivalent numbers https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/updatereport.html?report=colorado&format=snotel+snowpack+update+report](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/updatereport.html?report=colorado&format=snotel+snowpack+update+report) the amazing snowpack in arizona represents measurements of anything from inches of water equivalent at some measurement points to as much as inches on top of a mountain for the upper basin of the colorado the range is a low of inches to a high of inches across a much larger area this is like a poor person bragging about their pay being doubled to dollars a hour and how much better that is than the millionaire who s only making more than last year
lol what based on what science are you making this hilarous farce
yeah if you ignore everything else we re just fiiinnneeee with any luck my beach adjacent home will be beach front in a few years silver linings
fuck i want headlines and political power damnit
we ll get the edited california data in ten years and million tax dollars later
because the last years have been a constant drought one winter isn t going to refill it or lake powell sadly
snow water content is extremely variable nrcs measures monthly using snow cores to get the actual water value by water weight this infographic is the snow water equivalent as measured
nasa in the journal of science look it up the earth is getting greener that s what happens when the earth gets warmer and the atmosphere more carbon rich and the ice caps get turned into water vapor plant life explodes because you know they use the sun and carbon to turn into sugars then use those sugars to make fruits and those fruits sustain animals and thats how you get an explosion of biodiversity like what happened in the carboniferous when the earth was degrees hotter and the everywhere was a tropical rainforest it s global cooling that everything starts to go extinct but i don t think enviormentalists study geology or history otherwise they d know this
yeah maybe in a couple thousand years have you seen the coastline move at all i literally have lived by the beach for years and still in the same exact place it was
yes also this water is mostly not headed down the river yet it will start when the snow melts over the next few months the low point each year for the reservoirs usually now in april rather than later
the map is not measurements it is percentages of normal for this time of year yes they are getting snow water equivalents by melting it down yes this is good science but it s also right now i don t know about arizona but april is a huge month for snow in colorado s high country if we keep getting storms this could be a great year but if they tapper off it could be merely average which is quite good after the last few years but an average year would not do much to make things actually better we are in a deep hole waterwise in the west also because it is percentages of normal it is exaggerating how good it is from some small river basins that don t usually have a lot of snowpack actually having it the important numbers are not arizona but that135 to in western colorado
i understand how plants grow what you ve failed to describe is how this isn t a step towards a global warming catastrophe
another case of reading the headline not the article the vegetation cooling effect is large from the energy dissipation perspective but only about compared to the pace of global warming the cooling effect from greening is less significant in tropical forests with high leaf areas this is a warning sign about climate change we should be cautious that the rainforests which are at the forefront of the fight against global warming are reaching the limits of their capacity to absorb carbon and cool the surface commented dr rama nemani from nasa s ames research center
but a lot of the greening is due to agriculture and planting right namely china and india that carbon is released back in to the environment
you have no clue what you re talking about it s an unprecedented amount of water period the basins in the sw had arguably the most critical and extreme drought on record it s all well documented nm has has historic drought for several years it was like beyond the drought categories but according to your logic it doesn t mean anything because it s all a desert anyway or something
because a lot of non science communities have redefined what global warming will really do they act like a degrees of warming will have the destructive impact of degrees the earth on a large scale frequently experiences warming and cooling even without human interference it s a pretty natural cycle and to be honest the earth is pretty good at correcting problems when it happens this isn t to say throw all your trash out your car window or stop researching renewable energy absolutely let s keep doing that but understand that both greenland and antarctica had forests on them a few times in history nature is wild and unpredictable
oh well the climate has always changed between hot and cold when things are hot lots of life when things are cold lots of death also let s be real every climate extremist prediction since the 60s has been incredibly false humanity is fatter healthier and richer than it ever has been in its history if you want to talk about a climate catastrophe i d refer you to over fishing not global warming also we only started recording the earth s temperature since and since the earth has changed by one degree a single degree one hardly anything of note tbh
of course the planet is still warming we just left an ice age you know the one years ago and humanity has been on the planet years we didn t cause that one did we
yes that is true some of that greening is a result of humanity planting trees but the more carbon in the enviorment means more carbon and water vapor for plants the carboniferous the last time the planet was super hot with tons of carbon in its atmosphere turned the planet into a giant god damn fucking rainforest the ice age the last time the planet got cool turned the planet into desert wastelands and frozen tundra global warming doesn t spell the end of life as we know it catastrophe is not around the corner that doesn t mean we should stop planting trees we should but what we shouldn t expect is that we have the capacity to tell the planet what to do as if we are some kind of gods
imagine using millions of years of earths timeline through cooling and warming cycles to explain how our current acceleration into a warming period isn t dangerous lol
thanks for highlighting your ignorance do you also subscribe to other non science nonsense
thank you for taking the time to write all of that
also let s be real every climate extremist prediction since the 60s has been incredibly false actually i learned in high school in the late 1970s that the trajectory of fossil fuel use would likely get us to almost exactly where we are today e g glaciers melting sea level rise amoc disruption this was from a geologist oceanographer
one degree is significant though there is proof that temperature is increasing there is proof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has exploded there s proof that the ice caps are melting faster and all this started at the exact same time as the world started industrializing
people having opinions like you need a tornado right before their frontdoor to realize that climate is turning to no good or any other uncomfortable weather condition
uhh rapid shifts in temperatures have been recorded before and have happened without human influence normally from some sort of large event happening in nature large volcanoes asteroid strikes large ice dams breaking etc also you just glossed over the non scientific communities redefining global warming
i m only subscribed to the journal of science and nature not the journal of democrats and progresives lol
in the 1970s most environmentalists thought starvation would be widespread by the year because of overpopulation like come on bro the ice caps ain t even melted yet
of course the temp is increasing we literally just got out of a god damn ice age what it s going to go from frozen to cooler yeah we like all life have an effect on the climate but guess what we are richer fatter and more peaceful than any other time period in human history and the earth is getting greener the exact opposite of every climate prediction from the 60s 80s
right because carbon causes tornados god dammit jesus christ yall the sky is not falling the king is butt ass naked and the end is not even close to nigh
nobody is saying the earth hasn t gone through cooling and warming periods what the science is indicating is that we re accelerating that process and it s gonna fuck with our way of life again those historical shifts have happened over millions of years we re pushing the timeline forward quicker what non scientigic communities should i be listening to have a link
then perhaps you should actually read them
i knew that was coming it was obvious by your take but thanks for coming clean damn you guys just live to have enemies huh even when it s against your best interest blows my freaking mind
r foundtherepublican
like come on bro the ice caps ain t even melted yet uh yes they have they re not completely gone but they have melted quite a bit maybe you missed it and i have never seen a credible citation for your overpopulation assertion do you have one
here s a tip don t use the word every hold off on all too so very very rarely appropriate and it makes those who use them look like emotionally driven children and who wants that another tip don t apply today to the s now clearly you have only known digital technology but believe it or not it hasn t always been a thing so you got two good tips today pal not a bad days work
believe whatever you want you havent realized weather getting more uncomfortable each year yet you may do never or when it s too late maybe youre living in an area completly untouched yet maybe too young or whatever that iceage argument made me lol in just the last years we lost having winters with snow and got summers torturing people and environment im from the middlepart of eu
https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/14/969/2018/ there is a quick link about a rapid re cooling in the earth during the younger dryas period that happened in a very short period of time caused from a combination of volcanic activities near the north pole and shifting wind and ocean currents presumed to be caused by the north american glacial lakes ice dams breaking it caused a quick cooling of the planet that article specifically goes into the sulfer content from the volcanic eruption from that time in the link is a download button for the full report fyi edit for clarity and wording
i i do that s how i know the earth has gotten greener since the year maybe you should try reading them instead of taking what those who are politically motivated say as gospel
us liberals its not going against my best interest yall progressives have genocided million people since thats against my best interest
i m not a republican lol i m liberal i thought the left loved science oh well guess they prefer ideology more
ok have the ice caps melted before was it the end of life as we know it nawh credible citation for overpopulation poverty hunger starvation a lack of material at an all time low like broholio come on man
this isn t a courtroom this is reddit obviously i know that and obviously i m exaggerating but still if a boy is crying wolf and every time i go to check up and there is no wolf eventually i m going to say the boy is bullshitting for attention can you imagine europe being like well that wasn t real fascism let s try that shit again it s like come on bro and broettes they ve been wrong over and over again the evidence is overwhelming
no i haven t i ve been watching the climate get greener floods and natural disasters have been happening since the beginning of time lol that s normal tornados sunamis wild fires lightning floods all normal middle part of the eu maybe you should ask germany to stop burning so much coal
maybe you should try reading them instead of taking what those who are politically motivated say as gospel clearly you didn t otherwise you would not have missed only about compared to the pace of global warming and as for your earlier comment about only degree since that is by far the fastest the climate has warmed in the last several thousand years https://xkcd.com/1732/](https://xkcd.com/1732/)
did they mention that all this extra carbon has caused more plant growth but largely it s in the useless cellulose in the plants
do you mean the environment surrounding you ofc they did and will always do happen we re just causing an increase in such events yeah im living really near an immense big hole where they got their coal from beside the emissions from burning they also gave a shit about all the water which would still be underground atleast im having a charged phone right now to answer doesnt change that im already hating coming summers reaching degress celsius while having weeks of no rain followed by one day of floodlike rain
a scene out of repo man
ad astra per aspera to the stars with hope or so a mary norton paperback claimed but i would be wary of glowing space thangs might be radioactive yikes
it brings us peace don t let it get away
excellent quote to the naked eye it had a glow there are two lights one on each side that cast a subtle light on the boonji man when i took this the orb though and all the fun facts i learned a few days later made it all that more incredibly awesome
the peace and overall rejuvenated energy i felt no joke was a story on its own from the unexpected foot art sculpture on a full moon and all unplanned yet perfectly timed cheers
that s awesome i m glad you had that experience i was making a simpson s reference though
i caught that big fan btw i should of added the simpsoooona intro
arm tattoos d d book marb 72s and spiderman sheets
very cool what a fantastic find
the first pic looks like some exotic glazed french pastry
that thing s definitely a horcrux
did anyone see a demagorgon at first also i totally don t think i spelled that right
with that scenery in the background i would want to fish it too
it s been said before they just went and hired aragorn to portray aragorn viggo was the best rider best fighter went out riding and hunting in the mornings before shooting effortlessly and unexpectedly hit that knife that was accidentally thrown at his head away with his sword dude fit the role before he even got there
exactly what the ranger would do if he was next to a big river and had a few minutes plus big beautiful monster trout in new zealand
like the bob ross of fishing
i used to be so in love with him
gotta go catch me a bass real quick
i wasn t paying attention and thought this was a robin williams voiceover at first didn t realize how similar they sound
i d prefer taters
gotta eat them while they re still raw and wrrriggling
that viggo would be a perfect kurt cobain in a biopic
you have my rod and my tackle
how this dude is so cool and decent amazing aragorn choice
aragorn for rainbow trout
i would do the same
did he catch anything
vijjo morgenstein
new zealand has to be one of the best fly fishing places in the world with the milder temperatures the trout there were fantastic not to warm to be sluggish when catching them but warm enough so that the trout grew big enough to be able to catch some descent size fish for eating plus the coastal waters gave some nice fish coming up the rivers also
totally could have put this in one of the films
he s flyfishing too
what is aragorn doing whatever he wants
viggo and keanu should be friends
gotta feed the hobbits
with his regular voice i m just picturing him in the prophecy movie
it s still crazy that viggo mortensen wasn t the first pick for the role of aragorn the movie series was extremely lucky that he was both free to play the role and willing to take it on instantly mortensen had to move to new zealand for a year to film the movies and he had to cancel any other plans he had originally made
that lil run like oops gotta go got fish to catch
even with his broken toe
didn t catch anything stick to taters precious
i like viggo the road
i legit that was a box of drugs he was going to casually do while being filmed
candy crush in my trailer or fishing in that spot tough choice x200b x200b s
do remember that this is probably nothing even close to a smartphone available i would be fishing too
my favorite character viggio morgenstein
this be me in runescape in the middle of a quest
just feeding his hobbits at this point in the film he was well aware of second breakfast and sies
ranger irl
us danes love fishing what can i say
fine i ll watch the trilogy again
where is this clip from like a documentary i want to watch the full thing
viggos voice reminds me of robin williams voice if robin didn t have such high energy lol
how else would he get second breakfast
casting viggo mortensen as aragorn was the single best thing i approved when i watched the movie everything else was so pendantically put together from a corpus of pre existing lore while the face and acting of viggo gave something more to it he brought to life some unexpected aspects that were part of what i couldn t actually picture of the character
nice i d do the same
is there a documentary or a behind the scene movie
new zealand is famous for huge trout
oh viggo young guns ll
video game moment just spot a fishing point between the fights and decided to stop by
that s what you had to do back then weren t no grocery stores invented yet
anytime i see this guy all i can think of his lines i can t walk i can t hump carlito s way
what a legend
he caught that fish gollum ate
fits the part
water strider
shoulda thrown a spinner viggo
hell yeah dryrdie
dunedain
when he runs with that fishing rod all i can hear is for frodo
look at that place how could you not wanna take a cast
the cast taking a cast
he sounds like kurt cobain
big deal smeagol did it during filming
badass
u savevideo
of course aragorn is a fly fisherman
perfect chance for an aragorn fishin sign
u savevideo

definitely a ranger s gotta eat
until i saw the most recent season of alone now all i can think is fishing in places like these are impossible
looks like lake wakatipu in southwest otago nz it s a breathtaking place maybe glenorchy i went to a school camp there and it was incredible
it gets boring quick when you live there your whole life sorry for growing up here i guess judging by the feedback
i d love a source on that knife parry
well they hired stuart townsend first and he even shot a few scenes as aragorn but was so insufferable everyone hated him peter jackson fired him and in a desperate attempt to keep the production from being delayed hired viggo very quickly fortunately he was perfect for the role
he had to be they re cast aragorn after they started shooting so they needed someone they didn t have to train
and to think he wasnt the first hire for the role the other actor forgot his name he s not worthy of remembering just didnt want to commit fully by doing the horse riding so they got rid of him
apparently they even had someone else playing aragorn right before starting filming but the guy was a hero and they fired him and hired viggo he didn t have any of the weeks of training like anyone else but already knew hoe to do all the necessary stuff
teach a man to fish and he ll be king for the rest of his life
you have my sword fish
you still can be come join us at r viggomortensen d
i used to be too still am but i used to be as well
bass in nz nah
i was going to say he sounds like a chill robin williams
wow oh my god you re right
po tay toes
the fish or dick
spot on it felt like watching one of old kurt interviews
and my pole
and my lure
infamously yes https://youtu.be/werapb4scp4?t=1889)
punches a woman in the face
it was viggo s insistence that got us the hunted deer scene in the extended fellowship
fun fact one plan he did have to cancel was directing a music video for l7 instead of just announcing it was cancelled they took a more clickbait y direction donita will not reveal which l7 news stories were fake and she likes that it s difficult to tell however in the documentary the band do confess to one a bomb threat it was a different time that supposedly disrupted their music video shoot we said that viggo mortensen who s a friend of ours was the director of this video shoot and that we didn t care about the safety of ourselves but that we had many exotic animals on set so we were worried about this possible bomb going off this visual of people thinking that we had the money to have all of these exotic animals in our video viggo mortensen he loved it it was a chuckle i always liked having a press person deliver these stories because then it would end up on mtv news it was fucking hilarious
it s from the special features section of the lotr extended dvds you can find all the scenes for free on youtube
as much or less as i searched it s from a limited edition dvd
it s found in a very specific set the extended edition blu rays all came with one extra disc per movie of raw behind the scenes footage it s about another hour hour and a half per film this is from the fellowship disc
there is both the extended edition dvds and blu rays both come with hours of documentaries for each film this particular clip though came from the behind the scenes footage found on the extended edition blu ray s bonus discs

if you re lucky eowyn will bring you some stew
a ranger caught off his line
is that a joke or is there no fish in places like those
well i can see boredom happening for two reasons either you don t really like fishing all that much which is absolutely fine or the fishing isn t that great there you could put me fishing in absolute paradise and it would get boring quick if no fish are biting i ve been fishing the same 10k acre watershed for years and it just never gets old because it s teeming with feisty bass and the fishing is stupid good scenery is just water trees and stumps so nothing too special just hardly any humans
woodchucks marmota monax accounted for of the rabies cases in rodents and lagomorphs for through in the united states https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3520029/) so it s not like the doctor needed to experiment on bill murray or really had any excuse for not finding out by consulting the litterature rather than risking a patient
the docs name was dr nicholas nick riviera
ironic that it happened twice happening once yeah just a fluke but happening again a sense of deja vu there s gotta be a name for that kind of thing
the groundhog doing the biting didn t have rabies and was probably vaccinated against rabies too so treatment isn t indicated the doctor or bill murray was just joking about using bill as a test subject
source https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1993-02-12-2902959-story.html
you volunteered didn t you we re paying you aren t we
what a quack
what is conclusion of science experiment
bill murray never had much luck with groundhogs exhibit b caddyshack
question if you think you got bit by an animal during an altercation example a dog but actually you didn t and you still end up taking the rabies shot would it have any sort of side effects on your body
it was a troubled shoot so i guess rabies was probably the least concern of both bill and harold
couldn t have happened to a nicer guy
question is there a problem with getting a shot even if you think the animal didn t have rabies better safe than sorry
i adore that film
so any animal that can transmit rabies will be dead within days so just catch whatever bit you and wait a few days if it s still alive your good to go otherwise get some rabies courses cause once rabies presents in a human there s no saving you
animals can usually tell when a person is bad
well see back then he couldn t just google stuff he d probably have to call somebody who knew and he was probably too lazy or busy to do that
the knee bone s connected to the something the something s connected to the red thing the red thing s connected to my wrist watch uh oh
hi dr nick
even funnier if it happened in the same scene
that was a gopher
not to my knowledge i was bit by a dog and got a rabies shot actually on different days it s not a single injection i m pretty sure it didn t have rabies but it was to be safe no adverse effects you never risk not getting a rabies shot if there s a chance you are infected it is uncurable and once symptoms start you will die a terrible death always get the vaccine
nope its ok to get a shot even if the animal turned out to be rabies free actually its highly recommended yes better be safe than sorry
this is bad advice you don t have to catch the animal and you definitely shouldn t wait to see if it dies they don t all die within five days some can take longer to die and waiting for the animal to die can be fatal for you do not delay seeking treatment you do not need proof that the animal had rabies
some doctor s are too proud to google even today its infuriating
a groundhog is basically a large gopher gophers should be called dirtpigs
okay thanks for the info
now that you mention it i ve seen a lot of doctors and never once have i heard something like you know what i m not sure about that let me look it up it s like medicine stopped evolving in whatever year they got their degree which is why i m super sketched out by old doctors
they re really not as far as taxonomy goes they re not even in the same family
i have some great docs who will say that s a good question i ll look into it one has pulled up the information with me more than once i am not happy she decided to take a hiatus from her practice as i trusted her
this is cool but also fuck you
this is a thing of beauty
they fucking rick rolled us
i watched it twice and saved it for later
slow clap sir well done
how does this work does the laser pulse at the frequency of each note
wow just got rick rolled lol
fuck you too buddy fuck you too with respect of course
thank you fella
smooth when not stamping that is
super glue
i just see a jerky video recording of a video playing on a computer and no quarters what am i missing
someone is gonna get fired if that quarter gets lost in that machine
is that not a nickel or maybe a presidential dollar every quarter i ve seen has a reeded rounded edge which the coin won t stand on x200b for sure i d rather be wrong
haha they don t let you go in without dustless gloves i wouldn t believe it either but trust me when i say i wish both quarters stayed up
the quarter haha it s on top of the horizontal yellow line and you can see another fallen to the left of the screen
well i think the falling part was the hardest
in north korean former special force member ju syenjen zhu xianjian in chinese pinyin fled from north korea to china he then committed several robberies and thefts in china in he was sentenced to years in jail by a chinese court he got his jail time reduced twice for his good behavior in jail and was set to finish his jail sentence in august and he would be deported to north korea at that time in october he escaped from jail apparently fearing being sent back to nk defecting is crime punishable by death in nk chinese authorities announced rmb award for whomever that could provide information that leads to his arrest the award was later gradually increased to rmb roughly usd after weeks he was captured again by chinese authorities in china escaping from jail makes a prisoner get more years of jail time so he is now still in chinese jail media reports cnn https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/china/jilin-prison-break-intl-hnk), rfa https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/ql1129a-11292021041659.html) in chinese
i ll take note of that short circuit technique for potential future use if i ever find myself locked up in china i love a good prison break i thought el chapo s escape on an underground motorcycle was pretty effin cool
no one commenting on the fact he used his arm to break his fall and shattered it into a million pieces as it flails around while he s running away
all the best plans involve jumping falling from a great height onto asphalt
how high was that fall that s insane how did he not break his legs or ended up with his knees in his rib cage
christ a man with that dedication should just focus on his mind
what s more impressive was that fucken story drop that he just walks away from
does this incident have a name a link to more information locations date personalities etc
man that drop tells you the sheer desperation to escape his captors that took fear and courage most can t contemplate to do and all to escape being deported to a death sentence so sad he wasn t able to get to a safe harbor after all of that
minutes would make for a horrible tv show
the real jason bourne
what did we learn stong lights facing cameras makes you invisible
his training paid out
the force is strong in this one
woohoo out of my cage and back to the free land of um north korea
he broke outta jail so he could stay in jail
chinese n korean american concentration camps are all the same sorry american bros but you re not clean either
he escaped to go where it s a matter of time before they catch him unless kim jung un sends some special forces to rescue him
just a thought but i think anyone that escapes nk should be give 500k ok maybe a million to kickstart their new life a sort of reward and what ever else they might need to get their new life going
and no one is questioning how video from the ccp got on reddit about people escaping their prison this is really bad ccp propaganda at its finest we all know leaking info out of china like this is punishable by death but yea lets act like china doesnt control reddit
i bet he is a jason borne bruce lee chuck norris all rolled into one
man there are cameras in every single room in china
someone reddit with mission impossible music
spider man lol
life finds a way
badass
he was aiming for the bushes
not even a limp afterwards impressive
that drop was insane
was thinking the same thing how far was that jump
this is exactly the kind of scenario i prepare for i practice falling down like every day i m really good at it
i don t know i think the ground was harder than the fall
he just saved his own life
reducing a prison sentence for good behavior knowing that deportation upon release is a death sentence that s the epitome of lawful evil right there
i was in jilin city at the time of his escape which is the closest major city from the prison he escaped from i saw a ton of swat vans and helicopters and planes searching for him in the nearby mountains and highways of jilin shi it was november at the time and already freezing there i have no idea how he managed to survive at large for weeks most people would have frozen to death in the wild and he wasn t just in prison for robberies he also stabbed an elderly lady nearly to death he s lucky she didn t die or else that would have been the death penalty for him more on his escape https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59456540.amp
conclusion bro literally dodged a bullet there
guess chinese jail is better than dying in nk
i m honestly surprised that escaping prison in china only gets you more years
kinda w
i think countries should welcome nk defectors with open arms unfortunately china s somewhat simpatico with nk so they would likely prefer to send them back to nk over sending them to other countries
an absolute king
if china knows they would just kill him why east all the tax dollars imprisoning him and having a bounty just send him back right away
how could they send him to his death in north korea because he escaped north korea and some people still think communism can work
how did he ride it if it was underground
just make sure you get caught after your escape so you can increase your sentence and not be deported yet which was the whole reason he tried to escape he was nearing the end of his sentence
hardcore
i mean when you re facing certain death it s better to lose a limb or two than everything at once
he would have been deported and probably killed had he not atleast tried to escape
check my comment
ju syenjen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhu\_xianjian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhu_xianjian) all you had to do is google his name
i dunno having ovens mean to turn people to ash and showers that poison gas comes out of is kinda worse than the ones that don t
american concentration camps i was just paroled and i gotta say you re an idiot
maybe you should fund this
have you actually taken the time to read what hes done lol he almost murdered an elderly lady he stabbed her repeatedly and she almost died among other various robberies and thefts like homie go for it you take him lol
nice little tangent
how is leaking something that is according to you ccp propaganda but also so bad that it is punishable by death it s not propaganda i m betting releasing this isn t punishable by death and definitely something you made up and it got released the exact way you re watching it somebody filming it on their phone
in the last screen it looks like he is limping on his left leg though it doesn t look too terrible
he just went afk for a sec
definitely went head first that s for sure looks like he went unconscious albeit briefly before taking his run again
for about five more years
north korea would do far worse things to him if he was sent back i heard the stories
more like prolonged sounds like he still has to go back at some point lol
don t think so hitting a guard or causing some trubles sounds easier than falling from the roof
the only time he was actually supposed to misbehave and he didn t
this is a man who is willing to do whatever it takes to live but the laws are against him that s unbelievably sad
only five more in us as well but no parole
i mean he nearly stabbed an elderly woman to death
youd like to welcome him with open arms lol cool he can go to your house then he robbed a bunch of people and stabbed an elderly lady almost to death she survived but barely you want that lol
it s north korea on their border or south korea nato on their border that s what the relationship breaks down to
wheel motorcycle the two rear wheels were attached to train tracks
is there something im missing can motorcycles not operate under ground
tunnel dug from about 1km outside the prison right up to his bathroom area https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjqx8m/el-chapo-witness-reveals-new-details-about-the-epic-motorcycle-tunnel-escape
it s not so much the death i d be worried about if i were him it s the being captured alive hell of a courageous escape though glad he made it
not his fault i didn t mention the name in the title
all i ve got to say is that you just got paroled
who said this nk officials of course they would say that and tell the sk to send him back duh hey sk that guy that jumped the wall is killer send him back think about it homie
at least hide the fact your a ccp agent geezus
so your telling me footage of peple escaping maximum security prisons out of communist controlled countries from the employees on cellphones that are highly monitored by said government is common with no harsh repercussions
the chinese guys say that he lost his shoe which may explain the slight limp he s walking barefoot on rough ground
all the best plans involve jumping falling from a great height onto asphalt
plenty of time to plan a fresh escape and start that clock again
i can t wait for the next video in years time
dang didn t read the story just thought he just stole stuff never meet your heroes
the thing is that china deports all nk citizens regardless of if they commit crime or not
so u foegot
do you know what a concentration camp is north korea and china actually have forced labor camps america has prison overpopulation and a few other issues but it doesn t compare
i work for the ccp and i am deducting you social points
you re done ranting or you got more
woo prison for life epic win
i understand that point and that is valid i am specifically referring to the person in this video though
noone getting the joke
i feel like i was successful with my trolling today i always get or i feel like mert or something of equal or lessir value wood be worth more then jist deducting social points
no i feel like we should continue do you habe more btw im gona mispel alot naw u redy
better than a nk concentration camp
extremely cringe bro goodnight hope you can calm yourself
i wonder if he turned himself in and kept the bounty for himself
honey in north korea for leaving they kill your family in front of you before killing you all of which is done in public to set an example and instill fear in anyone thinking of defecting
crng on redit oh ya go morals naw over the internt ccp wuss
i can t imagine many places would let you claim your own bounty
fun fact gibbon wrists are a ball and socket joint like our shoulders instead of a hinge joint which gives them way more flexibility when they swing like this
look at the little guy go
skips every other bar on the first pass and then nails every bar on the second pass just to show the difference i want to see a gibbon agility course now
they had a couple at the oakland zoo when i was a kid and they not only swung all over their enclosure but they sang and sometimes sorta breakdanced on the floor sounds made up but i have vivid memories of one of them spinning around on its heels with arms up in the air similar to a ballerina spinning on her toes it was my favorite spot in the whole zoo and my mom knew that s where i d want to spend the most time great example of their antics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kge_ugrrj40)
this guy seems pretty stoked but it s always a bummer seeing animals in cages
that flip was sick
very impressive so fast
i have a video from the pittsburgh zoo of a gibbon singing it was one of the most ethereal sounds i have ever heard
brachiators by design are gibbons and spider monkeys which have odd upper arm muscles and reduced thumbs female orang utans are also brachiators they are just less acrobatic about it than gibbons https://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/brachiation.php#:\~:text=orangutans%2c%20spider%20monkeys%2c%20and%20chimpanzees,%2c%20coordinated%2c%20and%20graceful%20movement.
practising for temple run
i feel like he is just showing off
they look like they re having a lot of fun
i m so mad at evolution we couldn t have come from one of those yea let me just use my legs like some asshole
i just took the kids to santa barbara zoo and they had two of these there what s crazy is the exhibit is wide open to the outside world with only a moat of water between the exhibit and a lake they don t use any fencing or cables since apparently they can t swim the gibbons there were and years old
can t wait to see the boston dynamics version of this
that s how you felt as a kid on the monkey bars when you learned to swing properly
dude looks like he s having a blast but man the background sound is soooooooooooo cool
i want to do this so fucking bad
pretty amazing
now imagine being chased by of those while trying not to trip on pythons and cobras
feels like he s filming a tiktok lol
damn that s interesting
gibbon pog
i ve worked with white handed gibbons for over a decade they are truly beautiful primates to behold
if this were an athletic competition how well could a human do this i used to swing on monkey bars as a kid we definitely have some innate capacity
thats me who tf put up a camera my gym
this might be my to do list if i m on lucid dream lol
god dammit that looks so fun
imagine driving at 30mph and this little guy swings past you on bars
gibbon it heee heee
fun facts gibbons are actually not monkeys they are classified as lesser apes gibbons are the only lesser apes in the world although there are species of them discovered so far the lesser ape classification for primates of this type was actually created specifically for gibbons as they didn t fit into any of the other classifications
that s an awesome video
back in my teens i used to work at the st louis zoo in a concession stand near the gibbon and siamang habitats people love to watch those guys swing around at top speed and got really surprised when they d let out the loud howls with their air sacs they are still some of my favorite creatures at the zoo
verb brkt brak of certain apes move by using the arms to swing from branch to branch the gibbons brachiate energetically across their enclosure
i did that at a playground on shrooms once and didnt have any skin left on my hands was fun other than that
my rotator cuff is killing me right now
monkey bar style anyone remember the cal us we used to get from monkey bars as kids
it s always a bummer seeing animals in cages
poor soul stuck in a cage free the gibbons and all the animals locked up in cages
that s a dogshit enclosure
and they all work at fifth third bank obviously
i brachiate every night

i tore a rotator cuff just watching this
i could do that i just don t feel like it
i love you gibbon
why is my man in the gates of hell
that s really something
hate to see animals in cages though should be in the trees
pft i could do that
wow they make it look so easy humans btfo by our more cuddly and athletic cousins yet again
surely if i practiced that all my life i would be just as good
seriously i wish i could do that
i remember seeing one of these guys in a zoo there was an overhead cable strung between two telephone poles he was going back and forth hand over hand but every now and then about two thirds of the way there he d pretend to miss a handhold fall and catch himself on a rung on the telephone pole then scramble back up and continue watched him do this repeatedly for about fifteen minutes at first i thought it was an accident but it became clear he was doing it deliberately to elicit a reaction from the crowd
i always wanted to be a gibbon when i was a kid
get that parkour get that parkour
undefeated monkey bar champion
gibbons are so dope haha wooooooop
reminds me of a spider monkey my favorite monkey i think i evolved from a spider monkey
monkeybars were my favorite thing on the playgrounds got too fat too soon
i wanna know what their shoulder musculature looks like
orangutan
yeah but how was the dismount
that s fuckin awesome
them spooky sounds gibbon me chills
i pronounce gibbons like gibby pronounced his own name
clearly lesser ape is the wrong classification
showoff
i m thinking they get pretty bored in that cage considering how adapt they are at navigating branches
it s so sad that these guys are endangered they made a mobile game on gibbons called gibbon it is wonderfully made
they have a bunch of siamang gibbons at fresno chaffee zoo it s awesome watching them do this they have a big beautiful forest like enclosure shared with orangutans they really do seem to be happy there
i wonder what differences in wear and tear of their bodies experience from moving this way until old age
that s the saddest looking cage i ve ever seen
never skip arm day
showing off doing doubles then singles
it s crazy how close they are to humans yet so far since they use their hands as their main way of travel
humans are primates and can also brachiate
and it s stuck in prison
that cage is sad
ngl that looks fun as fuck
can you imagine this shit coming at you in the woods
today i learned the word brachiate tomorrow i forget the word brachiate
that looks really fun and i m jealous off subject slightly but another animal i m jealous of is horses imagine being able to just run super fast in an open meadow and not get winded because you have enormous lungs oh and sperm whales imagine being able to dive down deep into the ocean and be super bad ass that you eat giant squid and no one fucks with you maybe orcas do but they can t dive as deep and sperm whales do have teeth
brachiate ftw
hehe my yo boy enjoyed this
the new ninja worrier is here
watching this hurts my rotator cuffs
that s so cool
they may be lesser apes but they ll always be a great ape to me
soo i am gibbon i do not use my tail or legs on trees often
the funky gibbon
he or she i didn t look should do ninja warrior
thats so cool
it makes me feel like it should be freed
makes it look like nothin
me as a running down the hall when supper was called lol
in a fucking cage
doesn t it break its fingers and push the bones out of its skin
it s a bad day to be a fly bub
the poisonous claws of the hairy frog were found about but it wasn t until after the turn of the century that scientists learned how these unusual amphibians create them or break them if you will in fact when irritated the hairy frog trichobatrachus destroys its own toe bones resulting in a pair of cat like claws that it may use to scrape over its attacker s skin x200b x200b read the brief wolverine frog story in source https://flagfrog.com/wolverine-frog-who-can-regenerate/)
harvard biologists have described a bizarre hairy frog with cat like extendable claws trichobatrachus robustus actively breaks its own bones to produce claws that puncture their way out of the frog s toe pads probably when it is threatened https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13991-horror-frog-breaks-own-bones-to-produce-claws/
looks like sideburns too
wolverine frog this is how you know millennials are taking over the world
yes
not only that mike myers recorded the lines twice once in his normal voice and once in a scottish accent it s disputed https://screenrant.com/shrek-scottish-accent-recording-cost-mike-myers-response/) how much it cost to redo the lines but myers worked for free to change the voice
interesting i had no idea gotta say though i think the accent meyer s worked with played better
at this point it s too hard to separate from the iconic mike meyers shrek but honestly it s pretty good i think farley s voice came across even more emotional i have to wonder if they would have had him make changes like they did meyers i also wonder what would those have sounded like
this movie would have had a completely different meaning especially if you can see the obvious parallels between farley and this version of shrek
i loved chris farley this makes me miss him all over again
i ll argue that every voice actor has recorded their lines before their death
lol lord fartwad
there are some movies where the characters magically come together and the sum is greater than the parts chris farley is great but the movie was much better without him
this would have been a completely different movie and i would have liked it
i really love chris farley wish he was still around but mike meyers scottish shrek is too perfect and i m glad he was able to step up
legend
wonder if he would of lived in a van down by the river rather than a swamp
really nuts because farley passed in and shrek released they had shrek in the hopper for a whiiiile
no offence but like mike myers better
perhaps not for shrek but i think chris could ve done great in another animated role the expression is there
chris sounding like john dimaggio
he would have been great he was so funny but mike gave it the accent that made it very different than farleys version
damn the were gonna play tom waits innocent when you dream too
is that was shreks voice there would have never been a shrek
just doesn t sound natural
u savevideo
just sounds wrong without myers fat bastard voice
next you will tell me phil hartman was supposed to be in it as well just to remind of how good snl was
chris farley was so sweet an individual it is very difficult to believe the bitter short tempered edge that the shrek character needed mike myers more of a character actor really did a great job with the accent to give shrek that edge
posting because i was curious according to a quick google search chris farley died in and shrek was released in sources chris farley https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chris_farley) shrek https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/)
rip chris farley
chris farley robin williams and betty white were my role models as a kid and the fact that they re all gone now still hurts i hate getting older
farley seems too limited with his voice acting abilities might have been a career ender if it was made with farley
that was brutal to listen to couldn t finish it all the way through
i knew the story but i d never heard farley s rendition before mike myers was absolutely a better choice for the role by leaps and bounds
completely changes the profile of the movie big fan of farley but myers was the much better shrek
shrek woulda had about the same emotional resonance as trolls with farley giving that performance not saying it wouldn t be successful hard to say but myers and i guess the accent included gives so much more sincerity to the script farley just keeps bludgeoning you with shtick after shtick
i wanna see this why was chris s roll denied
man he s down bad
i absolutely love chris farley and there s no doubt he would have crushed this role however at the same time mike meyers owns this role they got the right guy in the end
i would love to watch this movie with chris farley as shrek wonder if ai could accomplish that
ohh man would have been amazing
i wonder if david spade got fired when farley died
i m watching shrek right now haha
weird i remember it sounding like this
idk why but chris farley voicing shrek reminds me of the english voice actor bryce papenbrook for meliodas from seven deadly sins
shame
that would have been fun
i miss chris farley
one of our fallen stars he lived fast and died young we were lucky to know him i will always appreciate that funnyman and his legacy totally gonna watch tommy boy this weekend
damn i miss chris farley
did you know the muffin man they refer to in shrek was one of the first serial killlers who killed children
rip chris farley
best decision in dreamworks history
woah that website has more cookies than a fucking cookie factory
lol lord fartwad
ya hard to say farley had more of a smokers drinkers voice and his schight at the time loved chris but the shrek franchise worked out quite well as it was
i thought the opposite to me farley s voice sounded less kind it made the lines sound more mean
it s a terrible strain on the mortician s wrists to do it after
though you can argue you re still technically correct don rickles was dead before toy story four i believe they just used a lot of old stuff with technology it won t be long before a studio will be able to cut a deal with a family to recreate the voice of a dead actor to just have them be the part for that film
at least until james earl jones passes and disney needs darth vader again
haha ahhh it s sad this won t be true for long https://comicbook.com/starwars/news/the-mandalorian-katee-sackhoff-allow-ai-replicate-her-voice/
i think that s obtuse we all know mike myers s did wonderful opposite of eddie murphy but the truth is we don t more for sure who would have been better this is a minute clip from an unfinished minute movie
hear where you re coming from but have to respectfully disagree to say the movie is much better without him from just this demo clip is quite the leap i grew up with both meyers and farley and love them equally don t doubt farleys range he could have absolutely taken the carrey route and done some heavier stuff that i m quite sure would have been really special the man had been through it he had plenty to pull from
exactly how i heard it made me think of his character from vampire the masquerade bloodlines

it wasnt he passed away
sorry first link i found
fartwad is funny until you realize farquaad is fuckwad
yeah the recast worked out amazing and became one of the most significant animated films of all time i would just love to have seen whatever chris could have churned out always enjoyed his work
what s schight
you did meep meep
that time has actually come james earl jones recently made a deal with a company https://nypost.com/2022/09/24/james-earl-jones-gives-rights-to-darth-vader-voice-to-ukrainian-ai-company/) to use his voice even artificially recreated in their productions i believe that includes posthumous use of his voice
luke skywalker in the mandalorian and book of boba fett uses an entirely synthesized voice mark hamill is still alive of course and i personally think the synthetic nature is evident in the lifeless robotic performance but it shows that its already being done and will presumably only get better with time
didn t prince reappear at the super bowl
somehow james returned
only minutes and he sounds awesome perfect alternative
ah i see thank you
i think its supposed to spelled shtick like his mannerisms or style
his voice is too great to lose to time
didn t even know thanks for sharing
i mean if i voiced darth vader i d want my family gettin paid for my voice after i died as well lol
is it me or did that not really seem to accomplish much
damn thats less efficient than i thought it would be
doesn t seem very effective didn t look any different when they were done than when they started hardly seems worth dispatching a truck to do that vs picking it up to empty it
i applaud the person that invented this apparatus and was able to sell it off to the idiots that thought this did anything worthwhile
thought this was about hooking up in jersey
yo this sucked
it didn t do lmao
this seems wildly ineffective
we serve customers and their communities by compacting waste in open top dumpsters our proprietary service crushes and reduces waste volume saves businesses money and cuts harmful greenhouse gas emissions this is from their website it really is supposed to compact it lol
is this to make sure the items thrown away are destroyed it surely didn t seem to compact it any so that wouldn t seem to be the goal
we use smash my trash where i work no it s not the latest dating app we have a lot of bulky wood crates and this really brings down the cost of the roll off services
wtf did this accomplished it looks almost identical
yea or recycle more pallets are worth money too
that did nothing
screenshot the beginning then the end and it really did nothing other than flatten the far end the middle was higher than it was in the beginning lol
not interesting
yeah i hope you didn t pay for that
what a waste of gasoline it didnt do anything
this is dumb af
so worth the of space savings
it is cool but with these plastic bags being dumped it has no effect whatsoever
but it doesn t do anything
this is about as funny and money conscious as the company that drives around to clean your trans cans and dumpsters out so they don t smell
seems like a lot of work just to reduce the trash volume by
what was the point of this
better title name flatten my trash
super effective and a great use of the resources it took to accomplish no
didn t do much apart from keep moving the pallet from one end to the other
i hope they didn t have to pay for whatever they think was accomplished there
i figured it was the jersey shore crew rolling in garbage
that must be a madoff crusher what a scam
whenever i see these truck it makes me wonder how much is a dumpster pull compared to what they charge it just doesn t seem financially worth it
how many tree shaped air fresheners do you think he has hanging in that tiny little cab
plot twist the roles were reversed
shitttt i need someone to use one of those on my back fr
i want that for my back
we did this in our sheet metal dumpster when i worked for a plumbing hvac contractor
this is about as interesting as an unseasoned hard boiled egg
thank you for sharing for sure it should be on an episode of odd jobs
yea we hired these people at my job for like months they didn t do jack shit except get trash on the ground it just doesn t work like it should unless it s a dumpster full of pallets or like furniture and that s just not what usually goes in dumpsters
forklift certified here easy now that pallet wouldn t of last seconds
i need them to do that to my lower back
wow a 1cm smashification
wow this thing is garbage
dumbest idea ever
it had already been smashed earlier that day does save money alot of money over a full swap source ops comment
big disappointment
the guy came with the truck and my buddy started explaining what it did so i asked the guy if i could take a video he said that his coworker already did that dumpster this morning but would show me anyway because i really wanted to see it in action the goal is to compact the trash in the dumpster instead of paying hundreds for a swap obviously you pay a higher tipping fee but it pales in comparison to a full swap i too wish it was more exciting but i still thought the idea was novel and worth sharing
that pallet just kept getting back up and saying fuck you
an extra 3mm of space
smash my unsmashable trash
exactly
yep it didnt do shit looked at before and after and not much changed at all
i agree
i was thinking the same seems like a waste of time
it was already compacted that morning he was just humoring my interest
it smashed the lightbulbs resulting in many micro glass shards so it did something
it is worthwhile and does something useful if you regularly lease a dumpster the less swaps you call in the less your bill obviously you will pay a higher tipping fee but it beats paying hundreds of dollars for an empty swap because your dumpster is full of airy material the more you know
we re testing it right now some of our roll offs we re getting a decent reduction with it this video isn t of a very effective demo imho
works a lot better in a dumpster full of sheet metal duct work
in my area around to swap a dumpster can t imagine you save a lot getting it crushed even if it was full when the first crush happened that s maybe a foot so let s say of the drumpster do they come out for less than seems like a tight budget to include driver pay truck maintenance and fuel and insurances but maybe it was overflowing and they crushed edit just looked it up and they are not worth it
we have them at our work too it helps only a little bit as our trash is also similar to yours sales rep explained the compaction greatly depends on the crap you are throwing out and it all makes sense imho its also ultimately cheaper then a straight up compactor or baler depending on the business setup and building
man it really seems like not a lot of people reading your comments lol bummer this seems pretty cool
how much do you end up saving with a trash compactor asking for a friend
i watched them do this on my site new construction trash made no significant difference
compactors were already a thing seems like any place handling refuse on a mass scale would have a better way of handling things other than rolling out one dumpster at a time for a small scale business the employment of a separate machine that requires fuel maintenance and storage also seems incredibly impractical this might change the shape of the materials but allowing everything to just sit there uncompressed doesn t change the overall volume of the dumpster by a nominal amount seems pretty silly to me
the presence of the skateboarder really gives the viewer motivation to look around the pic and make the squares move more
optical illusions don t fit this sub
no h on it for hornets
i can thank a calculator watch for my first serious relationship back in the mid s was with a group of friends saw a group of girls so went to talk to them no one had a pen and the girls had to leave so i entered names numbers in my watch i and two other friends later hooked up with them good times
ounces g on the wrist is heavy
now worth 5k
this is from an article at the independent museum of hp calculators time elusive and immediate limited yet infinite because time is important to you hewlett packard introduces the hp a new dimension in time management and personal computation it s a digital electronic wristwatch a personal calculator an alarm clock a stopwatch a timer a year calendar and yet it is more than all of these the hp is a unique interactive combination of time and computation functions that offers unmatched capability and versatility you can do anything from viewing the time to dynamically calculating to cost of a long distance phone call or if a pilot finding the distance to your next checkpoint for years hewlett packard atomic clocks have been used by international observatories and authorities to set time standards with accuracy to within second in years currently millions of hp pocket calculators are in use throughout the world the same company with this proven and respected clock and calculator expertise stands behind your hp hp at the hp calculator museum https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp01.htm) this is what the people at hodinkee say about the hp watch you probably fondly remember the casio calculator from your youth well the hp could be considered its mastermind ancestor reaching an unprecedented level of complication back in its technical feast has to be put in perspective imagine fitting three batteries and six chips in a wristwatch some plus years ago in truth the hp was not the very first calculator watch ever produced sorry about that wikipedia calcron and pulsar deserve that honor for their respective launches but the hp was undoubtedly smarter much smarter or as its advertising puts it with the hp you can compute and then count down the time it takes for a command to reach a spacecraft several hundred million miles away this sounds both insanely geeky and cool so let s understand how this beast actually works historical perspectives meet the very first smartwatch behold the hp from hewlett packard https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/smartwatch-hp-01)
on a side note i just found out what hp stands for
hp had been making top notch electronic test equipment since the late s that was there bread and butter for years this watch was a gimmick compared to the research development and products produced using their test equipment still pretty cool but not a game changer for the company

you are in for surprise with lg i actually owned tv from g back in 90s
yes the bit that s now agilent
interestingly my pops acquired a very early texas instruments calculator the size of a brick its display was the old red led s and it could add subtract multiply and divide it could even do a square root me being a little kid i thought it was the coolest thing wish he had saved it it would qualify as a museum piece for sure do you own that calculator watch it was so far ahead of its time although i m sure sony was working on something similar i would love to have that in my display case with my old apple ii and trs i saved as a kid cool post
i don t have the hp they are a bit expensive but i do have a variety of the original rpn hp calculators with the red leds
hp rpn the best
my hp 15c got me through college and us naval nuclear power school and i used it in the fleet exclusively for performing complex estimated critical position of control rod groups prior to reactor startup i love the rpn it is more logical and faster when doing alot of number crunching loved that it fit in my shirt pocket too
i wonder if there s any honey stains on either
honestly not surprised
act interested to earn social credit points
so china is basically becoming a much bigger north korea
people act like americans wouldn t have done the same with a towel from a very old president or something but hey i could be completely wrong
this is the counter offer on a yacht that don henley once slept on
gotta get a head start i just wish it was butt stuff
xi sees this comment oh bother
where s that always has been meme when you need it
here lies steve s right leg it had a great run
when i had my testicle removed my oncologist told me they just flipped it out the window to the pack of hungry dogs that hang outside the hospital i wanted to keep it and make it into a necklace
amputees can make good thieves as they won t be charged with armed robbery
someone on reddit actually ate their amputated foot they requested it back after it needed to be amputated after a bad break at the ankle so it was in good condition they removed musculature from the top part of the foot around the metatarsals and made mini burritos with it and had a dinner party with it with some consenting friends and yes all perfectly legal
who else was waiting on the bbq option
in the us if you own a grave you can bury it in your grave older sites might be marked with arm of steven or something
amputate limb burial sites what a fucking waste of space
my dad is an amputee right hand crushed in machinery eleven years ago when he woke up from the surgery he laughed at the question what does he want done with the hand he had the option to have it released to be buried at the time he had not purchased a cemetery plot so it was just disposed of medical waste
yo dude where are you going dude i m going to the grave of my right hand to mourn
take it to the backyard and set it ablaze
and when you actually die you just add plus the rest to your tombstone
what about that jesus freak that prayed some toes back checkmate
i had never thought this question before but im glad i have the answer now lol
in the us they go to pathology in pathology we need to prove the surgery was necessary so if a traumatic amputation i ll make a quick report saying it s mangled with broken bones and that the limb is consistent with trauma then if a diabetic leg there is usually a poorly healed lesion and it may or may not involve the bone so i ll take a piece of the lesion and the bone so we can pathologically confirm necrosis and osteomyelitis i will also dissect out the front and back blood vessels because often the patients have poor circulation and this is what contributes to poor healed sores we are looking for thickened blood vessel walls or hard calcified vessels i ve seen legs with maggots in the feet wounds some people have broken deformed feet and they don t know it because they have terrible nerves from being diabetic and they don t feel it so if you do request it back it might not be in the same shape it was in when they took it pathology probably took some and needed to dissect it a bit more source i am a pathologists assistant and i dissect body parts for a living
an old housemate of mine had her hip replaced she asked for the section of bone they took off back cleaned it up and gave it to her dog
no mention of donating it i thought that if you can donate your whole body to science you could also donate a limb to science an arm can still be used to practice dissecting on even if there is no body attached to it
you can buy them in mexico but it will cost you an arm and a leg
if i lose a limb i m eating that fucker
removed
why did i think that this guy was talking about the amputated limbs the saudis still like to chop off
so i could lose my arm and keep it too ok sure im in make it the right arm tho cuz im a southpaw wait i do most things left but fap right seems i have a conundrum
when my wife had her aortic valve replaced i asked the surgeon for it and he looked at me like i was crazy i was going to put it in lucite as a keepsake
his hand gestures are giving me anxiety i can t watch this
being buried in parcels seems interesting
so you can incinerate it but not cremate it
imagine having your own appendage lying around the house and some guest call the police on u for murder lol
i wonder how hard it would be to cremate your own limb without outside assistance beyond heating it to a specific very high temperature for a long time is there anything else that i d need to do for it to be successful
what about keeping it in a big jar of formaldehyde on the bookcase next to a well curated collection of rare leather bound books and remy martin louis xiii cognacs
but they wouldn t let me have my giant gallstone rude
yo i had a finger cut off and the hospital told me absolutely not i couldn t have it back wtf i wanted it in a jar to scare the kids
my exes great aunt had to have her foot amputated she insisted on it being buried on the plot she had already purchased
such a good source of protein totally wasted
so if i want to make a lamp with my former limb i can sweet
knew a guy who got his amputated leg back after surgery he worked as a mortician embalmed it sewed surgical side fine work i might add and had it in a giant jar at his home
has anyone said hamberders yet hamberders gif emote free_emotes_pack yummy
you need a toe i can get you a toe
if you leave the limb at the hospital it becomes sloppy joe meet for the residents to eat
i would so have mine stuffed and kept at the house
arm of stonewall jackson huh so where s the rest of him or did his own men shoot him that badly that he s scattered all round
hmm
i want to keep anything removed from my body but i forgot to ask for my wisdom teeth
as someone facing amputation and has been facing it for some time now thought at first it was a must but they salvaged it and now it still may be the better choice i hate this video i did not wanna think about this on top of everything else how creepy just as the hospital get rid of it and don t tell me how
med schools
so i could take it home and eat it i mean when else is there a moral chance to taste human flesh plus the bones and skin could be used for some ed gein style craft projects
rip my appendix
i m glad i asked oh wait i didn t
would the limbs decompose in you put them in a compost bin
ok what are the laws on stripping it down to the bone and putting it in a glass case hypothetically definitely not considering this
keep it and use it for pranks
ayo stop wasting food god dammit
neat but also gross but in a neat way
when my grandma got a new hip she took her old hip home and fed it to our dog
i can t come into work today i am going to see my legs grave
i ll take my leg to go please
can they keep them for training purposes for example to train a specific surgery you could use a lost appendage rather than a full cadaver i m sure there is something i m not considering there there may not actually be that many amputations so the effort to retain the appendage may not be worth it the thought crossed my mind though
no donating to medical studies
i m buryin mine if it is amputated
there s a bio hazard disposal center in my town they get paid starting pay and i ve heard more than one story bout dealing with boxes full of feet
i had a rib removed in my shoulder under my collarbone in highschool that had pinched my vein in my shoulder and caused a big clot when i woke up from surgery i asked for my eve doctors chuckled i then seriously asked if i could take my rib home they said no still bummed about that coulda had a hunk of my bone in a drawer collecting dust
so my dad had cancer in the head of the femur his surgery was very experimental because it involved a little reorganizing and removing part of the pelvic bone the survival rate was like as per the doctors and he did have to get resuscitated in the middle of the operation anyways his leg did a tour visiting several medical universities since it was so unique dad lived several years post surgery but eventually die to another type of cancer post surgery my father had a lot of phantom pains which i think are the most interesting thing in the word and would spend time talking to my dad about alleviating the pain most of the time it was him wearing pants putting a towel to fill the missing leg part and him stabbing it with a fork to justify the pain
can i give it to my dog
they have a documentary called finders keepers about a mummified leg someone won in a storage locker and end in a court battle over it currently on prime
when i told the surgeon i wanted to take my finger home he said it s yours i don t give a shit what you do with it years later it comes out of the freezer when folks ask about it
all i can picture is someone giving a comical satire grief talk to their amputated leg in a graveyard
most have infectious tissue in them are incinerated
and you can eat it
i m gonna bury all my limbs separately like horcruxes
could i keep it in a jar or set in a block of resin if i was going to have something amputated i d definitely want it on the mantle afterwards
in sterling ma there is the legg cemetery now i wonder
you eat them
i remember working at a big hospital in chicago and seeing some real messed up stuff also during peak covid there was a rookie called the grosse room where they would have vials of lymph nodes infected limbs etc one time i was chilling in there working on some software updates and fixing a microscope and the doc casually pulled out a severed frozen knee cap dude just started going to town on it with a rotary saw to cut it open it was interesting but made my knee feel weird had a similar experience holding a brain as well
i am jack s medulla oblongata i am jill s nipple i am jack s colon i am jack s raging bile duct i am jack s cold sweat i am jack s complete lack of surprise i am jack s inflamed sense of rejection i am jack s smirking revenge i am jack s broken heart
that s one way to let your nuts hang
is it a good idea to give stray dogs a taste of human flesh but i guess you are joking
you can become a one armed bandit though
deleted
you are under arrest haha and what for legged robbery huzaa how bout now ey
dad is that you
this is what i ll do if i ever have an amputation i m super curious as to how human meat tastes
wait you can lose a foot from breaking your ankle new fear unlocked walking
i d love the link to this post comment if anyone has it
r holup
oh where s that post at such a good read
the bbq option was illegal
when having a foot in the grave is actually true
i m going to go out on a limb and assume you don t like cemeteries in general for the same principle
the space the burial site is inhabiting will be annihilated when our star the sun moves into the next phase of its lifecycle and becomes a red giant star at this point the sun will obliterate earth destroying it instantly if you keep all of this in mind then it s easy not to worry about a bit of grass having some limbs in it
what s a better use of space
bury it in your backyard in the flower patch or something so when the next homeowner digs it up it will lead everyone on a pointless wild goose chase
that hand will never grow old
thanks for this informed response as someone who actually has this decision to make after a major trauma and infection and now of movement can t put a shoe on and pain
wtf
that s also what i was thinking i m surprised it s not one of the options he mentions the uk maybe it s not legal there i wonder about in the us
i m in the us and donated my heart to science i don t know if it is still around but it was for a bit at least
love a silly dad joke
ah yes the gecko approach
i ashamedly thought the same thing
they d probably have seen the fact you re missing the same appendage and so would a detective i freakin hope
i would think once you take it home you can do what you want
sounds like you are suggesting sending them to a medical school for hands on learning that seems like a good option
there were no lights in the nose or tail this was before led zeppelin
they consider this to be the first skyscraper
building looks like it has rocket boosters is this brutalism
there was a plan to put a docking station atop this building but it didn t work out alas the stairway to heaven proved to be impractical
then they are wrong
i visited that building on a trip and that s what they claimed
incredibly in i was housemates with a person who was taking a university computer science course which was still using punch cards
she s got that do you fucking see this shit yeah this is my goddamn job look on her face someone get this woman some flash storage and a drink
one card out of order or missing and you re fucked
i wish i had even a basic understanding of how the idea of computers and the internet came to be or were even imagined
my phone uses more memory to show me how much memory it has in space less than a hand full of those cards
nowadays i can fart mb
it always amazes me how far we ve come now you can be sitting on the toilet at 3am modifying code to be executed immediately on a remote system halfway around the globe via remote access from a device smaller than a dozen of those punch cards
my mom would bring home boxes of old punch cards would use them for crafts and put them in salad shredder for kitty litter salad shredders back then were strong
bro i got mad when a 1gb mobile game took minutes to download this made me realize how spoiled i am lol
my dad used to take me to the office on weekends to help feed the cards into the reader
we need a time machine and a thumb drive heads would explode
pretty sure the picture is close to megabytes wild how fast technology moves
do not fold spindle or mutilate
just imagine who had to type those cards a if there is a typo the entire batch got kicked out and then you needed to find that typo i remember that back in the seventies
did she code in asm assembler cobol common business oriented language fortran formula translator ada named for ada countess lovelace the first programmer or some proprietary scripting language meanwhile the pic shows enough punchcards to de orbit a satellite what is her secret mission
wow that s crazy
not that long ago
one sneeze
that s a lot of work to listen to a single beatles mp3
i remember punching up those cards
abacus
i took a photo today that was 5mb
probably analog to train big data today
wanna play a game
high speed optic readers were eventually developed a lot faster than the original mechanical ones
i saw a 256gb pen drive today in a food store at the till was literally thinking wow gb in that and how a flopy disc has not even a megabite technology is amazing
wrong file load the other one
yea and we put a man on the the moon years later laughable
i wonder how gigabyte it could handle
and years later men landed a spaceship on the moon sounds right
wow those were the good old days that s for sure fun memories of dropping a deck and trying to get it all back in the correct order
you sure don t want to drop that deck and get them out of order
still better than windows at least there was a definable order to things
it would take about billion and million punched cards to have red dead redemption uwu
incredibly in recent decades and later some operating systems for micro mini and mainframe computers still supported punch card peripherals nothing ever dies nothing ever dies the tale is foretold of a s cobol programmer going into suspended animation for millennia but roused in ad to de fang the upcoming y3k bug
yep i was using punch cards when i started college in by the time i graduated in we had progressed to magnetic tape lol
she s a badass and she knows it
have a look into the work alan turing did if you re interested his work is generally considered to be the basis for modern computer science
my brain used all it s memory trying to process this sentence of yours
yea it s crazy how we can store gb on a tiny tiny card compared to even one punch card and only for now
imagine loading a game from a cassette tape s
this thought experiment always fascinated me how impressive is our tech when we take it and travel back in time how much can it actually do without all the infrastructure we have built around it and take for granted this phone can access all the worlds information and communicate to everyone instantly sweet can you show huh no signal this thumb drive can hold gb how do you access it got a usb what s usb this slate called a tv can show moving images and reproduce voices and sounds let me just plug into wait solely depends on where we travel to and how much of the supporting tech already exists and tech of the time needs to be advanced enough for people to understand the general concept of course you can take a current laptop and load it with as much data as possible before going back in time and then play some games or hd video until the battery runs out that d probably be impressive
was curious its 176kb after jpg compression ie that pile is a little more than of these photos
de orbiting an apollo service module
should be year for y10k
i will thank you
he did the math fair hahah i m on mobile and didn t check tbh just judged by a full size iphone photo at 3mb so i was guesstimating
was it occupied
just watch circa y10k humans will still be coding in cobol pascal and fortran the immortals
happy cake day and fortran will always ruleemote free _emotes _pack sunglasses
but stay away from pl1 trust me
people are putting locks on these and claiming them all around the city
those won t be used improperly
context of the pods the creators have stressed that the capsules aren t an alternative to staying in proper overnight accommodation especially as the city of ulm can reach very low temperatures the sleep pods have also been fitted with solar panels and they even come complete with enough room to house users belongings and a furry friend there are no cameras in the pods to protect people s privacy however when the doors are opened this triggers a motion sensor which lets social workers who check the pods know they ve been used so they can get them cleaned and so they can also provide help to those who might need it in other places these would be rentable germans are efficient they will crush orphans with their pets at the same time
if that was san francisco it would be filled to brim with human feces and used syringes
items like this are well meaning but doomed to fail because some of the people using them will ruin it for the rest of them
public sex pods
somethings should also be done about the homeless people
if i walked past this in a late night sloshed state i d assume it s some crashed cryotube jettisoned from an ailing spaceship somewhere
dirty mike and the boys going to have a party in there
bandaids aren t the solution to a to a bullet wound
where is the sleeping pod all i see is a toilet
i can smell it from here
i would personally pay to have several installed in my city but they d just shit in them
so we re calling homeless people houseless people now why buck a trend we all know and use for a term nobody uses to describe homeless people a home isn t just a house it can be an apartment a mobile home a condo a house an immaculate and massive rv etc just say homeless as it encompasses all of those terms by your term i m houseless too but not homeless bc i don t live in a house
listen folks homeless people like a nice tan just like the rest of us
thanks for the fuck shack dirty mike and the boys
those would be destroyed in a week if installed in san francisco or portland
after a month the smell in there would be something to behold
baltimore first night destroyed or stolen
where i live this thing would be destroyed and buried in a pile of spent syringes
i hope they re post in a couple years to show us how homeless people have destroyed or otherwise rendered them useless homelessness isn t simply about finding a home for people without one if it were we d have solved this problem centuries ago
drug pod
great idea until hipsters want them to live cheap
oh look they left a note thanks for the f shack love dirty mike and the boys
piss pods
great way to get homeless people to literally shank each other
thanks for the f shack dirty mike and the boys
seems kinda creepy but if i were homeless i d take it
let the hobo wars begin
thanks for the fuck shack signed dirty mike and the boys
well damn i ve been homeless before but houseless that s some messed up shit y all
wait until they stab each other for them
the homeless will be fighting over them the mentally ill homeless won t go to them so what s the benefit
its always the same story cities implement pragmatic and rational homeless facilities that if used correctly will benefit the homeless but homeless people don t behave rationally the most violent and emotionally unstable homeless people are at the top of the homeless hierarchy they claim the pods install locks on them and then fill them with trash and biological waste then when another crazy homeless person tries to claim the pod and fails they will usually resort to damaging destroying the pod so that their competitor can t use it and all the sane peaceful homeless people that are just down on their luck and don t have emotional issues they will never see the inside of one of these pods unless they want to risk being murdered
you meant sex cabin
i m not trusting any kind of pod chamber in germany
wow i wonder what it s like to live in a humane country with lawmakers that actually do things to help people  _
at least they are trying
god forbid the town or district provides them an actual home
be nice until the homeless destroy them and shit all up in and over them
houseless every motherfcker living in the city is houseless you dopes
that s a dog house
you mean an injection and sex pod
oh that s gonna be a great look plus all the needles and piles of excrement
this is old news any updates on how their intended use is working
thanks for the f shack dirty mike and the boys
jokes aside it s frustrating that there isn t enough help for people who actually need it
cool now get them out of it
my towns homeless peeps would have these destroyed in days
meanwhile in new york we just got new spikes installed on our benches to stop people from laying down on them
drug and sex pods now
in just one week you ll see a nice attempt to help the less fortunate turn into a literal porto potty because they don t want to help themselves
the smell
what s the difference between houseless and homeless other than creating a new term that you deem less offensive is it not just a virtue signal
in the united states we called those rape pods
the word is homeless and it s not derogatory the people who see it as a derogatory term to hop on the euphemism treadmill are the problem they re the ones looking down on others in hopes they can create a cure to a nonexistent problem cut the bullshit because you re not fooling anyone with this crap
link to source would like to read more about it
nice
dauert nicht lange dann sind da benutzte spritzen leute die nicht mehr raus wollen alkohol kotze jemand scheit rein das ding wird nachts angezndet mit oder ohne inhalt
ooooh that smell the smell that surrounds you
don t get me wrong i love my family but this has a certain appeal
homeless sex pod
the final solution to homelessness
they ll be selling those soon as houses
what could possibly go wrong
opium den
dirty mike and the boys
would be listed on zillow in the us for
how long till they re sticky inside
das ist meine felsen unga bunga
better idea build homes and give them ownership so people have home security then can worry about a job rather where they will sleep that night
great idea on paper but in practice terribly executed and extremely naive of the city s authorities to think that these pods would work
who s gunna clean out the fecal and pee
these are a great idea until they get destroyed after one day
i wonder if they clean them i imagine they must get pretty smelly
on the new season of bum wars
masturbation stations for the homeless
i suppose that city isn t dealing with the drug homeless problem that many american cities are because this thing would have an od d body in it within a week
yes build these shits for the hobos so they can survive at least
in pooland cough cough excuse me portland the homeless would do two things to that one would be a place to hold up and do drugs followed be vandalizing and trashing it then move on todo the same to the next
wouldn t it be better to do something to help people not be homeless anymore
i can assure you people are fucking and using drugs in these
these ruin the public space for everyone terrible idea
ah yes heroin injection pods no way that these won t be used inappropriately
they gonna get super high in these space pods
the final solution for homelessness
love germany excellent engineering
and in my county in alabama they offer the homeless a choice accept a bus ticket and leave the county or go to jail i wish i was joking
if homeless people gets to keep one for themselves they will keep it as clean and as livable as possible homeless people aren t all addicts and drunkards some are just down on their luck
plot twist they re euthanasia chambers
a lot of you are reacting like these were put in california germany has a different mentality all together regarding homelessness most likely they will help people more than hurt them
i feel like your just asking for a homeless territory war over the heated pods i hope the areas are in a monitored location at least
seems the majority of people on this post have never actually been homeless
it won t last i was homeless for a while and there was a guy who owned a house but didn t live in it he kept it open for homeless people to stay in if they needed a place to go btw i was homeless in ohio right on lake erie so winters were absolutely freezing i stayed in that house one night and it was awful people tore that house apart they broke windows they shit and pissed everywhere garbage all over the place really sad cause it could have been a nice place to go it had a fireplace for when nights got truly cold and unbearable there was also this abandoned nursing home that a lot of homeless stayed at i stayed there the most cause not too many people came in and there was two stories and the upper floor wasn t as bad as the lower they still had beds and blankets and stuff in there only thing was you never knew who was going to come in i knew a few regulars that stayed there but it was pretty empty and it would be really easy to get murdered there but when you have feet of snow outside you really don t care as long as you can keep warm
i d hate to be the poor bastard that gets to clean these things as part of his or her court order community service
another great in theory terrible practically idea
sleeping pod oh you mean fuck dens
ah yes that ll solve the problem
meanwhile in the us we installed park benches that you can t sleep on or sit comfortably on
enjoy cleaning the shit and needles lmfaoooo
trap wont shut fully and seal on the worm it will probably turn black and die or maybe work one last time before dying looks cool on paper but no flytrap will ever be able to handle a earthworm if any at all it would be the b flytraps
i m thinking that worm likely got out we didn t see them get digested i ve seen vids of inverts like slugs climbing out they re squishy
still trying to figure out how the whole digestion thing works
that s actually gonna kill that flytrap head if they don t seal the head will die off
everything reminds me of her
i had a venus fly trap once wouldn t hurt a fly
r notmeanttobedirtystilldirty
yea work just went back in for the cuddles honestly
was thinking the same thing
enzymes and chemicals digest the insect the plant absorbs the nutrient solution and eats all the macro and micro nutrients
ha
thank you science side of reddit
no thank you
im surprised no one mentioned any of the chinese civil wars or conflicts they have the highest body counts so it follows that they would be noted in this list edit id love to see these calculations because the math seems more than a bit dubious
ghengis khan
the barbary pirates were an extension of the ottoman empire and caused great strife from the mediterranean to the european coastlines they were some of the most brutal and widespread slavers thieves and mercenaries of their time and caused great strife for hundreds of years
definitely an unbiased assessment s
what about the taiping rebellion or an lushan rebellion sure they re pretty wacky but like million people died in each of those wars
i thought it was the mongol invasions i think i read they killed about one fourth of the estimated human population at that time and a significant population of asians had ghengis dna markers
i have a hard time believing there were million native north americans to wipe out
it would be weird seeing india claim to be a world power and also a constant victim every other country takes advantage of if it wasn t the same lie far right nationalists have been repeating for centuries all over the globe
coppertone messiah will trump the list when it s all said and done
when i read the title of the post my mind already went to the european colonial era before i listened to him because it wasn t just the body count it was also the theft of national wealth and resources from the colonized peoples that has impoverished much of the world for many generations modern people always whine about the united states but that truly doesn t come close to what england france and spain have done in history
just say christianity
it s easy christianity to be honest all religion not only physical damage but intellectual too
where did you come up with million native americans i doubt there were ever million native americans in all of history there certainly was no record keeping or census and the vast majority had no written language so this sort of math throws a lot of skepticism at the overall statements made as an interesting note the muslims in jerusalem were themselves invaders and can t really be considered victims so much as competitors
emperor constantine for converting the roman empire to christianity
that his biased research million lol the muslims were in india for more than years they still have their religion language and culture suti devadasi s has harmed india more than anything do a google search about them same the portuguese and british
define the world first
million indians over centuries means killing about indians everyday for years straight are there any sources for what he is saying
thomas midgley jr dude has killed millions fucked up billions we are still dealing with this assholes effects today he knew lead in the air was going to fuck people up but hid the effects even when he was recovering from them this shit has knocked the collective brain power of generations permanently
mongol empire is the top for sure the dude killed so many people the planet went into an ice age
either jesus or the people who invented him
i m in agreement genghis khan should be on the list and it seems a huge oversight to leave him off the list these numbers seem to be merely assumptions at best and not supported by generally accepted calculations
he seems to have interpreted answered the question of who caused the most harm to his home country of india as opposed to the world very indian centric answer
this is purely speculation but i think they were left off the list because the damage was localized and not as widespread as european colonization for example
who
there are records of them going as far north as iceland and taking slaves the us fought a war during the jefferson administration where we basically went to tunisia and libya and bombarded costal cities until they agreed to stop their piracy
i mean when you bring things to a global scale everyone is biased lol
that larger estimate is for all of the americas central and south america were more heavily populated
well that s the funny part now we in the states are the english french and spanish cept for the large part of our population involuntarily stolen from their countries and brought here as slaves but yeah we didn t start the fire we are just that fire growing
i believe the larger estimates above million are talking about all of the americas including central and south america the caribbean etc the general consensus for that is around million but yes some researchers and historians think the total pre columbian population was million or more in america though the estimates range from just million to million
don t you think the greater question should be why and how did islam reach india and south east asia
the guy is very biased read this https://www.quora.com/why-did-ottomans-never-try-to-invade-india-during-the-rule-of-the-mughals/answer/ahmad-abubakr-%d8%a7%d8%ad%d9%85%d8%af-%d8%a7%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%a8%da%a9%d8%b1?ch=17&oid=238427824&share=b80aef9d&srid=hipjrr&target_type=answer
except americans didn t go steal people out of their homes in africa to bring them here as slaves other africans enslaved africans and sold them to others as slaves the turks invaded africa at one point and enslaved many as well parts of africa to this day are still under europe s colonization what part of africa is under us colonization i would be very interested to know what large part of our population was involuntarily stolen there have been no slaves in the united states for a hot minute i find it odd that people only want to single out the us for a portion of histories as if we are satan every country in the world has been involved with slavery at one time or another that is simply history
assumption of million killed would then be erroneous because that implies all indigenous people from the arctic to tierra del fuego were wiped out
mass conversion there wasn t forced conversion if you are trying to bring it up
it is worth noting the slave trade was made illegal in the uk france and spain long before the us the ottomans didn t so much as invade africa but claimed the mantle of the caliphate and thus demure sovereignty over large parts of arabic and islamic n africa and as a of world population more europeans were traded or conquered or enslaved to the arabic world than africans traded and enslaved to european colonies bottom line is slavery is bad and the slave trade is bad every culture and ethnicity has practiced this abhorrent practice at one point or another in its history whether it is the flower wars and slavery in central america slavery in the middle east the thrall system in the nordic countries the triangle trade in western europe or the serf system in eastern europe and russia the reason that the triangle trade and western european slave trade is mentioned most often and most heineously is thay the damage to lives and livelihoods is arguably the most recent and most documented as afterall history is unfortunately written by the victors in that sense i mean it nowadays as economically ps little drunk at the moment so willing to elaborate or explain more later and apologies if any of the above seems obtuse or if i have missed anything glaring just felt a need to expand on this somewhat pps most damaging thing pertinent to the video as a of humanity is either ghengis khan and the mongol invasions empire or any of the many chinese civil wars due to population disparities between china and the rest of the world
i mean i didn t say americans stole the africans but otherwise i agree with what you say here
hopefully you ll make a podcast about the rape culture and the toilette problem in india aswell
i m drunk myself lol you ve explained in more detail what i was referring to in that every country in the world has been involved in slavery at some point in their histories whether it be china asia greeks romans turks europeans united states etc i would also argue that mercantilism triangle trade is not the most recent example because people in africa are still being enslaved by other africans and china is enslaving a large portion of its muslim community the us is the most familiar because we have politicians that constantly use the history of slavery in our nation as a wedge issue for election purposes i just find it disingenuous when people want to attack the us as if we are the only country in the world that participated in slavery at some point in history and are somehow more evil than anyone else for it there are still racial issues in the us but i d argue that racism is significantly less today than before the 1960s and slavery has long since been outlawed as it should have been
i do think it worth noting regarding america the blame in my mind as a brit with an american extended family is that the blame tends to be directed at america because of the civil war and then segregation the former is frankly almost within living memory in the grand scheme of things and the latter definitely so yet when that is compared to what the typical continental european sees western europe outlawed banned it sooner throughout the french empire though the process began as early as and in the british empire though again began earlier arguably as early as in the british instance it was illegal to trade slaves within the empire though did not ban slavery with the act a british merchant could still purchase slaves from a west african port and sell them in the americas caribbean however in the same year and in fact month the us banned the importation of slaves the entire situation is muddied by legislation that applied to home territories and colonies differently throughout all of the european overseas empires and also a period of almost unrivaled free trade due to the difficulty of applying customs excise duties and tariffs that lasted until the 1st world war the issue is often that despite the arabic world primarily the ottoman empire engaging in the slave trade with west africa to an extent around greater in volume than the western world estimated million africans traded from west central africa to the arabic world compared to the million in the atlantic slave trade over a longer time span ending later and starting earlier than both internal us slavery and anglo american and european trade this is also not including the 10m european russian persian and indian slaves bought and sold within the same part of the world with all of that information in mind economically due to the way world industrialization panned out and globalization of the world economy what is now seen as quote on quotes first world was built on slavery yet at the time the economies truly being built upon slavery stagnated and now are not in equivalent positions blame is put on the doorstep of the winners not the losers in this geo political economic charade i have always maintained and argued slavery ended earlier in w europe and the n states of the us earlier because it was no longer as economically valid this of course in no way detracts from the hardship loss of life and wealth stolen from those people but it should never be viewed in excuse the pun black and white
he could echo locate like a bat i think that makes him the only real batman
how could someone play video games on a tv screen using echo location as per the article someone explain this to me please because to my humble understanding any form of echo location would only signal back that there is a physical obstacle the tv in front of them and not what s going on the screen
i remember this dude nailing jumpers in his driveway he could see the rim you d think an artificial device for this would have been developed by now
i remember watching a news story about ben he was incredible i m so sad to hear that cancer took him
hey man youre blind all good i learned to echo locate i can do almost anything that all you got
is that chamillionaire
i tried to help a blind woman cross the street once because we had the right of way and she hadn t taken a step she was veryy irritated and yelled at me for interrupting her listening
didn t see that coming
i remember him being on oprah with his mother aquanetta

read about him sad to hear hes gone
mf was a clicker before the game invented it
wtf cancer you killed a superhero
shit i hope he had some kids before he died
once i was a waiter in a restaurant in pittsburgh it was a neighborhood italian place in the little italy bloomfield there were two older twins that we both blind that would come in usually not together i was collecting the bill one lunch service he was alone i told him the amount due he had folded bills that he gave me the amount he gave me was less than the bill due so i awkwardly stood there after he gave me less than i needed because i was young and didn t want to seem rude after awhile he knocked his knuckles hard against thick pine table he sitting at and could hear that i was still there
more about ben underwood https://www.thepositiveencourager.global/ben-underwood-seeing-without-eyes/)!
original a train
took away his eyes gave him daredevil power then took away his life with cancer i wanna speak to the manager of life my fists wanna have words
superhero wtf is this shit
the sound he made almost constantly would drive me insane use a cane like the rest of my vision impaired friends yes i have adhd
echolocation is not seeing
you could say that cancer was his kryptonite
echo location is daredevils power no
i don t know if this necessarily applies but 3d sound spatialization is common now like in darktide i ll hear the zombies behind me letting me know i d better turn quick and hit them doom has a mod for sight impaired people there was a blind guy in world of warcraft who had a friend help him along too doing actions based on lua plugins that would play audio based on certain npc actions
i saw it in a short news segment on him i don t know how good he was or how he did it but he played he made a clicking noise that bounced off walls to navigate i m gonna look for video edit found it https://youtu.be/r9mvrrwu5gw
sound on muscle memory and timing dying a lot trying to figure out where everything is
there was one of those dumb detective shows that had a guy that did just that with some little device maybe bones castle idk it s probably not real but the concept has definitely been thought out
daredevil has high sensitivity not echo location for echo location you need to make a noise first
cochlear implants are so good now too i guess
daredevil has echolocation too it s not a special power humans have the ability to develop this skill but he had training and exhorted and honed that skill to be top notch daredevil is basically blind batman
daredevil uses the sound of the world as echolocation kind of like permanent echolocation
oh didn t know he did sorry well now i know daredevil is quite literally batman cause he is blind and uses echolocation and stuff
he looks pretty pissed off that there s a camera there and those paws
you can t defeat me you you re just a big fat panda

true definition of a hero
that s a man
he looks like that guy from the green mile
coincidentally my home caught fire this past christmas eve and i got to take a step in this mans shoes or lack of shoes as i was barefoot as well now i always knew that if there were to be a fire at my house and i was home that thing s would get really difficult for me because i would be the one responsible for ensuring the safety of everyone and on this particular night things happened to just get worse not better at the time my mother and sister were out and it was me my blind year old grandma my year old handicap dad my dogs my sisters dogs and my sugar gliders i learned a lot that night about the realities of a fire in a home that really makes you look at things differently first off the fire went from small to big in a matter of seconds from the time i first got the smell of smoke until everyone was out and you couldn t go back inside without protective equipment was minutes i felt like i would have longer to get everyone out but nope the smoke was hot and suffocating and overtook the house what felt like almost instantly first things first was get grandma out while yelling for handicap dad to get the fuck out of the house he can walk but if someone needed to be drug out yeah not happening from there it was get my dogs out which wasn t the worst luckily because they listened i had to grab my sisters dog from under a bed which sucked because it took a bit longer and then as i went in for the last dog a puppy in a kennel my old dog tried to go back inside which resulted in me grabbing him by his tail and yanking back then dragging said kennel outside the gliders were the hardest because scared and hiding mixed with the fact that i was trying to rush because i couldn t breathe and my lungs felt on fire meant i had a hard time removing their bag from their enclosure luckily everyone got out ok and no one was seriously injured now that is a house fire that started small i knew who was in the house i knew the layout i had a personal connection to every living thing in the house and it still sucked this man is part of a much more volatile situation in a vehicle he doesn t know the exact layout of doesn t know how many are inside and doesn t have a personal connection with yet he still saved people and while yeah it sucked that my lungs hurt this bad ass mother fucker is missing skin that was literally burned off man is a complete and utter badass on a level i don t think i could ever reach the point of my story isn t to say oh we are the same because we aren t and i m not sure i could have done what he did the point of the story is to say i have been in a similar but not as intense of a situation and from what i went through it really puts into perspective at just how heroic this guys actions are this man put his life on the line and felt like he was dying just to save a few more lives he should be able to retire today with the same pension plan as a senator as far as i am concerned
damn it took all of mr t s hair
the legs chad
his leg got the worst of it
unequivocally courageous
what an incredible person
not all heroes wear capes or shoes but this man he wears a tank top

thankfully he did it all before the police showed up to shoot him for with being black as evidence starting the fire
i love ving rames
this guy deserves a world of blessings for everyone reading this i hope that you take after his courage and also choose to save lives
adrenaline goes crazy but he s gonna be feeling that tomorrow next week few months
brave
huell
is that john coffey
god bless heroes like this most people want a tiktok short
yah think a guy d dress for the occasion
hero
reddit was only showing top half of this photo so i was about to comment now all he needs to do is walk through a red neck neigborhood wearing a i hate crackers sign around his neck to find a clue about the culprits but after opening the post i changed my mind to someone take him to the er asap
i couldn t find extensive english language sources but i did find this https://zambianobserver.com/meet-sirizani-butau-the-hero-of-the-day-when-the-fuel-tanker-and-the-beta-bus-collided/
an absolute hero god bless him
that dude radiates chad energy
marcellus wallace pulling folks from the fire
green mile vibes
mad it looks like he paid the price he got burned up
not all heroes wear capes
he strikes me as a black bryce willis
that fire was a preexisting condition claim denied
thankfully it looks like this badass doesn t live in america
murica
get this man some shoes
no capes remember what edna said
call a sculpture this needs to be a statue
get him a movie franchise
thank you with so much being said about this man i was wondering his name
i was just thinking the same thing
this man needs some coffey
should have seen the fire
probably somewhere he can t even get to a hospital that will drown him in debt
and socks
hello michelangelo s david we need you to make a statue
and skin grafts
and skin whitening cream
it s a wireless bird charger
it s a huge fine in arizona to hurt that cactus species they re protected a golfer filmed himself intentionally hitting balls at one of those and got a 20k fine so makes perfect sense to make it look like something that s heavily regulated to damage
oh god please don t show this to the conspiracy theorists they re already paranoid enough
i posted this on midlyinteresting forgetting that sub had to be oc only so posting it here
nice try coyote i can see the anvil and tnt from here
douglas firs in parts of oregon
the 5g people are gonna love this
it s coconut trees in nevada nevada is a desert
this only works in arizona and small areas of mexico
there s one across the street from me florida usa disguised as a pine tree it doesn t fool anyone but it is more aesthetically pleasing than a plain tower the woodpeckers love it because when they hit it the sound carries quite far i think that helps in mating
very cool
pine trees in montana
digital peyote
spicy cactus
since when is a cell tower only like feet tall seems more along the lines of disguising security cameras around area although for the record i would love to see an actual cell tower disguised as a foot tall cactus
that s a super short cell tower the range must be awful which means they must need these things all over the place
i got 5g once and now im a communist hippy liberal elite atifa athiest
nothin to see here they are also disguised as rocks signs windmills steeples barns houses palm trees eucalyptus trees pine trees flag poles radar towers chimneys water towers etc they are everywhere
they disguise them as palm trees in the middle east
but why

imagine thousands of years down the road and that s still there and some new intelligent species is foraging in the desert and they cut open that cactus and discover 5g
they call it a communications condom
oh god please don t show this to the conspiracy theorists they re already paranoid enough this honestly fits pretty well with the birds aren t real theory
i m enjoying watching their heads explode
why do you think we have to hide these towers in cacti
are you telling us you got a prickly reception from mildlyinteresting
northeast too but they always stick out and are quite obvious
yep
i don t know where this one is at exactly but i ve seen a handful that look just like it in scottsdale and carefree az
they have a few pine tree ones in az too look really really stupid and out of place these just look like a fake cactus lol
if an area is flat feet is all you need it s getting beyond hills that requires taller towers
az is super flat in the valley you don t need it tall
you only need tall if there are obstructions you need to get over if you are in a flat area a ft taller will easily cover miles
why do you think arizona has a hell of a lot of cactus hahaha
well with enough of these installed all your heads will be exploding too
surround it in pricks to disguise it from the p eople who have differing opinions to myself but whom i still respect
here in california up in the sierra nevada too they re much nicer to look at than the steel ones
same thing where i live in california since many of the actual pines died in drought they feel even more out of place
i think this might be fore traffic cameras because the ones i ve seen have holes for cameras and are pointed at the street did you take this picture because i have a guess as to where it is
i have a stylish tinfoil hat
sure bud
so pricks get pricked
if you don t believe me it s because the 5g and chemtrails have already gotten to you sorry bud
yo i was looking through his records he just came from denver international airport he is one of them
sure bud
i m glad you see eye to eye with me on this
the first shark cages were pioneered back in the 1960s by shark attack survivor rodney fox after stitches put him back together rodney was watching the lions in adelaide zoo and got the idea that maybe we could be inside a cage instead of the animals to view sharks in their natural environment a man sitting in a tiny boat made of sugar glass probably wasn t what he had in mind though hard to believe but that clip is real and was done as part of a shark week program that somehow gave it the green light that guy jimi partington https://www.trackingsharks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jimi_parrington_great_white_serial_killer_lives-3.jpg), previously had a close shave or two patting great whites on the snout but apparently suffered from ptsd following that near miss https://www.thesharkfiles.com/dive-into-white-lightning) in the video risky business and unlike other projects these actions seem for entertainment or thrills more than for the benefit of shark scientific research or conservation
why in the world are you in a ziploc bag in the ocean
lol might as well have just used a walmart bag
anyone who s seen a hockey game knows that the plexiglass can break at any time it usually is robust and lasts for years but occasionally it will break following a hard shot or a bump not sure if this shark box shattered or broke along the seams but you d have to be an idiot to think it couldn t fail waiting for those crocodile box swimmers in australia to get eaten when one of those glass tubes break
he should have worn the brown diver s suit
i ve seen this before on reddit and all i can think while i watch this is what a dumbarse it s even worse with audio he and the team come across as a bunch of goofs playing around with shit they don t understand or respect i mean look at his fucking toy box you can tell they didn t trial it didn t think to plan for what would happen if it tipped nothing it s just pure dumbarse cowboy shit and frankly it does a disservice to shark week if this is the calibre of the muppets involved embarrassing
why is he dressed as a seal in the first place
cardboard box might be better next time
i ve seen the documentary this is taken from the show runners and producers kept assuring this guy that it was safe even after many objections i believe this is an important distinction as the people that were trying to make the content all but forced this guy into a shitty situation
i m wondering if this was acrylic versus polycarbonate cause i doubt poly would break like a saltine like that
do now there s shards of perspex floating around the ocean and some stuck in some poor sharks eyeballs
guy goes in a box box goes in the water shark s in the water we knew this was a bad idea years ago https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/e2e67234-3974-4185-81f1-60029f3bf455)!
further they might want to hire an engineer next time instead of using a prop guy s
it s almost like the great white shark is an apex predator and that guy was in the water
so he dressed like a seal in an invisible box what an absolute moron
well he found out
i have two rules in life wipe backwards don t fuck with the ocean
doesn t take a genius to know this plastic box ain t gonna do shit how did these clowns make it past elementary school
if you watch the shark week episode he got massive ptsd from this and had a stroke he survived next time he did force himself to go diving again
r terrifyingasfuck
ok guys back to the drawing board

poor shark dumb humans
r damnthatsfuckingstupid

that s a huge great white
play stupid game win stupid prize
this guy found out that the shark s name is phuccarownd
what an absolute idiot
that s what happens when ya do stupid shit like climbing mountains swimming with sharks skydiving
that s a hell of a way to win a darwin award a thin transparent box so a ton predator won t know it s there good idea
for those not familiar perspex it is similar to plexiglass it breaks
funny how i see this right after hearing this video on the bob and tom show on the radio this morning https://youtu.be/bov0t-rifuw
duuuumb ways to dieee
how many of these dumbfuck docs do we need sure it most likely won t attack you on your little beach day but get shipwrecked out in open water you going to be chum sooner or later
can it really be called an attack when they bait the fucking thing
the dumb shit people do
bring yourself in a turperware for your beloved sharky how lovely
the main reason why the ocean is so scary you re in the domain of predators that can come out of nowhere gif emote free_emotes_pack no_mouth
play stupid games win stupid prizes was probability unpleasant for the share as it obviously didn t see the box fucking idiots
just needs some flextape
like what a fucking dumbass to think he was protected in that flimsy piece of crap
perspex looks like a fish tank to me
you live by the sword you die by the sword
what would win an 800kg shark travelling at speed vs some plastic paney boi
feel bad for the shark should have had a meal
how much force was that that s a crazy vid
i m kinda upset that this fuckin idiot likely fed this big beautiful shark shards of plastic not too mention it almost ate a chunk of fuckin idiot
the guy obviously needs a bigger boat
shark what box
the more you fuck around the more you re gonna find out
we almost got a perfect real life jaws video nothing like the detail has or would ever be filmed again
what could possibly go wrong putting yourself in the equivalent of a salt shaker for sharks
you go in the cage cage goes in the water you go in the water shark s in the water our shark
is the shark ok
imagine signing up to be shark bait
next week man with toe in a match box loses arm to bull shark
you go in the cage cage goes in the water shark s in the water our shark farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies

it s literally a horror movie
some context https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwcygqmbd04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwcygqmbd04) the level of stupid here is mind boggling
the box it does nothing
behave like lunch become lunch

no one could have predicted this
i guess he forgot to put out the sign that says please do not tap on glass
was the shark hurt
shark cage guy so i can do it with impact resistant plexiglass it ll withstand a shark attack for several minutes producer awesome how much scg tax producer any way you can do it cheaper scg i can make it out of  window glass for producer i ll take it
well you are just floatin around lookin like a wrapped up twinkie ready to snack on
they always do a scary swim by before they eat you for the same you reason you devein shrimp before you eat them
to the shark the guy probably just looked like a seal floating on the surface eg dinner i don t think a perspex box does much more than make whatever is in it look like a canape
amazing shot bruh some prospective i used to free dive up til had an leg injury plus some major health scares plus pandemic living still recovering but haven t been in water of any kind in almost years i ll take death by shark any day then death by heart attack in my bed i m glad you re doing what you love to do just keep swimming shaka
where did i put my bag of nopes
do sharks come on land and fuck with us lmao no
interesting he sat in the middle of a school of fish in a plastic box to attract the sharks makes sense he almost became shark snack shark went after the biggest meaty object
sharks can break the big metal bar cages people go in this guy knows that he also knows he s breakfast if the shark actually wants him snarky was just curious
the cage kinda work the initial impact slowed the shark down and made it slightly miss
lucky guy shark s tooth didn t hook any part of his flesh
for the people saying great white sharks are not aggressive or attack eat humans please send them this video as example
this is why i am a killer whale supremacist fukkk great white sharks and all sharks steal their livers
r praisethecameraman
that would have been a cool way to die
too bad he didn t get him people who play in the ocean deserve to be eaten by the things that eat people and live there
very lucky man he should ve bought a lotto ticket after that
the goose put it in upside down
i mean he didn t die so it was technically a success
awesome footage
the moment you realize the game pass is worth buying
phill swift here and today i had a shark eat this boat
out here looking like a snack
i guess they just had to throw that suit away
wow that would be my last experiment
r thalassophobia
he just wanted a kiss

if that was me that water would be a lot browner absolutely terrifying but so interesting to see how powerful those creatures are i m glad he s okay
should have tied a ribbon and bow around that gift box
seemed like a great idea at the time
leave those sharks alone
he was just annoyed at people throwing trash in the ocean
the first degree program for computer science didn t exist until at cambridge and the first program in the states was at purdue in before that and still in many places for a while after that your degree program would ve been computational mathematics computer was also a job title for a while
is she the mother superior of the coneheads
she was also the second person ever having been beaten out by a guy at washu who received his phd earlier the same day https://onwisconsin.uwalumni.com/on-alumnae-mary-kenneth-keller/
here s the training manual for the fabri tek bi tran six computer sitting in front of her https://archive.org/details/tnm_computer_education_bi-tran_six_-_fabri-tek_20171010_0075/mode/1up
my high school trigonometry teacher was a nun and actually held a phd in mathematics she was an amazing teacher and probably one of the most intelligent people i ve ever met it s crazy how educated she became and stayed in the most low key humble environment you could think of to counter that she was also into the old school punishments for misbehavior holding up books with your arms outstretched banishment to the closet knuckle busting with a ruler all the classics kept us honest
wow surprised at the lack of kudos for this lady in the comments she definitely worked hard and defied expectations especially as a woman in that time to say nothing of her religious affiliations
reddit complains about islamophobia antiemetism bigotry of all sorts but a woman gets a computer science degree and happens to be christian and they mock her mercilessly double standards
go mary
es but being a conehead she had been exposed to advanced technology at an early age
the only way i could have ever gotten a phd in comp sci would have been with divine intervention
fortran sister
how d she pay for school serious question no paying job life devoted to the service to christ vow of poverty and all
serious question is her head actually a cone like that
she looks like a cone head from saturday night live
but more importantly what s up with that head unit
christ sent me to learn this who could say no
nun unit
the motherboard
ohhh so the nuns from those emails needing donations were real
i probably could understand assembler if i could learn off this computer and see what everything is and how it all interacts with each other
she was on a mission from god or maybe that was elwood jake my bad
for a second i thought it said helen keller and i was like how the fuck
go sister
i think this lady hit my knuckles with a ruler when i was in catholic school
nice forehead there sister
of course the computer nerd is a virgin
she looks like a kenneth
a nun who mastered computer science interesting
how can she understand logic yet still believe in fairytales ehh humans are weird
download steam then we talk
under his eye
more like a russian spy posing as a nun
just don t let her drive a car probably drive it right off a cliff
what the hell is she hiding under that wimple
wow my mom s the only other woman i know who can take a sandwich like that
conehead
interestingly enough she also became the internet s first webcam girl
clearly she s preparing the bank software for the 2000s switch
and the name of the device in front of her is bi trans
did she thank god or grace hopper
hmm i thought nuns and monks were supposed to devote their entire time to god i guess not
let us celebrate with the heating of starch discs
why did i think this had something to do with the holocaust
sure she got the phd but she owes it all to grace hopper grace created linker and flow matic the predecessor to cobol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grace_hopper
bi tran six sounds like the badest badass lgbtq whatever supporter ever basically the techno viking of the black and white days
keller believed in the potential for computers to increase access to information and promote education i bet she never dreamed of rule or the mindgeek
she would certainly have written her programs in holyc if only it had been invented by then
jesus christ i can t believe people program the fucking cpus directly like this with a goddamn 1950s push button to have the accumulator and everything holy moly
surprisingly she is not the namesake of the university of minnesota s computer science building kenneth keller hall
what a beautiful middle name for a lady kenneth
unexpected good omens
admech intensifies
so was she nun binary
well of course she clearly is a conehead so she has like more brain capacity you can even see the conehead
when i went to university of colorado in there was no cs degree you were a math major
og computers were literally people working out the math for naval ballistics hence firing solution
i m atheist but was educated in a catholic prep school and will do the same for my kids
removed
you know connie i read in a magazine that you can talk to me about anything
when my people come to colonize this planet your name will be on the protected rolls and you will come to no harm
but really why the heck is she wearing that head thing in that manner i ve never seen that imagine that catching wind on a gusty day
is that her head
god damnit i wanted to make a coneheads joke
r beatmetoit
to counter that she was also into the old school punishments for misbehavior
lightweight and portable weighs pounds thanks for posting that i collect old computer memorabilia including operating manuals
must of used a lot of punch cards cockroaches munching on the cards were literally the problem bugs in the system then
at the beginning middle of the 20th century women often entered religious institutions that supported education and were able to get higher degrees that way otherwise they wouldn t have been allowed into programs once educated they became teachers because companies often refused to hire women my own phd director used to be a sister of mercy and got her phd while still in the convent she graduated in the s i think during the progressive era there were all these amazingly smart women with phds who became teachers because there were few little other options for them one of the things that rarely gets talked about in education is the brain drain that occurred when women started getting consistent access to positions other than nursing teaching or jobs that didn t utilize their intelligence suddenly smart women who would have previously been forced into teaching had other better paying more interesting more respected jobs women have always worked outside of the home most of the positions though were unseen or uncounted labor piece work boarders laundresses cleaners there s always the exceptional woman in business government upper echelons ie francis perkins at dol under roosevelt but those were rare if you are into this a great book about this uncovering the hidden work of women in family businesses a history of census underenumeration garland studies in the history of american labor source phd in women in education during the progressive era

some bot stole part of your comment lol
reddit is not a single person no group of millions of individuals would have congruent moral behavior so no there s not double standards you re going to see hateful comments on posts decrying bigotry anyway that s always going to be present in any internet forum available to the wide public
same i reread it and now i m wondering if helen keller had an illegitimate child
it s yer cake day it s yer cake day gonna party drink bacardi like it s yer cake day and we don t give a fuck cuz it s yer cake day
its more like a fivehead
there are plenty of women who become nuns after their husband dies and the kids are grown
catholics have always prioritized education that s why catholic schools are among the best schools in whatever city you are in the united states that s no accident i m atheist but was educated in a catholic prep school and will do the same for my kids don t lump the catholics with the protestants and think all christians are the same one is a lot smarter on average imo
i went to catholic school my entire life was taught by nuns never once did they incorporate the bible into anything other than our one class on religion especially not science
maybe you should reevaluate your own position through history many of the smartest people believed in god and help lengthily scholarly debates on the topic just because you don t understand something doesn t mean it s foolish and maybe they are wrong but it s perfectly rational to be rational and religious
anyone who believes that p np is liable to believe anything
read a book
the church was involved in quite a few scientific discoveries when it came to the natural sciences that said the discoveries would generally have to mesh with how the church viewed the world as being or at least not counter that view https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/science\_and\_the\_catholic\_church#scientific\_revolution\_and\_the\_church

no atomic bombs can deter mr yamaguchi from getting to work
source https://curioustic.com/tsutomu-yamaguchi/): yamaguchi s double dose of radiation took its toll in the days that followed his hair fell out his arm wounds became gangrenous and he began vomiting incessantly on august he was still trapped in a bomb shelter with his family when japan s emperor hirohito announced the country s surrender via radio broadcast i had no feelings about it yamaguchi later admitted to the new york times i wasn t sorry nor was i glad i was severely ill with a fever eating almost nothing and barely drinking i was about to cross to the other side i thought tsutomu yamaguchi was not the only person who had to endure two nuclear blasts his coworkers akira iwanaga and kuniyoshi sato as well as shigeyoshi morimoto a kite maker who had miraculously survived hiroshima despite being only a half mile from ground zero were also in nagasaki when the second bomb fell despite the fact that people were possibly affected by both attacks yamaguchi was the only person officially recognized by the japanese government as a nijyuu hibakusha or twice bombed person he finally received the honor in just a year before his death at the age of
cause he was getting to work for fucks sake a nuclear armageddon yeah you can t call out for that get your ass to work
story i read involved mr yamaguchi reporting to his boss at mitsubishi explaining what happened boss man calling him crazy for claiming one bomber destroyed much of hiroshima blinding flash mr y made to boss did not
and here i am taking a mental health day
so the city was wiped out but the trains were still running
i wake up slightly tired i contemplate calling off work this guy survives a nuke and still shows up his boss didn t believe his story about a fireball consuming an entire city either only to be hit by the second blast
the best part is his boss refusing to believe him you re an engineer he barked calculate it how could one bomb destroy a whole city famous last words at that moment a white light swelled inside the room heat prickled yamaguchi s skin and he hit the deck of the ship engineering office i thought he later recalled the mushroom cloud followed me from hiroshima x200b it is not reported if the boss survived i think not
japanese trains are so good not even a nuke is going to stop them from arriving on time
here s another fun fact he did not exactly go to work he needed to go to the corporation headquarter to report because the higher ups did not believe a single bomb could decimate a whole city like that this was also partly because harry truman only announced the bomb after they dropped it the first time therefore maybe the bosses at his company had not known about it hence the request for him to report
his friends knew him as ol lucky yamaguchi
boss hey we re short staffed at the moment we need you to come in this chad i just barely survived nuclear devastation boss i m sorry to hear that what time will you come in
the unluckiest luckiest man alive
how did he live this long no cancer no anything etc
boss you re not gonna believe what happened to hiroshima you re right i m not just get to what was that flash
wonder what he thinks of america
its a good thing the emperor surrendered the third one might have done him in
that s when he got the idea of no more train rides
he was great at parties in fact he was a blast wherever he went
living to after taking that much radiation is ludicrous
he had an interesting anecdote about the second bombing japanese culture is very authoritarian and puts a lot of emphasis in morale when he got back to nagasaki the other employees were curious about his experience he described to them a bright flash of light and then a few seconds of silence before the shockwave hit he happened to be behind a reinforced wall so he survived while many people in the building didn t the other employees were very rapt in his story but a supervisor overheard it came over and started to chastise him for exaggerating his story and scaring the other employees the second the boss was done with his lecture there was a bright flash of light and everybody ducked behind a solid wall and they survived when the shockwave hit a few seconds later
i think shadow can learn from this man
spiderman s batman s and not one freaking blockbuster movie about this
back in my day we had to navigate atomic explosions both ways to get to work
this is probably used as an inspiring story about work ethics on linked in
r fuckyouinparticular
r fuckyouinparticular
a 420km morning commute nah i doubt it
wow well if you thought you could have a bad day
damn this dude is metal af
damn i hope he stays in nagasaki
he had that main character plot armor
if i survived an atomic blast i m not going to work the next day
he is literally simultaneously both the luckiest and unluckiest person on earth
the worst day of your life so far
the most incredible part of the story is that he survived an atomic bomb and still went to work i call off if i slept bad
i think our railway companies could learn a thing or two from japan even a nuclear attack didn t stop the morning train leaving to get people to work
who tf goes to work after an atomic bomb who was his boss literally satan
hi tsutomu how s your morning been oh not bad had some breakfast walked the dog read the paper got hit by an atomic bomb did some yoga then caught the train here for the ol you know business as usual this dude s a freaking badass
the og final destination
biggest takeaway here the trains were running the next morning
hold on there was a working commuter train the morning after hiroshima
i am deeply confused about the toxicity of nuclear radiation how did this guy live through two blasts and make it to i had the impression it severely damages dna yet his kept on replicating well enough to get him to
he must have suffered from elephantitis nuts
r fuckyouinparticular
this was my former neighbor too he lost his entire family and he survived to only be hit again in nagasaki i met him when he was in his 80s and when we both moved away he had recently survived colon cancer
blursed commute
found the grandfather who walked uphills both ways
what an empty life to get nuked and then still think it would be rude in your culture if you don t go to work and blah blah blah spring rose petals and declining population years later
you re not fooling me that s mark wahlburg
and i thought i was having a bad day bc i spilled my coffee
don t let r antiwork see this
i can t decide wether this man is incredibly lucky or incredibly unlucky one one hand he survives two nuclear blasts on the other hand he experiences one nuclear blast does everything he can to be in time for work only to be hit with another nuclear strike
from his perspective he probably thought the whole world was getting blown up
ahh he must ve been a gundam pilot
does he have anime superpowers
wonder how many people did the same thing but things didn t go as well in nagasaki for them
there seriously needs to be a movie made about this man
i wonder what his job was
the original bad luck brian
there needs to be a movie about this man s journey of survival
yamaguchi san you can t get to work there s a level earthquake and a level hurricane it s impossible to go out son i survived hiroshima s atom bomb and when i got to nagasaki i survived that atom bomb as well trust me when i tell you the ground shaking a bit a gust of wind and some light drizzle isn t going to stop me from going to work fun fact nagasaki wasn t the primary that day the industry city of kokura was but for thick cloud cover that prevented the bombers from seeing the target kokura would have been bombed when there s heavy cloud cover and rain the people of kokura don t complain they heave a sigh of relief not this day
shouldn t he have turned into a superhero
god tried to tell him to take the day off twice
hell of some good train track that survive a nuke american tracks keep derailing
the trains were running in hiroshima the day after the blast
something to keep in mind when you re having a bad day
he died of stomach cancer maybe the radiation finally caught up to him https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsutomu_yamaguchi
don t be like this guy just fucking call in
so the morning train was running out of hiroshima despite the city being flattened the day before
sick japan deserved that shit
after visiting the hiroshima peace park and the museum there i wouldn t want to live through it once let alone twice the stories and the aftermath is beyond heartbreaking
it s official guys it shouldn t be a bad luck brian meme it should be a terrible luck tsutomu meme random thing i learned in hiroshima when i was there two weeks ago high school girls using salvaged military equipment after the bomb is how the rest of japan was informed of the bombing in a timely manner people killed in hiroshima alone vastly civilian allegedly part of why it was chosen as a target is because it didn t have any us pow but it was mass genocide and should probably have been treated as a war crime i felt shame in hiroshima as a us citizen despite it being years ago now i didn t feel any hostility

sorry mr yamaguchi it was just absolutely essential to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people nothing personal

what a bullshit made up story as if there would be a single train service available one day after the bomb
i m sure this was proved to be a myth
i just got bombed but i ve gotta pay the bills somehow
so he could arrive at his job on time crazy lol

evidently it s ireland they are a member since
odd i ve never seen that accent over the c used in irish before

when an animal detects danger it has three options fleeing fighting or freezing this little fella went happily to pick some seeds that were offered to him but then its brain abruptly realized that the friendly food source was actually a giant hairless ape in its minuscule mind the squirrel contemplated the possibility that the devious giant was probably planning on hunting and consuming arboreal rodents therefore it froze if it remained completely still the behemoth wouldn t be able to see it it would be completely invisible it wouldn t be there anymore still as a dead rock the squirrel became absolutely transparent in the place where the squirrel used to be only a void in the shape of a squirrel remained that until the giant became handsy then it was time to flee fast as lightning swift as the evening wind
the heck did you do to him
where did he get those ears the squirrel
squirrels looking so funny
matrix glitch
i would like an explanation but i have seen similar behavior when giving a squirrel something delicious from my hand it is flight response to danger human interfering with wanting all the treats causing a freeze response
i didn t know that skwerls had paws buttons
i don t know what to do with my hands
does that hurt the squirrel i hope not
is op gonna come in here and explain or are we to assume they re giving harmful chemicals to animals
so then i woke up i guess i had these in my paws fucking nuts man i m telling you it was a human out here in the woods and it has nuts it just gave them to me
this is superb
let me tell y all about the time i got rabies it all started with this squirrel
what were the bean or seed looked like coffee beans
what yeah
that familiar feeling of going from having a good time to being completely off your nut pun intended
gotta do the up down wavy motion gets em every time
that squirrel has seen things things you wouldn t believe
this squirrel is so tiny the squirrels i m used to seeing in canada are about the size of a house cat btw what happened to this little guy lol

deleted

they look at least similar to coffee beans
that squirrel is so much cuter than the ones we have here

error

this is the explanation that i found about this particular video _the viral squirrel freezing up may also be explained by freezing behavior which emerges as a response to fight flight or freeze stimuli that occur in prey animals it s believed that freezing happens before or after the fight or flight response is triggered _ source https://www.boredpanda.com/squirrel-malfunctions-eating-nuts/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic)
that squirrel is high as a kite after getting a sniff of that good stuff in the dudes hand
brilliant reference a
lol
googly eyes while whispering sweet nothings and licking his lips
well this is how european squirrels look
nah it s just a conflict between wanting to eat and wanting to not be eaten
i don t think there is a single record of a squirrel infecting a human with rabies most small rodents actually are almost never found to have rabies and rabbits too i believe
this
have you ever seen coffe beans are they triangular this is cedar
your username is backwards
with a fluffy tail
hey what i do on my property is no one s business
squirrel dmg found corrupted
it s believed that freezing happens before or after the fight or flight response is triggered well that s a bit of a redundant sentence isn t it
that behavior made it through evolution
thank you i was near canada this fall and saw my first black squirrels they re all cute af
pushes glasses up nose um actually https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12098-013-0990-2)

now that you say it this one looks blacker than i d expect this is how the ones in my garden look like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyjc86rqc3c
i might have read that wrong but it seems that they are assuming it s from a squirrel bite 2mo esrlier i was attacked by a squirrel no lie i literally have a big scar on my hand from when he fell out of the tree and i instinctively stuck my hand out to save him it worked but he didn t appreciate it and had to go to the urgent care they recommended rabies treatment but i knew how awful that was so i called my doctor who told me their core temperature i think it was is too low for rabies to survive in a squirrel and there are no cases of a squirrel passing on rabies that being said there s no reason the squirrel from your link couldn t have been recently bitten by a fox or something so the rabies virus was still alive and then bit the boy quickly after i m not a doctor but that seems to make sense in india rabies is much more common but it s also possible that another animal bats are many times the culprits bit the boy and he never noticed so i m not doubting the story at all just telling what little info i ve been told and seen and for anyone wondering neighbors dog injured the squirrel badly the day before and he couldn t run my two shepherds cornered him but i managed to get them back far enough so he could climb up a tree he then tried to jump to the bigger tree about 4ft away but due to his messed up back came up short he was gonna hit the ground so i stuck out my hands to try and soft catch him he latched on so hard and i couldn t get him off when i finally managed to pry him off the skin tore in the corner of the bite slice and i now have a visible l shaped scar on my left hand i literally had just started a new job a week earlier 3mo into covid and had a fun time explaining to my boss why i had my hand wrapped up no one believed me except my wife who witnessed it also they won t stitch animal bites so i had to super glue the corner down and let it heal i know this sounds so unbelievably stupid but i have a scar still and can take a pic
technically yes those just only called cedar nuts real cedar seeds totally differ
deleted
too cute they re closer to the ones we have in florida ours are the brown of mahogany and oak bark
glad you are ok now
he isn t harming the squirrel if someone hurts the squirrel because it came up to them they hurt the squirrel this guy is just feeding them and making the rest of us happy because we get to see cute lil squirrel hands
thanks wasn t really a big deal injury wise tho just such a crazy story it sounds made up only weird thing about it is for some reason since then i ve noticed i m becoming extremely scared of water probably just a coincidence squirrels don t like water either so must just be related to that
the way he tucks his hands by the chest feels more like
keep us informed on what kind of superpower will a squirrelman have
so far it s just made me nuts though i do get the urge to cross the road at the last second and cause people to swerve gotta go tho geico keeps calling me about some job offer
in some way i m even more impressed by magic tricks now cause when you see magic tricks all you think about is meh it s just mastering a diversion a slight of hand but when you actually see the diversion you d realize the genius behind it
the way he transfers that card from his palm to the back of his hand is absolutely masterful
and just like that he made her panties dissappear
this guy taking all the pussy
that is awesome when i was a kid i used to love learning how to do magic tricks and then when the show was over or even during the show i d stop and show my friends or family how the trick was done everyone told me to stop doing that but i was just so fascinated by the process i wanted everyone to know what i knew haha
the alliance is guna frown upon this one
aaaand he got laid
deleted
that is better seeing how it s done also very gratified on his behalf at her reaction

i d rather go with an alliance approved magician
hahaha
reminds me of when i was a kid and my step mom took me to the county fair while the midway was being set up she was terrified of the rides and wanted me to see how they were cobbled together to understand why i wasn t allowed to ride some of them it kinda worked after that i was way less interested in riding them than in understanding the clever jury rigging that comprised them
there is incredibly levels of skill and remembrance in preforming magic tricks from remembering what card someone has picked where you are positioning it in the pack being able to keep that from the persons view and manipulate it where you need it for the reveal x200b the dexterity required is insane d
if you haven t seen it look up richard turner on fool us guy is blind and absolutely amazing with a deck of cards
agree
you ll love this then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8osrafttgho
i definitely started to appreciate and respect it more when i started learning the mechanics myself was a fun hobby for a couple years
njnnjnnnjjjjjjjjkkkkkkkkkiiiiioiiiiiiiiiii
i hate all magic tricks until i know how they are done lol
i ve learned enough about magic and it s history that my main way of enjoying a magic show is to go over in my head what tricks they re using and who invented them penn teller are pretty much the only magicians i can t do this with most of their stuff is too high level for me
that s the whole problem though a magician never reveals his tricks is to prevent loss of the magic or wonder if everyone knows how it s done then there s no wonder involved no wonder no interest in the show i m glad you got to share your interest with your friends and family though
i was going to say something along the lines of this magician s next trick is to make himself disappear but couldn t get the pun right but yeah they re definitely gonna put out a hit on this dude
ace of spades
you see two attractive people interacting and your brain immediately goes to sex
one of my favourites still don t know how it s done
mina
el chico
spanish with a chilean accent
nah nah it s just this one guy
i hate to break it to you but it s always about sex the stock market gas prices real estate all about sex

it seems ironic that the traveling rides that get taken down and moved each week are so much safer that the sedentary ones because they get inspected constantly
and not just the dexterity but the sequential flow of all those things is another thought that makes these tricksters soo impressive
he better protect his legs
two attractive people it seems like yours doesn t work differently either
clearly i have a talent for regional dialects
phew my world almost exploded thanks for that
except sex sex is about power
source for this
oh yeah some impressive tbh x200b even tricks like cups and balls penn teller did one where they use clear cups and show you how its done but its still damn impressive especially if you go and watch ricky jay doing his cups and balls routine after
what are you even saying this is not the dunk you think it is
ong you do
sex is also about sex good sex bad sex straight sex gay sex free paid sex
i read this a long time ago before the web was a thing and it s plausible i started to google it and found plenty of on line commentary about it which you ll find also if you google it so no i don t have a source
i really have to explain don t i attractive pleasing or appealing to the senses or of a person appealing to look at sexually alluring x200b you ve used the word attractive which is subjective means you think those people are attractive to you in your response which is against what you wrote in your very own comment which i semi jokingly responded pointing to the clash of ideas in it
turns out it s about the same https://imgur.com/a/8zlhc5y).
you know a person can tell when another person is ugly or attractive without wanting to fuck them right even disregarding that your logic makes absolutely no sense
man ur mind works like mine it s exhausting sometimes tho
jfk dude you know a person can make jokes about a slight implication while it isn t representing the truth at all you know how jokes work right amount of seriousness you posses is beyond me just forget it forget i said anything it s not worth arguing over
thats like me saying why did the chicken cross the road because it was an apache attack helicopter your joke s premise makes no sense do you think that all the men and women who can recognize when one of their own respective sexes are attractive homosexuals
do you think that all the men and women who can recognize when one of their own respective sexes are attractive homosexuals wtf
