can we also ban posts that are literal emotional and borderline physical abuse
this is a post about reddit
man at this point we will need specific subs to be even allowed to mention that we are on reddit cannot even organize shit incase the sub admins go the darkjokes route
the way this is written should also be banned
made it more clearly visible in the sidebar on old and new reddit that s a sign of good mods ones who keep both the old and new looks updated also when did yall add the hair on the upper right side of the screen
i saw a post on r askreddit and it was if you could remove one thing what would it be i change my answer to this guy right here

removed
those are two separate things though not a slippery slope the reddit app needs improvement won t degrade to personal attacks banning discussion of specific users or subreddits is sensible but worrying about site admins disliking reddit criticism sounds like censorship if we can t say anything bad about mother reddit
you misspelled a bunch of words
hate to break it to ya buddy but its not christmas anymore
i dislike the words in this
i ve been recently followed by a scammer told him to get out my back and blocked him and then i got a notification for harassment that scammer was very likely to have tried to get me banned from all of reddit and you can t even report individual users on the mobile app
ha ha ha ha you guys put a hair on the sidebar when i mean it is fairly new right btw i have been coming in here for years and still still tried to flick that little fly speck off the left side dang it all lol

the biggest joke in r gaming is not the joke but instead it s the picture

but are we allowed to take a screenshot from a reddit post that is midly infuriating like somebody made sth and it got destroyed a b bit later and the person made a post about it
def a fucking reddit mod

yes it s gotten so much worse lately seeing family members going crazy and destroying someone s property isn t mildly infuriating it s just straight up abuse i used to love commiserating with people about annoying shit that happens but now it s just sad
just came here to say that every post i ve gotten in my feed from this reddit has been look at this awful thing my family member did to a personal item of mine like that isn t mildly infuriating that s straight up dangerous and abuse and the comments and upvotes just roll with it like it s normal and not a sign the op might need help
yeah that stuff isn t mildly infuriating it s just plain infuriating
i feel like a new sub for that would be nice something called idk r abuse or something similar
yeah like stubbing your toe is mildly infuriating your dad destroying your shit is abuse
how can text on a screen be borderline physical abuse
too meta delete your comment
hi could you help me a upvote back thanks

literally a hair on my screen as i m reading this wtf
same
the giver
good bot all bots deserve some love from their own kind
yuh
yes you can lol did you even try you can easy google this and know what you ve said isn t true
bro those are so fire used to have em when i was young
i don t see a different between this or any other subreddit maybe because i m mobile do they still have a desktop version of reddit these days
wait
same lol
this kind of content is rising again now and i m honestly debating leaving this sub for it
agreed
you misspelled a bunch of words
yes there are plenty of places to post this stuff if for the sole purpose of venting maybe we need a flow chart
i think it s not just family members i ve seen so many shitty roommate posts it s to the point where i m over this sub i think it s just more kids on here and reddit in general and i think it contributes to the growing amount of unintelligible discussion the amount of posts i see that can be pretty easily googled or that lack any exciting discussion has led me elsewhere but i consider it for the better
yeah its only when its damage caused by accident or sheer stupidity that it should be mildly infuriating
negative behavior is being normalized now as being funny sick world we live in
think that says something about what those people see deal with in their own lives that normalises that
infuriating heartbreaking triggering i literally feel like i need tw to scroll through what should be a joke y subreddit about mild but annoying inconveniences i m getting fucking 2nd hand trauma from this shit
or r extremelyinfuriating
i do think there is value to some degree people posting these probably don t realize that it is in fact abuse but there are definitely places where it actually fits the sub
and it was if you could remove one thing what would it be
this post is very mildly infuriating
i really like that aoneone got a prize just for being very excited that s pleasant
it s a mildly infuriating moment within a mildly infuriating moment gif giphy orva44oav5wof1lvoe downsized

congratulations to u yumdoge41 for winning third prize in the best of awards your nomination of the post about people opening other people s mail was spot on and truly mildly infuriating thank you for contributing to this thread and bringing attention to some of the most annoying posts on the subreddit and a big thank you to the community admin team and everyone else who participated in the awards let s keep the mildly infuriating content coming
that
i think you are confusing batman returns with morbius
why is it so hard for them to spell correctly yeesh
there
him and his catchphrase i am the terror that flaps in the night
are u being sarcastic
she her
it s morbin time
it s so packed in the lid could have been pulled off when that drawer was pulled forward
what you gonna do about it bro https://preview.redd.it/vvvqgii7scsa1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95048f2908c1497cce25169ff472c53af24d1209
i hope your power doesn t go out there is a mortgage payment in there
why you got tubs of ice cream
bro i m fine with y all having lots of stuff in your freezer but the mildly infuriating thing is how disorganized it truly is wtf
the lid probably came off when the freezer drawer was opened who has four tubs of ice cream in their freezer is really the question
who has any ice cream left to put back in the freezer
this is the most american freezer i have ever seen
check your blood sugar and check it often
it s great value ice cream does it really matter
four containers of ice cream and three containers of taquitos
yall already have hella ice cream i think you ll be good
i m getting diabetes from just looking at this image
in the mood for something healthy in your freezer ice cubes if made with filtered water
i m concerned about your diet ice cream and beyond
i m just going to assume that half the residents in this household are morbidly obese
did you ever think of eating what s in your fridge before you buy more
who has four half gallons of ice cream in their freezer
please buy some quality ice cream if your going to eat like shit at least go for some decadence
jesus buy a vegetable organize that freezer
i hope you ve all gotten your diabetes vaccine
itt people with logic and people who are anti more than one tub of ice cream
what s infuriating about this is that they put the ice cream back with just that little amount left
i wish my freezer looked like tbis
who tf has different tubs of ice cream on tap
someone who got high as hell
a stoned person
ur family
i bet the interior of their car looks the same
i wish i could afford this amount of ice cream in my freezer
fix your diet man
that s a healthy freezer
who has that much ice cream
the real question is who has types of icecream
i hate your freezer organization
who has containers of ice cream
correction who buys walmart brand ive cream
looks like it popped off
the same type of monster that would eat great value ice cream
great value is not ice cream
me when i m drunk
my son he s
so it gets a lil crispy on the edges
considering how much stuff you have in there i d assume it fell off
my grandpa put a half eaten bowl of ice cream back in the freezer with the spoon and no covering old people crack me up
the real question is why would they put that little corner of ice cream back they should ve finished the carton
relax tons of fun your not running out anytime soon
why so much
looks like a freezer when i stayed at a halfway house years ago
this is the freezer of a child haha
who has four kinds of ice cream in the freezer
four boxes of taquitos
i don t think you have a shortage of ice cream plus i think the lid just popped off when it pulled out cuz the freezer is insanely stuffed
who has maybe packs of ice cream at a time
who refers to an ice cream carton as a box
do you guys have any real food in there
try freezing some vegetables or fruit
this right here folks is the window into the fattening of america
god your freezer is mega stuffed
damn you love your taquitos too
its very obvious that this household is full of fat lards
a icehole that s who
op should be banned either the kind of person to post to the internet without considering the most logical explanation or it s fake for karma
my son when he was about left the spoon in it too
you need to stop eating processed food
that unicorn sparkle ice cream probably tastes like death
tell me you have diabetes without telling me you have diabetes
kids
easy access
there s no time throw it in the freezer and close the door
my kids
can i get some of them taquitos
i could have sworn this was my freezer kids are assholes
i can t keep my ice cream on my top drawer because every time i open my freezer it rips the lid off
only you can answer that
whoever s freezer that is
a fucking heathen
what the actual hell
a high person
savages
kids i even have to remind them to flush the toilet half the time
weed is a hell of a drug
fucking stoner s
sleep eater
savages
savages
animals
me
someone who deserves the death penalty
this entire freezer is mildly infuriating
those boxes taquitos aren t even good
y all got dessert for weeks
it came off when you opened the freezer door duh
by the looks of this food i would consider getting a colonoscopy asap
this just tells me that they have no idea what is in their freezer i mean come on two different brands of frozen taquitos they forgot that they even had some and bought m o r e
considering that it s right on the edge of the basket bars it could have just popped off when they put it in to the drawer and didn t notice so it might have been unintentional i d ask em tho and just see
i mean it s not like it s very neat in there anyways so
why you got so much gosh darn ice cream
that s a lot of ice cream
average redditor diet
hey are you available for my budget is commission i want you to draw my paypal please send me your son
hey man are you availabe for commission just went through your page and fell in love with your artwork
same amount and same message in the 1st and the 3rd makes it a scam not sure why some are still not accepting it s a scam
okay just out of curiosity what exactly is the expected outcome of this scam for the scammer what are they trying to get
i m dead it s been less than an hour since i called the accounts out and they re all gone hahaha
i think it s just the consistent offer and similar conversation as a fellow artist i would be a little suspicious myself just on the weirdly high identical offers unless it s a weird coincidence there s no way three separate strangers would be offering the exact same high price i wouldn t be surprised if the scam showed itself in the payment process i ve seen this sort of scam before
hey i m willing to pay you my whole paycheck if you can draw a picture of pinky finger i would need your paypal name address and your password don t worry this isn t a scam i just need your parents credit card information as well with the date and the number on the back these are all important for me to send you my whole paycheck don t worry
have you gotten the looking for a muse commission scam yet i ve been targeted by at least different scammers in the past couple months i barely have followers on instagram so how do they keep finding me lol
happened to me while trying to sell a couch on marketplace people basically all at once and all wanting to pay ahead before seeing it and their brother was going to come get it bc they had to work
literally thought i was on the scams subreddit for a second there op this one s common as hell have you had the muse mural one yet that s the other inevitability for artists
same thing happened with me a few days ago i was trying to do some tutoring at my school the scammer wasted my time with a legitimate sounding offer only to ask for my address to send a check preemptively which immediately set off red flags for me i miss the days of the nigerian princes where at least i immediately knew it was a scam
i m from usa florida nope you are not
from the usa florida is a red flag not just because it s florida lol
sounds like my experience any time i ve tried to sell anything on ebay
for a commission steal do you do creature art like if i gave you a comprehensive description could you come up with some concept art for me
omg i hate when this happens they make it so obvious too lmao
definitely a scam i got the same message a few days ago but the kids name was michael and they wanted spider man on the piece
would you make artwork for me in exchange for lego instructions for a mini f22 that i designed
you don t trust steve i always trust people from usa florida they re just so nice and they re willing to help out artists a lot too
that s annoying
what the fuck is going on these are the weirdest scam bots how are they benefitting why is this happening
somebody asked me on instagram to paint them a drawing for just recently i don t paint or advertise on my instagram account that i do paint in any way
odd scam you didn t actually do any work for them or exchange any money right
your work looks great give this artist some love
what s your commissions look like when drawing someone
i had this happen to me too it s so disheartening and honestly kinda makes it harder for me to trust others who want to commission from me
what s your art page
usa florida lol
what s your ig i need a bday present soon and for a custom awww gift sounds about right lol i m serious btw lol
ahh i think i know what the scam is ran across this before they send you a email from paypal saying you need to open a business account then they will talk about them needing to trust you as the send a fake that you need to pay back the difference and you get it all back as so it seems like a win win it s not they in fact walk away with of your money and paypal just goes well you sent it sorry
wait i want to know about the bojack horseman art
that s a new low to target artist s specifically everybody knows they already broke af
ugh so annoying
soooooooo can we see the bojack pics
hey if you had as much money as your social security number how much would that be
delt with one of these before too it sucks
well now i m interested in that bojack art
bojack horseman art can i get a link
so you re like really good at bojack horseman art
i m sorry you have to deal with this my sister is an artist and gets similar messages every once in awhile screw those scammers
i need about tree fiddy
hey man i just checked your commissions and i love your work my budget is s
damn they didn t even try to differentiate it that much i am confused what the angle is is it one of those fake reverse paypal link things
i hate people like this my google listing gets constant spam calls even after i put the listing as temporarily closed they still call i got calls today claiming my business isn t verified these jackasses gotta make an honest living
you just lost and an email from a nigerian prince
it might be bots the pictures are real but it s from the bot owner so they have a data base the second guy responded the same way twice in a row to slightly different of inherently the same question the owner finds person and has them draw a picture then they either try to steal your paypal or the image you send them for nfts or something without credit
i had someone here pull this crap we went back and first for like days before he left a clue it was a scam
anyone else more curious about the bojack horseman art
why would ppl do this its so mean
dude the same thing just happened to me i worked on this commission for a week asked about payment and they brought up a child savings account check like seriously thankfully i didnt send them the final result
can you draw me a picture of my car i ll give you for it if that s ok i can send it to your paypal i would just need your email password social security number credit credit card number cvs number your mothers maiden name and the name of your first pet
i always introduce myself as steve from usa florida that s how people from usa states talk to each other
i m steven from usa florida
i checked a bit of your post history and your art is absolutely adorable
this exact thing happened to me but with music someone reached out to my band to make a song about his son who was turning loved paw patrol and had a dog named maxy i made the whole ass song before i realized he was a scammer though
hey dude speaking as someone who frequently does art for money i really implore you to take payment upfront if not the whole amount then at least half that way there s no chance you ll get scammed out of your valuable labour secondly it s better to issue invoices to your clients paypal addresses rather than giving out your own for basic money transfer gives you more control over the transaction more cards in your hand makes it more ironclad so to speak
i just went through your page and i think i just fell in love with your art work op i want to you draw my croissant but as though it s taking part in an animorph like transition into my pet ferret i m willing to pay you of that isn t that stuff
i m a musician and this happened to me with customized songs for birthdays i got halfway done sometimes with full tunes and got messages the same thing by a dif account word for word smh
pretty sure steven from usa florida is legit i know him good dude drinks with gators a lot
this exact thing has happened to me i had suspicions from the beginning but them insisting on paying more than i asked for was a dead giveaway nobody wants to pay more for something if they don t have to so obnoxious that you have to be the one to expend effort to respond when it ends up being nothing
aaaand this is the reason i stopped taking commissions lol
from usa florida
i went through your page and i think i just fell in love with your artwork but the best i can do is five dollars and that dirty t shirt in the corner please draw my big toe
take it or leave it
is this for the bojack horseman art or something else
okay fr tho how much is a commission
i am also in wa i would legitimately be interested in buying a drawing from you pls pm me if interested i m unable to pm you for some reason
you should scambait them next time that ll be funny lol
so why cant i message you what if i really do want to get something specific drawn which i do
what s your insta page
gif giphy sdcfxfdozb3bo
i just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has commented dm d me or demanded pics of my art lol it has really brightened my day and i am kind of on the verge of tears thinking about how kind all of you have been gonna be honest it was definitely disheartening knowing all the commission requests i had received were scams but you guys have just been so amazing like i never would have imagined thank you all again so much i don t think i can put into words how much this has meant to me thank you
excuse me i went to your page to look at art but instead found the loml aka your bun bun how do you not spend all day swooning
im steven i m totally real america usa florida
well at least you re giving good customer service and reasonable rates
question can you do art in dragon ball z style i am looking to have art work done for a tattoo
speaking of commissions does anyone know a good reputsble artist that can do a commission of a cat i would like to surprise my fiance with a picture of him since its about to be a year since we lost him
hundred dollars take it or leave it
and now instead of scammers you re going to be getting a bunch of parody fake scammers
booots
i m just interested in the bojack art at this point
can t someone just want the god damn bojack horseman art
scam aside you are too easy with payments and your worth that stuff is just as bad as getting scammed know your worth and take a damn deposit upfront haha
hello i m available for commission im john smith from los angeles california usa at generic st do you accept check by mail for my services
huh i m dumb asf bruh what s the giveaway here i sell for pounds all the time sorry if i missed smt obvious
went through the same thing but instead it was their pet i hope you get an actual commission soon
i m willing to pay you of that isn t that stiff
the last people who ve messaged me have been like this and it s so discouraging
i m willing to pay me
hey op are you available for commissions
they like offering for some reason don t they i don t know much about commission art but i would assume i tell them what i want and ask how much and go from there am i wrong or is the upfront offer part of knowing something is up
i think it s the same person they all start out with dollars for some reason
seriously though can you do a commission for a dragonlance dnd group
at least the scams are easy to spot wait till they evolve and start asking for enough special requests to reasonably charge sending you multiple pictures of their starving kids and haggling you down over a week to and then start demanding it sooner and sooner like a real customer
my wife deals with jokers like this on instagram it s frustrating
i m a musician and get scam offers for playing at weddings and they want to send money i front i can always tell by the awkward language i ve also gotten scam offers on facebook marketplace and poshmark they always ask for your venmo paypal or email up front i ve come to expect it now on any public forum where i am selling or advertising really annoying
try not to tell them how you l ow they are scamming you the rest of us don t need them learning how to be better scammers if they are too stupid to figure it out themselves just let them be stupid
the ya also the nft shit is driving me nuts i get it more then i like fuckin scammers can burn in hell
oh now i want to actually get my dead cats drawn in that style sorry about the scammers
i m steven from usa florida
you had five seconds to save the chicken but you took a photo instead
don t hold just the bag hold it by under the bucket rookie mistake
could you put on sandals then retake this picture so i can comment nice job colonel sandals
social media is the first thing you think of smh
kentucky floor chicken
i d eat it off the floor and suck the carpet clean
carpet licking good
bro thought at least i can get some reddit karma for this and instantly pulled their phone out
and first thing to do is taking picture bruh
that s some work conference room carpet
nah it fell on carpet if you hadent pulled your phone to post on reddit you could of saved it
damn you colonel
never trust the bags always hold the bottom
make sure you take a photo of it instead of picking it up
i am so sorry for your loss
kentucky fried carpet
kfc is crap anyway
it s because it s thursday try again on fried day
i know what i have to do but i don t know if i have the strength to do it
kentucky floor chicken
first thing i d do is pick it up possibly allowing myself to convince myself it will still be safe enough to eat or you could take a picture for reddit did you eat it
kentucky fried carpet
three second rule gogogogo
well there goes a weeks pay
thank god it s only kfc https://preview.redd.it/p2bkuhbb0fsa1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba51100c982e14c5c62d944d4c8189266e0beeee
the bag did you a favor now you can go to popeyes
if you picked it up within seconds ur still good
if it s within 60mins u can get a refill on ya chicken i think dunno if ya had to dine in
and on a hotel floor no saving that calamity
this is far more than mildly infuriating
time to cry
i ve had this happen to me a few times one time it especially sucked cuz i was not having a good day and all i waned was to enjoy this great smelling meal i just spent a bunch of time going out of my way to go get then i dropped the food just as i was unlocking my door then i gathered it up threw it away and promptly sat down and started crying for bit kitchen was empty af too so i didnt eat for the rest of that day
everyone knows that the bucket of grease is eventually going to dampen and then weaken the structural integrity of the bag
and your first thought was to whip out your phone and take a picture of it
pick them up you can help the homeless
bruh
second rule
five second rule idiot
the five second rule applies here
sec rule
second rule
second rule
second rule
and it s kfc you ll be fine
dude just be happy you made it to the carpet
that you bought kfc is more than mildly infuriating
well at least you were saved from explosive diarrhea
this is how one learns the hard way that the best way to support a paper bag is by holding it in the palm of your hand paper bags are paper thin and it only takes once i feel your pain hopefully others will learn from your experience too
second rule but you wasted it taking picture
do you want ants cause that s how you get ants
now like secret spices and herbs and who knows what else
poor bastard lol
bro
sorry donald
it s a sign bro
you bent your wookie
this is way too depressing
rip
don t be a pussy just pick it up
god did you a favor lmao
nothing wrong with floor chicken
in the arms of an angel by sarah mclachlan starts playing
last kfc i had around years ago sucked so it probably wasnt much of a loss
i would still devour it
nooooooo tha fackin chicken
carpet looks clean ish blow off any hairs and lint and enjoy the strength training your immune system gets
that made me cry
my broke ass would still eat it
damn worth of chicken there kfc has gotten ridiculously expensive i probably would ve eaten it
took op until college to learn you hold the bottom of the bag
good
you better eat that i m fasting and want chicken so bad
fuck that i m eating that chicken and pretending that never happened
free bird
second rule
it s fine it was probably on the floor before they bagged it anyways
just pick it up and eat it
you got me fucked up if you think i d let it go to waste my hard earned money and my time spent in that drive through i m eating that damn chicken i don t care if it gave me aids
nobody had to know
could be worse could have been your fifth of popov
f
anguish anguish and agony
hey at least whatever s in those smaller containers survived but i d be mad as hell too
meh eat it anyway
good thing it was only kfc
i heard on tiktok you can get a free refill on your bucket if it s empty within the hour you bought it
must ve been real greasy
five second rule
that kfc looks sadder then the mcdonalds i ve went to
man i had this happen with the taco box from taco bell years back i almost had a breakdown but then i realized oh they are still wrapped nvm

second rule op you could have picked it up instead of taking a picture
that sucks

i have a reservation dumped pup and she is the best dog ive ever owned
have to believe karma will come around on the original owners good on you for stopping
we adopted a dog that was dumped on the side of the road best dog ever you re right however people are the worst
i m not an animal person but it still bothers me greatly that people are willing to just abandon pets like that at least put them in an adoption shelter or something don t just leave it in the middle of a road
people will take puppies pay for puppies why would anyone just dump them i don t understand
how do you know that they were dumped maybe they weren t dumped maybe they got loose it happens did you have them checked for a chip maybe their family is distraught that they are missing they actually look fairly well cared for but good on you for helping get them back home
yeah people suck they make my head hurt i love dogs i also would own more if i could afford it i have weenie dogs https://preview.redd.it/wl33isww3csa1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bf1a08399a9ad54310b872afa279025593ee7124 they are the best right now i am trying to figure out a way to get the neighbor s puppy they ignore in the backyard if you get an animal any animal don t ignore it that s cruel thank goodness for people like the op who saved those precious little puppies so what are you going to do with them
your are a person
this is how i got my dog best puppy in the whole wide world no idea why she would have been dumped
so cute upside free puppies
please make sure to take them to a vet first then if you can t take care of them please don t dump them at the pound try to find someone you know who s capable of taking care of them
some jerk threw an entire litter of these gorgeous kittens out like they were trash what makes me really hate people the male kitten with the prominent forehead nose was actually a broken nose and an abscess above a fractured skull and the little guy is still wary of hands and terrified of men so it s easy to assume what happened seriously what kind of person punches a tiny kitten https://preview.redd.it/zr6nctaocdsa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c8768d97e65e4007c07305b9b664800ce03e9d1f
i live in the country and folks from the nearby town of 35k people will release pets in our neighborhood our road is so common for pet dumping that they put an animal shelter at the end of it i was just about to go feed the barn cats and it looks like they just welcomed in another stray as a matter of fact
the black one looks just like my dog as a baby she was part of of a dumped litter of bear hunting dogs and years later she s still the best good girl
i wish a puppy would stop me in the road so i could take care of it
i ll take them

they are so cute why would anyone dump such sweet babies my poor heart
ohh the one with more black reminds me of my eutybooty except she has one blue and one brown eye
hey i saw the other comments and while you wait for someone to get them i will give a word of advice keep stuff you like out of their reach you won t regret it
thank you for saving them you are amazing
love you for what you are doing thanks for helping those two
thank you so much for helping them
i guess your only choice is to raise them to be amazing doggos old own was a horrible scumbag for abandoning them their loss your and the puppies gain
humans suck good to see someone stepping in to help
my current pup and her litter mother were ditched before being found by the humane society in my area after that another entire litter of week old puppies were dumped over the fence into the humane society my pup s litter has been adopted and those puppies are almost ready to be adopted and healthy of course i have a puppy tax please ignore me desperately blurring out her tag i m so glad you found those pups op and i hope you find a good home if you re not going to take care of them https://preview.redd.it/o8m4rsiicdsa1.jpeg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff94bec966121d97f485a11b193bc97a5124171a
what sweeties thanks for helping them people who treat animals as disposable are scum
dogs are better than humans i love my two amazing dogs
bless you for stopping to rescue them
they look like beagle pups or part beagle
you are an exceptional human being a lot of people would just keep going those lucky pups will be happy to have a kind human to look after them while they find a forever home
they look identical to my dogs like so much so it s creepy i got mine when they were weeks old from an irresponsible neighbor
thank you for being a decent human and saving those puppies i hate people too i am on my 3rd and 4th rescue pups cuz some humans are just vile and because of that so many dogs need loving homes
best of luck finding homes for those cuties
they re awfully clean to be dumped street puppies not saying you re necessarily lying because that would be horrible to use innocent animals for karma but either they were just dumped and didn t spend even one night outside or something isn t adding up
they don t look like they re starving
definitely not starved but yeah fuck people who dump puppies like this
or they just got out you can t assume they were dumped without evidence
humans suck
awwww one of our rescues was abandoned in the woods with her litter people suck
omfg they look like my doggies who passed earlier this year i would give anything to hold one humans don t deserve animals
omg i d keep them in a heartbeat
who could dump them they re so cute
they are so cute thank you for helping them
ive picked up three strays in the last ish months in my neighborhood in the same block radius all clearly pets none of them tagged or collared only got one of them back to their owners after lots of effort humane society for the others i dont get how people can be so careless
thank you for helping them
how could someone look these poor babys in the eyes and leave them
these sweet animals still have love in their after being with such a terrible human thank you for finding them a home
on the bright side yay new puppies
thank god they ran into a kind person like you very good work
congratulations on your new dogs yea people suck fuck em
omg the dark one looks exactly like my puppy when he was younger take care of these little cuties
if i ever saw anyone doing that i would beat the shit out of them and then leave them by the side of the road it s only fair
congratulations on your new babies
omg they r too cute thank god someone like you found them people are disgusting if they were near me i d take them in a heartbeat
op advertise those as hunting dogs when you rebreed them and they will go super quickly the black brown one looks just like my baby and every time we go out people stop me to ask how she hunts and if they can buy her those both appear to be part coonhound a bluetick and a red merle https://imgur.com/a/ckpnu5c

me too
god bless good human
that s a super long way to say we got new puppies
thank you for saving them people suck i d want to keep them so bad
we need a lot more people like you in this world
poor pups their lucky you found them bless your heart people who do that suck so cruel to do that its cold out
nothing mildly infuriating about that just plain infuriating

some people suck no doubt
are these both boys they look so much like a litter of puppies i saw from a catahoula female the girls came out looking like mom and the boys absolutely did not
exactly how i got my best friend he is the best dog i ve ever had and he was dumped so sad that people do this but i ll take all the dumped dogs
thank you for helping them
oh my gosh i don t know how people that do something like this can sleep at night ergggh thank you so much for taking the time to stop and help these lil cuties
i really love you stopped to help thank you op the universe will take care of the rest
why do you think they were dumped did you even check for a chip
look on pawboost maybe someone is looking for them
you are a first class human
the way these pics were taken reminds me of when my dog was a puppy take a bunch of pics and keep the ones that aren t blurry even if they aren t the greatest photos they only stop moving if they re asleep i love it
psa shetlers are overflowing in the us right now even small cute puppies are not able to find homes pet ownership skyrocketed during the pandemic but a lot of those people were first time pet owners and didn t spay neuter or didn t know how to secure their enclosures and a lot of people relinquished their pets when they went back into work costs of veterinary care are also skyrocketing as people are increasingly facing economic hardship a few major corporations own most of the veterinary clinics pet food companies and diagnostic equipments labs so even though individual vets are seeing their job become far more challenging as people can no longer afford diagnostics they have no say in the price increases in most cases if you have been thinking about a pet now is the time to adopt if you have time to spare they might be able to use your help as a dog walker or foster if you have money to spare they could use your donation talk to your local county or city shelter puppies and kitties will thank you
that s how i got my second dog my buddy was driving back from a wedding late night with his wife they had to take a back road in the middle of nowhere to charge their car and he happened to see a puppy in a ditch this month old puppy based on dental from the vet was emaciated covered in fleas ticks and had three different kinds of worms they took him to the emergency vet and the vet said he probably would have had day or tops left in him the little dude couldn t even walk he crawled on his belly towards them when they got out of the car he turns year old this month his name is boone and he is an absolute hellraiser but i love him
thank you for saving them
the german shepherd mix kinda reminds me of mine her litter was going to be taken to the pound cuz the owners weren t going to be able to take with them when they moved sooooo yoink weeks later they came to get them and did really care i took one to save from the pound
those are some adorable puppies if i didn t already have three to one dogs to people ratio in my house i d offer to take them in but three is enough for one man lol
to be fair my two dogs are perfectly well fed and are still always profoundly happy to see a human
so glad there are good people like you
those poor baby s the puppies don t deserve to be dumped
so glad for them that you stopped people who dump dogs and cats are in my opinion horrible
if you find the person who did this send me their address and full name no reason at all i just want to speak with them briefly don t worry about it
i m in the texas dallas area and if you are close to that i would be down to take one
belongs in the subreddit humans being bros thank you for rescuing them babies
why don t they dump dogs in rich neighborhoods instead of rural areas
i m actually glad these puppies were dumped my friend told me last night that his really good friend not friends after this happened moved out of his apt bc he couldn t afford the power bill anymore and he left his puppies in crates in the apt didn t say anything about them or dump them or take them to a shelter or just leave them outside for someone to find and at least have a chance of surviving instead he locked them in a crates and abandoned them and they died of dehydration and starvation were found decomposing in their crates poor babies
this reminds me of when my mother took our two dogs one afternoon for a joyride she actually left them on the side of the road in a crate when she got home i asked where they were and she just told me that straight up i was about six years old
i don t necessarily feel proud that i feel this way but it s my honest feeling i hope whoever dumped them gets a very nasty illness and suffer for the rest of their lives for being such a piece of shit those puppies were very lucky a kind soul like you found them
oh my god i thought those were maggots wtf
is your mom a fish
my guess for the mince version of the turkey is to lessen the risk of choking but still the sandwich is lacking
she had no dietary restrictions either this was the normal menu looks like hamster poop and she said at the time that it tasted like turkey sawdust which i d believe edit this is in canada by the way manitoba specifically edit i will say not all our hospital food it such garbage but oddly enough the larger the hospital you re in the worse the food tends to be she got this at the largest hospital health sciences centre in manitoba however when she stayed at smaller more rural hospitals the food was all fresh homecooked and good
that looks like the wood pellets i use in my traeger
your palette is just not refined enough to appreciate this delicacy s
that s cat food
when my mom had a stroke she was sent to a rehab hospital they gave her what looked like mashed potatoes or grits it was neither it was pured garlic bread wet garlic paste is what it was we couldn t believe it yuck
that looks like pellets for a guinea pig
looks like turtle food lmao
that looks like a pellet sandwich
wow they skipped elder abuse and went directly to animal abuse serving her something my cat wouldn t touch
minced turkey actually saves lives in hospitals daily choking risk and such much safer not as visually appealing but can actually be tasty
was she on mechanical ground texture due to choking risk as gross as that looks it s what they serve to people with a habit of aspirating their food
that looks like tape worms
this isn t the kind of language we use here on r mildlyinfuriating
i work in a hospital this is called a moist and minced diet it s unfortunate but it s a real thing that some patients need
mum uk right isn t that about on par for the quality of food in the uk p
it looks like cat litter
pellet turkey meat i guess i haven t seen everything
it s like they microwaved raw turkey and threw it on some bread
the chef should apply at panera
ew these look like the little wooden granules i d place in my cats litter box
these look like the pellets id use to feed the fish in the pond at the nature center i volunteered at
looks more like what turkeys eat
that s fucking insulting
my mom had to recuperate at a nursing home from a fall one night they served popcorn for dinner popcorn rural mn usa
turd isn t spelled t u r k e y
i was just in the hospital in switzerland last week broke my leg skiing and had to get surgury and the food was absolutely delicious restaurant quality best hospital experience of my life this far
looks to me like she was on a soft mechanical diet that would have been ordered by the attending physician
and i thought school lunch was bad
no wonder people don t like hospital food
that s not a hot turkey it looks like canned cat food my dad worked in hospitals when i was a kid and i used to think the cafeteria food smelled so good and my dad would just chuckle i only understood his amusement years later when i got to eat it while hospitalized
cat food
i just want to know where you are that you celebrate thanksgiving and have a mum
my grandmother was a dietary aide for years at a hospital she was always adding salt other seasonings changing portions adjusting ingredients etc she wasn t supposed to since the food is supposed to follow whatever dietary restrictions patients have but she lived on the high of patients saying wow not as bland as i thought it would be
i used to work at nursing homes and this looks like food they d serve to patients that have problems with chewing choking risks they always look disgusting and i felt terrible serving people food that looked like something from the dumpster most of the time the residents wouldn t eat their main meal because of how unappetizing the food is making their conditions worse i can t believe that they served that to her when she didn t have dietary restrictions that s just terrible
the four horsemen of crappy food in order from best to worst shelters schools prisons hospitals
that sandwich ran your mom if she s in the us
my kid has a play doh set that extrudes pellets that look like that except more appetizing
i mean ground turkey that s been boiled with no signs of seasoning is this what we go into debt for the rest of our lives for
our little hospital served actual carved turkey on the usa thanksgiving holiday but at least that canadian healthcare is better
looks more like a hot mess to me
i can t even tell what that it is that s wild
solient green is people
criminal
is that cat food
my immediate thought was you are from an area that has socialized health care your picture makes me think of the food everyone gets in venezuela
that doesn t even look like dollar store dog food quality good freakin lord that s awful
sadly they have to grind up any meats if the patient has any issues chewing swallowing normal foods if they have no teeth or other issues swallowing everything would get pured up in a blender
ground turkey must ve been cooked by someone who is quietly quitting
is your mother in prison seriously it looks like what i d expect prison food would look like in the states
looks like a maggot melt to me that s the worst i ve ever seen out of hospital food sevices anywhere it should qualify as patient abuse perhaps do future patients a favor forward that photo to the hospital administrator along with the approximate date a suggestion they could do better it s quite possible they have no idea how bad it is so very sorry you lost your mum
i ve read that it s very common for people to leave us hospitals more malnourished than when they arrived due to the horrible quality of their meals
today s special cat food sandwich
i can verify from a hospital bed right now that the food is so fucking terrible here i would pick jail food any day before i pick what they serve here to eat
i m guessing this what free healthcare gets you
that is absolutely horrifying this is the shittiest excuse for a turkey sandwich i can even conceive of
hot turkey sandwich
the fuck is that cat food
this literally made me gag
i bet prisoners get better food
dude it s a hospital what do you expect a fucking turkey dinner with cranberry sauce and green bean casserole lmao
damn that s horrible
that looks like maggots wtf is it actually
and they re gonna charge her a fortune for that ofc
insurance was billed for meal service
looks like a fancy feast
cursed hagelslag
it looks like horse grain
ugh that looks like dogfood
that looks like pet food i ve always seen people complain about hospital meals but my meals have always been at least decent now i understand better that s horrible
is that layer pellets
i think that s catfood
looks like rabbit food and probably cost upwards of at a hospital
no seriously what is that
nah that dog food
i m pretty sure that s the cat litter i buy
i mean it is easier to just make the food with all possible dietary restrictions then make a regular and a restricted one but still sucks and looks like garbage
bro they literally have better food in prisons for violent criminals
is that cat food
id rather starve than eat that even the diet restrictions they could find better more appealing options give me real food or let me starve
more like hot turkey barf i would refuse to pay the charge on this meal
i could see multiple reasons for this and i think your observations on food being worse on bigger hospitals is the key here bigger hospitals have to make food in huge quantities and unfortunately that often leads to lower quality where i m from schools hospitals and elderly peoples care centers got the food from the same kitchen and they definitely made all of it flavorless mush to minimize the work they just don t hire enough people to make good food
what month are we in
are those maggots
why is there what looks like gravy underneath the bread and turkey pellets
it looks like a hot maggot sandwich instead
for a moment i thought those were maggots
i thought it was gravy granules
gross it looks like it tasted awful without even touching the fork first
hot or not
the hospitals don t make enough money to be able to afford better food give them a break s
it looks like rabbit food where i live
that ll be
that looks like the old gainesburger dog food
that s making me gag rn
oh fuck that s vile
those literally look like turkey feed pellets from a farm wtf even is it
my cats food looks better than this

nice you get a bogo
good deal coupon day military discount tell us your secret
been that way for awhile at arenas stadiums etc years ago at an nhl playoff game i paid for a oz draft beer
its so funny how people make the decision to buy overpriced food then complain about it on social media
our local team offers unlimited food hamburgers hotdogs chicken sandwiches cookies drinks popcorn all included with the ticket price which is minor league baseball but they aren t in a league anymore
you gotta learn how to sneak food in ice cream fits perfectly in a zip lock baggie
maybe the problem is that you call them sports games s gif giphy dyosj1mauwbqs
i paid for a beer at a concert in la in i wonder how much it would be now
those pretzels look like a sad monkey shat into a jar
enjoy your frozen vegetable oil infused sugary lactose goo and rectangular flour batter baked with carcinogenic hydrogenated butter
mlb
seems a bit much lol
prices suck at music concerts too
don t even get me started on movie theaters it s nice to go watch something in the big screen once in a while but one of those small boxed candy you can get for a dollar at walgreens checkout counter is
god damn that shit looks good
eek but of course now i want pretzel nuggets and soft serve in one dish
i would like tickets to sports game please
just bring your own like i do
yeah next time fill your pockets with mcdoubles soft pretzels and candy buy beer and soda there the whiskey is in your boot go stars
and yet you people still pay for it
are toe thumbs the same size as regular thumbs so i can gauge the size of the ice cream
auntie anne s slaps tho
not only expensive you also had to eat them without any decent entertainment take it easy folks just a casual joke from somebody who doesn t get what s entertaining about watching other people play a game
that s a screaming deal
oh yea a hot dog and beer totals at wrigley these days
it s absolutely batshit the price of things i know it s labor costs but that s like maybe a few bucks worth of flour salt milk sugar and ice cream salt not sure if they re all the same kind of salt crazy shit
what a deal
shoulda bought one beer
but did you dip those in there
did they at least kiss you before they fucked you
thats a steal those would usually cost at least
yup free pretzel bite with purchase of a sundae
his mom blew the owner
that s awful considering i wouldn t even buy a beer there for of todays money
my buddy bought my ticket for me so i had to do something
inflation my dude all food everywhere right now is overpriced
i agree
real talk though cam loved sports or at least football
eh it depends on the venue i went to shows in la this last month cocktails were and beers like the teragram
found the vegan self employed essential oil peddling mlm business women from high school i keep hearing about
nhl
glad i ll never go to them thanks to ticketmaster
we went to the movies for the first time in a year last night not only was the popcorn and drink there was literally minutes of fucking commercials before the movie actual regular tv commercials and then minutes to previews the posted showtime was the actual movie didn t start until
they dont stop you bringing in food though the upcharge is for the convenience because they know lazy and or people that don t think ahead will want them from the lobby
bro village cinemas has gold class and they almost quadruple the price of a hot dog if you go in there it s pretty sweet for what it is but the actual food pricing goes wayyy higher for no reason
at least i ll admit that it was good
he mentioned he didn t pay for the tickets so he paid for the food
are you sure that wasn t your mom
you have lost touch clearly sub for two items at a major league event is normal
do something i mean piss in the bathroom it is free for now
you still bought the food
nice enjoy bro
oh my gosh was it amc our popcorn was and the drink was the movie was supposed to start at 6pm so we got there at 15pm and it didn t start until 30pm lol
how does pissing in the bathroom for free show gratitude to your buddy for buying you a ticket to the game
i m no biologist but i think i know the answer to this one
the labeler clearly didn t recognize the brain since this one has wrinkles and their s probably doesn t
why is the lid open and why is everything filthy
abby someone abby lung
a brain labeled a lung by another brain
maybe that s the name of the person it came from like chinese actor lung ti although i m pretty sure this isnt his
ab normal
how much fo a rack of lung that ll be fie dollas good lord that s a lot of money how much for just one lung
i think the person who labelled this one had smooth lungs
big brain moment
you know the old saying the brain is the lung of the head
well if it used to belong to someone whose head was just full of air i could understand the mistake
gif giphy icoga6bcxkqkvmy3wp
there was an attempt to label the organ
i think we found out why this former patient died
breathe smarter not harder
abby abby who abbynornal
what infuriates me more is how the glass tanks haven t been cleaned in ages
someone should clean the fish tank
looks like they reuse the same container and replace the organs so usually the lungs go in that container but someone put a brain in there instead notice the faded lettering that label has been there for a long time
i can smell this picture
would you mind telling me whose brain i did put in and you won t be angry https://youtu.be/c9pw0xx4dxi?t=18)
gif giphy sov9bylgyicgq abby something abby normal
so much wrong here each with questions why is the label blocking the view why is the tank with the brain labelled lung why is the tank ajar why is it filthy where is this why is this and what s in the tank next to it
after seeing this i seem to have lung in my skull i wonder how am i still functioning
i like women with enormous lungs because i enjoy a good talk
looks like somebody left their lung at home that day
they have lost their one of that
that was his name
cerebriform morphology
well that explains a lot these days
this only applies to total airheads
that s a breath of fresh air
why do you have a kidney first of all
what did you expect his brains were in the glass already
whoever labeled this clearly didn t have a brain
look everyone we all have had an identity crisis before
dammit jeff you had one frigging job
the trainee is gonna have a field day with that one
that s a lung on drugs
both have oxygen so same thing yup i m using my lung
someone just ate the lung and deposited whatever was floating in the formaldehyde vat happens all the time
lungbrain or airhead
you had one job
well we all know where they left their brain
obviously a non smoker
and like this the brain failed to identify itself
a brain did that by the way
was the guys last name lung
bro they just did what my nonna does after finishing a tin of cookies relax no big deal
it s a smartlung a new product developed by nasa
yall are stupid af being a biologist i see nothing wrong here
it belonged to abby someone
they had one job
since when were the lungs located in the head
check out the big brain
the person who labelled it forgot their brain in the box
it s important that you use your lung when deciding what to label things
that s the brain iest looking lung i ve ever seen
yeah totally infuriating like how would a lung breathe underwater
abynormal
that s some big lung energy right there
nice
me and my rock hard brain
me when i re label the surgical items the patient now has a brain for a lung
that s the lung of the head
they got no brain
bro took imagine breathing to a whole nother level
well they both have lobes
you had one job
abby normal really earned her name
must be an asthmatic
gif giphy m3864rbwwbtkmabpn3
damn your eyes igor
his was in the tank so he couldn t effectively use it
that s the brainussy
pfft imagine not not breathing from your brain couldn t be me
if my lungs were as fucked as my brain i d be dead
aha he smoked crack
this image has very uncanny vibes i feel uneasy looking at it for some reason
i am a biologist in training and tbh everything looks totally fine
you know it s been over years since i took gross anatomy so i might be a little rusty but i don t think that s quite right
looks like the brain of the guy who labelled the organ
usually the alternate place for that organ is lower down
this brain identifies as a lung and is unfortunately drowning
did the dude without a brain label this or
it s a brain lung
someone has shit for lungs
looks like a refreshing drink
brain on brain violence
we dont sell them in pairs anymore
why not a not small portion of people seem to think the vulva is the vagina
i dunno there are a lot of airheads out there
hey there s my testicle
abby normal
why are you just hanging out somewhere where there is a brain in a tank
abby something
abbie normal
abby normal
abbie normal
that s one way to keep stock of what gets stolen
managed a thrift store for a while you would be surprised theft was such an issue we had off duty officers work there at the time they got about an hour and it was cheaper than letting all the stuff get stolen our average price per item some things were cents others or more at the time across the whole store was just under so that should tell you how bad it was not to mention we got robbed a couple times and we weren t in a bad part of town just an area with lots of hard working blue collar families our store earned money for veterans charities
i worked at goodwill when i was younger first goodwill the organization is shit and should be out of business second the customers were fucking animals leave food places shit in the changing rooms shit on the walls of the bathroom throw stuff around break stuff an just over all pieces of shit it really cemented how shitty people can be
and then it closes like that insect eating plant
popping tags is stealing no matter what macklemore says
stealing from a thrift store aren t the clothes cheap already edit it s been several years since i ve shopped in a thrift store so i guess they re not cheap anymore i m still fat and will be getting rid of fatter clothes in the upcoming weeks if anyone is in need i m happy to share free rather than dropping at a donation center
have you seen the price gouging at thrift stores over the last few months it s insane i m not suggesting people steal but i frequent local thrifts a few times weekly and i m tempted especially when they leave the original price tag on and they re asking nearly double whatever walmart couldn t sell it for
ok as much as this mildly infuriating i love how passive aggressive this is
i recently attended a tropical destination wedding some people were there for a week and some only a few days from all different areas of the us one girl i didn t really know was wearing a very simple linen dress that i knew couldn t have been cheap as a beach cover we were walking with a mutual friend that day and i quietly asked said friend if she knew there was a security tag on her dress just trying to be helpful well that was apparently the first of many many times people asked if she knew there was a tag on her dress poor girl it was the only beach throw she brought she said nordstrom must have forgotten to remove the tag and this was one time i believed the girl lol
shout out this store was actually very very cheaply priced i didn t see any clothing over cdn any of the times i was there and they donate their proceeds to the town s homeless shelter if someone needed clothes that badly i have no doubts they d have donated it to them after a simple conversation also to you guys advocating stealing from small family run stores why don t you just keep it to wal mart or some other big box chain and stick it to the corporations instead yeah they deserve it a hell of a lot more thanks and have a good day
should be a trap door as soon as a gram of weight hits that tin you fall into a pit
bit hard to sympathize with places like goodwill where staff get first dibs and take whatever they want gratis for themselves
we have signs at the vintage store i work at that reminds people they re on camera and it s a small business and please don t be human garbage because we ll put you on instagram and find you and get back what you stole lol
come on if you re going to steal just do it from walmart not from the stuff people have donated specifically to be cheaper items for others although some thrift stores have been pricing items up and up i think most still keep it reasonable
or that the average person can t even afford discounted clothes
if you see someone stealing clothes at a thrift store no you didn t same for groceries
if people are stealing donated clothes from a thrift store their lives are at a point where they re probably not the problem
this is actually awesome
if i ever catch you stealing food or clothes i didn t see a thing
reminds me of a scene in reservation dogs where a kid is working up the nerve to shoplift and the store manager say hey i know you re going to steal something so could you just tell me what so i can mark it down as stolen so he holds up a sucker and the guy says thanks and the kid walks way with the sucker looking very confused
average redditor when reverse psychology
people would piss and shit in the dressing room of a thrift store near me they closed those dressing rooms
this is also admittance of stealing if you get caught nice
realistically it s probably teenagers
stealing from a corporate entity like walmart or target is one thing but stealing from a thrift store that s some straight hood rat shit
misanthropy is the only genuine cringe people are fine it s the fact that the shitty ones are so loud about it
i ain t falling for the old mouse trap in the tin can trick
honestly i love this
i m mildly infuriated at someone using silicone as a verb
it s disturbing the amount of people justifying encouraging theft in the comments yikes
buddy if someone is stealing from a thrift store i m looking the other way anyone that desperate can have what they take
people don t suck for stealing clothes and other necessities that they can t afford the system sucks for not giving them accessible alternatives shop lifting is caused by poverty
just as infuriating at this post is the disturbing amount of people justifying if not full on encouraging theft
it s a trift shop like people gave clothes for free and you expect people who can t afford it to pay
idk what situation is like where you live but here trift stores often ask similar price to brand new clothing so ye as a broke teen i was happy looting them
i just don t go to thrift stores anymore but i encourage stealing from them if you pay there is a large chance you end up funding a crisis pregnancy center or conservative politician
yep happens all the time at my work they take tags off then want to get upset when we tell them the price up front the most pathetic one was the couple that popped the pink tags off a leather motorcycle jacket then complained when my manager told them it s just because the items at my store were donated doesn t mean that we should sell them for pennies because like it or not inflation still affects our stores rent goes up electricity and water go up when we need a new cart or little baskets that costs money for each one we need to replace not to mention the employees need to get paid as well and on top of that we also pay for the rent and utilities at our donation only centers and the trucks truck maintenance and gas to get the donations from the donation centers to the stores and same with the wheelers to get our outlet items from the stores to the outlet stores i hate when people whine that it s all donated so inflation doesn t affect y all because that s simply a false statement
listen i am a okay with stealing from big box stores even goodwill but a local thrift store thats just sad
i go to thrift shops weekly and i always see empty boxes obviously stolen missing parts it s really a shame seriously if you re stealing items from a thrift shop you re a pos
great way to get the thieves fingerprints
i don t excuse theft the reasons are irrelevant nobody has a right to other people s property that you have not payed for period yes people suck i feel sorry for the owner that it has come to that
i would assume that the intelligence level of some property relocators would actually fall for that
over all the years i ve shopped at thrift stores i don t think i ve every tried anything on
people who steal like that are bums
sometimes people need to steal to have basic needs met and i think that s okay if you can t afford food or clothes you should steal them only a real bastard would want to stop you
why is this infuriating
i mean this isn t so bad people don t steal from thrift stores for fun unless they re bored kids and even then they can t do much damage this way they re not putting those who are stealing from need on blast and ruining their lives further plus they can better track inventory
this normalizes criminality
people stealing from a thrift store are probably struggling the most luckily most thrift store clothes are obtained for free and a lot of people do pay to keep them running times are tough right now i thought they were tough ten years ago nothing compared and a certain political group just wants everyone to suffer so lazy assholes with tons of money can earn a little more
who steals from a thrift store that s messed up everything there is already super cheap
i hope it s jigsaw trapped so they stick their hand in there and if cuts it off probably not tho
they suck or are desperate i don t think a charity store taking a gentler approach to theft is a complete coincidence
thrift stores and sperm banks really weird places to steal from
this is the absolute definition of being all out of f__ks
good girl
you don t get it those people are oppressed they are punching up they truly live in a society get your privilege checked he will not devide us my body my choice to steal clothes get debunked with feelings and affirmative action
it doesn t hurt any of us when people steal why care why is this infuriating struggling people deserve nice things too
where is this i have some clothes to steal
when the economy sucks theft goes up it s just the price of living in a country that pays the vast majority of its citizens well below living wage
people who don t have money dont suck people like op who are probably better off suck for judging
i don t feel bad for thrift stores at all they get all of their inventory for free
yes we do
i work at an off price retailer in construction not only do we silicone behind all mirrors soap dispensers etc we also have drywall ceilings in restrooms we caulk all baseboard in the entire store and or course we have over a dozen cameras none of it means much when you can just fill a duffel bag and walk out we even sell the duffel bags
they just don t care anymore
check the can after every customer
so basically they re saying if you re gonna steal at least recycle
my first wife used to work retail at a mall she had to spend the night there several times to do inventory gif emote free_emotes_pack thinking_face_hmm
prank motion detector alarm in the bin
did they just staple that paper right into the wall
why do people suck so much
thats pretty shitty people have to steal from a thrift store i m glad covid happened because it taught me to stay inside and stop wasting my money on dumb shit
good way to get finger prints off the thief
good way to keep track of who s stealing tho
well now i know that this happens at thrift stores all around the globe and not just in ours good to know
in my town it was the thrift store itself that was criminal the pta had to fight to get their name taken off it because they d stopped giving funding to the pta yet still kept it in their name
must be the same person stealing not everyone that steals would have the idea to stuff the tags in the mirror
what what what what
friend of mine ran a thrift store if you spoke to her about your situation she d provide you with whatever you needed up to a furnishing a home with clothing for everyone for free
fill the can with scorpions problem solved
oh shit worked at dillards and would find tags stuffed in between chair seat and chair behind mirrors on top of partitions you name it
omg people did that constantly at my last job which was salvation army the clothes are like and if someone needed anything we would give out vouchers for free clothes no need to steal
that s sad
my local thrift store just decided to close the business then finding out so many price tags behind the mirrors
accept that people steal and let that shit go old people young people rich people and poor people they all steal i do like this idea tho for retail stores it is probably so much easier to figure out where your inventory is than finding random tags occasionally and people stealing most of the employee retail world and in loss mgmt are totally hip to you our hands are just fucking tied of the time yeah i do a lot of breathing on this one and have to remember to let it go a lot
i mean if your stealing from a thrift store you have to be quite in need
who steals at a thrift store
at this point wouldn t you just put cameras in the change rooms even fake ones would deter thieves
also a good way to keep an ear out for someone dropping the tag in the tin
yes this feels like the owner just accepts that people will steal and probably believes that most have a reason to do so being very poor they just want to make their own life easier around that fact
and keep the mirror from being damaged by someone trying to pry it forward to stash tags
man a couple of times my car has been broken into and the most frustrating part is not knowing what s gone like they went through the glove box i don t know what s in there it is full of crap what did they take i don t want to get pulled over for speeding one day and discover that my vehicle has no registration anymore they took my tire pressure gauge which is annoying and also i can t figure out why they d want it
that s one way to keep stock of what gets stolen this person retails my first thought well that makes stocktake a lot faster while also making it clear we are onto you
you are under the mistaken assumption that thrift shops exist to provide inexpensive items
i wouldn t remotely consider humanitarian in fact many religious non profit thrift stores fund anti humanitarian goals
shrink can be a bitch and this probably helps more than the thief hurts the store
all the goodwills in my area have a security guard by the door or walking around
i would love to hear more about working at thrift stores
ah a fellow traumatized ex goodwill employee we need a support group i was a sorter someone who sorts the items that are donated and quality checks them arguably the worst job you can have at a goodwill i ve found enough dead mice to fill a swimming pool sex toys with substances still on them so many cat piss soaked clothes spoiled milk rotten eggs and more i finally quit when i was stabbed by a used syringe while pulling clothes out of a bag got tested afterwards i m all good lol
my mom worked at goodwill when i was a little kid i m now and back then it was actually a good company to work for as well as still true to their mission my mom worked in accounting and her office faced the laundry area big commercial washers and dryers where everything was actually washed before going on the floor there was a repair department too that fixed whatever they could including electronics they employed the disabled and underprivileged in every department and actually did community outreach and jobs training programs one thing i ll never ever forget was the easter baskets they made every year which they would give to children at the annual community easter party they did community christmas celebrations too and would even have a santa they also have a food bank on site and gave out food boxes to those that needed them unfortunately the company is absolutely fucked now and i wouldn t patronize one of their stores by choice though i still wouldn t encourage stealing from them the employees are already given enough shit by customers no need to have management come down on them too
goodwill is a company not a charity more people need to know this also they purposely understaff their stores and take advantage of their disabled staff in the back
imagine getting one of those corner lockers
terrible designer imaging being the to people shoving their way into that corner let alone the inside most two lol
took me about seconds to process with what s going on with this image feels like an optical illusion for some reason
the light is fine the lockers are off
im sorry this image is fucking with me where is the floor
what kind of psychopath installs a light like that the world is going to shit
r mildlyinfuriating doing that job of highlighting peoples ocd relax it s not that serious lmao
okay this is the best post i ve seen on this sub i m twitching looking at this picture and have questions for who placed it there
i just wanna move i just wanna move the liiight i just wanna move i just wanna move the light i just wanna move i just wanna move the liiight i just want to move the light
it is aligned it s pointing directly at the locker which conceals the door to narnia
it was put there to mildlyinfuriate youx
you know people probably design stuff not symmetrical cause they know it woll bother a lot of people i know i would
perfection is in the imperfect
this photo is making me nauseous
ohhhhh i hate that
that has to be a degree corner that photographed weird making it look more angle ly right lol
beware the light this looks like a game where something bad happens if you fuck with it
this hurt my brain
i don t know which is worse the fact that the light is not aligned or the fucking corner lockers sighs i m okay
everything about this photo fucks with my brain i feel like a hell portal should open in that corner
want to know what happened because i bet i know the line measuring the conduit for cutting did not take into account the turn onto that wall it was boxed and set before the wall was finished no one gave enough of a shit to fix it the lesson in any electrical bwal wiring where symmetry matters don t install the box and over extend the conduit install the box after the wall is installed so you get it aligned correctly that it the studs were not centered in that spot
this is more than mildly infuriating reports kidding ofc
backrooms
ha the stud is in the middle they ve got to mount the electrical box to either side of the stud couldn t center it even if they cared
the tile joint as well jesus christ
they were aligning to the ceiling tiles
oh fuck i didn t think about that one i shouldn t be so upset about this locker room but i am
yeah the lighting made the perception of depth very weird
im proud to say that hallway has zigzag lockers
underneath the lockers
installer didnt have a choice unless the whole wall is torn apart to the studs the electrical box needs to be mounted to a stud by code or at least wood attached to a stud the only way to center the light is to have access to the studs inside the wall no electrician is going to smash apart a tiled wall without being specifically requested by the customer and that shit costs a lot more than installing a new light fixture at the existing location
i really don t care about the light but i thought yall would find it annoying so i posted it
easy to answer thats where the electrical box for the light fixture is located installer isnt going to relocate that box without getting paid to do it owner likely didnt want to pay to have their tiled wall redone that costs a lot more than putting in a light where the box exists
yes the lighting made the photo super weird looking
true lmao
heh touch moving the lockers wouldn t align it with the tile anyway just noticed that it does line up with the ceiling tiles though probably should just knock the building down and try again
how do you open the corner ones
deserves more
there are multiple lights though between each locker zig zag the hallway is longer than this photo
and their locations are all dictated by the electrical boxes that they need to be wired to its electrical code so unless the entire wall was stripped down to the studs prior to construction it would cost more than it is worth to center them thats the way building code works aesthetics comes after safety the lights need to be mounted to boxes that are securely mounted to wood inside the wall
interesting thank you for educating me
i used to work in this jewish bakery and every passover we had to move around 10kg bags of flour to a employee s house and bring it back when it finished
where can i apply for this job that will soon provide free hot chocolate
what does passover have to do with hot chocolate
without seeing the ingredients of the chocolate my guess is that this is because of how passover prohibited food is labeled during passover there are two different categories of prohibited foods on top of the usual kosher laws which continue to apply chametz which is basically when any barley oats rye spelts or wheat are combined with liquid and not baked quickly enough and kitniyot chametz is biblically prohibited not only to eat during passover but also for a jewish person to possess or even receive benefit from giving something as a gift would be seen as beneficial in this context this is also why you might see a kforp label on a non food item to indicate it is free of chametz kitniyot are rabbinically prohibited to be eaten during passover from a much later time probably later than the midddle ages and there are no further rules against possessing or benefitting from kitniyot kitniyot are also a regional tradition ashkenazic and while it s a large region that is well represented internationally avoiding kitniyot is not even remotely universal for reasons too minute to address in this post corn is considered kitniyot likely a hot chocolate packet contains corn based sweetener as opposed to any of the five grains this is further complicated by the fact that people usually don t have the knowledge or information to make informed passover purchases for themselves so they rely on kosher organizations to investigate and provide labels about what is safe for passover and what is not as such the fact that something is not labeled kosher for passover doesn t mean it is not simply that it s status cannot be relied upon if that s how you judge whether or not a food item is potentially prohibited then you likely clear any food which is not explicitly allowed from your property for the eight days so someone not making granular decisions most would not would likely view a chocolate packet without a kforp label to not be allowed and remove it with corn in so many products there are many items which are technically kforp for some but don t get labeled as such or at all i should also mention there is also a possibility that hot chocolate packet contents could either contain chametz itself or be processed on equipment that also processes chametz which would indeed make that packet prohibited for your landlord to own sell gift etc during the holiday so knowledge of the ingredients and production environment would be necessary to render an informed decision on the status of this product
if it s his and complimentary he can do what he wants with it sorry still sucks though
if the landlord is orthodox jewish he can t keep anything containing wheat on any of his properties i m atheist and disagree but the point is that he isn t saying you can t consume chametz but rather i can t own chametz easy way around this for him is to find kosher for passover packets
if the landlord is religious then he is not allowed to own any food that is not kosher for passover on passover the prohibition is not just eating it it s also owning it i don t think he s gonna violate his religion so that you can have hot chocolate edit to clarify because people are missing my point he s not saying you can t have hot chocolate imposing his religion he s saying that he can t give you hot chocolate which is just following his religion that was the point of my comment i wanted to bring it to ops attention that stocking the hot chocolate would be a against jewish law just because someone is following their religion in a way that impacts you does not mean they re imposing their religion on you if someone closes their shop to celebrate a religious holiday that may impact you but that doesn t mean they are imposing their religion op is free to make themselves a bathtub full of hot chocolate if they want to no one is imposing anything on them another edit even if he puts them out for public use they are still his according to jewish law of you put something out so that anyone can take it the technical term is making it hefker it is still considered to be yours until someone claims it so no he could not leave the hot cocoa it for other people to take since it would still be considered his by jewish law
so let me get this straight you have a landlord who provides you free hot chocolate everyday this landlord is jewish and according to his laws cannot own non kosher food during this holiday so for one day a year doesn t have any your reaction is to complain and say he s imposing his religion on you dude sorry you don t get free chocolate one day a year but you sound like a baby with this post edit one week a year not one day
as much as i fucking despise religion if he was supplying them complimentary he has the full right not to do so anymore for any reason
lol while i don t agree with this it is kinda funny seeing a non jew have to deal with a jewish imposed rule as a jew myself my entire existence bends to the christian world christmas and such are paid days off for work but when i observe my holidays i must burn a personal day
this post is mildlyinfuriating
discovered the landlord decided to impose his religious beliefs on all the tenants in the shared office space vs discovered the hot chocolate isn t available because the landlord is observing passover i don t think the complaint itself is the issue my bud i think your phrasing is pretty tone deaf considering jewish people have to pretty much nonstop deal with minor inconveniences based on people practicing christianity
ok you re getting free hot chocolate and complaining about the guy who is providing this free hot chocolate taking it away he s providing it so yeah he can choose not to provide it when he doesn t want to especially if it s for religious reasons putting away your hot chocolate is not him forcing his religion on you
impressive that this comment section is simultaneously grow up it s not a big deal because christian s do it it s not imposing his religion he has to do it
was he imposing his beliefs on you when he offered the hot chocolate complimentary in your shared office space using his own money
op the fact you get hot chocolate anyway is awesome you ve been getting it for free and now because you have to wait days you re upset most people only get crappy coffee that tastes like someone vomited on peanut butter mixed with shit and you re out here complaining about hot cocoa
okay let s be honest here for a second is the landlord well within their right to remove refreshments they provide for religious reasons yes is it still mildly infuriating for the person who expected the coco to be there to see it removed yes do they have a point about the landlord forcing their beliefs on everyone no as unless the landlord wasn t the one to provide the coco then them removing it is within their right
if he s paying for them then he can do whatever the fuck he wants with them bring your own in if you want hot chocolate
evil jew landlord won t give me free chocolate candy drink for eight whole days because of their religion i d better post to my fellow morally superior atheist redditors about how they re forcing their religion onto me by not giving me free shit
oh no little baby gonna cry with out hot choccy what a desolate fascist world you must live in go to dunkin and get your own
if it s his resources he can do that just like if a jew chooses to not work or answer their phone starting friday evening until after saturday evening in observance of shabbat not saying that s always a thing but shabbat is a time of family and prayer and this they dont typically engage in external activities friends are jewish or if someone is overdoing passover idk just chill if they come and get after you and press their beliefs then worry this seems minor and probably not a hill to die on yet
it would be imposing if he stopped you from having your own hot chocolate not his
they aren t stopping you from buying or drinking it so they are in fact not imposing their beliefs on you or anyone else they are just practicing their on beliefs
jesus loved hot chocolate he just couldn t pass it over
what about every office building that puts up a christmas tree shut up
uhm did you bring your own hot chocolate or are you mad because the free chocolate isn t available right now
oh my god just being your own prepared hot chocolate from home or get a kosher for passover variety as a gift for the office you ninny
so hot chocolate isn t kosher for passover damn chametz gets in everything
if they re supplying it with their own money then they can do that
 
i mean if he provided them then i feel it s his choice to stop providing them just bring your own for a week i guess it s mildly inconvenient but not really infuriating
just buy your own he isn t imposing his religion on you he s practicing his by not owning starchy foods during passover
just bring in your own like a real grown up
i m a dyed in the wool atheist all about shitting on landlords and i m all about anti work but complaining about your landlord taking away free hot cocoa packets come on man edit temporarily taking away free hot cocoa packets for religious reasons
me when my landlord doesn t give me free hot choccy
all religion aside if someone is giving you something they are not obligated to continue to provide you with it just because you ve come to expect it he s not saying you can t drink hot chocolate he s saying he can t give it to you if he forgot to order it and said it was out of stock and on order i m guessing you wouldn t have bothered with this post go buy a hot chocolate and enjoy it
i mean if he s providing them he has every right to choose when they re available other wise it s messed up
just be glad the landlord isn t mormon they don t drink hot beverages at all
this is when you provide a small supply of chocolate with a large sign this chocolate is for individuals who do not observe passover
ha ha once more the sinister jewish cabal has deprived the gentile of their beloved hot chocolate we aboard our death star of david delight in your mild inconvenience where is your beloved swiss miss now papists the imperial march gradually gives way to hava nagila as a shofar sounds tunelessly in the background
he doesn t have a choice religiously he is observant and in his observant view he cannot own this product and therefore it has to go away you re getting a privilege and you re moaning about it you are not having a religion imposed on you you are being entitled
ok but can we all just be happy kosher coke is available yellow cap is the best
uhhh provide your own
tell me you re antisemitic without telling me you re antisemitic
at least he won t be calling you on a saturday
i mean you can just buy your own hot chocolate for the duration of passover imagine making a post complaining that the landlord for your work stops giving you free hot chocolate for like a week hot chocolate packets are not exactly an ultra expensive item dude
complaining about not getting provided your complimentary hot chocolate for a few days it s just hot chocolate stop making a big deal about it
if he pays for them he can do what he wants with them i assume the water is still hot bring your own
do ppl not realize the landlord of a building likely doesnt own the businesses inside nor the things inside said businesses
cry about it lol he s paying for it
nobody is imposing anything on you he is following his religion and you are whining that you want others to provide you free stuff in violation of their religion
if hes buying the hot chocolate and hes not getting upset if non jews bring their own i dont think theres anything wrong with this
oh no i cant have something i was getting for free for one week my life is truly over i m the one that wants it why cant my landlord by it and give it to me for free and violate the religion that they re allowed to have
so his religion is oppressive because you can t have free chocolate what are you years old
i mean to be fair unless you pay for the hot chocolate packets it s his packets and he can do whatever he likes with them including restricting them for personal use and not giving them out for free
awe i m glad you found something to be oppressed about today
you ll get over it
now you know how certain religons feel when chik fil a is closed on a sunday a day they don t consider holy
my boss is a great guy gives us some nice freebies and all but he ordered food for the office and wouldn t get me a ham sandwich cause he s halal how inconsiderate of him to push his religious beliefs on us yeah that s not how it works
snowflake goyim
imagine if muslim manager did this and removed all food and water from offices for a month while imposing your religion on others is prohibited in islam sadly many in muslim majority countries do the same shit and freak out if they see people eating edit yes i am aware of christmas and other religious holidays but other than days off no one forces you to join in religious practices i m schools and workplaces any xmas celebration is opt in activity edit my experience relates to scandinavian countries apparently jesus and santa are mandatory in usa schools
assuming this is in america it is hilarious to hear anyone say impose his religious beliefs on me that couldn t be more quintessential christian america sorry the provider of your free snacks took them away for a day though
no one in the office is to have hot chocolate because you can t have it yet being accommodating to muslims during ramadan is too extreme big lol
now you know how it feels when i have to work during the high holy days
if the landlord is providing the hot chocolate then they they choose not to for any reason go buy your own hot chocolate
just bring your own you cheap bastard
seems like he provided free stuff nobody paid for and then took it away for a day
average person deal with one slight inconvenience of judaism challenge christianity dominates american society and so many things are catered to it you ll survive
time to go purchase your own and leave them with a note that says for everyone who doesn t observe enjoy
if the landlord had been supplying a free amenity of his own volition without contractual requirement then i mean he can kind of stop whenever and complaining is a bit petty full stop but as another point of information if he really was religious himself then his own beliefs state he cannot consume not kosher for passover foods himself but also he is not allowed to provide not kosher for passover foods to others it is a religious commandment not to engage with such foods in any way and to eliminate and dispose of every piece and crumb in your possession so while i m sorry you feel inconvenienced i doubt very much this was any sort of malicious imposition he is simply not doing what he is not allowed to do and considering it was a free benefit in the first place making this level of fuss seems kind of petty x200b x200b edit just for clarity i m sure he wouldn t mind if you brought your own because the prohibition is only on his own actions he may not eat nor provide but you can do whatever you like
bring your own hot chocolate does the lease agreement say they have to provide free hot chocolate you re going to have to call corporate on this one follow it all the way to the top
reddit moment
just like restaurants that close on christmas and impact everyone else huh ok when your beliefs but not for others huh
the only infuriating thing here is you are unable to act like an adult and provide your own refreshments
this is a very polite sign letting you know when the goodie will be available again free hot chocolate anytime you like is not a right lol i think you will be ok
what kind of adult is drinking hot chocolate on a regular basis and then complaining when their free hot chocolate is temporarily taken away
happy that didn t happen at the blood donation center yesterday
only after reading the comments do i understand perfectly that a fully stocked kitchen for free at work is not only a luxury but a fuckin rare one must remember to thank the boss good luck the with the chocolate thing
an upper management person at my job stopped talking to me because i don t have easter plans ok thanks for not annoying me anymore with your stupid comments wish i had known this hack earlier in my career here stupid jerk loves hearing himself talk
here is a pro tip now that you have learned as soon as this holiday is over grab a bunch of packets the next time they are out and store them up for when ever these things happen
imagine being pissed off at somebody practicing their religious freedoms stop being a jackass and go get your own hot chocolate from the store oh wait that s right you won t get karma on reddit if you go do that
we can t own or supply chametz during pesach op can go buy his own he s not owed free amenities especially when it violates the religious laws of the person generously offering it the rest of the year
passover more like i ll take a pass on working there
ooh i d buy a giant box of swiss miss from costco or something and plop it right on top of the note
i don t understand religion whatsoever and find this stuff to be very funny
weird how religious people historically and contemporarily impose their will on others hmmmmm
go to the grocery store buy several boxes of hot chocolate mix bring it to work put a note on it for everyone enjoy thumb your nose at the jackass who decided to impose their beliefs on everyone else unilaterally fuck them
i mean if he owns the office and he provides the hot chocolate he can choose when he wants to provide it or not he s not telling you you can t have hot chocolate he s just saying he s not going to provide it during this time it s not that big of a deal bring your own
you should definitely replace them so that when he goes to put them back it s already refilled
christians do this to other people all the time no meat on fridays in lent bank closures on christian holy days in god we trust on our fucking currency nice to see the tables turned once in a while
in observance of passover give me hot choccy
if the landlord provides them this makes some sense because they aren t allowed to possess them during passover sounds like they re keeping it quite strictly so if they normally buy them and hand them out they can t do that during passover but if this is just something your office does and the landlord inserted himself by forbidding the packets in the building during passover that seems improper and an overboard interpretation of the demands to keep kosher for passover
buy your own
dude cry about it christian beliefs are imposed over the entirety of the us walk blocks down the street to starbucks and get your hot chocolate there grow up
oh no the free items aren t available
so bring your own hot chocolate during passover problem solved
so he was providing complimentary hot chocolate packets but decided to obey his religion for just a sort period of time and now you can t have your hot chocolate you know there are stores right you know there are coffee shops right you can always i mean always buy your own yes it s frustrating expecting something and it s not be there but you re expecting something from someone else
imposing his evil religious beliefs by politely taking away the free hot chocolate for a week the humanity of it all fuck this guy who provides us free hot chocolate and his evil jewish ways s
oh no did you survive the day without hot chocolate
jewish person doesnt bring free hot chocolate for a week why are you imposing your religion on me christians dominate a quarter of the year with christmas ads songs and decorations why are you guys not getting into the spirit of things its basically secular anyway
it might be a bit milder than it once was but it ll be fine
are you at my moms house
you ll find an expiration date on your sea salt too sodium chloride a literal mineral
if it still smells like cinnamon it s fine
won t have the same intensity of flavor but it still should be fine
usually spices can last forever if well preserved
almost everyone here needs to learn the difference between best used by and expires two different things
after reading this i had to open up my spice cabinet and take a look of the spices in my cabinet of them are expired don t sweat it
save it and make cinnamon applesauce ornaments at christmas time
best by isn t a use by date use it it s fine
i found some hydrogen peroxide in my mil s bathroom that expired in yep almost years ago and they ve moved at least times in the last years
best by date expiry date
i just ate mustard that was best before don t be a weiner baby
as long as it doesn t have mould and shit it should be fine
eh i ve used cinnamon my grandma had in the cupboard that expired years ago
this isn t even mildly infuriating it s a fucking spice if it smells like cinnamon it s fine to use or go buy a new bottle for either way get over it jesus christ the things people complain about
good god i got reminded of that commerical expired expired expired expired
cinnadone
nothing wrong with it
at my mil s house i ve found spices from the 80s
best by then second best by
it won t taste like fresh cinnamon but it ll still taste like cinnamon and it won t be spoiled unless it s been contaminated with something else excess moisture dirty measuring spoons etc it s safe to continue using
my parent s house has spice tins from a grocery store that closed in about and they moved across state lines when they did in the 00s
that s a gimmick lol and it s say best if used by it doesn t assay expired lol
it s ground up tree bark it s fine
best by dates scam
well i ve heard that expiration dates aren t an exact science but this is really pushing that to the test at least it wasn t milk
you know it s literally sawdust right
didn t know ground cinnamon could go bad
you got a few things to remember with dates if it says expired by use by it is fine untill then maybe another hours after but that s it spices don t expire the container it is in dose tho if it says best before or best used by it will be milder or less effective after that date but it s still usable dates are only a guide for domestic cooking where as they are mandatory for commercial cooking
just like eggs cinnamon does not go bad
it s fine when things like that expire it doesn t mean they spoil it just means they lose a lot of their flavor
pre ground cassia cinnamon tastes like dust from grandma s house when it s fresh anyway
i m so sorry that happened to you but i always find it hilarious when i see stuff that s like expired by years
i ve used year old blue ribbon spices was still good
it s fine spices don t really go bad if anything they get less potent so the spice makers put these dates on there so if you do use year old cinnamon they can point to the date to explain why it isn t very potent
bruh it s literally wood
it s cinnamon it s fine just less intense of a flavor
i ve heard that toasting it in a pan will help activate the oils and make it taste fresher really just stronger never could be bothered to try it myself and tbh i can t imagine ever looking at expiration dates on spices in the first place
meh you can use it perfectly fine
i bought a specialty butter at a sam s club in ca two years ago it expired in
you can spread it on your lawn to keep trash pandas from tearing it up for grubs
thinking about the ancient traders transporting spices across oceans and continents how fresh do you think the spices were by the time they got to their markets
you can still use it it hasn t expired it s just not the best
if anything most dried spices will lose their potency after a long while but if you keep it in a sealed container in a dry environment it should be fine they have an expiration date because they have to have one but that date doesn t mean the product can t be used
i have cinnamon sticks that expired in
meh those mean nothing
i was extremely sick a few weeks ago and went to buy a tea from as it s a small walk and i had no energy to drive i bought it without realizing it expired in
my dad goes to costa rica every year and my wife and i clear out all of his expired food when we re house sitting i swear he has a place that sells expired food cause every year we throw out tons of stuff
dried goods are essentially non perishable unless they re contaminated
try a tablespoon
make cinnamon dough ornaments edit recipe cinnamon ornaments non edible cup ground cinnamon tablespoon ground cloves tablespoon ground nutmeg  cup applesauce tablespoons arlene s tacky glue ribbon or cord for hanging combine cinnamon cloves and nutmeg add applesauce and stir till mixed then add glue work with hands minutes to form ball if too dry add applesauce if too wet add cinnamon knead on cinnamon sprinkled board till it holds together well divide into quarters roll out  inch thick cut with cookie cutters punch hole for hanging place on cookie sheets to air dry days turning from time to time to dry faster dry in sunlight or in a degree oven for several hours makes ornaments when ornaments stop smelling strongly of cinnamon take fine sandpaper and sand each side a couple of passes
they didn t have a bigger one
best used by and expires are two different things your cinnamon is probably fine it would have been best used by however it did not expire on that day as it is a literal spice and doesn t necessarily expire like other things can it may not have as intense of a taste but it is still very much edible however if your milk says it expires on a certain day chances are you should toss it out day of day after
thats some cinnamon oxide now
oh you still did don t lie
bro it s still good
mom
yeah unless your house is disgusting op i m sure it s fine
we all are
nice rhyme
you would think this silly but i have had this argument with my wife for fuck sake
i think the expiration date in that case is for the plastic container not the salt water bottles also have expiration dates for the same reason
what are cinnamon applesauce ornaments sounds tasty
it depends on how you store it also the best buy dates aren t when it expires it s when it stop tasting as good
you ve never seen it get in with the wrong crowd it can get involved in all kinds of things that any self respecting spice would never even consider
all herbs and spices start losing potency once they are ground once the plant cells are ruptured the volatile compounds in them begin to evaporate or break down this mainly happens due to air contact and light to get the best flavor from your spices buy them whole and grind them as you need them the next best thing is to buy ground spices in small quantities from spice vendors like the spice house and keep them stored in a cool dark place like a cupboard that isn t over the stove oven this cinnamon might still generally smell taste like cinnamon but if you compare it side by side with some ground in the past couple months you would be able to taste how much flavor it has lost
eggs go bad
i found it hilarious as well its all good
that sounds like the archives of my cabinets fr lmao
or trash pandas can have grubs with a touch of cinnamon
considering they understood the quality degradation of ground spices and transported whole spices instead pretty fresh i d much rather use pepper ground fresh from year old seeds than pepper ground months ago
yeah i did
nah i just left you can have the seconds
nice thyme
subliminal and the literal minerals was the name of my prog funk beatnik shoegaze slam poetry fusion jam combo in college
ok but my salt in a glass container also has an expiration date
https://www.bakedbyrachel.com/easy-cinnamon-applesauce-ornaments/
personally i blame the nutmeg
wow you know she is right
may go well with a side of lime
your what
oop after a quick google search it turns out it s additives that are the reason for the expiration date not the container my b
thank you those sound really nice i love cinnamon scented anything
more like
she s had practice
i brought a duster it s all good
or stinky cheese with fine wine
their prog funk beatnik shoegaze slam poetry fusion jam combo i believe
the leaf blower and ky are on the dryer
in college
american see the knife as the issue and canadians are more offended by the quality of the syrup funniest thread i ve seen all day
lol bring a knife to school day
where s the real maple syrup
for context this is a canadian school they really ought to know better when it comes to the liquid gold
canadians table syrup americans knives moms dishes
what is table syrup
the oversight is that i want some waffles and it s horseshit my kids keep getting them around every corner
shits expensive
do any other canadians remember going to the maple syrup places with the cute little shacks and maple syrup on snow that s how we celebrated learning about it
what was the oversight
please tell me you went to costco and got them the real thing i jug would probably be enough
they never said real maple syrup would be served so technically it is accurate
i m sorry why is this infuriating
the knife comments are laughable send a plastic knife and fork or a butter knife i mean i m sure one kid could show up with a butchers scimitar but i think that would be a very very low odds type of incident
if it had said plastic knives and forks would that change your take on it
that s not a knife australian accent
so is the problem the suger water syrup i m confused
okay why the damn crappy sugar water our kids deserve organic maple syrup they can get it fresh from the tree right now
syrup is a huge miss probably could have come up with a better quality waffle too fewer allergens just missing the shared equipment with peanuts and tree nuts ftw
i don t think this is the oversight you were referring to but i immediately wondered what the kids with those allergies get like do they just get excluded if i had a kid with those allergies they d be home that day getting better treats for sure
poor kids just want to taste what real maple syrup is like wth
let me have my kid throw syrup covered stuff back in their backpack
those ingredients eewww that s not maple syrup at all
we re providing your children with a treat make sure you provide etc
i remember in elementary school sneaking a steak knife into my lunchbox to cut my apple teachers did not see it my way
this belongs to r facepalm
it could be worse the syrup could contain potassium benzoate instead of sodium benzoate that s bad
as an aussie i was so confused as to what the problem was is it weird i had to read the comments
i m not a parent but my first assumption is plastic knife those cut through waffles
why wouldn t the school just provide plastic silverware and paper plates just add it as a extra cost
i can understand the knife kinda but this is a school don t they already have plates and forks in the cafeteria
the first thing that came to my head when reading this is why they re asking the parents to send their own plates and utensils lol
definitely an interesting observation haha
this is so true i was just showing this post to my canadian partner and his first reaction was to the syrup while mine was the knife then we saw this comment it s so spot on
don t bring a knife to a gunfight
as an american i am definitely more upset by the fake syrup
also no alternative options for kids with food allergies wth
my work also has a weird thing about knives we make tools that are sharper than a normal kitchen knife
another oversight to be sure haha
what if its a plastic butter knife
they ve been learning about it but we re too cheap to serve it
bingo
its real its says so on the bottle
they serving fucking eggos fuck
idk how it is in canada but here in the us where i teach kindergarten it costs like for a small container of real maple syrup you might need two containers for a whole class to have waffles that s real money with how little we get paid not to mention providing waffles i think the weirdest thing about this is that they aren t asking parents to donate all the supplies that s what i would do also individually packaged plates and cutlery for this sort of thing we would use paper plates and plastic forks and knifes those would be the cheapest part of the whole thing
teachers parents remembering to send something
maple syrup comes from maple trees table syrup comes from tables
aunt jemima s or your typical breakfast diner well table syrup definitely isn t maple syrup though
disgusting sugar water pretending to be maple syrup
yes we had to carry the buckets and stir the boiling pot it seems a bit late in the season for maple syrup fests now as most end in april 1st in my area i wonder how far north op is
it s not real maple syrup which was the whole point of the exercise in the first place
the classes are learning about how maple syrup is made and to celebrate they are going to provide table syrup fake syrup with the waffles
or just a regular knife for eating surely the kids use metal cutlery for their lunches every day anyway
hope they re at home getting better waffles and real maple syrup
that s what i thought it was too lol
the 5yos just want to have waffle day they really do not care the lessons were probably how the teachers got a fun social event approved by admin
lmao
as the celiac i m horrified im grateful i developed it later in life and got the enjoy dunkaroos and koala yummies
i used to grind plastic knives down on the sidewalk cement until they were sharp because what kid wants a dull knife it wouldn t get as sharp as a cutting knife or anything but definitely sharp enough that i shouldn t have had it this was also in the s though and we were poor and didn t have our aol subscription active usually so it really was a different era
to be fair the teachers are probably paying for this out of their pocket and even fit he school has funding they probably wouldn t pay for it
table
per student how generous
i bet el would show up tho
ikr that s name fucking brand that s rich person shit
in most places you can get a 1l of pure maple syrup for about i ve heard costco is the best but i like to get mine from smaller places i have a shop in my town that makes their own and it s for 500ml they also did a special syrup from the town they don t use local sap and it was for about 200ml more rarity there and it was unreal delicious
are they maple tables
baby oil
excuse me it s pearl milling company or some shit now
that s so true i didn t even think about the time of year
thanks
i seeee thank you
yeah i imagine canadians are allergic to all syrups except the real good good shit lol
what kind wants a dull knife me lol
table flavored
maple wooden table
yea fuck that teacher for trying to do something special and fun for the kids out of their own pockets s
or ya know it s garbage ass frozen waffles instead of fresh made ones
1950s formica
this comment sent me they most certainly must be
maybe it shouldn t be out of their pockets but instead funded by the school who received adequate funding from the government through taxes to the extremely wealthy half of musk s pandemic earnings could fund the entire education system for a decade
fresh making waffles for probably up to kids sounds like a nightmare it would take so much time and kindergartners have zero attention span most kindergarten teachers these days don t have assistants so that means you have to manage a whole class of five year olds while making waffles which is always a mess no fucking way not to mention that five year olds have poorly developed palettes compared to adults they would probably love eggos hell they would love the sheer novelty of waffle day regardless of the food served source i teach kindergarten
my sibling in christ it s a school function involving children i think the last thing teachers staff want to fuck with is making a huge mess with a million ingredients while a bunch of kids wait on them way too much work secondly are you high frozen waffles are good you just sound bitter and snobby
yea and i wish everyone had healthcare and global warming didn t exist but here we are don t shit on the teachers though
no frozen wafffles are shit look at the ingredient list ffs
there is only a handful of ingredients in waffles they take a couple minutes to make if they had maybe teacher and parents per class each with a waffle iron it wouldn t take long a waffle iron would make waffles per time lets say the class is kids can do rounds of irons and have one for each then start again for seconds that or you can make and freeze waffles and toast them just like eggos honestly it is barely less time to toast vs cook them
frozen waffles are good you must be high
as an elementary school teacher i really encourage you to substitute teach in a kindergarten class for a week come back and reread this comment and realize how funny it is just make waffles from scratch for the year olds in a publicly funded classroom what could go wrong and then make seconds i m dying
this was a regular even at my school growing up i ve taken part as a kid and volunteer pretty well went exactly like this everyone would go to the cafeteria parents would volunteer there time and kids never acted up because the best behaved table got served first
spoken like someone with experience in a classroom or being responsible for kids lmao if you re not willing to go do all that yourself while instructing and being responsible for an entire class or more your words are empty but then again you re probably gunna say yuh huh id do it because you won t ever actually have to
i volunteered tons when my son was in elementary he just went into middle we did things like this in his classrooms constantly yes he is in public school and in the us we had a very similar event but it was pancakes or volunteers pre made the batter and we had griddles in the back of the room it didn t take much time at all we didn t just sit there and make the batter during class we pre made it before school and then it sat in the fridge until we cooked them my son has never had a class with kids though my son s classes have all been kids 1st and 2nd were closer to they also did a similar expirement with the kids making ice cream in mason jars then the parent volunteers helped with an ice cream social toppings typically it was funded by the parents dollars per kid kind of thing and lots of parents would do double annonymously to cover those that couldn t afford any extra would go to the next class event experiment
my kids schools have muffins with mom or donuts with dad like every few weeks and it s always made not store bought shit this simply isn t as hard as you make it sound muffins and donuts are harder then waffles to make too
our son s school has too some of the events were in individual classrooms and some like you mention were in the cafeteria the one in my other comment about ice cream social the topping part and kids eating it happened outside they each had a mason jar with their name on it the ice cream they made the pancake one happened in each classroom for his grade would be multiple volunteer parents and we never had issues and absolutely this was in a public school each child would pay like dollars and many parents would pay double to cover those that couldn t afford or the pta would help out with their funds any extra would be left for the next event or go to the pta thanks for making me feel not crazy
no i haven t been the teacher but i absolutely constantly volunteered in my son s classes he was in the middle of 3rd grade when covid hit these were absolutely things we did in my son s publicly funded school we honestly worked to save costs things like eggos were out of the price range allowed no i don t live in a rich area either if i get a chance i would love to be a sub or para educator currently i am making sure my own kiddo is okay and has the help and support he needs medically and volunteer at any opportunity i can i don t understand all the hate as these are absolutely the type of events i helped with through my kiddos schooling and still do
that s fine and i m sure plenty of schools have events down pat in the us schools are funded by local property taxes and fundraising events for the specific school so are completely hit and miss most schools do not have parent volunteers or donations available most classrooms will not have reliable families able to premake batter in a sanitary non contaminated manner fridges available to teachers or the space to have bowls of batter and griddles near available outlets and families available to make food during the work day while the teacher manages a very excited class of 5yos this is for two kindergarten classes so about students in most areas in my state there is no cap on class sizes though teachers usually get extra pay after elementary students i hope the situation is better in canada where this takes place but having read the sun reddit teachers for many years am not sure it is better frozen waffles are easy and loved by kids this is april when most kindergarten teachers are exhausted and the kindergarteners this year were toddlers during covid lockdowns and show many of the repercussions of a stressful pandemic during formative years just some perspective i m glad you volunteered if you can try subbing in kindergarten in a less funded district they will ironically often pay subs quite a bit more too as they are hard to find
devil on shoulder turn it into a meatloaf
if i spent on meat i wouldn t trust anyone else to cook it
just tell them to hc con cac
you say ok that ll be hours from an hour from now do you want to go get arby s
that s not a spontaneous dinner you need to plan for that
a prime rib roast takes several hts to cook low and slow how are you supposed to cook it after work you would be eating super late when i make it i start it at least by pm also i made it recently and the entire roast was under why are they charging you that much per pound
that s so annoying hey son when ya get home from work would you mind roasting some meat for a couple hours
i get it it sucked when my parents would barrage me with things as soon as i had gotten home from school
oh the dad i read this as husband telling her no you will cook
you don t just cook prime rib when you get home it needs to be prepped a day in advance and then proper cooking takes a good hours depending on the method especially with it being as large as that someone is a fucking idiot here fairly sure i know who
lb for ungraded beef is some shit my local boutique butcher would pull hard pass
who the fuck gets an expensive ass prime rib an hour before dinner time that shits supposed to be marinated dry rubbed and slow cooked over an entire day your dad is excellent at wasting a perfectly good cut of meat that s what s actually infuriating here
anyone who s fine with this is mixing up financial stability with a positive relationship this isn t op being a big boy and cooking dinner for himself or even the family this is a three figure responsibility hours of work to be done well dropped on them out of nowhere with a you do this now attitude maybe this was an irresponsible purchase or some shit he got reduced or as a favor or who the fuck knows i was well off as a kid i was broke as a kid i ve been well off as an adult i ve fond banked and dumpster dived as an adult me at any of these stages would look at this and know it s at least a little fucked up
so you have to book hc and cook nightmare
gonna be a late dinner tonight
life s tough when you get lb prime rib
my mum gave me a crayfish once just after i had moved out of home i hated it tasteless about a month after mum oh what did you think of the crayfish me ordinary really very stringy a d tough no taste mum how did you cook it me what do you mean
so how was your midnight prime rib
fuck that if you re spending lets make someone else cook
bucks of ribs fuck yeah i m on my way i ll cook it
no you will cook oh good no i won t
i can immediately identify the people here who have never had to work a real job and also keep a house only lazy privileged baboons can t understand why this is more than mildly infuriating
just boil the thing that will teach them
shoutout sgv
at least it s easy as fuck rub that bitch down with some oil salt pepper garlic rosemary and throw it in an oven for a few hours until it s ready hardest part is having to wait for it to be finished
not the first time i ve seen alexanders meat
it s i assume pm and they want that for dinner tonight there s a few hours prep and cooking in there hope they like a late dinner
it s wild to demand someone cook literally anything much less a prime rib that s like coming home and telling your kid to paint the house with a toothbrush
save that shit for easter sunday
maybe try sub prime rib
a mf like me is saying no but i ll also be finding somewhere else to live
overpriced as hell
maybe you should book a fancy restaurant table for one please
the power i gained when i started telling my family no i swear anyway if i m coming home from working all day especially on days i have night classes i m not cooking anything that takes more than minutes an hour if i m having a manic day it s just a hard no from me and i can maybe do it if you want to make plans like a civilized member of society but especially if you just drop some shit in my dms and say you are doing this i m saying no out of spite fucking ask
let make him cook
damn didn t even ask lol
you just got hit with the the menu treatment
serious question how do you misspell cook as h with a dot under it c
when i was a child i was punished by having to season a steak for some reason and i purposely made it disgusting
that s almost my monthly food bill only a bit smaller than it before inflation almost months
that shit is for the holiday where i live no way i m spending that much on a rib roast
this reminds me of my in laws they would buy one of these and sides on a whim come home throw it on the counter and tell my husband to cook it he is a chef as soon as everyone was done eating every single one of them would dissappear leaving all the dishes as well fuck that
intentionally ruin it i promise this won t happen again
uhhh no in my house if you have a plan for dinner you are the one cooking that dinner im not cooking what you planned
oh boy watch me fuck up dollars worth of meat
i think the price is a bit more infuriating than getting volunteered to cook
i grew up in a very 50s household for parents born in the 70s and when i first moved in with my partner and a roommate culinary student we were asked if we wanted him to cook a steak since he d be having steak that night all we had to do was supply the cut so doing groceries that day i went to the adjacent butcher and picked out a t bone just like i had for my dad many many times a thicker cut just like i had many many times and it cost about for the piece but what did i know i was a former vegetarian moreover my man wanted a steak so a steak i got just like i had for my dad many many times that evening we re all in the kitchen for beers before starting dinner and roommate says dude where s your steak for him in the blue butcher bag in the fridge where s yours roommate produces from the fridge the butcher wrapped hefty cut and a small plastic tray of grocery wrapped economy beef cutlet comparing the pair roommate remarked on what he could afford and all i could say was you said to buy a steak i bought the same steak i would have bought my daddy my partner was bashfully giddy but also saw the humour in being prepared and served a cut as big as his face he made it about thirds of the way through before announcing defeat and the t bone would go on to be alfoiled in the fridge before being treated to the dog the next night i ve since learned that a ribeye or scotch fillet will suffice and my former partner would lovinglt joke when we crossed paths years later about the time i bought him and my dog a steak to share
paid for ribs
i lost my appetite looking at the price of that prime rib
of you have no idea what you re talking about this roast will take 1hr10min 1hr30min for medium rare you cook prime rib for min per lb for med rare
if someone brought me worth of meat i would cook and not complain
did you cook the rib
lbs for prime rib oof
you will cook
it s a receipt for being robbed
glad i don t eat meat i d be broke
not that anyone asked but reverse searing is pretty easy slow cook low temp with meat thermometer till f and then sear on a piping hot skillet minutes each side with some butter and herbs salt pepper steaks that is
why would anyone pay for a pound is beyond me i d rather have tuna steaks for that price you can still get some nice prime steaks for a range
i would go home real late if i were you or come home tomorrow chill at a cheap hotel lol
back when women were women and men were outright savages i said cook it s
that is a special occasion type of cut of meat for me and a good chunk of the day in the kitchen that being said i have never spent anywhere near that amount for a prime rib roast why is this one so expensive does it have gold in it i would be afraid to cook it
lb for prime rib better be some exquisite rare dry aged prime shit
holy blue jesus for a kg of prime rib are they feeding the livestock in merica gold flakes or what it s for a kg of prime rib in south africa i just can t imagine what could possibly make something more expensive despite it being the exact same animal except one is in merica and the other is in africa it s disgustingly expensive
i ll see you tomorrow
the biggest question is that is it actually prime most consumers are so ignorant of actual beef grades that many stores sell choice ribeye as prime rib just because that s what people are looking for although for lb i hope to god it is prime
you know pam in spain they often don t even start eating until midnight
this relationship needs a bit more respect tbh
i must say i checked out the market listed on the package and they look like they have high quality and fresh meat would love to see what that prime rib looked like after cooking
best prime rib i ve had is from a little place in the southern tier of new york called donolli s a family owned joint with their own beef ranch their thursday special was to die for
like prime rib fine i tend to agree with the other comments that a nicely cooked ribeye is and always will be superior but bucks for not even lbs of meat fucking ridiculous
i see dad is speaking ting vit
that is so overpriced lol
the problem is that even using a faster cooking method prime rib is not a fast meal so if they re coming home after work or something that is at a minimum of about hours and the best method would be to smoke or sous vide it which will both take much longer so to spring this on someone is extra stupid
hk
how the fuck do they expect you to cook a prime rib roast for dinner tonight and you aren t even home at 5pm it needs at least hours in the oven not to mention it won t be good without a nice marinade overnight how about we try again in the morning and have a nice dinner tomorrow
hc
i would go berserk internally if my wife bought a piece of beef and then she s apparently drinking and can t cook it
nothing like getting home tired and starting a dinner that won t be ready for another hours also is insane hope that s for a big family
cook prime rib after work are you eating dinner at 3am
i completed understand but also like free prime rib
jesus dad you have a seizure
thanks dad for paying dollars that you worked so hard for uggggg i have to cook and eat expensive prime rib i m so poor and like a slave to my parents
bro you get to cook prime rib it will be very yummy
thanks bad mad dad thanks dad
man i gotta say cooking prime after a long day can seem inconvenient however please don t take for granted how lucky you are to have parents who a like your cooking b will drop on prime rib for the cause i don t have much groceries in my house lately and i will usually jump at the opportunity to utilize my dads kitchen and ingredients to cook especially if they clean up and i can return home to my clean kitchen afterwards lol
what s the problem
see the world crumble when they ask for their steak well done
no offense but the reason meat is so high is that there are idiots that will pay for it that price is bullshit and whoever bought it is just stupid
are you by any chance a chemistry teacher with lung cancer
having spent much on prime filet mignon prime ribeye and regular old marinated tritips the current house favorite is the tritip followed by the filet and they both make great carne asada burritos i have always been disappointed in the ribeyes and i do like prime rib
to be honest i prefer to cook the prime rib than my wife
you will book it
i feel you bud or i guess the positive note is that they re not gonna route piece of meat
i honestly love cooking but don t cook one or two nights during the week if work kicked my ass i buy a lot of food but people know if they buy good food i will always cook it no matter how i feel if someone buys some good meat like that i m going to cook it because if they try to it will probably be a very expensive waste of meat
center cut top sirloin preferred or whatever is at good price at the time even flat iron steaks sous vide at for 45mins 1hour quick sear at end this is how i ve been doing my steaks for years since i don t have a bbq or decent stove that maintains proper temp it s perfectly medium rare everytime never overdone juicy and melty and never steered me wrong
don t be a dick help cook i m so mad i have to cook this expensive piece of meat wah
jesse you have to cook
people who demand others cook are people who need to learn how
a pound at that price you aren t far off from just going out to eat
spoiled rat
do they also store open flour upside down on the top shelf
were they inebriated
ok but seriously how did they manage to not fit it in the right hole
does she wear glasses are they the correct prescription
i hope you have a good lock on your bedroom door because you my friend live with a psychopath
it s the correct way around
that s actually awesome in some ways just really having zero f cks hahahaha i mean annoying for for sure but geez total anarchy with this they probably shoved papers just straight into his backpack with no care i m actually jealous now that i am thinking about this more
they re sending you a message i don t know what it is but from the looks i d deff take it serious
so how long have you been living with a psychopath
it s harder to do that way complete dick move time for a new roommate
who hurt them
no way do they make other simple things in life harder
fuck it plus for novel presentation
i see he put it the wrong way as well it goes under not over
i have done this after the roll falling out of my hand and onto the bathroom floor and unwrapping itself all the way down the hallway i rolled it back up without caring at all how it looked and stuck it on there toilet paper rolls always fall and gain momentum so they roll and unwrap it s like how they roll
probably wipes their ass back to front
it s not rocket science
siri how do i set an automatic reminder to notify me when the toilet paper roll is empty
dude certainly put in effort can t say he was lazy
task failed successfully
they have a weird way of saying stop using my toilet paper
is your mate i ve seen this before
time for a new flatmate
this is the revenge of a person who came in to one square left
sure it s annoying but you can sleep well knowing he s going to hell
ha ha precision sliding into the roll
nailed it
do they eat banana s without peeling
my first thought too there better have been liquor involved
been there done that got slapped
gotta spit on it first
she could wear coke bottles and have a prosthetic arm still wouldn t justify this
do they drink boiling water then eat pasta
i have heard of people eating oranges with the peeling
gif giphy bbjdwrosm7nta downsized
i had a friend in middle school who would do this as a party trick wanna see me eat an orange like an apple
they re not going to fix that haha
if you re renting that s never getting fixed as its not broken just non symmetrical if you re not renting then its on you
misaligned doorknobs
eileen shouldn t be installing door knobs
googly knobs
i feel like one of the doors might be on there backwards or upside down
closet knobs look like bargain basement boob job
non serious answer the doorknobs are drunk serious answer the doorknobs are not levelled and aligned with each other
knob needs realigned and polished
right side doors because the installer was lazy
come adjust my lopsided steel balls
my closet doors are drunk
those pantry doors look like idaho to me haha
towel rack needs adjustment
closet doorknobs not level
low hanging knob
uneven doorknobs on cabinets if that s what they are
the door itself needs to be flipped vertically and re hung it s on upside down right now
i should call her

doorknobs hung by knobhead
just like your nuts
uneven doorknobs
aren t the holes pre drilled
are these folding doors i moved to a new house recently and they have the knobs on the second segment instead of the first so you can t use the knobs to close the doors lol
diagoknobs
you don t unless you want to give your landlord an example of unreasonable and petty requests to point at when he inevitably fails to fix half the things you write
they aren t going to fix that there s nothing wrong with the door knobs they are just annoying to look at
gif giphy 10jhvifuu2gwd6
right door knobe off by inch and half
closet door handles resemble ex girlfriends breast
that doesn t look like a locking door knob will take minutes and a drill screwdriver to change it around if so
this would drive me fucking nuts but i probably wouldn t put in a work order for it as long as it s functional

art deco
they probably didn t measure the entire door correctly and then measured one from the top and one from the bottom
condemn the house you can t put up with that
uneven knob
easy fix tilt your head when the doors are in view
someone beat me to it but the word you re looking for is misaligned
was a door installed updside down
your landlords are not gonna fix that lol i know i wouldn t
my nobs needs to be aligned can you straighten my nobs i feel like this sounds a bit nsfw
so avant garde
say goodbye to these
they were going for a unique look that s all
one ball hangs lower than the other
the lopsided titty closet needs to be fixed but as others said they totally won t do shit about it
my brother in christ i just bought a house and you d have a field day if that s the worst you ve found lol
smh the shit some not all tradesman get away with
uneven knobs might not come off as intended
this picture wouldn t that be better than i don t know cattywumpus doorknob placement
it doesn t matter you list it anyway so they cannot try tk force you to fix it on move out
guess you have to break it first
this is correct
bra lol
neighbour had tilt as her license plate took me years to connect that her name was eileen
come on eileen
haha love this
the recessed panels are in the same spots and so both slabs are installed correctly the knob on the left is centered between the recessed panels the one on the right is not the right slab was drilled in the wrong spot
ive seen this happen before if the doors are those doors that have spring loaded pins that click into place on both the top and bottom they are sometimes symmetrical and yes this could be inside out upside down
that s what i was thinking too
was just coming here to say this flip the door over and reverse the door handle problem solved
i m a woman sorrily no nuts here
uh yeah
nope and usually they are in the middle of the doors not close to seam like that
diagoknob alley
be pretty much impossible to cover up that hole with the same fake wood grain pattern and texture you could pretty easily prove this wasnt you
if it s not documented then they can simply claim you must have broken the door and replaced it wrong because there is no record of the mismatch i have seen individual landlords and companies try to pull this crap
that s sadly believable actually
that fucking smiley at the end after the quote
i would never go back there again
based on the percentages your bill must have been
wow i didn t think that was legal
post this under their google yelp reviews they are embarrassing themselves
where is it legal to pay the waitstaff nothing at all
remember to pay your employees
bro the title really made me laugh lmfao tip culture has really gotten out of hand lately i m vehemently against it i d rather they be paid an actual wage and i d pay a couple more extra dollars for my food like if they were all paid a decent wage and the business slightly raises prices that ll come out to less money spent going out than these crazy tip amounts just my two cents
i would rip that part off and leave it on the table lmao
in australia minimum wage is around usd they legally have to pay on sundays and on public holidays tipping culture is not a thing here it s appreciated to tip but not in anyway expected at a more high end restaurant you d get a lot more tips but they get to keep additional tips too seems like theft expecting the customer to pay the wages so the business can further profit
tipping will never end in america because the staff don t want it to they make too much money this is why it pisses me off when i read in here about skint hospitality staff they aren t skint they make triple what i do so they need to stop trying to make people feel bad about not tipping
https://preview.redd.it/eufl8k1ua9sa1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60d111ffc1983d8815a18d44da7efe24b9f9cea2 meanwhile
remember i don t pay my employees have a good day
remember we don t pay or employees and will lowkey guilt trip you to do it instead
playing on emotions will backfire why would you eat at a restaurant where the servers are treated as slaves
not my fault it s literally illegal here and i supported the minimum wage increase
i use to be a waitress despite the fact of barely getting an hourly pay i made a crap load of tips also people keep in mind your waitress waiter also doesn t claim their cash tips and that means they don t pay taxes on it
who is fault is that guess i should make my own post in this sub
i would write i dont care thats your problem remember slavery was forbidden but it is a duplicated copy so it would be useless v v
i hate this tipping culture in america when i went for vacation to new york i went to a starbucks in manhattan i there was a self service computer which allowed me to order my coffee and pay as well when i got to the counter to pick up my coffee i was given a tablet by the person who delivered my coffee from the machine to the counter and the tablet asked me how big of a tip do i wish to give fak off i know these workers make shit but hell no i wasn t served i m not using tip for someone who just pressed a button on a coffee machine and moved said coffee from one place to another stupid america
lol that makes me want to tip less nor more begging is not attractive
if you re not tipping the wait staff in cash why even bother absolutely no way to guarantee they re seeing any of it anyway
this is why i am done eating out unless absolutely necessary fyck the tipping economy get better service in europe with no tipping
and who s fault is that labor laws fault
we don t pay our employees please give the poor bastards some of your scraps
only one way to fight back against tip culture guys stop going to the restaurants don t reward negative behavior vote with your wallet etc eventually they will come around
i hate tip culture with a passion charge me a couple extra dollars for the goods service and leave me out of your wage negotiations
remember it s your job to pay your fucking staff you cheap c t
whose
they say that to make us feel bad yet they don t feel bad for not paying their employees absolute scum
so glad we aren t forced pressured to tip in japan
whose
whose
and this is where the european visitor decides to write an economics lesson on the check instead of tipping the server who just busted ass for a solid hour
whose
this blows my mind as a european
as a customer why should i care i care about spending as little as possible not there to save the world
of course they don t have a salary because they re paid hourly i m very confused about both this receipt and this post
lol i would not tip
perhaps i don t know the unspoken rules of reddit but can someone explain why we crop out the name of said restaurant establishment maybe the only way to break the culture of tip dependency is if we stop giving our business to restaurants that don t treat their staff with respect ex not giving them fair wages
i m not a fan of the attempted guilt trip
just want to say that if this is the us if a server doesn t make enough tips to get from their base pay to minimum wage the employer is legally obligated to make up the difference tipped employees make minimum wage unless they make more tips just sharing to make more people aware was a server for years
is it illegal not to pay your workers
tipping has gotten out of control everyone thinks they need a tip now
wow thanks for putting in writing you are part of the problem restaurant it might as well have said we don t pay our staff a living wage we suck
suggested wtf
imagine taking a job with no salary
what i don t understand is the concept that since a waitress waiter is supposed to be kind of a service that they get get tipped for giving good service how does that translate to being the only job that allows the company not to pay them minimum wage a tip should just be a tip like someone went above and beyond so you feel like they deserve extra shouldn t be required because the government and business don t pay their workers
just imagine someone actually thought that putting this at the end of a receipt is a good idea what really makes this asshole level of is the smiley face
small business owners are just as terrible as corporate ceos they just screw over their employees on a much smaller scale so you hear about it less
remember we exploit our workers by not paying them a living wage and then guilt trip you our customer into making up for it
if the aren t getting paid do they technically even work there
remember your waiter is a modern slave thank you
remember i don t have to pay your employees
remember we are fucking slavers so give those beggar waiters some money so we can take our share aswell
start paying them properly use tips as a way to encourage exceptional customer service not as a way to live
we are assholes who doesn t pay their employees thank you for visiting us
well that s kind of a two way street plenty of waiters that i have known and heard from have stated that they prefer to make their living through tips as opposed to a flat rate hourly pay because they make a lot more through tips than they ever could through a flat wage not all of them of course but the ones that work in high traffic locations trendy spots can pull down anywhere between a night easy not to mention that they prefer cash tips because they always have the option of not declaring all tips if they are paid in cash
what the fuck how they don t have a salary tipping culture should be stopped just fucking pay your employees you greedy assholes
we re a piece of shit because we don t pay our employees
it s bad but it s not the customers problem the employer needs to pay its workers better not let customers pick up the slack
the tipping game has gotten ridiculous
employee they agreed to taking the job
and remember it s not your patron s duty to make up for you not paying your employees this patronizing borderline bullying of patrons to force a tip is complete bullshit and has grown out of hand tipping should never be expected it s an offering to an employee who goes out of their way to make sure your service is above par
remember to eat somewhere else because we don t pay our staff well
tip get a job with a salary
if you cant afford to leave a tip you cant afford to eat out on the same token if you cant afford to pay your employees you cant afford to be in business simple
yep tip and never return unless the service was outstanding tipping culture is getting ridiculous pay your damn employees
i don t tip and won t support the idea of allowing employers to pay their workers less while passing it off as the customers fault
that s not legal
i m a bartender who depends on tips for bills and i find this despicable earn your tips don t beg for them provide good service get good tip that s how it works
if i was an employer i would pay all staff a fair wage just saying
if they cant pay their employees then the company doesnt deserve payment for the meal it s only fair
if i saw this i d never go back give them a terrible review and i d be kinda pissed as the waiter too
i hate people who think they re entitled to other peoples money
tip fuck right off in a reasonable society where workers are treated properly i should be able to look at a menu and work out what i m going to have to spend without having to do complicated math based on how i don t know whether the staff get a decent wage a shit wage based on topping up with tips or no wage at all the standard usage is that if you can get overtime you re on a wage if you re expected occasionally to put in additional time because you get paid better than the staff on wages that s when you are on a salary nobody expects wait staff to be on a salary
name and shame this place what the fuck
tip culture needs to die out pay your employees you cheap fucks
friendly reminder that we exploit our employees and expect you to feel like that s your fault
my tip perhaps they should
murricans and their word salads to cover up how crooked their country is
just never tip i never tip nor do i plan to why the fuck should i pay for the food i already paid for madness i d just pay for the food leave and never come back matter of fact just go to places that don t do this if you can find any
i don t think anyone s saying it s your fault it s a way for the min wage workers to silently protest their bosses and the restaurant into actually paying a wage they can live on
hmmm nice play on words of course restaurant workers don t get paid salary you get paid hourly
partly yours for being a patron to the industry
give me the name of the restaurant need to take my father there to explode on them for this he has habit of doing that
they need to find a dam job then
i ve been to some bars that use volunteer bartenders so they kinda expect over think places like elks lodges moose eagles clubs etc unless this was something non profit ish like that employees need to be paid at least per hour and in many states like mine the full minimum wage before their tips
you re welcome see you again never
why the fuck people work there who works without a salary and hope to get a tip wtf
remember we are putting the responsibility on you
remember we re greedy shitbags so we rely on you to pay twice so our slav i mean workers can have a living wage
bro what the fuck
what a cruel thing to admit to on a receipt
never eat there again
tipping is an archaic practice and completely unfair to workers
thanks god people delivering food to us restaurants cooks and restaurant cleaners have salary
we know who is fault that is s
exactly i have not and will not ever pay a tip to an employee performing their job if they aren t happy with the pay don t take the job
hmmmm maybe the employer should pay their employees i guess that s how employment works sounds reasonable to me
where tf you bowling at the goddamn moon
are the balls made of gold this is more than top golf who can afford this
thats like bucks an hour where the fuck are you going
haha the bowling alley near me literally does all you can bowl on wednesdays edit had to look it up to verify they upped it to now but it includes shoe rental unlimited video games they have an arcade there
that s insane surprised they didn t ask for a tip
when the fuxk did bowling get so expensive
i thought this couldn t possible be true but then i price checked at our local bowlero and damn it was crazy
are you renting the lanes in some fancy fucks basement alley
event fee i m the fucking event if i m the one bowling i really hope whatever alley this is goes out of business
you get your videos for tik tok your pics for the gram you throw a few balls down the lane for said videos and pics and congratulations you ve ruined it for everybody that just wants to bowl by making this place a hot spot or maybe they re just shit and nobody should bowl there i don t know
bowlero
suddenly bowling is an event
holy shit i remember paying games for a buck once upon a time
they charge more online all the bowling alleys near me are generally jam packed when i get in there i go when there s unlimited bowling for bucks
i paid less to do an escape room with a group of than you d be paying to go bowling with a group of what the actual fuck
two and half hours on a friday why are you surprised
bowlero has fucking ruined local bowling i hope all of their c suite chokes on a bag of dicks
just a local bowling alley down the street no where fancy at all lol
i ve got a place near me that does thursday shoe rental and per person per game the only problem is getting there early enough to get a lane
bingo
they and brunswick zone i refuse to frequent either i like my bowling alleys to be dives where the smell of old cigarette smoke is permanently infused into the drywall even though smoking hasn t been allowed indoors in years here there s only one left within a mile radius of me and it s in a sorta sketchy area but at least the food is good
bruh just go to brunswick it s like
haha yea i had an alley that did the same thing on tuesdays we bought bowling shoes and would go all the time eventually we kinda just petered out as we kinda had our fill
yep i think it s cheaper if you go in and ask for a lane there s usually a wait but it is cheaper i think i went with others lane game it was like a person
a person for bowling even if they charge for shoe rental anything more than per game is bullshit because a game is already a rip off
yeah it s a rip off there aren t really other bowling alleys where i am though but i m not a bowler i will say i got drunk as shit off of their long island iced tea so in the moment forgot how much money i had spent
why can t they use their own towels
this sub is called mildly infuriating what you are dealing with here is a monster
i think that makes it her towel now she owes you one of hers in exchange
just tell her hey were you using this towel for your face i sure hope not because i wiped my ass alllll over it like i really get in there you might wanna get checked for pink eye honestly and she ll probably stop using your towel
use hers to wipe your butt to establish dominance
have you told them to stop
maybe kindly recommend demand she buys some microfiber makeup remover towels from amazon or whatever that wash clean of makeup instead of your white ones that will most definitely stain i would never use a white light washcloth of anyone s not even my own to remove makeup def fully infuriating
homegirl needs to discover some micellar water before washing her face it would solve a lot of this issue
omg no i m getting flashbacks to working in a hotel where airline stewardesses in training stayed and they always did this we even left make up wipes in their rooms that stuff never comes out we ended up turning so many perfectly good hand towels into rags
is there a fucking disrespectful sub that s where this belongs
oh she wouldn t be doing that much longer if she were my roommate
itt people who don t understand that women with more melanin need darker face make up
i bought brown towels orange towels pink towels each has its it s own designated use saves the heartbreaking sight of makeup covered white towels also i keep in sight the disposable wipes specifically for makeup for those towels try extra strength oxy for laundry spray miracles occur
i d say you re not wiping your face on that right because that s the towel i use to wipe my ass
does she do this regularly have you asked her to stop
i as a melanated person would politely ask her to stop wiping her butt with your towels i know it s foundation but that would make me so self conscious about it that i would never do it again
use her towels to wipe the shitoff your ass
i do that too but use my own towels
i got a charge from a hotel like that from my gf taking her make up off they said there is a dirty towel and i was like
as someone who wears makeup this seems petty i don t know a single person who uses a dry white towel to take off makeup it stains and is not easy to get off many being waterproof most of the time you need wipes remover or soap to get that caked up stuff off even then i have a couple of specific dark rags just for this your roomie is doing this out of spite imo definitely a dick move
you should post this on the bad roommates sub reddit
that s effed i was going to chime in to say that using towels to remove makeup is perfectly normal then i realized i misread and didn t catch that you wrote your towels good lord
yea i used to live with some annoying rich girl that did this was completely ridiculous and she kept denying it and acting like some hoodlem musta broke in and done it
that s still horrible and gross but waaaaaay better than what i thought that was before reading the title lol
tell her next time wash her face first
put hot sauce on it see what happens next
this post is extremely aggravating
use hers to wipe your butt
what person is using _towels_ to get their makeup off somebody get this woman some makeup wipes
bro fuck roommates i just got mine out over a month ago they decided to finally give me back my missing towels when they moved didn t even tell me they had them and lied when i asked if they took them as i was missing a few they were full of old and crusty pee and shit from their dog i only found them when i went to go and get some plastic grocery bags from the hallway closet to clean out my cats litter box the smell was uhg they were missing for months i threw away towels
sphincter eye liner
these comments are infuriating me more than the actual situation
get her some makeup melting balm elf has a great one for it will save both your towels and her face she ll love it and will never want to go without it one time purchase and i bet you she will start buying it regularly https://www.elfcosmetics.com/holy-hydration-cleansing-balm/59910.html?utm_content=gpla&gclid=eaiaiqobchmiv-zvqf2t_givtjatbh1a9g_weaqyayabegjhzpd_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds
removed
your roommate bought your towels
when your done using your towel spray it with pepper spray that way next time she uses it you ll get a laugh when she finds out just be sure to replace the towel before it s next use that heathen must be stopped
what the shit ever heard of something called makeup wipes so sorry about your towels my dude
each day i m thankful i don t have to put up with a roommates bullshit
think you should be using her towel to wipe your nasty shitty ass with
easy solution get brown towels
ma am i believe you dropped your face in the bathroom
she needs to buy black washcloths and that is super rude
on a white towel too gif giphy f8ldluiwj7yqttds3l downsized
one of my roommates used to wipe their toothpasty lips on my towel till i reminded them i wipe my dick with that
holy shit that lady needs to learn about makeup remover sheets why is she using something non disposable for removing makeup she needs to buy you new towels this is unacceptable
do some dusting with her makeup brushes make sure you get behind the toilet too
i bet there s something you could wipe with her towels that would make them look even more gross and be even less appreciated might make the point though you might end up needing a new roommate might get one who respects your things though
tell her to stop or do a good deed and buy her a towel or tell her to buy one since apparently she can afford makeup
reading some of these comments as a black woman is interesting lmao people will do mental gymnastics to refuse acknowledging that someone isn t white
the comments are bordering on racist i don t like it here
why are you sharing towels
i run an airbnb i specifically had to put in my rules not to remove makeup with the white towels it s dumb we have to tell people that
start leaving them in outside her room
she needs some cotton pads and micellar cleansing water
gif giphy mdk97sopgp08vzsdcq downsized
looks like your roommate just bought a towel at the used to be white sale
get a new roommate
it s so weird because it looks like she used a dry towel to wipe off her face like why wouldn t you wet your face wash it and then dry it on a towel so there s not all this makeup residue still should be her own damn towel and not yours i use micellar water and then wash my face with an oil cleanser because i don t want anything left on my face or towels maybe you need to venmo charge her the cost of the towels she ruined give those to her and tell her she can t use any of your towels ever again or hide them in your room if you have to
i wipe my makeup off sometimes a little trace not all of it using a towel funny enough i use my own towels instead of towels belonging to other people i live with
rude
no
that s a rough way to remove makeup
using a white towel for that is just actively being an asshole
at least it s better than what i thinking from what it looks like
my girlfriends niece once spray tanned her legs on the carpet of the flat we were renting there was a hugh v in the middle of the room my misses said why does she need to tan that high it s fucking winter
there s a comedy routine about this guy got himself a new girlfriend and was horrified one day to notice brown stains on all his towels he discovered later on it was makeup but realizing that he d stuck around long enough to learn that he concluded that the relationship must have been for real
buy her a five dollar makeup eraser cloth
tell her to use toilet paper to take off the worst of the makeup and then use a makeup remover and a wet washcloth to take of the rest maybe buy her makeup wipes and tell her to use those from now on she owes you new towels
my wife used to use articles of clothing shirts sports bra socks you name it she was my girlfriend at the time thankfully she stopped fairly quickly after me asking what the actual fuck are you doing a few times
tell her to get her own designated towels case closed yw
it s time for you to find a new roommate
drop a cut up ghost pepper in some water let it soak overnight strain then put in a spray bottle and mist your towel let dry and enjoy the entertainment
put a thin spread of ben gay on your towels
had an ex do that one time she used a makeup remover that had some element that reacted like a bleach to my towels it was weeks before i noticed anything but by then every single towel hand towel and wash cloth i had was a tie dye mess
hey who the hell used my butthole towel to wipe off their makeup
use her towel to wipe your ass problem solved
you should tell her to stop doing that and buy you new towels or kick her out and find another roomie who doesn t act like an animal
remove your towels from common areas
the slight pinkish hue on the outer stitching to the left just makes me feel like she s on her period and used your towel so worse
now wipe your ass on their towels
wipe your ass with hers establish domio
wipe you ass with her sheets
use her towel to wipe your ass
use her towel to wipe your ass
use her towels to wipe your ass
take all your towels out of the bathroom and put a lock on the door
that is so disrespectful you should say something and if she does it again after you ask her not to dump her ass with the bills
use her pillow to wipe your ass
start wiping your ass with it all the makeup in the world won t cover pink eye
that s mildly infuriating to you
oh dont worry this is a very common practice beteween inconsiserate bitches that is
use hers to wipe ur ass
you should start using her towels to wipe your ass
use hers to wipe your butt
as soon as i read wipe
i expected to read my roomate uses my towel to wipe her ass im disapointed now
i d use her towel to wipe my asshole and tell her it s my makeup
god damn that s make up i always thought my girlfriend is cleaning her but with it xd
at least that s what she said
my roommate does this too one of my biggest pet peeves of hers her biggest pet peeve of mine is that i refer to her as my roommate instead of my wife
this is the second post i ve seen on this same thing as a relatively tall person there is no way it hell this is more comfortable than sitting normally
hey at least he got shoes on
if i was in the seat infront it would be my time to recline back let s see how flexible this person is
why don t flight attendants deal with this crap keep your feet down i mean it s fairly obvious
if someone put there feet near my head like that they soon wouldn t after i have words
airplanes really amplify the worst in humanity
a selfish one
oh we d be having words
flexible assholes
i can t see how they feel comfortable like that because it sure does not look comfortable that s for sure
these are people that go through life and never face repercussions but suppose everyone took a photo of this person and posted it on social media then eventually karma will bite them in the ass
a trumpanzee
one willing to face the ankle rope of death
i m too impressed to be irritated i couldn t fold myself in half like that with two assistants and a magic wand
someone who intentionally did it hoping it will end up in reddit
a contortionist apparently how tf is that comfortable
i honestly just wish i was flexible and thin enough to do that
trash monster that s who does this shit on a plane
we call this verdammter hurensohn in german and i think it s beautiful
at least they left the shoes on i guess
how come people let them do this how come the person who sit in front of this pos doesn t smack down his legs and start yelling
i m flying to puerto rico in three weeks and i keep seeing posts like these i really hope i don t come across anyone s nasty ass feet on my flight
one that no one said anything to
not anyone sitting behind me i would not be having any of that shit
just be glad they left their shoes on
at least kept his shoes on
same weakchinned pussyfart who wears tight slip on shoes with no socks and long pants
a selfish twat that s who
the amount is these posts and posts with girls having their hair behind the seats in actually infuriating tell the flight attendants and they will tell these people to stop
why blame other people when its obviously a airline issue yes people are weong for it but can we get to the root of the problem society is either going to get broken by this giga economy or were going to nicely and neatly slice responsibility til we the people take care of ourselves love ya ll
ooo laceless monsters are the worst usually worn with leggings and known to be dangerous when suddenly awakened they are more intelligent than their sock in crocs relatives
it sucks but also planes are uncomfortable as hell and sometimes you gotta do you and try knew things
real question is how does it affect you at all you appear to be sitting quite far away
i don t see the big deal with peoples feet up am i missing something they re not touching anybody
myob
that doesn t even look comfortable who the fuck are these people
nah that s just the aussie bloke
somebody who hasn t been told to get their stinking shoes off the back of my seat before i make it an issue bee otch
a flexible one
pray for turbulence
who lets someone do this
someone that could probably suck their own dick
stretching the back of your legs and blood flow can make that have a releiving feeling it s simply way into inconsiderate and being a boar though you can discipline yourself to your own space for a few hours to make the flght go smoothly and with no more stress than neccessary for everyone with just a touch of thoughtfulness
why don t waitresses tell them to stop i mean you wouldn t be allowed to do this in a conventional sit down restaurant so what gives
you shoulda told me my ankles were ashey gah damn
she s a recliner too one more strike and i would put her on the no fly list
this person has dishes in their room covered in mould and half finished iced coffees going off in the bottles
im trying to figure out how the hell this is remotely comfortable
i used to do this a limber year old glad we didn t have phones and internet back then
i m trying to figure out how it s remotely polite
i don t know if that s any better instead of smelly feet now he is potentially dropping dirt dust and grime over someone s head
the whole half an inch youd recline would really show them hahaha
nothing makes me more annoyed than when i m using my tray table to sleep and the person in front of my puts their seat aaaaaaaalll the way back like you butthole there s no way that degree incline makes you soooo relaxed
seats on spirit don t recline
could be some dumb corporate policy to not do so because the guy may get mad that it s not ok to act as if everyone else is an npc and then not fly with the airline again oh no a loss corporate says we can t be having that
that sounds like an oxymoron
the person next to him takes a photo and posts it on reddit
agreed there is a very simple solution to all of this just tell them they have three seconds to move their feet off of your seat or you ll do it for them

knew things try a dictionary
try it sometime and see what kind of reaction you get you know for science
its not i m sure this person looks like there trying to suck themselves off and there ass is slowly falling off the edge of the seat and when they get uncomfortable they ll try to get up then fall and get stuck between the seats
i don t lean it back if feet are on my headrest the seat is coming back butthole
idk why your being down voted but had the same experience hour flight and the couple in front of us decided to recline their seats all the way down in a way that left both the meal tray and screen unusable for pretty much half of the flight
the recline doesn t move the tray table so it doesn t affect you if my seat reclines i m going to recline it every time
depends on the airline but you re on the right track everyone is so afraid of getting an hr call over some fuckhead claiming to be offended it s total garbage and those garbage animals need to be called out on it want to be treated like a person and not an animal ok act like one source i fly too damned much
i would definitely have no issue contacting the flight attendant to take care of the situation i am not trying to be on a no fly list
beautiful eventhough its not a haiku absolutely beautiful
oh i agree feet up hell no seat not in the upright position allowed but i m gonna think about putting little pieces of paper in your hair the whole time
nah but it like squishes your head it absolutely moves the entire seat
also i didn t realize this is an unpopular opinion lol the more you know
the real question is how d they get the cap off hmm
a gallon of elmer s glue bruh
at least it didn t run its shit encrusted ass through it like the other guy s cat did
why were you storing it in the middle of the floor you may be able to peel it up once it dries the spill sucks op sorry to see it happened to you
ha this is only a mild disaster you could have had an elmer s cat
you had a gallon of glue clearly not capped securely and cats then you took a nap you brought this on yourself
i have a weird urge to dip a chocolate chip cookie into that
the irresponsibility is what s infuriating
talk about a sticky situation
the only thing you should be infuriated in is yourself who leaves glue out in the open with the cap off and has animals in the house irresponsible af
few questions what the fuck do you need a gallon of glue for why are you storing it on the floor and what appears to be just in the middle of the fucking room especially since you have cats who are kinda known for knocking things over how did they get the cap off if it got knocked over while you were sleeping why does it look very much still liquid like it was just poured out how did they manage to get what appears to be every last drop out of the jug just by knocking it over
was really hoping it was milk until i saw elmer s glue in the title
who the fuck keeps a gallon jug of elmer s glue on the floor amd dosent fully twist the cap closed
imagine picking that much glue off your fingertips
why wouldn t you tighten the cap ya dunce
bro blame whomever didn t close the cap and not the cat
you can blame the cat all you want it s your fault take some responsibility and don t leave caps open
you did that yourself downvote
i can smell this picture
elmer s glue is usually water soluble so there s that
my girlfriend likes to make slime is your girlfriend
put your hand in it you know you want too
bet youll screw the cap all the way on next time huh damn lazy cappers
that s a sticky situation
why is your girlfriend making slime on the carpet
your girlfriend tipped it over the cat was just a tool
absolutely infuriating but who in their right mind has a jug of elmer s glue just sitting around in their home and not in the pantry or in a cabinet
so a few questions why do you own an entries gallon of elmers glue how did it get to the middle of the floor how did the screw cap come off
if only cats were somehow predictable on this subject
why would you leave a huge jug of glue laying around without the cap on it especially knowing you have a cat who love to knock things over
the real question is why do you have gallons of anything sitting around in any area they could be knocked over especially if you have cats of all animals the pets notorious for pushing things over and knocking things off of counters
so its just in the middle of the carpet and the lid was clearly not closed or you jus opened and dumped it
geez i hope they didn t think it was milk
you re sniffing glue wrong
personally i have a two liter bottle of super glue for when the cats act up
don t cry over spilled
who needs a gallon of glue
i thought it was milk but this is even worse
who tf keeps a gallon of glue with the cap off especially when they have cats must of been sniffing it lmao
why do you have an open gallon of elmers glue on your carpet
i was looking at the top and bottom as if there were photos
my question is why do you need a gallon of glue what are you glueing
who in the hell needs a gallon of elmer s and also why is it in the middle of the room on the floor
roll around in it and peel it off
if it only had a cap to prevent such disaster maybe suggest to elmers
my guy why are you keeping a half opened bottle of elmers glue out in the open
wow if only someone would invent lids
maybe you should ve tightened the cap
this seems like everyone except the cats fault
can t blame the cats
on the bright side at least you don t have a million little white paw prints everywhere
how did they open the lid
a who the fuck has a gallon of glue are you a professional children s arts and crafts artist b who the fuck keeps a gallon of glue on the floor c who the fuck keeps a gallon of glue on the floor with the cap off d who the fuck keeps a gallon of glue on the floor with the cap off and has cats
if you set and opened gallon of elmer s glue in your floor and expect good things to happen next i feel like you ve just played yourself
why do you have glue in the middle of the floor
forbidden milk
no point crying over spilt glue
who purchases a gallon of elmer s glue
seems like your cats got you in a sticky situation
that s not elmers glue
i m sure this actually happened
i left a puddle like that after no nut november
this is why only of the population call themselves cat people
there was a ghost this is ectoplasm gif giphy lzpwntmokbrdg
this post confuses me your girlfriend left the glue out in middle of the floor and didn t fully close it then your cat knocked it over but the glue looks like it was poured out instead of being knocked over i think op did this
your cats really put you in a sticky situation
bro actually left this shit where a cat could knock it over and then acts like it s the cats fault nice
why wasn t your glue lid screwed down can t blame your cat for that oversight
just a few more well placed words and your post is extremely hilarious
i would say don t cry over spilled milk i have not said don t cry over spilled glue so commence
well it s no use crying over spilt oh oh no
you mean you spilt it obviously cat did nothing
good news let it dry and rip it up
glue the cat
that looks like less than a gallon
another fine example of cats belonging outside
it s funny how much of this sub involves cats being dicks
mop it up with the cats they will learn
my cat knocked over a bottle of olive oil felt
not cats fault
wait till it dries and then peel it all up in one swoop motion then cut it up mix it in with the cats food and feed it to them
why do you have such a large bottle of glue
at first glance i thought that was milk so did your cats i guess
forbidden milk
man it was on carpet to that fucking sucks
rip that carpet
no crying over spilled milk ig
stop sniffing glue homie
don t cry nvm
is that carpet or tile if it s tile thank your lucky stars
nothing like trying to go to bed and your cat throws up on your carpet
yeah that s right it s elmer s glue nothing to see here
seems like it s your fault for not putting the cap on tight
why is there a gallon of elmer s in the middle of floor
no use in crying over spilt milk
who has this much glue
just pick it up and put it back in
killm it
where s hasbulla when you need em
kinda dumb like most other comments but hey if you let it dry it will be easier to clean up
that say s fuck all the others to me
you ve insulted your slug dorm mates
fuck salt
what kind of monster does this
so unkind im sorry
i see satan visited
save your kindness for those that will appreciate it
a salt assault
print the photo with the text this is why you lost the free salt
looks like the container got wet the salt got hard and someone tore it open to get some salt out then left the mess behind i d put it in a waterproof container next time like maybe a salt shaker
to much salt is very bad for your diet this is a little extreme however
someone wrote a note on my empty peanut container that said every one of them sucked
i bet you feel salty
pasta water insufficiently salted hulk mad
this is fucking hilarious
very few animals would even do this
what did you learn
do you live with a rabid dog what ever liquid tbh prob water is there looks like slobber
next time leave a decoy box of salt filled with laundry detergent powder jackholes
looks like salt lick now pretty appropriate for the one or more animals living there
so someone got the counter all wet and it compromised the cardboard box
sounds like you re pretty salty about the situation
please tell me this is a tourette s guy reference
don t talk shit about total
don t you mean salt an
it was assalted you mean
yeah the box looks wet
it is lol
sounds like what weird al would name his parody of that one marilyn manson song lol
i love a wet box but who doesn t ugh i just bummed myself out
why didn t i think of this
you and i just collaborated is all haha i just thought it s funny salt an i also listened to the song earlier so that helped too picturing the music video of al just in the kitchen seasoning shit singing aggressively at the salty foods like fries
i saw weird al in concert and you listened to the song earlier i think the summoning is complete edit forgot to tag the legend himself u alyankovic
takes two to tango baby
excatly
this is similar to zero calories water isn t it
ban dihydrogen monoxide it s in our food it s in our atmosphere it s in our water literally anyone that ingests this stuff eventually dies people actually signed this shit
this cheap shit again i don t drink anything less than double hydrogen infused oxygen
no it s real gas bubbles added to the liquid apparently https://www.webmd.com/diet/hydrogen-water-health-benefits
just gonna put this here cause i m sure lots of people will assume you cant possibly add more hydrogen to water plain tap water already contains hydrogen but hydrogen water has additional hydrogen gas dissolved into it it does not alter the ph or change the structure of the water molecule hydrogen water is made by bubbling pure hydrogen gas into water or by using electrolysis which decomposes the water molecule to hydrogen gas and oxygen gas since molecular hydrogen is an odorless tasteless gas hydrogen water doesn t taste any different than regular water hydrogen water is said to increase energy reduce inflammation and reduce recovery times after workouts a study of soccer players showed that drinking hydrogen water may reduce muscle fatigue and muscle function decline caused by exercising but more research is needed hydrogen water may contain antioxidants
anyone that stupid deserves to have paid whatever that costs
what they do is suspend gaseous hydrogen in the water in the same way that oxygen and carbon dioxide does normally it s not referring to the h2o part i really feel like the fda should regulate what these companies can say all of those claims come with heavy asterisks this reminds me of brawndo https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kaqijzeexec)
what the fuck have i been drinking for the past years
i sure hope there s hydrogen in my h2o
hang on a sec i m off to go patent some oxygen infused water
it doesn t even say if it s gluten or nut free pass
this water has twice as much hydrogen than oxygen must be awesome
sound like they re making people drink hydrogen peroxide
i prefer de hydrated water it s much easier to carry a gallon around than the wet stuff
h3o
a sucker is born every minute
i should market nitro the nitrogen infused water
so would it be h3o or h4o as long as its not extra oxygen for h2o2 as that shit kills
your smart water is not working
hydronium
hydrogen water hydronium h3o is said to increase energy reduce inflammation and reduce recovery times after workouts however i do not believe there are any real studies to validate this claim
guess the two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen wasn t enough
free ionic hydrogen makes the water acidic
infused with a to hydrogen to oxygen ratio for ultimate hydration and performance
is it gluten free is it vegan is it light is it zero does it come with no added sugar is it natural flavoured csn it be used in paleo diet
h2o infused water is all the rage
technically water will have different acidity depending on the free hydrogen content and alkaline water is one of the newest dumbest health fads
this is one of the dumbest things i ve seen in a while
it s no different than that bullshit mountain water next to it
so is this acidic water h3o weird
it s low concentration hydrogen peroxide
acid
helium balloons tend to deflate after a couple of days i d assume that this plastic container wouldn t be able to hold on to the extra hydrogen for long periods of time
yoo i herd this shit gets u f ed up
you think it s like roughly hydrogen or what
i guess if there s extra h it s acidic water
is it fresh water it s all fresh it s water but is it hydrogen infused it s all hydrogen it s water
i mean
at least it s not oxygen infused that would be h2o2 or hydrogen peroxide
ah yes on isle next to the blinker fluid right
you poor stupid guy you never can tell what some people will buy the onceler
i ve been seeing this a lot lately i bought some weird oat based coffee in a can type of drink because it looked intriguing it was oat based caramel flavoured coffee or something said nitrogen infused i m not sure what it means any science experts can chime in
nothing beats the dehydrated water you could by in the 1920s google it
does that mean it is h30 instead of h20
now that s high quality h2o
you need no brains to build muscle this brand assumes their customers are idiots
good solid corporation just stating facts
thank god they didn t double the oxygen
no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the general public
h3o
not mildly infuriating actually infused is a frustrating misused term but whatever diffused is more accurate hydrogen gas in water has been suggested by _suspiciously_ few studies to help with inflammation muscle fatigue and overall quality of life but as we know many many fads stemming from studies have been complete horseshit in the past still i am happy to see it available on the shelves for those who want to volunteer themselves as guinea pigs before further studies can corroborate or invalidate the findings as far as snake oils go at least this snake oil has a few studies backing it up but please god nooo do not get me started on that fucking restructured water i can t even figure out what restructured water actually is aside from ice or that bleach water that some people were buying
i mean if it is this far along it has some credible story you just assume it is a joke
watch out for that dihydrogen monoxide too it ll get you
uhh does no one think that h in h20 is not hydrogen
that s like having c12h22011 infused sugar
fun fact did you know you can drink heavy water
you tried that new gluten free water it s worth the dollars
h2flow
it s made with heavy water i m guessing hydrogen atoms typically only have one neutron though there are isotopes with more deuterium is a hydrogen atom with neutrons and if you use deuterium in making water it s more dense than normal water thanks to the extra neutrons the while increased performance is pure bs tho
plot twist it s deuterium
bet the ph crowd loves it ps hemoglobin only works at 45ph
so it s hydrogen peroxide now
i miss the sonicated water guys they claimed that the sonication broke up the water to make it absorb easier i m a chemist so stuff like this is amusing because only fools buy it i should start looking in my friends cupboards to see how dumb they are
maybe they are drinking hydrogen peroxide
from the studio which brought you canned air now presenting watery water
now with double the hydrogen
on sale next week alkaline water with lemon
h3o so it s basically liquid ozone which you know bad for human consumption
why would i want that flammable water sterling archer probably
guy you re telling me there is literal hydrogen in my water marketer well yes in fact 3rd of that water is hydrogen crowd audible gasp
half of the global population is probably stupid oblivious enough to buy it for the fancy packaging i hope we get wiped out by an explosive diarrhea inducing virus
it makes you lighter therefore faster
this is the kind of shit naturopaths and chiropractors are shilling in their offices
i prefer mine oxygen enriched
lol
i only drink argon infused water i m not a peasant
don t smoke near it
now twice the hydrogen
h2o if more hydrogen infused in it you actually drinking a bomb that can explode in your mouth
extra dihydrogen monoxide included more
as a biochemistry graduate this makes me face palm aggressively
maybe it contains more heavy hydrogen like more deuterium maybe
i hope my water has hydrogens i don t wanna be drinking pure hydroxide ions
h3o
h o
if the off gas doesn t blow up when exposed tk fire i m suing them for false advertising
i only drink hydrogen free water thank you very much
america is something else when it comes to water
let me guess it has atoms of hydrogen for each atom of oxygen
they aren t lying so
i ve seen ionized water also which admittedly is more healthy to drink than de ionized water which will strip minerals from your body if you drink it luckily for everyone water is already naturally ionized
now with double the hydrogen
n2o infused h2o is what i need
gotta admit their marketing people knew what they were doing people are quick to jump on a trend and it leads to quick profits for the company until the next trend
double the h as o
hmmmmm this will go great with my oxygen infused breathing air
fizzy lifting drink
now with extra hydrogen
h o someone please tell me how to make subscript idk
wait until you get a look at our new product oxygen infused air
nah just take a full year
they called me crazy but i knew that delivery companies had time travel technology
if that is usps i truly understand
quantum shipping technology bro
so did it
did you buy a delorean
doesn t matter what side of the country they lost it on lost is lost
i had a delivery yesterday that went miles overnight then sat stops away for hours
turns out that humans are fallible how dare an underpaid and overworked person make a mistake once every deliveries
meh close enough
i can just feel the pain by looking at this
dont pull it u draw blood and pain for days i am a veteran of this scenario
cut it with nail clippers before it pulls if you have the time effort soften the skin beforehand with warm water and a moisturiser before and after you cut it
it took so long for me to figure out what i was looking at i seriously thought the hangnail was a candle wick i was like is it burning unevenly
we got a runner
those hurt like the dickens
if u pull that you will pull off ur entire outline be careful you ll turn into a pool of ink
came to the comment to see if anyone have a life pro tip for this only to find that we all must suffer now i know i can bookmark this as an effective torturing technique
grip it and rip it
when this shit happens and you re not at home with easy access to nail clippers that s even more infuriating
use it to unzip your flesh onesie and release your true red and blood soked self to the world
you re going to have to amputate
oowww
hang on hang nail it s gonna get worse before it gets better
i have these every other fucking day
well build your grave
rip it off pain is temporary
hurts so bad but feels so good
rip it pray in doesn t keep going up to your elbow like a zipper
omg this is so annoying i m getting these daily on different fingers and when i pull them out they grow back on other fingers i don t remember having this before it started a while ago
grip it and rip it
better yet the one that s on your toe then you put your socks on and it s snags
it s too late amputate your finger
https://preview.redd.it/zy5ql8909esa1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9fc83f0022e158747d8dbb63ce655fa12f528609 stopped bothering me after buying one of these
tasty snack
is it just me or does anybody else like pulling their hangnails
the only solution is to peel off all of the skin around your fingernail
nail clippers you re welcome
be a man yank it off with your teeth gif giphy ggdy5nylc8w0zzpgfe
i m literally going in for nail surgery to have my big toenail removed
light it and watch in wonder as your finger bursts into confetti
nahhhhhh
you need to get a hangnail clipper they really work
had a dream years ago where i pulled it and with it my half finger i could see the bones too and no i m not wasnt doing drugs xd
cuticle nippers are your best friend
nail clippers works for me every time otherwise it will ruin several days
my god did everyone but me know this was a photo of fingers at first glance
yank
pain i hate these and have to bite them when i don t have clippers ow
i work at dominos and there s been times where its caught on a box while closing it or something followed by bleeding why do fingers do this to us better than the burn i got couple days ago from a pizza though
the only thing worse is getting it stuck on something and ripped off without warning
use tweezers and pull toward the tip of your finger youll actually be able to grab it and pulling forward does not hurt almost at all
gif giphy 3o84sw9cmwypanrrni
for a split second i thought it was a leather car seat with a broken headrest
somebody many years ago got really pissed about this so if you go to a pharmacy or similar places that has skin care products you will find the right tool to fix this
this usually happens to me in the middle of work i got a little victorinox multitool has a file would use that in hopes of wearing it down works only half the time since it leaves a weird thin sliver yeah it has a knife but that s a bit risker should find one that has an actual scissor or just get one of those low profile clippers i can stuff in my wallet
nsfl
i live for these moments
i absolutely love my cuticle scissors for this definitely less painful and messy than ripping it off as i used to do
a good nail clipper fixes that yup you can cut your skin with it and it won t peel anymore it is amazing
i have the same should i pull it off im doing it anyway
reminds me of a song hangnail rap https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d3dninr1fza)
minus health point
always pull up never pull down
pull it upwards
bro i thought i was looking at an apple with the stem broken then i thought it was a candle with a short wick i was wondering why this person gets so mad at mundane things
i get those all of the time especially on my thumb
wanna hear something more annoying having a week of finger infection then it going away for a few days and then coming back
yes i fn hate thoseemote free _emotes _pack rage

you can t feel a photo the photo
tell me you never worked with your hands without telling me you never worked with your hands
seriously do you wipe your own ass or does your mommy do it
i just pull em out it s worse doing something and it gets caught to your shirt or something else
smear of antiseptic cream then add a bandaid usually gone in a week
pull it you know you want to
i usually get the bottom front teeth and quickly tug away from my finger i never really bleed doing that to them
i had one of these a week ago clipped it and some skin around it still hurts like crazy and a little spot of skin swells out like a bubble i clip that and bleed like crazy but then it s better for a few hours until it bubbles out again help
lmfao this is me so much
and that is why i have some small sidecutters in the bathroom drawer
the only way is to pull it and bleed
did you pull it out does it feel like you pulled a nerve out of your finger and did blood fill the crack around your nail so much fun then it annoys you for the rest of the evening
i saw a funny gif once of someone pulling the hang nail and it keeps going and they end up unwrapping all of their skin it was animated
prove it
b i t e i t
nail clippers and just cut it off trust me
i have a mother in law that has been on my foot for weeks now
i want to die looking at this image
took me forever to realize what this even was
that s even more infuriating
i pulled it and with it my half finger
am i the only one who enjoy pulling these
removed
i find the pull and following constant pain to be far more suitable than the sporadic irritation and pure purgatory that is the hanging skin
you support trimming off the hanging bit with nail clippers i know your expertise isnt exactly with people but its what i do and not sure if its an issue
removed
this this is the correct advice
is it just me or does anybody else like pulling their hangnails
lmao same
til you hit armpit
yep happened at work
i have nail clippers in the bathroom at home in my nightstand at my home computer desk in my car and a final pair at my work desk i really don t like pulling these but i can t just leave them alone either
same actually
i felt pain in my toe just from reading this
your mom does it for me
seriously do you wipe your own ass or does your mommy do it xcramer i detect haikus and sometimes successfully learn more about me https://www.reddit.com/r/haikusbot/) opt out of replies haikusbot opt out delete my comment haikusbot delete
came to the comment to see if anyone have a life pro tip for this only to find that we all must suffer
how they usually tear off skin and bleed if i do that i usually only ever notice them when i am not at home therefore dont have my nail clippers around and have to deal with it the whole freaking day so annoying
apparently
am i the only one who likes to bite and eat these
what part of this is infuriating i mean aside from her house burning down last week package was delivered to its destination in good condition
should ve rung the bell to let you know the package arrived
what was in the package
dick move
honestly there s nothing wrong here sucks the house burnt down but i think that exceeds mildly infuriating territory
fire extinguisher
nah too small it was probably the smoke detector
i ve dealt with hit and runs in my state the cop just shows up and writes a report for insurance claims they do nothing else
dashcam is a good investment
gotta invest in a dash cam that records while parked as well it s insane to me that people drive without cameras with all the crazy shit that happens on the roads can almost guarantee it will pay for itself
i know your pain a few years ago i had paid my car off and was just waiting to get the title in the mail for a few weeks the day i got the title in the mail i was rear ended pulling off of a rural highway and my car was totalled
that sucks i walked out to my car just now and saw that it looks like someone tried to force my hood open with a crowbar i think it happened last night and my complex has no cameras anywhere
to be fair it looks like that might be reattached with minimal cost you just won t have high beams not an ideal solution but a possible short term cheap
you re making payments on that car in how much did you get scammed for
this is what happens when you park in a parking space
shouldn t have bought a car you couldn t afford
any security cameras in the lot
well at least it seems like it s just the bumper so either replace it or fix it up
i imagine those businesses have cameras maybe ask them if their surveillance cameras are up and running could at least get a color make of a vehicle
that looks like a hud cap off of a big truck
smash n dash
one time about years ago i hit a pickup in the mall parking lot totally destroyed the rear bumper and i drove away when people asked me what happened to my car i told them i was the victim of a hit and run every vehicle i ever owned after that excluding the i own now have been hit in a parking lot and left karma is a bad bitch i shit you not
bro why did i think a hit and run was something with shooting someone
someone did this to my last car when i had two payments left on it it wasn t a hit and run but he didn t have insurance they totaled my car and even with the deductible coming out i had more than enough to replace it since i owed so little the only silver lining is that since you weren t operating the vehicle it s not considered an accident if your insurance company raises your rates because of a claim you can go to another insurance company and there will be nothing on your driving record from it
same thing just happened to me paid it off in march and couple weeks later saw someone left a baseball sized dent in my front fender jerks
got a brand new weeks later i was at the mall and somebody hit and dented my car and i don t notice till days later it is a cold world out here
someone did this to me when i was in the hospital birthing my child luckily they just cracked the back bumper a little bit sorry that happened to you
this is my first one so i m not sure how it works in my state tbh they showed up and wrote a report and said they d check w the surrounding businesses to see if they have cameras that show my car
it s because it s just a misdemeanor if they don t catch them right after the act or you have video they just write a report if it s felony hit and run where there is body injury they put more resources into it
i m not really sure what you expect them to do for a misdemeanor crime with relatively minor property damage they aren t going to csi forensically analyze the bumper to paint match to a specific paint type on a ford taurus and then investigate every body shop in a mile radius for a matching car that shit doesn t happen if there were severe injuries or a fatality they would put more effort into it but you can t investigate every parking lot hit and run it s a complete waste of time and resources
i didn t bother with the police when mine was done just popped the bumper back on
what do you want them to do
yeah i know been meaning to get one but just hadn t gotten around to it will definitely get one after this
i know been meaning to get one just never did will be getting one for sure
i don t want my driving being recorded
oh shit that sucks
damn that sucks smh
thanks hoping it won t be too much money out of my pocket
lol it had miles on it when i got it was very well maintained from an older guy that couldn t drive any more my payment was a month plus i don t like cars w auto windows and locks since they go out faster it s a solid car for me
lol where else am i supposed to park there s no room to in the back of the store
uh what i just paid it off last month how tf do you think i couldn t afford it made the payment every month
ugh get fucked
not in the lot but i m meeting w a police officer to go request camera footage from the surrounding businesses later today
going to once i finish w the cops and insurance people
i m meeting up w a police officer later today to request any footage
thanks for the insight
it sucks but usually it comes at the cost of your dime and the other person goes on like nothing happened it s a bad world out here
depending on your state policy and elected coverages you may be able to pay a lower deductible than your standard collision for a hit and run incident make sure you ask your claims adjuster about that uninsured motorist property damage umpd some states only allow or insurance only sells uninsured motorist as bodily injury umbi if you had gotten hurt it doesn t hurt to ask to see if you have umpd but it s not likely you d have it
you should get cameras they are pretty essential for cars now days
yeah because city cops are so busy investigating high profile murders all the time and can t take minutes to check some security cameras
i recommend the viofo a129 plus duo as a decent affordable camera edit you will want to get a hardwire kit fuses for parking mode
to be fair not sure how much it would matter in this situation there s not going to be much doubt someone clipped your parked car in the lot and ran police aren t going to look at the footage much more helpful where there s disagreement between multiple parties about what happened and it makes the different between at not at fault
the beauty is that you record your driving and you don t have to submit your video as evidence if you did something stupid luckily most people have cameras now so idiocy is recorded for the most part
oh i thought you actually financed it
i was trying to be funny but i don t think it really works
you used a loan to buy a car payments in parts is loaning money from the seller if you borrow money for something you can t afford it a house is one thing but then a car then a phone and before you know it you ll be endepted to different companies and you can t afford your montly groceries
got more closer pictures of the item lodged in the grill
hoping not but wouldn t be surprised a lot of people in my state drive w out insurance so i m not really holding out much hope tbh
good to know thanks will look in to it for sure
it was something that i meant to do just never got around to it smh will be getting one for sure
no but they do have a patrol route and looking through security footage for a collision that you don t know what time it was at could take a hell of a lot longer than minutes that s if any security camera footage is even available then what do you get from that security footage oh it was a white sedan cool almost no shot you are getting a clear angle of a plate all for the same conclusion of a police report getting sent to your insurance company and nothing coming of it
awesome thanks
it would go to the other person s insurance most likely
oh god no
lol
i have zero credit card debt bc i never got a credit card and have no student loans bc i worked jobs and paid out of pocket for college bc i never had debt i had zero credit and needed a way to start earning some outside of my phone bill bought the phone outright tho and utilities
or wild concept op is responsible and only has one or two debt sources one of which being a car it s not all or nothing
it s really unfortunate my state legally requires full coverage if the vehicle is financed so it helps a bit
this is why they didn t stop
yeah that s usually what happens lol my fiance just got a kia optima with cameras installed but she won t set the cameras up and it has to be her via whatever app evo is thus reminds me to remind her again
there are so many wrapped up assumptions in there i m not gonna waste my time pleading with you to agree that police should attempt the bare minimum of protect and serve
the video would have to clearly capture a license plate to even start down that route probably helps it looks like someone backed into them and would have a clear shot of the license plate also high likelihood the person hit and ran because they don t have insurance expired plates license didn t have permission to use the car etc mostly why i say it probably won t make much difference the other issue is my experience is sometimes these cams aren t that great at recording parking incidents won t do you much good if the recording doesn t start until the offending car is pulling away
thank you for your polite lol
many do but many people still do not have insurance they are breaking the law
please remind her show her this
i mean i can tell by your language that you are one of those incredibly biased people who will never admit that the police can do something right you re also not worth bothering with because you don t know what the fuck nuance is edit i can see you blocked me because you lost an argument there s no nuance at all to your reasoning you are demanding action unreasonably on something that will not change its conclusion demanding that resources and time be wasted to satisfy your personal needs for something that is frankly a civil matter in a parking lot also don t talk about strawmans when you original braindead comment was a massive strawman and then you responded to my next comment with a strawman so good job there hypocrite
you re creating unlikely scenarios just to say it wouldnt be beneficial honestly i have a dash cam with parking mode the field of vision for the dash cams is pretty good and clear especially if you re parked even if it didn t catch a plate it can catch details of the car where it got hit etc which is useful for insurance and it only helps you to have idk what kind of cameras you ve used but my viofo a129 will trigger very well for movement that is detected thankfully i ve not been in a situation where i have needed to use the recordings yet
that s just a shit camera then most cameras start recording as soon as motion is anywhere in frame meaning it would capture ahead of the collision and you can record in 4k and easily get a plate number
np my dude
i m literally telling you it s more nuanced than you think and i m the one who doesn t understand nuance where are all these assumptions and strawmen coming from
how is any of what i said unlikely there are ridiculous numbers of uninsured drivers out there and they probably commit an undue share of hit and runs anyway i agree its better to have one than not to have one just think its good to temper expectations on how much it can help especially in a minor parking lot fender bender i think it s good to also temper expectation on how much work your insurance company is going to put into minor things like this definitely some cams are better the one i ve got uses an impact sensor to detect an impact it takes several seconds to start up and record and so it doesn t actually record the collision which isn t all that useful i know there s others that use movement sensors and those are much better at recording before and after the collision
it s unlikely because you are just assuming circumstances out of the norm it s possible the person that hit them is uninsured or that if they had a dash cam it would have missed the plate we have no way of knowing because op doesn t have a dash cam having a dash cam would give them a much better chance of figuring out who did this and you re discounting that based on well maybe thoughts on the person that hit them who we know nothing about but the average driver has insurance and your experience with a lower quality dash cam which is not the norm now a days
you re reading too much into it my initial point was that at least where i m at the entire reason people don t stick around after a collision is because they are uninsured or are breaking some other law like driving on a suspended license which also means they don t have insurance it sucks but there s little reason to put much effort into chasing down a hit and run driver again where i m at maybe it s different where you are
i don t think im reading too much into it as i m not creating scenarios lol either way having a dash cam is a good idea and can be very helpful in collisions
step buy a can of compressed air step clean your fuckin phone my god lol
now you have unlimited battery life
oof have you tried using pliers or tweezers or salad tongs or a particularly large nail clipper
super glue and a q tip
stick a sewing needle in the broken part of the cable and jiggle that bitch
that happened to me pulled it out with tweezers
fingernail clippers
you know those little pin things for removing the ad card in your phone use one to pry the thing out a bag of is like on cramazon
i thought that was the mildly infuriating part
but now all the datas will leak out d
grab a hold of it and wiggle out
they ran out of caution tape so if they did not secure the safety of the cement its on them and they ahould fix it contact them and mention it to them
there is no way to fix cement those prints are permanent they should be less noticeable in to years so you can look forward to that
that fucking sucks bro i m sorry things went wrong with this job the contractor should have put up a sign or tape there s no excuse but also all that driveway the fedex guy had and he picks the fresh cement to walk over dick move
cement guys won t fix because they can t
it was fixable until it dried
a negative review and pics on google maps will probably do more than continuing trying to contact a company that didn t even care to begin with
stop payment thru bank until it s fixed
fedex should pay
first of all its called concrete not cement secondly these prints will wear off in like months of normal traffic there really isnt a good fix for this issue just grin and bear it and realize your fed ex guy fucked ya not the concrete company who ran out of caution tape
could you sand it down with sandpaper idk how cement works so it s just a suggestion
are you sure there were not orange cones put out at the bottom of the driveway way is it the driveway guy s responsibility to repair something fedex should be responsible for is it really a big deal it doesn t affect the integrity of the driveway looks like a funny conversation piece
that s what i thought as well except they keep dodging my calls and texts
i m sure there were cones out at the bottom of the driveway
the prints don t look deep you could easily grind the whole pad down a bit brush with muriatic acid also skim coats exist and with proper adhesive should stick nicely on freshly poured concrete id personally stop payment on the check and tell them they need to fix it
repair touch up cement idc what they call it i don t want prints for years
break it up and poor a new one
we wrote a check suggestions
i thought so too but with zero warning of wet cement i don t see how i can blame them posting a video in comments now smh
see if they can dodge a court summons after you get three bids on what it will cost to fix it
better business bureau yelp social media your neighbor facebook group spread the word
feded has more insurance than the concrete guys maybe if you complain to them you can get some help
the only long lasting fix to this issue is removing the cement and re pouring it
it s cement my man you can t grind down cement it s not like wood where you just sand the imperfections away even if you skim coat it with quick dry cement the top layer will crack and then you just spent money for no reason
there is no touch up repair would require removing all the cement and replacing it those prints are permanent
next time stupervise them
don t write checks for pretty much anything use credit cards
i wouldn t they d probably drag you into court or try to get a contractors lien slapped on your house unless you re prepared to spend thousands hiring a lawyer just to fight that i m not sure how much you paid but you d probably end up spending that much or more you re better off trying to take them to court yourself just having a lawyer send them a letter might even be enough because that puts them on the defense instead of you
it s obviously wet cement and if there is any cation tape visible around that area i mean come on
you can literally rent a floor polisher for cheap and put a coarse diamond pad on it it s done all the time a properly added skim coat will last years easily i know people who take plain concrete slabs like this grind stain acid etch the heck out of them and it s a complete transformation
you absolutely can grind cement on both a small or large scale diamond blades pads
you can grind cement but it isn t cheap probably the same cost as redoing the whole thing
this is true
yeah but it s old and set concrete this is brand new concrete it s still fragile taking a diamond pad to brand new concrete will most likely create more damage than do good it just more expensive to do everything you are saying compared to just taking the concrete out and re pouring my opinion tho maybe folks have figured out how to do this more efficiently than the team i used to work with
you have to shotblast it i worked construction most of my early youth it def cost more to do that than just removing and re pouring labor cost is insane
lmao more spicy chips than usual i guess
majority of those chips in that planogram are hispanic chips and are in spanish
i had chips earlier with my lunch am i hispanic now
dollar general has a hair products section called african american
what s mildlyinfuriating about this
as a hispanic person i find this hilarious it probably means most of those products are from latin america probably mexico but yeah op get offended in my behalf or whatever
they literally are hispanic chips i don t understand the problem
this is kinda funny
aisle
wow i worked at am pm to brings back memory of night shifts
aisle
also legitimately curious grabs popcorn and waits
the dude thinks it s racial profiling that we hispanics like doritos a little bit too much it probably means that most of the doritos cheetos and lays are made and imported from latin america or another hispanic countries and that is the place where you put them in the store but yeah i found this hilarious because we do have a lot of chucherias in latin america
looks like it s time to google it
the cat https://i.redd.it/nazdxojcy4sa1.gif
the way he s admiring his masterpiece
my cat ran from her litter box two days ago with a turd stuck to her and proceeded to do that across the living room and entryway floors i ve never seen a creature scoot their boot that fast she got it in carpet and hard floor and i ended up doing an intense shampoo and mop combo i feel your pain
someone needs a sanitary shave
if i m not mistaken he still seems to be boot scootin his shitty rear across a different area of carpet while you are taking this picture lol i bet that smells glorious
for every streak you can visibly see are countless more streaks that are better camouflaged
look at him admiring his work that s right fuckers i did that deal with it
he s looking at it like he s telling you dang if only someone would clean that up xd
you ever wake up to a dog throwing up that might get you out of bed a lot faster
my dog eats my cat s ass problem solved
the cat s thoughts gif giphy dw3whvb0k5vaw downsized
take him to the vet he may need his anal glands expressed it s painful if they re blocked
pets carpet floor is a big no
this could potentially be a symptom of worms or some other parasite could be worth checking with a vet
my cat s tummy was upset so he took a nice big squishy poo on the floor right next to the litter box when i woke up and found out it had already been discovered by the roomba everywhere
toilet parpet
this is hilarious
to his credit he seems to be trying to figure out where it all went so wrong for him most remorseful cat i ve ever seen
he ate too much hair he s got a dingle berry
how about waking up at am to the smell of yummy dog shit walking out to the living room half asleep in the dark turning on the light and finding piles of shit
ah the ol butt sharpie
i don t want a cat anymore
cat is like huh i didn t notice that yesterday
take a human shit in it s litter box to establish dominance
that and hairball sounds are the worst
over my years of scrolling thru reddit and real life experiences i ve gotten farther and farther away from ever wanting a cat as a pet the upsides just doesn t seem to offset the downsides
i am cleaning this carpet in my mind i cant even leave it long enought to photograph it so disgusting feel bad for your cat being sick but shit is shit
when your cat has an itch
the cat just staring at it lol
your cable set up is wack
ooo that stings carpets and pets not a fun combo
and half the people lately are saying the humans are the only animal that has to wipe after poop
look at him he knows what he did
people give me looks when i wipe my dogs asshole every time we come inside but you only need a dookie stamp on your shirt or couch one time before you make some major changes to your relationship
bruh thats an asshole
get better cat food might reduce stomach issues
kitty need fiber in its diet no no not carpet fiber
my cat sometimes does this she won t let me brush her and she won t let me groom around her back end so this is a fun random dingleberry carpet streak she does every few months
i read that as boredom floor and was wondering how much lack of stimulation drives a cat to do this
he is proud of his work
gruesome
in my family we called this the chocolate mile
this likley means your cat is feeling a bit ill take it to them vet for a checkup make sure the fella is okay
you get to still be asleep at i find that mildly infuriating
he looks ashamed of himself could he have worms
bye bye kitty
folex great for stains
and admiring his handiwork

clean my mess foul human
and then staring at it mentally
my dog started to go crazy around the same time a couple of cats were outside
looks like a shitty situation
cat looks at skid mark like yeah i fucking did that a dog would never
he is probably unhappy at you for not being the best owner possibly applying to be adopted by others by now
invents cat bidet

my dog used to do this constantly i feel for you i really do at she was completely incontinent and i had to out her to sleep because of cancer
feel that heard my puppy spraying liquid shit onto my carpet as i was brushing my teeth this morning
picacasso
hes looking at it like he s critiquing the quality of his work lmao
my dog does this so i figured getting his anal glands expressed would help nope he just likes rubbing his asshole on everything
gif giphy lmv5advwogtmby3a13
aww he s admiring his work
this made me lol for a good minute thank you
nice i usually only get vomit
if you ever run out of toilet paper you can use your cat s technique too so inspirational
damn that was a long one

this thread has convinced me to never get a cat
i love my little green spot carpet cleaner i got for stuff like this
waited tables in college one night i worked a closing shift til 1am after getting there at i come home eat some dinner everything is great and i pass out wake up to the most god awful sound of like a clogged sink being run my dog was sick and he had diarrhea all over the carpet so i had to now spend like half an hour cleaning scrubbing and using the carpet cleaner at like 3am worst night ever lol
as bad as that is and my sympathies as a multi decade cat owner but the ultimate cat wake up is being woken up to both the sound and vibration of a cat hunching and horking on your bed at am i have slept through alarms tornado warnings screaming toddlers etc but a horking cat on your bed look i love my cats they are spoiled rotten full medical care lotsa toys and treats and cuddles but it s an involuntary kick that yeets a cat across the room when the bed starts shaking with that
https://preview.redd.it/k7pc45pcx7sa1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d72e747fa43d77a283dcd639caa58f91aadef615
but he s cute tho bro that s the only benefit to animals they re just more chores you gotta worry about and theyre not worth it especially when cats don t even like you
never get a pet that is suppose to shit inside the house
username checks out
cats are so gross
oof buddy that s carpet too
you pissed the cat off
get rid of the carpeting damn that s nasty
it s probably mildly infuriating to the cat that he has worms too
i grew up in a house with cats and a dog my mom was mother theresa of the animals literally had skunks squirrels raccoons and stray cat chilling outside the house and she would feed them all now i m living with no animals and it feels great i miss having them but can t deal with all the hair and furniture being destroyed
things like this are why i love other people s pets instead of having my own
reason why i don t have pets
this is why i will pass on pets although i love animals i m good on having hair shit slobber etc inside my home and not being able to be gone from the house for long
reason to not own a cat i have a running list at reasons to date
at this point i m glad that i d don t have carpets on the floor
if it makes you feel better i woke up to my dog being sprayed by a skunk in the face that smell does not easily wash away
may i introduce you to your dog about to vomit at 3am
actually the sound of my cat about to puke on my bed wakes me up faster and more ready for action
i got a big area rug for the litterbox any stray poop or scooting generally ends up there
have i been missing out on carpets primarily function my whole life really funny no one told me i m spending a fucking fortune on charmin and just walking on my carpets like a damn fool
makes me feel lucky to have tile floors in my apartment my cat s done this too but at least cleanup is super easy
poor dude is probably having some minor gastric issues you may want to discuss this with your vet there is probably a simple diet change that could help prevent this
cat said picasso i like it
maybe a vet visit is in order if his butt was that itchy it may be parasites or if you happen to have recently changed what food you give him or he got into something he shouldn t have that might also be the source
you expected it to use cat litter as toilet paper
he couldn t stand his mud butt any longer
why is it that a cat barfing at 3am always sounds like it s right next to you even if said cat is rooms away
u can make claims
every month i get two letters on the same day from the irs one telling me they ve changed my business address from ste to suite and one telling me they ve changed my business address from suite to ste
that s very rude of her to not let her nephew go to wizard school
i can hear the tree spirits screams of anguish through the screen
weird glitch lol
that s postnord for ya
i went on an extended vacation and had the post office hold my mail from my apartment box i got the verification by email it said to go to my local office to pick up my mail when i needed it started again i get back weeks later and go to the office they had no idea what i was talking about i then went back and opened my mailbox it had weeks worth of mail stuffed down on a notice that my mail would be held at the local office
go to the post office and take out one and ask for the parcel once they have looked and told you it s not there smile and thank them take out the next one and ask for the parcel once they have looked and told you it s not there smile and thank them take out the next
i wonder if it s one of those scams you usually see with emails where they bombard your inbox with fake emails so you don t see the real email saying you applied for a credit card has been approved or your account password has been changed maybe this is the snail mail version of that i would open them all just to be safe
ppl have doubled it and gave it to the next person youre next in line
i ordered a computer monitor on march it was delivered by usps days later on april with the outer box all busted to shit and hastily taped back together wtf is going over at the post office edit oh the original post is about the swedish postal service wtf is going on at every post office in the world
was this on april i wonder if they typed for qty instead of for the date
have arrived so far
it kinda sucks that we as tax payers funded this
update today they sent another letters https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/12do9xz/it\_seems\_ive\_pissed\_off\_someone\_at\_postnord\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/12do9xz/it_seems_ive_pissed_off_someone_at_postnord_with/)
fick typ sdana fr ett paket som hmtades ut ca en vecka tidigare lol
small hands or large forearms
things like this make me think what the hell happened here and how did no one catch it
drop them in a public mailbox when you receive them again go back to
that is not the us postal service
obvious glitch in their computer system
glitch is the matrix
fyi fan
she should open them to verify identicalness and then take them in a purse or bag to the post office pull out one at a time saying she s there to claim a package when it s verrified as delivered say alright one more thing i m also here to pick uo this package and pull out another one
this is ridiculous our current system is so bad we truly need to update everything
this is the equivalent of being yelled at by the post office this is actually more effective than sending one letter written in all caps
you are a wizard hairy
postnord
our government at its finest
as someone else mentioned this is not the united states postal service it s a post by someone in another country most are familiar with the fact that the usps rarely goes out of its way for customers let alone notices i occasionally get signature required mail left at my doorstep with simply a knock and run by the post person
that s physical software gore
our tax dollars hard at work
it s astounding how much paper is still wasted in the postal service i d love to see the day when i can check a box that says paperless and actually receive no paper
what a waste of a tree
yeah let s give our healthcare to the government responsible for this
was this post created by a chatbot
dejoy rocking that conservative efficiency of operations all day long
lies
when the oldest two generations is gone paper mail should disappear completely useless with the technology we have today
deleted
democrats controlled usps just practicing their mass voting mailing fraud technique for the upcoming presidential election
wow that s insane
so that s why the price of stamps keeps going up
when you write your for loop wrong
this is a software issue i ve seen similar issues where i work but not to this extent
was the package a box of hobby lobby flyers
that my fi me is what we in the business call bad automation
real glitch in the matrix
most competent bureaucrat
go in and make the clerk process each one individually gif emote free_emotes_pack poop
this is fine this is fine this is fine this is fine
ai is killing it
i worked in the data dept of a big company once i had to compile a list f client addresses to send a certain letter to i made a bad join in sql and didn t notice customer got over 120x the same letter with some important letters from us mixed in between somewhere this stuff happens
go back different times and pretend like it never happened
bureaucracy at its finest
what a waste of my taxes and paper
would become note paper and bookmarks for the next while for me
ahhh classic government efficiency
hopefully the package wasn t your letter opener you may need it

it s the postmaster general s newest strategy to keep usps in business by artificially inflating mail volume data
deleted
did you open all that s my question
i deliver mail and sometimes big stacks like that make me happy because i have less mail to deliver
there is a programmer some where that messed up the math on an main system
only rookie numbers
tangible evidence that we re glitching through the multiverse
holy bureaucratic waste batman
that almost looks like a frustrated person fighting a printer that wont print and then it prints a billion pages lol
the usps is run by the same guys that run the printing shop cuz fuck em thats why
now there is great use of gubermint
this is more funny than irritating to me i d be more irritated if i got a letter every day for days
jeez
i feel like you re holding an art installation in your hand
the post office needs a full top to bottom audit and restructure
i d go check just to see if the seller sent you double might score something for free
typical government run program
you should wrote return to sender on all of them stick them in the mail by
you can block spam mail online but you cannot in person
dejoy has to go
is your wife jenny droptables
just wreak havoc on the postal service find a random postbox and put them in there
tax dollars at work
wish those were paychecks
yeah that sounds like the usps
u accenture should be proud
good enough for government work
from the bureau of office redundancy and repetition
i d have thrown it away in front of them lol
hahahaha wtf
welp that s the government for you
my local post office has been on the downward trend of suck federal government employees don t give a damn
it came from the government department of redundancy department
oh hey this is what i do for a living there s an excel sheet with your name on it times the very first thing you re supposed to do with that list is run a de dupe to remove duplications i could see usps automating this process since they don t pay for postage and well this is what happens
efficiency at its finest
lol that s government for you employees doing one job
why is the cost of postage increasing
they re just testing in production no worries
should be posted in the mildly hilarious subreddit because that shit is gold
but let government run healthcare they said
five one foot tiles equals five feet you re both equally bad at measuring
the one who did this should be cut the same way
wu tang
this is disrespectful
these people are clearly off their meds don t let them near the knife again

cheesecake is my favorite cake and what you just showed me is unforgivable

looks like an axe
you mean murdered
mmm that looks like a obviously horribly cut keylime cheesecake
is it bad that whenever someone tells me to cut a cake i do exactly this just to see the anger build on their face
looks like a dicked up wu tang clan symbol
what kind of madman cuts their cheesecake like this the only thing worse would be to make a slice from the middle
i genuinely hope the person people who cut this steps on a f king lego
i still can t wrap my head around it tbh lol
disrespectful to the cake
yeah couldn t figure out at all how to right this wrong
apparently it was good sadly i just lost all my interest to dig in haha
it s a calamansi philippine lime cheesecake
i won t be inviting you to any of my birthday parties then haha
and to the person who made the cake
that s the smartest decision you could make tbh i m that guy who people are like damn who invited him and when is his ass leaving
most likely thawed at some point probably at the store waiting to be put away

is it
use a password manager then you only need to remember the password to unlock the app
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii is a character password i can remember and it is weak
abcdefghijklmnopqrst
does it have uppercase lowercase numbers and symbols
they have all your data so they know that you use it for all of your accounts s maybe
booooooooooooooooobs isn t a secure password
add uppercase letters numbers special characters i like going to the park or something like that lol
bro
until it gets hacked like lastpass
funny enough adding a symbol bumped it to
thought about that but it simply seemed to dislike whole recognizable words
that s a small risk that s definitely worth it to me
lastpass is a dumpster fire that should ve been avoided since a long time ago the company has been rebranded and resold so many times which is a red flag in itself i don t think they have even had a third party independently audit their codebase which is something a critical software application should periodically undergo
how bad was the lastpass hack i use lastpass and the emails they sent out about it didn t seem to be too concerning
lastpass user vaults are all encrypted lastpass can t even decrypt them as only the user knows the key
yeah common words and small variations are the first thing a brute force method would try i suggest instead to creating an acronym out of an entire phase sentence if it is something you need to remember rather then just using a password manager also you should mix in capitol lower case and replace with symbols when you can just pick a pattern to it or replacement that makes sense to you
i use keepass is that a good alt to lastpass

i have those at my school the lines were absolutely terrible when we first got them but after a few weeks it got better the security personnel also became more efficient over time the best way to avoid the wait is to show up a few minutes before after most people arrive at school and hopefully the line won t be as long
i graduated in and there was a bomb threat once and we had to do this for a week after that i was pretty pissed about it then now idk there were plenty but a lot fewer school shootings back then if we ve accepted having to do it before getting on a plane then why not to go inside a large building filled with children
gun reform or tsa is takes over
gun reform would be allowing carry on school property gun free zones only work on targets
yeah i expected it to take longer at first but we have staff at our school that take their jobs way too seriously who are constantly yelling at us during this the detector went off as i went through because of my umbrella and i was being yelled at like i was a serious threat
fuck everything about this sentiment and what lead you here
yeah the metal detectors are really sensitive one time my school id card was enough to set it off but the staff at my school are pretty chill for the most part so they didn t stress out and just used their wand thingy and i go to a public high school in chicago though it is an above average neighbourhood so the staff at my school know to only act on actual threats if your school is in a nice neighbourhood somewhere that s probably why the staff were so fearful they ll see anything and everything as threatening
you should definitely talk to them as soon as you can so they get this fixed
drain cleaner doesn t eat through bathtub enamel however many old bathtubs have been refinished with a softer paint substance you ll probably have to have it refinished again
time for a new bathtub lol
i had that happen in a bathroom sink too much drain cleaner it backed up and ate the nickel off the brass drain escutcheon drain ran great after that but it didn t look as nice oops
he said he ll look into it
and document all interactions about this for move when you move out and you can prove he did it
yeah that looks like an old nicotine yellow tub that s been refinished a couple times i don t know what else to call that hideous old color older generations were drunk and on tranquilizers all the time i think it affected their sense of aesthetics
i have a baby is this not safe it s clean but like is there chemicals under the enamel or pieces chipping off
i ll look into it lol no get fucked
if you mean you have a baby like newborn baby they make little cradles for them to take baths in anyways in the tub they shouldn t be in the bare tub itself unless toddlers and even then highly supervised
i m sure it s not the best to use but still usable just looks like poopoo now
wow angry at a sticker lmao
i know it wasnt normal peeling of the sticker because it went from untouched to this in a single day they tried to peel it from a couple sides too theres fingerprints in the adhesive i bought this from a company that makes full car wraps for advertising and the adhesive is very strong and you cant remove part by tearing im a bit worried theyre going to come out with scissors next none of the other stickers on my vehicle are damaged at all either
keep your head up queen
let s not jump to conclusions they probably wanted her for themselves
looks like there s peeling on both the other girls heads and the end of the text doesn t look like it was only peeled from the black girl s spot
yeah no this did not happen and you re trying to advertise your site on here
i mean could be still pretty upset if so though because like the website to buy merch is right there
so a thief is better than a vandal and racist
i honestly can t imagine what would motivate somebody to do this it makes no sense and it s definitely infuriating i don t know if you ever heard the term hanlon s razor justice renquest used to quote it a lot of judges do never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity for your own peace of mind you re better off thinking the person is a mindless moron than to think it was a hate crime
anything is better than a racist
well i m just saying either way this neighbor isn t a great person
no an absolute ass at best and a kind of a monster at worst a shithead none the less
your accountant should have been able to address that penalty and it s odd it would have been assessed also if she got a massive raise then yeah you got to pay the tax man but the extra tax is only assessed after the income threshold so it s not a bite on all your income
i notice you ve said this twice and i mean no disrespect x200b why the fuck didn t they take the proper amount out of our checks x200b why is it too much to ask that they take out the right amount from each check instead of doing it this way and then fining us for filling it out honestly i dont know who you are blaming but it s not the irs or tax authority this is up to her employer s payroll department to deduct the proper amount they probably never adjusted her tax deduction when she got the promotion or didnt allow for it on whatever bonuses she may have received i appreciate and respect that you re willing to pay what is proper that s admirable and i totally empathize with you that it s sucks to be caught off guard during tax season that said she might want to address that with her payroll department to make the correction on her paychecks so the same thing doesnt happen next year
imagine not tax evading
i get a yearly work bonus that gets taxed at roughly i bust my ass to get that bonus just shows hard work gets punished my wife and i went into a higher tax bracket last year and if it wasn t for us having our kid we would have had to pay in it s all complicated just so they can stick it to you
we went through this too got a promotion and a nice raise and then took home less money per paycheck because of the higher tax bracket it was absolutely the opposite of what it should have been
what planet do you live on you budgeted the hell out of buying a car but it didn t dawn on you that there is a progressive tax code your wife is a coo with a big pay bump and didn t think to consult a tax accountant grow the fuck up
you can t spell theirs without irs
our accountant is the one who explained the penalty to us we re not upset at how much we re taxed or how the system decides how much we need to pay it s that we filed our w2s honestly we are a married couple with two kids it s worked out correctly every year until now why is it too much to ask that they take out the right amount from each check instead of doing it this way and then fining us for filling it out honestly we re insanely lucky to be in our position but we ve made decisions based upon information we believed to be true we tried to do everything right and it s like we re being punished for not understanding how things work when you pass this threshold
i don t have a whole lot of faith in her company s accounting department this very well could be on them my frustration from everything boils down to our accountant making it sound like we should have known to fill out our w2s as single with no dependents we re so used to living paycheck to paycheck before now that we had no way to prepare for something like this it d be so much easier if we were just taxed appropriately up front
we re paying the taxes we filled out our w2s accurately how were we supposed to know that we needed to lie on the w2 so that we could pay more taxes on each paycheck the government knows how much we make and how much we owe just take that out of our checks and make it simple for us to understand we ve made debt commitments based upon the idea that we were paying what we owed that s the way it should have been why the hell do tax brackets change whether you can file single or married or number of dependents it doesn t need to be this complicated take what we owe and move on
there was something with a bonus she got that fucked us on top of the new bracket the account said they viewed it like she was an independent business owner probably the thing you re talking about i seriously don t care about how much we have to pay i d be fine paying more if it meant free healthcare or other benefits to everyone in our society my only issue is we do everything we can to be honest and it somehow screwed us it s so stupid that we should have somehow known to fill out the w2 with false information
progressive taxation doesn t work like that
tell your accountant to remove the penalty and that you want the irs to assess your penalty then if you get the penalty you can request an abatement assessing and paying which your accountants software is automatically doing is basically you not contesting the penalty the irs gives automatic relief for first time penalty abatement requests you may never even get assessed too
the new w4s are a joke i do consulting for a well known erp software and support payroll since i can t tell you how many people get confused on what they need to do to fill it out correctly if you are single it is quite simple if married with dependents and make more money than your partner you need to calculate the household income and put additional withholding or you will end up paying the new w4s are not as intuitive as the older one
i have always checked the box to take extra out you can do this it s common it s on the form you write in an amount i made money outside of my job that does not withhold so i have extra taken at the job if i don t need it i get a refund if i do well so it goes i do this and check the irs form for my expected income to estimate my taxes and predict my takehome i do this because i don t trust payroll to get it right you would be shocked shocked i tell you to find out how many payroll people i have schooled on withholding
i thought that was an atoll in a green sea
that gets left there to let you know not to put a sticker on your wall next time
nice picture of an atoll from an airplane
try goo gone or nail polish remover best test it first in case the paint isn t durable
i thought those were islands for a sec
when you buy a second hand movie or game from cex or cash converters
just use a wet sponge and rub the residue off
remember when idiots were putting the biden i did that stickers on gas pumps
totally thought it was a hole in the drywall exposing a stud
this picture hurts my soul
little goo gone and a scrubbing pad like you d wash dishes with will make this disappear
definitely annoying
i want to live there this picture is vaguely familiar is this actually your picture op
rub it with natural peanut butter oil gently don t use crunchy
just soak it with a spray bottle of water and gently use a rag to wipe it off
i found a solution for when this happens use either packing tape or the label again and keep placing and pulling it off the stickiness can remove it
oil of any kind will break down the adhesive rub some on then clean the area with soap and water
just use goo gone let it soak and wipes the sticker and glue off this after tearing the dam surface of everything all these years
yes
came here to say this
i thought it was a weird shipwreck
cut off the end eat

there is not really anything wrong with it you peel it and slice off the bit of the banana that was exposed to the air you will lose maybe half an inch of it at most
k i don t eat bananas and even i know you just slice off a quarter inch and eat
just eat it to get it over with
eat it
burn the house down move to mexico and open a jet sky rental business
you have gremlins if a human did this i don t want to meet them
that s not half
put a condom on it s
put the rest of it in my butt too
3d print the missing part to make it whole again
just the tip
toss it it s worthless now can no longer be used for scale
eat the banana how is this infuriating
who in their right mind would do that take the whole thing or don t take one at all
im just going to throw out the entire banana stand
what would you do punch the person who ate a third of a banana and left the rest for me to clean up
i would throw out the whole banana if they aren t going to eat the whole thing then should just wrap it and put in fridge feel like fruit flies are just gonna be all over the open banana fuckin gross
in my house it would hang there gathering fruit flys for days until i finally throw it away same with apples and oranges it s infuriating
who did that spank them
get confused and end it sticked up your ass
that s not half it s just the tip
either eat the other half or don t
someone must like gnats
wait four more days then make banana bread
leave it in the shoe of the heathen who did this
same cut the end off and use it asap in a smoothie or add it to oatmeal
i like the way you think
bruh it s barely even a quarter who tf eats one bite of a banana i can t even
ayyyy
thank you that s exactly what i thought when i saw it
there s money in the banana stand
who tf even buys a banana stand buying a whole ass furniture piece for specific fruit
i just wanted a taste
well if you really want to i m sure you can probably get other fruits on there
explain to me other fruit that can actually be stored on this thing as intended excluding grapes
if you try hard enough you can spear an apple on there or you can hang cherry pairs on there if they re like the average cherry picture neither are recommended of course but if you re really bored and want to mix things up they are options
apple you gain artistic ability you lose respect of anyone visiting over and a perfectly good apple although the cherry option was a nice pick i ll give you props for that one did not think about that
see but when you re ready to take the apple down it ll have a small round hole in it you then grab a gummy worm put in in and bam you have an apple with a worm bonus points if it s a realistic looking worm
your brain works different i like it
someone didn t empty the capper all the way
dakin milk they have a new capper at the dairy
it took me a solid seconds of questioning myself before i realized something was wrong i looked at the label and put it in a whole milk crate and all i saw was the cap and wondered if i had put it in the wrong spot
i do this in the sims it makes the outside windows look arsthetically pleasing
you can cut out the picture and stick it on another wall to deter intruders
i mean you very clearly have a ring doorbell so it s not like discrete packaging would have been the thing to dispel theft if someone s gonna steal a box on camera it doesn t matter what the box says or doesn t say
wow everybody is jumping on the lets post pictures of fairly ordinary stuff and call it infuriating train recently eh meh free karma is free karma
discreet not discrete two completely different words
what s the problem here i think it looks like a boring old doorbell cam and can t tell there s a corn cob in there
ring is a scam
looks like a big improvement over how they shipped my ring camera in a box twice as big as the camera with about feet of wadded up paper for padding i d rather they use less packaging even if it means the product is exposed on the packaging
not sure what you mean by that this was a packaged delivered to my house when i wasn t home
well not really someone with the intention of stealing anything discrete packaging would not help but showing exactly what s inside the box may entice someone walking by to get the idea of this is worth stealing these packages usually come in brown box and a shipping label having it in plain sight is mildly infuriating
thanks
explain
they re saying take the packaging and literally cut out the image of the camera on the packaging and tape it somewhere outside your house to deter people
i d say an increased risk of being caught is a bigger deterrent than the risk of it being not that expensive
so i m not the only one i can t count how many of these thots i ve blocked it s annoying af
omg you re sooooo right and smart i m glad i saw your post btw i m a year old college girl who loves being naked i hope you want to see my dirty videos i only reply to messages on only fans come hang out with me
honestly this is setting off weird alarm bells for trafficking the impersonal usernames and canned bios are uncanny like it was all organized and posted by the same person
begone thot
mine are always real people that actually have messaged me but always have nsfw as their profile icon and usually never say a word after that first exchange again i got this problem on snap all day tho notifications a day from usually someone with femboy or crossdresser in their name one had the balls to ask me if myself or my friends would like to pay for pictures of their naughty femboy photos i mean the audacity of these people to presume i have friends i have feelings ya know quit opening that wound
it s just some weirdo in a different area scamming for money
i recently canceled hello fresh due to having too many things going on at the moment i would have preferred to keep it as i genuinely love it but i m just going to be away from home too many days in the coming months if there was an option to pause delivery that did not by default send you unselected and meals if you fail to manually cancel each week i would still be a member all it would take is an option to temporarily set my preferences to don t ship unless selected
which end
that s personal what did you do to deserve that

cat is mad at you for something
cat showing it s luuurve
nsfw tag
what did you do bro shit and puked in your shoes i know they threaten to do it every other minutes but still to actually get a cat to shit and puke in ur shoes is impressive p s pls make sure your cat is okay and not sick
wow he gave you a gift
yo brush him that s a fat hairball
thank scat
i don t think this is something the cat did to spite you it s quite possible your cat is experiencing some sort of physical discomfort in its intestines digestive system please get it to a vet asap
been there so many times
this is the primary reason i will never own a cat
looks like we are going to need a new cat
maybe you should take your cat to the vet and be concerned that it got sick instead of posting on reddit for karma like why even have pets if you don t give a shit about their health i don t get people like this
did you try to walk it off
the cat can at least clean up after
you very nearly put your foot in it that time op
my cat once dropped a mouse he caught in my mouth while i was sleeping he was so proud while i choked on a mouse
seems like your are not cleaning the cat toilette often enough
cat is probably like you re welcome human
please brush your cat or you ll get a lot of these everywhere
stupid thing should stop eating his own hair
zeus poops and shoes
he put some peanut butter on it to make it more appetizing
looks like both
front end big hair ball
probably didn t clean the litter box
its a hairball
that s actually a hairball quite a big one too actually
no
absolutely not
because cats never vomit up hairballs
deleted
it s shedding season my cats get these kind of hairballs every spring
looking on how that desk is being treated that s the most respectful thing that could be done to those things
looks like he is keeping the stuff you got him from getting a disease from the desk
nope i don t find it disrespectful once i give a gift it no longer belongs to me and they can just do what they want with it life is too short to let something like this bother you and in the future you know not to buy them anything of real value
i d say more storage box than a bin you re over thinking this as was said above its probably more respectful doing like this than anything else
he kept them honestly in todays disposable world that means more than you can guess
my brother buys gifts he thinks people should like all based on things he likes it s annoying because literally decades have gone by full of gifts that i don t like and have no need for that clutter my space and collect dust i ve tried to politely hint when he buys gifts for other to get something they might want and he s like nah he will like this it s cool but only to my brother for example he is obsessed with formula racing lamborghinis ferraris mclaurens etc i don t give a fuck about any of that when you visit he forces you to watch racing and i tell him no thanks and even tell him i m leaving before he gets frustrated and just turns the tv off i ve even been rude about it and yet every birthday christmas or just because gift he gets me is a shirt model building set legos or whatever all related to fucking formula racing i have kids who also have no interest in that shit and guess what he always buys them maybe you are like my brother i ve stopped hiding the shit and pretending i like it i give it away right in front of him before offering it back to him to get a refund at this point i d prefer he get me nothing at all i love him but he doesn t listen in that regard and my closet full of junk he s given me over the years is full when we do polyanna however you spell it for christmas everyone hates when he gets your name
idk but taking pictures of his room and posting it on reddit doesn t exactly scream respect either
at least he s keeping them safe from himself and his messy habits from the looks of it
is it possible your brother is not so into the things you think he s into
buy him a hoover and tell him to sort out his grotty shithole
is that a bin or just a container to store stuff in i mean if it is a bin then yes i would be pissed but i also would confront him about it before i would overreact
i wouldn t find this disrespectful i would actually appreciate the fact that all of his stuff is gross as hell while the stuff i got him is in like new condition in a bin away from all the gross lol for the next birthday or holiday i d buy a cleaning lady voucher or some cleaning material for this man jesus
this is why i always give money as a gift it may seem lazy but i find that if i were to buy something someone wouldn t like it would probably be thrown away i m no exception myself if i receive a gift i will never use i will of course thank the person but after a while it will be in the garbage
considering how the desk looks space might be an issue though hanging the figure on the wall is an option and who knows he might be happy to have it like i got a large figure collection some of them have not been displayed yet and have planned on cycling some of them in and out though a lot of them are rather delicate in assembling and disassembling them
not disrespectful no perhaps he doesn t like what you got him or has no current use for what you got him why in the world would you be inclined to take that personally as an affront rather than information that might help you make better decisions in the future
maybe find out why does he need help installing display shelving
it s probably better off there than on that nasty desk
i wouldn t be offended i do this with gifts when i don t know where to put them yet by the looks of the desk your brother probably doesn t tidy up that often and hasn t gotten around to organizing things yet i tend to hold onto gifts in their original state for a long time because of the sentimental value
he s putting it away so it doesn t get damaged
toys in a toy box
he s treating them a lot better than the rest of his stuff
nah stuff has more value unopened he may also be collecting maybe
you didn t find them in the trash and they didn t go missing this is a good thing they kept them i have stuff from family that i keep stored away
maybe you should have bought him a vacuum and some lysol wipes but looks like those prob would have ended up sitting under the desk too
buy his ass a vacuum and carpet cleaner
it s disrespectful of you to think you have any say over his stuff it s not stuff he s borrowing from you it s his stuff it s sad you re trying to shame him online when he did nothing wrong
not in the least bit my guess is you are a little brother who got gifts that are meant for people younger than your brother sorry to burst your bubble kids should stay off sites where they can talk to adults
save your money and give him nothing and see how he treats that
lol
pay for a therapy session and some ssri s
if it s been a few months and they are still unopened and just sitting there then your brother is unappreciative however if you got him that stuff yesterday then i think that s more of a storage bucket and he might still appreciate and use the gifts
well the tp on the desk there means he s probably got other things on his mind
you never take them out of their package because the value drops completely respectful
how old is he he s messy i would be disrespected by this he s just a slob
he kept them didn t he
get him a lighter next gift
given how much he doesn t respect himself to keep his station clean it s thoughtful he put all the gifts in one spot
there are much bigger problems going on in these photos lack of basic hygiene and care for his own belongings i d check in on his mental health or wellbeing
better off in the bin that room is a f ing mess
well if the stuff is being used he s intending on using the stuff or if he is grateful that you gave him the stuff then no
that s an impressive collection of bic lighters i think your bro is a fire thief which is more mildly infuriating than his storing your gifts in a tote away from the mess s
should have gotten him a roomba
looks like he s set it aside in a special place to preserve its value unopened collector items
i don t see how that s disrespectful you made it seem like he threw it in the trash looks like that s the cleanest part of his room and he s keeping it safe
how and why do people choose to live in filth come on man clean it up
dude needs to clean up before you worry about why they re in a can
eh maybe he just hasn t felt like engaging in figurines as a hobby in a while maybe he s depressed maybe he doesn t really want more figurines and would be happier with a gift card for his birthday ask him about it but don t be angry
that place has clearly never been cleaned
where do you expect them to be there no room on the desk it s not disrespect there s no room
looks like storage
bro is one mf with that dusty musty crusty ahh desk with his busted ps5 they should ve gave bro a gameboy as his only console and an elmo game instead of a phone console etc btw i d take the action figures over a ps5 any day because there cool
tbh i feel more infuriated that you are making your brother feel bad for maybe not liking the gift you got him i now live alone but i also know how to fake a smile to a gift i may not like but was given to me by a loved one your brother doesn t owe you anything
no he clearly spends a lot of time at the desk the bin and contents are there within arms reach like a child s toy box and not stuffed away in a closet or garage space he may not have removed some of the figurines from the original packaging because he considers them too valuable collector s items
ohh this is a tough one i see both sides
once you gift something its off your hands be free my friend
you got them shit gifts and think you have a right to be offended they are the one who got shit gifts
you should have bought his ass a vacuum cleaner cuz gyatt dayum
the desk chair table floor i feel dirty just looking at the photos there s more respect being shown for your gifts here than anything else op you got this all ass backwards
could not agree more life gets so much easier when you re not hung up on these sort of things
just save your money and regift him all the gifts he gets you
just wait until they release formula racing you ll love that even more
i recently got diagnosed with t1 diabetes and all i got for my birthday was diabetes related stuff i appreciate the care they have for my comfort in it but i honestly couldn t care less that i got diagnosed because it really has not affected me to much it honestly annoys me that while my sister our birthdays are close gets a nice set of airpods that i also wanted for my birthday but instead i got a pack to hold my gear already had one i do love them all but it s hard to be enthusiastic about something i honestly could care less about
it may be petty but i would get him gifts related to one of your interests that you know he doesn t care about please please please make wishlists and have your kids do so as well or help them if they re too young to do it on their own tell him that unless he gets something off of the list he shouldn t bother getting presents for you since he clearly doesn t care about getting you something you ll actually enjoy as someone who sucks at gift giving but actually genuinely wants to get people things they ll like wishlists have been a godsend for me and i have one that i update periodically and have ready to copy paste and send to friends and family mine is a note on my phone but there are other options for keeping track of these things amazon wish list etsy favorites etc i just keep a note because it allows me to add and link products from a variety of places sites and also include more general requests like gift cards nonspecific clothes and such it may or may not kick your brother s ass into gear but i d say it s worth a shot
sounds like you ve got shit taste and need to get your crotch goblins into f1 racing step your game up you re failing at life
he s shaming his brother that s low idc what your family did or anyone you know did this is not a good reason to shame someone
that s a lot of wrong assumptions a quick look through op s profile shows that he is so i guess the gifts are for a younger brother probably a teenager
ah yes the way family hates you don t try and gift them what they like assume they have to like the gift and if they don t be a rude shit and post a shame picture and than ignore them on their birthday while your family ignores you i will give you a secrete if you don t know what they want money gift them money
you should have bought his ass a vacuum cleaner cuz gyatt dayum congnitive _failure i detect haikus and sometimes successfully learn more about me https://www.reddit.com/r/haikusbot/) opt out of replies haikusbot opt out delete my comment haikusbot delete
this would have been the smart play literally wait a year and re gift it when he doesn t remember at this point youd have like years of gifts to pass off
the weird thing is i didn t post it in that format and haikus require a seasonal reference fix your bot it doesn t know what haikus are
i don t understand how some of these drivers can be so bad
i ve had this happen to me where they take a photo of it somewhere sus couldn t find the food and then door dash refused to refund or credit the order lost about in dinner one time sucks people gotta half ass their job especially if you ve already given them a good tip when you make the order originally
looks like it s still on the front seat of there car
threaten a charge back and they change their tune real quick
shrinkflation
drink water and let all those greeders rot in hell
i like how some products advertise specifically with them not having any preservatives while this says antioxidant infusion many preservatives are antioxidants
it s no longer such a good bai that it once was
what s more infuriating tiny bottle with same price or same size bottle with higher price i bet that s the question bai market execs had to answer lol
say bye to bai
arizona cans have been cents for years i have noticed a few that don t have the cents printed on the can but they re branded circle k so as far as i know that s the only large chain store that sells them for more love the arizona brand
as these greedy bastards reap record profits
shrinkflation baby
u could make ur own
wait you guys go to drink isn t water
lucozade went from for a litre bottle to for 900ml a short while back just for that i ve not drank it ever since
my dad drinks these they re also getting rid of certain flavors his favorites sucks
economy is doing fine no one panic
have you been asleep for the last two years it s called shrinkflation
those bai drinks i thought were very healthy for you when i looked into it it has erythtol and it has been coming out as very dangerous for your heart so fucck that i m good
people putting up with this shit and continuing to buy the product is the reason it keeps happening
i just wanna read the corporate lingo filled bullshit blurb they wrote for justifying this to customers
stop buying plastic bottles
welcome to shrinkflation an extremely irritating phenomenon
what about the potato chip bags it s insane lately
well antioxidant infusion is a scam anyway
but you get the same amount of calories so that okay
find a new drink then if you re unhappy the best thing to do is stop supporting them
yeah it s called shrinkflation when inflation happens they have two options raise prices or shrink the product in this case they shrunk the product
it s called shrinkflation they make the bottle smaller so they don t have to charge more it s been happening for years people notice when things cost more but usually don t notice less product
it s smaller but still calories
vote with your dollar stop buying they keep doing this bc they know they can and you ll keep buying stop being complacent
just drink water
ditch that crap anyway it has erythritol
i mean you were already paying an absurd amount of money for flavored water what s a little more
damn i love bai looks like ima have to start shoplifting it
and even worse they changed the flavour
i am altering the deal pray i don t alter it any further
you know this is the new normal too no matter if inflation is fixed
bai bai to cheaper times and hello to shrinkflation op
guess you could say they said bai
why is your go to bai
and it s still calories a bottle volume shrunk by yet calories remain the same does this make sense to anyone
this would be a good moment to say bai bai
yeah and they think we are too dumb to notice i quit purchasing a few products because of this
we sell this at the store i work i have never seen someone buy one
for stuff like this consider writing or emailing the copy and telling them they are losing you as a customer
but you are comparing watermelons to blueberries
time to swap brand we love capitalism
thanks bai den
this stuff tastes like dogshit
but not less calories
time to say bai bai to this brand
its just another benifit of demoshit echo comics
capitalism at its best sticking it up to the little guy
antioxidant beverage fucking hell get a grip
have you ever heard of inflation money is losing value so they shrink it to the point that it costs en same amount to make and same profits
buy fresh fruit chop it up freeze it add frozen chunks to your water bottles every day make your own drinks death to ceos and corporate greed
time to learn how to make yummier juice at home
have you ever considered that your drink is disgusting edit you all really love your bai
bidens america
everything costs more and or is smaller because of higher minimum wage and or taxes most people that are selling something are going to want the same profit margin no matter what this was the argument back when everyone was demanding higher minimum wage people were saying it would drive up the cost of everything welp here we are everything is more expensive so now we all need another raise
maybe they reduced the amount of water they use and the size of the bottle but kept the same amount of syrup that would explain why the calories are still the same does it taste any sweeter to you op
murica we re number one
bye bye bai
same amount of calories
bye bai
gif giphy l1j9zyisjpayojfri downsized antioxidant is bs do you believe in those airborne pills too

thank bai den
that s at least a sip of lost liquid get over it
it s just business
you forgot thank you biden
is biden economics
shrinkflation let s go brandon
criminal
that s odd guess it depends on where you buy it but at wegmans when it used to be 18oz bottles the six pack would cost me after the reduction to 14oz it s which seems to match up with the total cost
as their commercial once put it none of this makes any sense
stoopid
better say bye to bai see what i did there
op s reaction girl bai
blue has the most anti oxygens
i noticed this too and it s disappointing
perfect example of the world today
send a strongly worded letter
you still bought it they won
same goes for cookies as well used to be 400g package costing on sale now it is 275g 320g package but the buggers are charging regular price or on sale how is that fair
eurythritol has recently be shown to massively increase blood clotting stay away from those
that is more revenue
mass boycott of offending products is the only way to curb this corporate greed
same with my bagels used to get in a bag now i only get for the same price
yea inflation sucks if only people were actually curious about the cause and effect
bai bai prices

those things are so damn expensive but i love the cherry flavor it s the best imo

knife or box cutter slid right along under that overhang
you are supposed to pull the front panel off during installation its usually screws and it slides down and off it has documentation behind the panel and you can cleanly remove film
you think they re going to give them a whole new appliance instead of them just using a knife to slice that off
oo that s gotta hurt
are you in an apartment or house is it your plumbing leaking or the people who live above you
dont leave your laptop under that or do gif emote free_emotes_pack joy

i live in a house apparently there s something wrong with the piping around the bathtub on the floor above
haha whats the point
but why
the skid marks are a nice touch
what a load of
did he get mexico to pay for it because that wall is useless
i would just toss it on top of the dryer and then cram it all in but yeah this don t make no sense
just make sure you don t go on amazon and look for the key to those pay washer and dryers and definitely don t use the money inside to have yourself free laundry beware of cameras also don t do not take the money only use it for free wash i mean don t don t do that
time to practice your basketball skills
haha i would be on that immediately thankfully the landlords did one smart thing and deactivated the payments so laundry is free
you mean you wouldn t be on that immediately lmfao
this lady looked like she was in her s too
inconciderate shit like we can t smell your stinky feet back in j19 if turbulence it she s sue the airline for injuries reminds me of the same people that put their feet out cars as a passenger seriously unsafe likely same one that has their dog s head out window they can go blind but hey your dog
i m sorry but this looks so funny i m just picturing the way she must be sitting and it s hard to imagine somebody thinking this is acceptable to do
this has to be weird trend no way in hell someone finds that comfortable
that s disgusting zero manners or self awareness in that idiot
i feel bad for the person next to them
keep your shoes on keep your feet on the floor or the footrest that is all
wtf the next person on that flight sitting there will have had no idea
does it usually seem to be female feet in these kinds of pictures
they are clearly having intercourse
lmaoooooo in the philippines truck drivers are notorious to do this in the truck and you see their feet hanging during traffic in the plane though hahahaha next level
admit it you ve always wanted to moon the state
the saddest part is people are more comfortable in this position than with the leg room given fuck airlines fuck all of them
omg
can t really tell from the feet
putting your feet on the dashboard of the car i ve seen the x rays where they had damage to their hips along with their legs whenever the driver got in an accident
must be the latest tiktok challenge
as long as they don t smell and not resting on another person s chair i don t think it s disgusting it s just two feet
but they were on the flight and saw her in person
ew it is acceptable no where to take your shoes off in public and put them up in the air resting above your head horrible manners
they are far apart but tbh true op probably wanted to see their face so they pretended to pee to see them
why i m not talking about smelly feet what s wrong with feet without shoes because they are high up in the air or because the feet are exposed whats wrong with feet wearing socks some people have a hard time travelling because their feet get swollen so maybe they need to put them high up in the air
i didn t have to pretend but you got it
bare feet are not ok anywhere public in north america i grew up with a lot of punjabi people and i mean this in no offence but they don t see this the same way seeing them slip their shoes off in a public place is not that uncommon but in north america is considered poor manners no shoes no shirt no service could be a cultural thing
why does my foot keep getting in the way when i shoot
tell them sorry that you re late the interview ran longer than expected
you certainly gave your manager a lot to think about
shit happens tell them exactly that unexpected and explosively for your whole morning so far take the day off tell em i said it s ok this time
is your boss the one that s mildly infuriated
i guess you don t deserve a raise after all
i think you should ask for pay decrease it s fair and all
a number of years ago i had a lot of medical and personal things going on i was late every day for a couple of weeks my boss finally asked what shift are you working she was aware of what was going on in my life i looked at her and said the after shift she chuckled about my answer but i did realize it was an issue and corrected it
when i went through divorce no kids it was pretty hard on me i was a commission only employee making great money turned my house into a sweet bachelor pad and went wild started partying my ass off staying out up late drinking having people over etc most nights during the week i got in the habit of going into my professional office job at 10am wearing flippy floppies shorts a polo and a sun visor with my hair all fucked up immediately closing the door to my office taking hour lunches and jetting out for 30pm happy hours but i was making the company money and i think they were compassionate toward my situation with my divorce so nobody said a word about it for like months eventually my vp started gently telling me i needed to get back to 7am mornings i ignored him for weeks which eventually led to a meeting with the president of the company who delivered my final warning i started showing up at after that and was never late again
if you re not usually late i don t see an issue lol just be honest and say my fault bud lol
sets up a meeting to discuss raise manager confused because op doesn t show starts wondering what the fuck is going on op sell it hard thank them for the discussion on pay say is more generous than you were expecting then go about your day
power move keep them waiting
it s ok what is the totality of your performance your experience and your merit go with that you were late once but it doesn t define your value
if they ask why you were late say the garbage truck broke down in front of your driveway or something
i guess it depends how that meeting went if they declined the raise i d say this was right on time
good for you
alright it s been hours what came of this
it will be alright relax everything happens for a reason oooommmm
this is life my guy nothing you can do now but hopefully all the times you have been on time worked hard outshine this oopsie good luck
id being late once was reason for them to not give you a raise then id start looking elsewhere
well that s a sure sign that you re not ready for it
well that sucks
tell the truth you were so anxious about the asking for a raise you could not sleep all night then your cat shit on your car keys
i m here for update if you get the raise i hope you get it we re all human
ahahah i ve been there before op accidentally setting your alarm to pm instead of am that one time i hope your boss is understanding it you ve only been late twice in in years just be honest
it s unfortunate timing of course but being late one day shouldn t be the overriding factor in the decision for or against your raise some managers are petty about everything hopefully yours isn t
it happens don t worry about it how late were you just curious
ah yes being infuriated with the fact you were the one who messed up big time
you couldn t help being late you stopped to help a little old lady cross the road and then there was this kitten stuck in a tree
me irl
tell them the power company shut you off because you can t afford the bill and as a result your alarm didn t go off and your phone died either that or you have been shitting uncontrollably for hours or go slash your tire and take a photo of it with today s shoes and pants in the photo and say you got a flat
that s capitalism correcting itself
did you vote for biden
way to go
youre doing it right dont worry
ooooooo i like that one
yeah then get laid off with no backup great idea
genius
dude im so irritated especially since this is the 2nd time i been late in a year and a half
this i needed this thank you lol
i m the one mildly infuriated
my thought exactly
if i get a pay decrease then i win
it s my 2nd time being late in months and i m dreading it
hey man stuff happens the good thing is that you were able to fix the issue and keep going
lol i know im just one of those overthinker types
hahaha love it
good comes to those that wait
i m the head of my own department and have improved the state of the company in ways no one else in my position has in the history of the entire company i ve taken constant responsibility for things that aren t even in my job description lol i think i m valuable right
hahaha that would be so perfect uhh yeah boss garbage truck legit broke down in front of my driveway typical dog ate my homework excuse where it s totally possible but just rare lol i love it
hahahahaha meeting hasnt happened yet x200b edit wanted to add more if its declined after all the hard work i put in i will revolt x200b lol probably not but yeah
nothing boss hasn t scheduled the meeting yet
this is exactly what i live by you re exactly right
that s what i m hoping thanks fellow human
if you have a meeting to discuss your raise and you don t show up you re not getting the raise if you show up late one time on another day whatever i totally agree w ya
my cat did it
thank you for this waiting on the boss to schedule the meeting he s quite the busy guy lol
hahahaha thats it i absolutely hate it man but i know it happens and i will thanks
he s a pretty cool guy i m sure he understands
minutes but hey i worked hours over
story of my life not mad at everyone else mad at myself always
i then proceeded to be honored by the city for my good deeds and thats why i was a late all at a m
at least im not alone
this i like i m not a liar at all so this is something i d do
i ain t taking advice from someone who oversleeps on getting a raise
in nh at least this would be wrongful termination which is illegal given what op has said they set up a meeting to talk abt a pay rise it would be rather hard for the company to deny they fired the employee for a legitimate reason
and to add a bit of truth say it was for your dream job
you ve only been late twice in months this is good excuse practice time of most modern jobs are about making up what you do when it s meeting time anyway
you didn t need this you are a dumb motherfucker i am your employer and you ask for a meeting requesting a raise i take time to consider this and you cant even get your lazy ass out of bed on time to get to the meeting you arranged end of discussion kid i would actually consider terminating you
what the fuck are you getting downvotes for vast majority of reddit is stupid as a fucking brick
ah yes i also hate when i am a victim of my own poor planning
people downvoting can t accept the truth
sometimes the downvotes on this sub make zero sense
don t understand these downvotes fuck reddit as if you fuckers haven t slept in by mistake before
no everyone deserves a raise hope you took the day off bud try again tomorrow
lol jim and dwight
it depends on the job but it s honestly not that serious still horrible timing i m sorry op
how late is late most places will allow minutes as a grace period some states require that when i was a fed contractor it was minutes tardy minutes late no show no call
you will keep going too being late for work once or twice does not negate an otherwise exemplary track record get that raise friend
just be like if i had a raise i might ve been on time lol
no i totally get it lol i am always hard on myself when i mess up but mine is more extremely vs mildly infuriating in this day and age with prices i hope you still get some kind of raise
well you couldn t help that the surgeon took so long helping you donate that kidney to the year old either can you imagine how much later you d been if you d let them use that anesthetic
very very fair
discuss
this wouldn t br the cause for termination they ll find somethin
pretty sure showing up late is reason for termination no
ya know i actually been working towards my dream job lately and they don t even know it
yeah i know i know let s see lol
my favorite thing about the internet is the fact that you have complete anonymity a quick glance at your profile just shows what a hateful and spiteful person you are which i fully believe reflects on who you are as a person i m willing to bet behind the screen you re genuinely just some random ass loser that nobody takes seriously you spend your time online and the only comments you make are typically full of hate for people you don t even know for little to no reason you truly are an asshole chief
you can t fire me i am suing you for a hostile work environment
the poster is human and admitted to their mistake there is nothing more they can do at this point aside from improving their time management which judging by the fact that they have been late twice in months doesn t seem to be too poor if as an employer you seek perfection you will be sorely disappointed
cringe
you seem like a nice and happy person
calling random internet people kid is extremely cringe fyi
hahahahahahaha dude i saw that was like was it something i said probably for the memes i self down voted
i m not alone

i think we bought poptarts from the same batch i had some not long ago that were split in the middle half plain crust and half actually filled frosted weird
they ve been skimping on frosting the past few years such a shame
i had a pack with one like that and the other with none
looks like it would make the perfect little pop tart bed in the perfect little pop tart town
the frosting took one look at those fingernails and ran for the hills
looks like the bed harry potter slept on
do you need a hug
just the toppart
lol i haven t had a frosted poptart in years prefer unfrosted myself and slightly dark from the toaster

no way this is legal i doubt silk feeling polyester is a proper material name
also i love the please clean before direct skin contact warning
hah this is what i think every time a shampoo commercial promises healthy looking hair like wait hold up there must be a reason they re saying it ll just look healthy and not be healthy no
silk so good it ll have you feeling polyester
so it s polyester but it identifies as silk
feeling polyester dunno might machine wash later
chinese companies on amazon do this shit all the time bezos doesn t care as long as he can jerk off in low earth orbit

ugh i shopped today at alpaca connection a store that has clothing made from alpaca shearings at least i thought so until today i felt one of the caps and thought that s weird its not as soft as the rest of the store their kids hats were acrylic apparently a lot of parents won t drop real money on kids clothes so they can t afford to make the kids stuff out of alpaca lol
made from the finest angora eating skunks

it identifies as silk it s texture fluid
it s not just misleading it s an outright lie for it to be accurate silk feeling needs to have a hyphen

it s not even grammatically correct it should be silk feeling i bet you could report that to the fcc or whatever
lol yea something tells me thats not silk
you won t believe it s not silk
without a hyphen i think they re violating regulations
kobe beef tasting meat
you can actually report them for that label to the ftc it is not in compliance tell them your misunderstanding was that you thought it was silk they feels like polyester the rules on listing composition are very clear what they did is not allowed
silk feeling polyester
cunts
not to be devils advocate but silk isn t just a fabric type but a description aka silky so it would be hard to prove they intended to trick you most the time silky feel is from the fabric being made of longer threads giving it the softer feel and shine you can have silk cottons polyester silk etc most synthetic silks are still labeled silk rayons or polyester and in my personal experience real silk stuff made from caterpillars is too much a pain in the ass for most people to want to bother shit nearly dissolves in water lol
wannabe silk
yoooooo
who cares caterpillars get boiled alive to make silk buy the alternative
it s not misleading if you can actually fucking read
fuck i wish my first 3d print layers looked as good as the lines on that shirt
oooops
of men s tinder profiles ripped and shredded feeling a little tubby
did silk get polyester s consent first
wym it clearly states silk feeling polyester
that is just plain stupid marketing but i have to be honest what they are able to do with polyester these days is awesome i have these fluffy polyester bedsheets and they are the softest and most pleasant textile i have ever had they aren t that soft after few years but as long as they sell them i will never go back to cotton

this is hilarious
i read feeling polyester like soundgarden
i d be more concerned that you need to clean before direct skin contact what the hell is on that silk feeling polyester
i ll give you money feeling paper
it s only infuriating if you fall for it
it s actually not a scarf it s a scarf feeling sock
the polyester just feels like silk man let a material vibe
can someone ad lib this tag kinda like woke up asshole feeling like a gentleman
this is honestly pretty funny though
the silk is doing what to the polyester
chicken tasting sandwich
i m so glad to live in a country where all the things you buy are regulated so a company can t lie trick a customer you always have years warranty and being able to return a product within two weeks if not used damaged
they were even smart enough to make it ambiguous by leaving out the hyphen if it said silk feeling polyester it would be clear that this isn t silk but because of the line break you could easily read this as silk feeling polyester as in this is actually silk but it just feels like polyester to you
removed
pretty much
this is a chinese brand that makes drop ship quality polyester knockoffs of high end scarf designs they re not worried about the legality of their tags
if vegan leather is a legal material label then i m sure this is fine
i thought my favorite r b group was in the mood for a john waters film

but you should actually do this with most clothes unless the fabric is something you don t wanna bother going through the laundry for
well i mean actual hair is dead material it can t be healthy your hair follicles can but of course that s not what the shampoo commercials are talking about
because unless a product is tested and proven by the fda you can t make claims about health that s their way around that

no it feels like silk

couldn t tell you
that much packaging is no bueno
nice candy but very fragile and they use so much packaging because of this excessive packaging should be illegal
kit kat got it right
kinder bueno packaging has always driven me up a wall i feel so bad getting them just knowing how much of it goes to waste
yo we heard you like packaging
probably stays fresher and doesn t break like that
horrible just noted it myself when i put the trash to the curb have hardly ever trash yet my recycling bin is overflowing like crazy
very common in food packaging not surprised opened a box of cereal only to find the bag was full admitted cereal is sold by weight but it still looks deceiving manufacturers also play with amounts too a popular sports drink is more to buy yet is sold in 28oz instead of 32oz buyer beware and read your labels
yea i always thought this was un needed
huh i ve actually never seen that much packaging for kinder buenos when there s multiple packets usually or they are just stuck together with a little adhesive piece on the side on them no extra box and outside packaging
costco execs hold my beer
right the first time i had it i complained about it to my boyfriend
this and palm kernel oil are why i avoid nearly all candy
man i just picked up one of these the other day and thought the same thing i like them but damn
are you only displaying one of the four bars prominently to seem more dramatic
and then the candy bar turns out to taste like some kind of packaging too
that s no bueno
that amount of packaging is no bueno
were there bars why show one
kinder is the worst for that everting is double wrapped
you bought more plastic than chocolate
op my wife and i get those every week and we say the same thing every time why so much packaging but they are delicious af
this is no joke my favorite candy
if i want hazelnuts i just pick em off the bush provided i can beat the squirrels and blue jays to them they usually win though
welcome to germany the government cares about you
so we put packaging in your packaging
how do you have no trash that s a weird flex
no all bars are present it is like a progression to show the stages of packaging i thought it would be bars under the main packaging but it was separated into packs i then opened one pack and was very surprised that it had additional packaging for each individual bar if each bar is individually packaged then why is the pack packaging required
you can literally see the other three
that s why i used the word prominently i can clearly see that all bars are present but you ve arranged it so it looks like there s only
you can t lterally see anything unless you are blind and are given sight
looks to me like they arranged them in a dissected sequence to show the levels of packaging from highest to lowest if your eyes deceive you then that s on you mate
i can literally see one other and then the other packet containing the other two

tomatoes should be free if you didn t get cheese
i went to a restaurant yesterday that charged me because i asked for no tomatoes in a wrap i doubt i ll go back there again
is that a lettuce taco with piece of tomato
these fast food places are getting out of hand with their portions and prices lol
deleted
i love taco bell so much but also sometimes i hate it
the tomatoes at taco bell are usually a shade of orange mealy and taste of water at best chemicals at worst i d send an email to them with the pic maybe get a gift card
that s why at this point in my life i have zero trust for fast food they charged me like something for extra jalapeos i only got one jalapeo on four burritos so in return i always always check my orders in any fast food drive through bc mcdonalds is guilty af too before leaving the window and idc how shitty they get with me because they earned it and i feel like if others need to sit at the window for as long as it takes im not even mad i get it
usually they charge and just forget entirely
so i cleaned the kitchen today and didn t want to make a mess after grocery shopping i picked up taco bell they charged me to add tomatoes to three tacos but no credit for no cheese of course and then this is how many tomatoes they gave me https://preview.redd.it/yur1xl43h6sa1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=860fbc91996657e556edbcddc7a3e5f0bacf6e66
my question is where s the fucking meat
that s cents per tomatoe kernel
like how subway be with their olivs
tacobell is a scam
that s why i always have a can of rotel
blame the stoned teenager not the company
the other night i ordered tb got no tomatoes on item but they added tomatoes to all other items that normally don t even have tomatoes to be fair though the orders are never correct at this tb last trip and that was chips cheese
i will never go to taco bell again making amazing tex mex style tacos at home is just way too fast easy and cheap for tomatoes on my tacos i just use canned drained diced tomatoes with chilies like cents for a can of them at aldi enough for a dozen tacos
meanwhile someone else got a chalupa supreme in their deluxe box and scraped them off
going out to eat has become ridiculous
it s been years since i worked there and before fresco style i used to suggest getting a supreme no sour cream it was cheaper than the added charge for tomato
lettuce pray this isn t a new normal
taco bell acts like you re murdering them when you pay for tomatoes on tacos they give like little pieces per taco l
your first mistake was going to taco bell
it s so much better to make taco bell at home we just started doing it for our taco tuesdays and we wish we would have done it sooner you can stuff them as much as you like also they sell their sauce at walmart they were always stingy about their sauce recommend
why has no one sued taco bell yet it feels like everyday i m either seeing tacos miss stuffed under stuffed or people complaining about diahria from actually getting what they ordered
i love tacos but taco bell messes with my stomachs so i avoid it like the plague unless i want some cinnamon twists and a baja blast luckily i have a drive by better places for tacos around me just to get to a taco bell plus those places give you more than shreds of cheese
the opposite situation is actually pretty nice though if you ask for no tomatoes on their basic tacos it reduces the price i m surprised they charged that much though and ofc the amount is pitiable i think it s like less taco i see now that there was no reduced price for the cheese so maybe it s franchise difference
first mistake was to go to taco bell
i use to get fast food and eat my lunch by the river in my hometown if i d get fries i d throw some in the water and seaguls would come get then if i d have tacobell i d throw my dropped veggies in for them they d refuse to eat them that s the quality of tomatoes you get from there idk why you d pay extra to get tomatoes from tacobell
that s not a taco i m mexican
you added tomatoes yuck you deserve it
im downvoting shit like this from now on fast food bad is getting old just go to the fucking grocery store
stop eating bullshit fastfood
yall still eat this trash lmao get what you pay for
the fact that you got food and taco bell are disappointed and are now posting on the internet about it just baffles me what did you kid think was going to happen when you ordered food there d enyou didn t think it was going to actually look like the commercials did you
should have picked up a tomato on the way home for like and cut it up yourself
i need to get into the taco business
two of them were probably cores idk what it is about taco bell that requires at least tomato core in any item with tomato
capitalism thanks you for your service
for that fucking price i ll buy the tacos and buy a tomato from the market too fuck that lol dice your own edit actually while i m here at the market i m just gonna make x the tacos for half the price by buying my own lol
i m glad to see you at least got a cheesy gordita crunch if you re only ordering crunchy tacos at taco bell you re doing it so so wrong
they make something that comes without tomatoes
this isnt fine dining you hope they get of your order right
ain t no way they charged you for some damn tomatoes cut the cap
saw this thought this better be on r mildlyinfuriating because i m honestly ready to take up angry villager arms read plastic fast food cutlery possibly on fire over this what a ripoff seriously
that s unsat but that s taco hell for you no real mexican food near you easy for me to say because i m in az so it s easy to get actual good mexican food at a decent price from a mom and pop
the other day i went to taco bell and ordered a chicken quesadilla it was like seven bucks and had no meat whatsoever in it just a folded slightly cheesy tortilla
this is why chipotle is better
i ask for no tomatoes and they come littered with the boogers two hot sauce packets pleases gives me makes no sense
thats profit baby s
would it have been cheaper to get deluxe and no sour cream
what tomato you mean that tiny spot of red that looks absolutely pitiful
anyone remember when taco bell was affordable i went there the other night it s been years and i spent bucks for tacos and a drink taco bell isn t good enough to charge that
it s criminal how they re charging so much for something so little if they wanna be fair about it they should take off the difference in price if you re removing something
inflation hitting crazy
they have been doing this when i ask for extra and get charges as well i stopped ordering extras
someone needs to be fired expeditiously
i don t understand why in when you have every cuisine and type of food at your fingertips why anyone would choose to eat a dry taco shell plus lettuce
it is mildly infuriating that people go to crappy fast food places and expect them to not give them crappy food
i was a taco bell employee for a single day i went to the first day orientation and they were walking us through the store explaining everything then they handed out a shirt and hat so i could start the following day right at the end they showed us the rear exit door at the end of the kitchen area where you take the trash outside it had a huge warning sign that said something about not opening the door after dark i asked why they said they have had a few instances of people waiting outside that door and robbing the place at gun point after the store closed at night this was the mid s and it was paying minimum wage around the hr range noped right out of there anyway that s my tacobell story
i ask for my tacos with no tomatoes every time those mfs always put like a pound of tomatoes on there wanna trade taco bell s
at least you got taco bell i went last night at and the guy said the drive thru was temporarily closed so i asked is the dinning room open he said no i have ten orders to make and i m the only one here shits getting real out here
thats what u get for eating outside these days you re basically playing russian roulette even if you initially think that you got your money s worth
get the supreme with no sour that s usually cheaper
should have chosen gif giphy 26gssek4kzcxxakew downsized
boy am i glad that i hate tomatoes
fast food is now just as expensive as some actual restaurants i used to love taco bell but the crunchwrap and taco game have gone downhill only things i get are bean burritos and steak quesaritos it just becomes so disappointing
it usually is ask for fresco style and they swap cheese for tomatoes for free but if you say no cheese add tomato they charge you cuz that s what their system does in that order of operation
right
if you ask for fresco style they ll take off the cheese and add tomatoes no extra charge
you two should switch restaurants you get charged for tomatoes you dont want and op has to pay for tomatoes he dont get
the only reason this could make sense is if they overfill other ingredients to compensate
that ll be for describing the food
even the mcdouble seems smaller these days
i did they said they couldn t do that
i have no idea why anyone would pay extra for taco bell tomatoes because your description is probably being too nice to them easily the worst tomatoes i ve ever had and it s amazingly consistent how bad they are i love tomatoes but i use their app to order any time i go there just so i can remove the tomatoes on anything i get that has them
whataburger isn t much different i used to always get upsized fries and drink let the kids have the drink and burger while i ate the fries then they got fucking cheap as hell with the fries and put a medium amount in a large cup it s supposed to be all the way full not halfway
the real crime is tacos a torta essentially and a pepsi costs
if you ask for fresco style they ll take off the cheese and add tomatoes no extra charge at least where i live it s also an option in the app under style at the bottom when you customize doesn t change the fact that they gave you a shitty number of tomatoes but hopefully you can avoid the extra charge in the future
next time ask for a side of tomatoes you ll get a little cup of them for it ll be enough for all three tacos
did it have any beef in it
that ll be dollars extra
chipotle better
still a much better deal compared to any burger fast food place now you can spend and get a meal at taco bell you are easily at burger places
yes and if you have that you may as well make your own tacos it s stupid simple
honestly rarely get fast food and there are limited options close by in my town i actually went to wendy s first and their computers were down i did a deep clean of the kitchen today and just really didn t feel like cooking i was really tired
i mean i m not gonna sue them over but i sure af will complain about them on the internet
don t like your order just walk back in with your food and collect a refund they don t give a flying f either way
omfg it s not a regular occurrence go ride your high horse elsewhere
amen needs to be said in this economy fast food is stupid
don t have one near me
taco bell employee here can confirm we re supposed to prompt you for fresco style if you say something like this but that might just be a my area deal
wraps are probably pre made sub items means they now have to make one outside normal prep time
that could be a possibility but then again we know how business are these days
even my wee wee seems smaller too shrinkflation

they are so consistently terrible it makes me think they have tomato vendor globally i imagine they pick them when they are a shade of white and do their best to ripen them after being picked or just spray with color ripe tomatoes have a short shelf life and a lot of liquid hard to maintain quality control and would prove problematic to a huge chain
i don t live in a state with a whataburger but when i go to one its my guilty pleasure we have a local chain here that used to have holster fries which were like an xlarge and was almost too much to eat they came in container that looked like a gun holster sometime during covid they changed the holster fries to what used to be the medium fry container and just changed the label to holster fries and it was not longer shaped like a gun holster i guess no one was supposed to notice
yeah the standard amount from what i remember
i feel like this has been happening more often
seems like this is happening a lot more recently i ve resorted to trying to track down physical cds for some artists
someone wrote a song about the mid 2000s tv show veronica mars

even things i ve already played are suddenly unauthorised
yeah right i immediately looked it up on spotify there is a soundtrack of i guess the movie kickstarter backed if i remember correctly and there is a track which appears to be some dedication to veronica mars

you can see that there s no when the full label is visible
oh even wors
here s the math i m assuming the drinks are half price based on that assumption the regular price on the drinks would have brought that subtotal up to those percentages are based on that subtotal not the discounted subtotal for the sale price on the drinks i m not saying that it s right or wrong just doing the math you re welcome
i just realise it s the end that doesn t work the rest seems okay
it is because they are calculating the tips off of the standard drink rates not the deal just using the tip i get that each drink is typically more expensive so i m assuming the drinks are half off
the tip percentages are based on the regular prices of the drink not the discounted prices that s what s happening here don t shoot the messenger folks
in all honesty i would ve never caught that the tip percentages were off lmaooo that s devious af
yeah i think u drank a little too much they re selling the house margs for each when u buy of them lol
was this a split check
post again without censoring the name of the place also post on yelp and google reviews you ll never make them honest until it s painful to be dishonest
that s literally what it costs you don t get for you get at which means each is literally says it right there dumbass and i swear to god if you argued with these poor workers with your drunk assumptions the tips are accounting an undiscounted price that s how the automated system works if you pay anywhere near what your receipt says with a discounted order you re still a dumbass cry and downvote
that s very frustrating as if you can t just do simple math to check
chilis rellenos is the most underrated of all the mexican cuisine i don t know what a crispy relleno is but i bet it s en fuego
i mean yeah but it s still nothing compared to toilet paper math
no the math is right without knowing the tax rate we will have to assume the tip amounts are off though
glad my country doesn t have this problem
it s a common programming screwup in register systems it is calculating the tip as a margin rather than a markup the tip percentage is including the tip itself the person who developed this software had no real idea what they were doing were to sloppy to check their work and pushed it out to market
gif giphy rlo3aazzvebbfwqmcb
just putting it out there that americans are daft not including tax in the price
there are an increasing number of inflated tip math posts on reddit or i am scrolling a lot more reddit than i ever did before and this has been going on for a while hmmmm
we tried that math too each drink was originally and the math still wasn t adding up
each drink is normally
we thought that too and tried draht math but it didn t add up each drink was originally
my husband works with numbers for a living so he s good at mental math and he put a tip but when i looked at what he wrote i saw that it was less than what the receipt said was and told him we couldn t til that little and he was so confused thats when we realized the percentages were off
actually look under the thank you i can t remember if you are supposed to use the subtotal or the total but neither works anyways
look at the tip percentage suggestions
no my husband and i were on the same check look at the tip percentages
i understand what you re saying i only crossed out our super sweet and kind waitress name and the address of the place because we live right next to it
it s funny when somebody calls somebody a dumbass but they are completely wrong op is talking about the tip percentages there are other factor that can affect those like split bills but pull your head in mate
look at the tip percentages
literally says it right there dumbass op is talking about the tip percentages not the prices dumbass
it s not the amount it s the tip percentages
the tip percentages at the bottom aren t accurate it has nothing to do with the at or for
look under the thank you that doesn t work
i think it s the same thing but fried
yeah the total is right it s the tip percentage that s off
if you calculate the drinks at 98ea as i did and not at 49ea not knowing they were on the menu the subtotal makes the math work
which would make it for drinks for food subtotal seems like the tips are low if they re going off menu price
rough math is it seems right they don t include the tax in the tip calculation then again i could be wrong i m sal from the cooking channel not janine from the math channel
calculating is easy take and double it should be just over they recommend over quickest way to know if those amounts are a scam or not
i ve seen before on reddit this happen when there was a split bill was this split
oh lolol i did the math for nothing was the service good
were you with others though sometimes they base that on table total if you were alone that s super shady
stupid ass reddit keeps doing this thing where if you reply to someone and edit another comment it adds to your original reply so idk what i even said here but don t pay the suggested price on a receipt when you have discounts the tip doesn t account discounts you re an idiot if you do
what dumbass pays suggested tips
what idiot looks at the tip percentages on the check when they have discounted items
they re accurate to the undiscounted price try math
i got that the tip amounts aren t correct i m just agreeing that it s frustrating i was trying to say how dumb to assume people can t do simple math and clearly see it doesn t add up
it was just me and my husband at dinner and we paid on check
our waitress was a sweetheart we thought about bringing it up to a manager but didn t want to cause any trouble for our waitress so we left an actual tip and left
no it was just us
op already said the math doesn t jive with the original prices you absolute fucking simpleton
true
salute
listen year old these automated systems put the original price together then calculate the tip the discount special is not considered by the system because that is accounted separately it calculated the tip and maybe even the sales tax because i have no idea where op lives independently of the discount if you can read english you ll realize you have no idea what you re talking about and i just explained to you exactly what you don t understand you re welcome
op stated the original price of the drinks learn to fucking read the math of the original price un discounted still doesn t work compared to the calculated tips
someone literally told him the tip is correct after he told them the original price you learn to read you fucking embryo
it still isn t accurate even without tax
you see kids these days they love the pokeemans
looks like it worked marketing was like how can we get the internet mad make the pokmon the wrong colors tah dah
actually might be smart marketing is seller is willing to do any of these models in any color guess if this was the case they could ve added multiple colors of each tho
you had one job marketing person
to be fair i would prime charmander with a white or yellow primer base paint first
almost like it s a scam site or something
that s just a shiny charmander
you want to buy and fix that mistake for them now won t you
how do you do fellow pokemans players
i feel like this is one of those mobile ads where they do the thing they are advertising so badly it makes you want to do it yourself just to do it correctly
i heard that those are printed off color because of copyright and likeness but that would mean squirtle and bulbasaur are garbage
it can be fixed paint charmander red pikachu yellow
how do you fuck up pikachu

looking at the horrible winding on those spools hope they get sales this coming from someone who have no shame in buying cheap filament but at least it comes neatly on the spool
is that weed whacker wire
char char
i wonder if you could use weed eater string in a 3d printer probably cheaper than the filament if possible
if only there were
they were going for the shiny charmander look obviously
charmachu and pikamander
no way you have digimon oh that isn t digimon no teenage mutant ninja turtles shredder

why did i get mad at this i dont even like pokemon marketing successful

nice now i ll definitely buy random unnamed 3d printer filament
if that was there goal why is the green one green and the blue one blue why not make the green one blue and the blue one green hhmm
the product is the filament behind it the pokemon are just example prints
and they succeeded at it mess up a small problem means that it spreads on reddit and more people see the product
i couldn t buy it out of principle well that and i didn t want any of those colors but mainly principle
look at you being all fancy using paint like some sort of big shot p
it s from amazon sooooo kind of _  _
plug him into an outlet
why do we keep letting jimmy do the marketing we all know he s color blind
now find the company on amazon and sell them your edit also great edit btw
man i love jimmy carr
agreed if my filament showed up like that i d be unhappy even if i only spent on it
i ve got some works just fine for smaller projects
it s filament for a 3d printer though there is a video of someone using weed whacker wire as filament for a 3d printer so i d have to assume you could do the opposite
zack freedman voidstar labs on yt tried it and it does work but not well and it s insanely expensive compared to just using proper fillament i think it was around for 200g of weed whacker wire
bro i ve got the shredder mobile
i wear my nerd badge with pride

as someone who was married to a colorblind individual for some time and somewhat of a color theorist myself who was highly interested in what he saw as opposed to what i saw i can in no way agree that this person was colorblind albeit this is a darker yellow and maaayybe possibly similar to the red in greyscale i still don t buy it i would rather bet on the fact that this was done by a disgruntled employee or someone severely overworked either way it s still disturbing nonetheless
are they trying to squeeze money or just trying to stop bar patrons from using their parking lot
reading the sign it says they are looking to reserve parking in their lot for people who want to patronize their tenants that is not unreasonable but the language on blok s sign shows their level of class as a parent that is just what i want in my community
the parking lot is right up against the bar and has been used by the bar for over two years the previous owners were fine with this situation because the only business in the now angry building is a dentist s office which is not open during the same hours as the bar there s no reason other than greed unless you are a fan of useless empty parking lots taking up urban space
don t take your kids to the bar
well i guess the new owners aren t fine with it maybe they don t want a bunch of obnoxious drunk people in their lot just saying
it s their property not the bars not everyone is ok with people using their property and they most likely don t want to be liable for any kind of drunken incidents
so by this logic you d be cool with people parking in your yard to save money on street parking or you don t own any land and wanted some reddit points
damn capitalists
well that s where i m going so if we re having family time that s where we re doing it
op said it s next to a dentist s office the sign is asking non dental patients who are parking in the lot to pay it is not like this is a bar district and kids are not allowed the offensive sign is at a dentist office
yes so the perfect solution is to make the drunk people park on the street in front of your building which is closer to the entrance than the parking lot
hahaha jesus i didn t know what i was responding to best of luck sir
you asking me or the other fella
i don t live at a dentist s office downtown and my yard isn t a big empty parking lot taking up space
it is a bar district whatever that is this is where all the bars are
the lot owner is not making them park anywhere they are providing them the option to park in their lot they could have blocked the entrance altogether the bar is the one encouraging them to park in the street and if the drunk people are responsible enough to uber home think about where their car is the next morning
solution that suggests there s a problem it s their lot
the person i responded to
a simple no would suffice
all the bars of okc are right there there is a dentist office on one side a hair salon across the street and self serve wash your dog place on the other side one cocktail bar halfway down the block that s it the rest is apartment lofts i stand by my comment that it is a trashy sign that is a bad look for the community and as a parent something i should not have to expose my kids to could have been handled with more class that is all
but i m lonely
a simple i m a douchebag would suffice
what the fuck is your definition of a district yeah if you fucking gerrymander this shit then sure there aren t any other bars in this district if you want to be realistic though a district would encompass all of deep deuce bricktown midtown etc
you want to go park in a non bar affiliated parking lot and get some drinks at a bar
you make a valid rebuttal to my point and i stand corrected upon finding out there are multiple bars within a mile radius i now believe it is quite appropriate to post a sign that says fuck in front of a dentist s office i retract all previous references to the sign as being classless and trashy and go on record to state this is indeed a good look for the community this could not have been handled any differently and i am sorry for my inconsiderate posts
i wouldn t say no
lmaoooooooooooo your issue is with the bad word
lmaooooooooo you ve had your panties in a bunch without even reading what the other side was saying rather short sighted my friend
micro transactions existing at all is majorly infuriating
i ve had mr coffee ones last years

bend down and give their toes a little suck and a nibble i bet they ll move them
every one of these posts is guaranteed to have a mixture of comments that include both ew those disgusting feet are in your space and start sucking on their toes
that s what teeth are for s
years ago i ended up on a packed train with a woman who didn t speak english and kept falling asleep on me
toe twist
should have thrown their feet of if they complain tell flight attendant what happened
yeah i m not buying it either
look maybe this really happened if so i m sorry but i ve also come to the decision that the majority of these types of photos are completely staged while it may very well be selection bias from hanging around mildyinfuriating too often i just don t believe there can be this many people who blithely put their feet or hair on people in planes and not just any people but active redditors this one especially where were your arms before this woman slid those crusty cheese doodles on your lap
this was just after i pressed the call button and didn t respond to me trying to wake her i was in that much shock i just had to take a photo of it cos no pics didn t happen to be fair she looked absolutely exhausted
it happens i had a woman fall asleep on my shoulder during a flight four years ago some people are raised in situations of dire neglect and as adults behave essentially like feral animals without any social niceties you see plenty of videos to that end on the internet these days
given she was fasy asleep that would be rape
what why

to be fair i would have assumed it was staged or a gf or whatever if it wasn t me that it had happened to she was already laying across the row when i boarded the place i was travelling alone hostess woke her up and told her to sit up so i could get to my seat im a window person so i was quite happy to rest head and drift off looking out not soon after i kinda wake up to this woman lying back down and legs on my lap like wtf like it was just too crazy to be real which is why i took the photo to show friends and fbook at the time
nah no need to say sorry can t trust anything on internet these days this happened years ago hence quality of phone photo being so bad i have a video too i totally agree get the impression most things are staged just for the clout i m not sure i care if anyone believes this or not i just had to share it because all the recent posts of feet on planes reminded me of what happened it was so surreal
there is a huge difference between someone leaning on your shoulder and someone propping their feet up in your lap
very huge difference weirdly only ever had gfs lean on me which is what made this so unexpected i was single and traveling alone though
cause it s plus years old it s not even active
i see apps that frustates me every time i open one by mistake

shrinkflation is a bitch
almost literally all brands are doing this right now
what i hate the most about shrinkflation is that i now have to shop more often for the same stuff such a waste of time
that is how inflation works money has less value than it did before both for you and for businesses manufacturers can either reduce the amount of product per item increase the price or a mixture of both it doesn t mean you are getting a deal just that the nominal unit price has increased as a side note inflation decreases the value of your debt the principal credit card mortgage and student loan debt will be reduced proportionally to how much the currency has devalued
they really should do a study on shrinkflation or just examine that per oz price in small font on the label costs always make it to the customer it s frustrating
they think they slick lol
thanks inflation

ya know you can buy more than one right
agreed and it is frustrating
they do making the bottle look cuter just to shrink it
yess especially the healthy chips like protein chips i buy quest chips and iwon they are so expensive but filling in between meals
that was the only spot it was in and they had some more behind it i m thinking maybe that s the last of the 22oz supply they needed to sell
meh not trying to go to jail or catch a charge
even cheaper at tj maxx they ve really expanded their shampoos body washes options i only get them there now half the price also good brands like nexus
true good thing the person you responded to used a portmanteau instead of a contraction

the only pussy you ve ever touched was the one you came out off isn t it
you re literally so dense in the head i ve literally never seen someone so dense
not inherently someone who gets paid small amounts frequently might have the money to go to the store to get the thing they need and be just constantly getting by month buy buying bottle where they increase the price compared to days could mean that you have to buy a new one at days because you re running low now with a shrunken bottle instead of an increased price you have to buy bottles some months and bottle other months so then that s adding irregularity to your monthly expenses obviously the math here is made up btw hopefully a bottle that size lasts a tad longer than a month lol
you mustn t have any mouths to feed the ignorance doesn t surprise me don t make a wrong move or you to could be ringing up a single bottle of suave

remember the security at the airport is not there to prevent a terrorist from bringing anything it is there to make people feel safe it might stop a random nut who tries to bring a gun or a pipe bomb although if you look at the failure rate when they inspect this seems like a crapshoot at best virtually no chance it stops a sophisticated terror plot it s called security theater it s a giant joke basically we have to rely on intelligence gathering to stop these attacks before they get to that point some ged recipient with weeks of training at the end of his shift is not keeping you safe

oh most definitely
just drive around him
reminds me of a line in a woody allen film that s fine we can just walk to the curb from here
i always wonder how legal this is i didn t sign a contract agreeing to this what if the sign said a fee would i have to pay because they put a sign on the fridge saying so if so can i leave my own sign that says if i find dust on top of the fridge i m going to clean it and charge the owner
this is why people are going back to using hotels yes you should clean up after yourself but that charge is outrageous
for two nights why tf do people even use airbnb
stayed at a tahoe airbnb first time we got charged a cleaning fee and was required to a long list of cleaning before leaving remove bed sheets and out in washer take trash out wash dishes clean stove top etc learned my lesson on that one
airbnb was a deal for like minutes and then everyone started dramatically increasing prices and fees i would much rather stay in a hotel where everything is taken care of some hotels actually offer a decent breakfast if you check around
when i had an airbnb i charged a night for a bedroom house and a flat cleaning fee that was it i had zero negative reviews everyone always told me that i charged too little but i lived right next door i think because the fee was so small people were more courteous to clean up after themselves without me even asking part of me wishes i never sold it because it was always booked
what if you took a huge dump in the kitchen sink
airbnb takes a cut of the nightly fee bht not the closing fee so they ve moved part of the nightly fee to the cleaning fee so it appears to be cheaper up front it has nothing to do with cleaning
and seriously thinking each guest will wash their dishes to the degree that the next person gets to eat off them so they wipe them clean with paper towels and return them to the cupboard without actually getting washed just gross cuz you know people aren t going to do a great job seems a bit disgusting
this is very frustrating when airbnb owners do this i recently had a week long airbnb and was so pleasantly surprised when the checkout instructions were nothing required but if you tidy up after yourself it s greatly appreciated
post the link to the airbnb i can promise you those signs will be removed for the next guest
i stayed at a vrbo last summer i got there a day before everyone and took a video and pictures of the whole place the day after we left the host messaged me about a quilt that he said should have been on the bed and they couldn t find it i sent him the video to show it wasn t there when i arrived i was glad that i did that or he would ve tried to charge me for a damn quilt
it s time to take air bnb out back and shoot it we could use the housing
my favorite airbnb had us pay a cleaning deposit that they could use if anything was majorly damaged like we spilled and stained the carpet and they had to get it professionally cleaned never had that happen we clean and leave everything as it was and they always have us our deposit back immediately i guess the is to pay a professional to go in there and really really forvan hour or two after you leave i read these places are being used by only fans to film sex stuff so there s bodily fluids getting everywhere so the process ces got raised
why use air bnb anymore
i ve noticed that the hotels are a better value for days or less unless you have a lot of people since it takes at least days to amortize out the fees
airbnb was chill like years ago now the cleaning fees double the price get a hotel unless you re getting a full on house with a group
sorry i don t clean on vacations hotels only
i ve had good stays with air bnb but we finally gave up trying to book with them on an upcoming vacation several attempts to book got cancelled because the owner didn t reply within hours and not even at the same places clicked a hotel booked a room got a confirmation how hard was that
should read thank you enjoy your chores
there to afraid to say extortion so cleaning fee sounds good
i used airbnb once and will never again
the dishes are one thing but to be fair the trash thing is a big bear city ordenance its manditory cabin guests remove their own trash and they have placed series of garbage bings where giests can throw their trash at whether its through airbnb or a local cabin rental spot you are responsible for your own trash in big bear
i stayed at an airb b and they required all bed linens to be stripped and the 1st load to be started in the washer the towels were to be brought to the laundry area and separated into piles according to color a white pile and a gray pile take trash out hand wash dry and put away dishes sweep the kitchen and bathroom floors none of this was posted prior to check in and there was still a cleaning fee i m not one to post a bad review shoot i d just assume leave no review than give a bad one but this experience warranted a scathing review i thought of it as an obligation to tell other people
i m realizing the cleaning fee is now an arbitrary bullshit number means nothing and the reason why i ll never again stay at an airbnb until the issue is corrected
you could cancel whatever credit card you used and then leave a big ol mess
those prices are insane and should be conditions that air bnb regulate for baby to take a few feet to the bin
like i understand loading the dishwasher and pulling your sheets and pillow cases off and leaving them in the laundry room i even maybe understand making sure all your trash is in one pile somewhere or if it s somewhere like a suburb take the trash to the curb on trash night what i don t understand is shit like this especially for the amount you re paying in cleaning fees
how did you screenshot a hair
i ve grown a hatred towards airbnb
fuck airbnb
usually the cleaning fee is to cover the cost of having a cleaning crew person come in after guests leave it seems high but that s the going rate to have someone clean your place if you hire out i have an airbnb and only charge a cleaning fee to cover exactly what my cleaning lady charges me i don t understand the extra fees that person added that does seem steep unnecessary
or just don t use airbnb it s overpriced anyway and all these people who rent their places out expect to be swimming in cash while doing no work for it
just stop using that crappy service
check vrbo when you travel too we travel with kids and sometimes pets so short term rentals are usually our best bet our last rental only had a cleaning fee we stripped the beds started the first load in the washer washed dishes and took out the trashes
as it is not part of your contract i believe you could legally dispute any additional charges with your credit card statement as the contract includes a cleaning fee they have already charged you for this service
i thought there was a hair on my screen because of the line on the second pic
the other stuff
that s a pricy clean up fee to do what change the sheets and vacuum the floor and maybe disinfect the bathroom assuming you didn t trash the place it should scale to what they actually need to do but definitely don t leave dirty dishes
take your trash where
this isn t even the worst i ve seen i ve seen shit like a night but with a a night cleaning fee that s the airbnb grift
my wife and i used to do airbnbs in big bear all the time we went up there just last december it might be the last time we use airbnb the fees are so crazy it just makes more sense to stay at a hotel now
stay at hotels airbnb is ridiculous cleaning fees for you cleaning up the place and paying to do it i don t care if they hire a cleaning service is insane for that purpose hotels only for me
airbnb hosts should have to provide a breakdown of how they justify these outrageous cleaning fees got a company that cleans it for you cool show potential customers the proof i ve had cleaning fees cost more than the stay itself and simply cannot understand where that money is going
that s why i stay at hotels and book car service or taxi i prefer the jobs done by professionals
it s straight up fraud they show a lower price and they add on the extortionate cleaning fee to create the real price if an airbnb charged any significant cleaning fee i wouldn t lift a single finger to clean anything not even a dirty dish let s see them fight with my bank as i contest every additional charge
that trash requirement is standard for rentals at big bear the dishes though should be in the
another mildly infuriating thing going to airbnb and potentially being spied on with numerous cameras around the home security ones by the front and back door is fine but some have gone too far people work hard to get the time off to enjoy themselves so let them or don t put your home up to be rented out
this is what happens when karen is the landlord
this is mildly expected tbh maybe we live in two different worlds but the only thing i can say with absolute confidence about airbnb is that they will charge me a shit load more than i agreed to if i were to ever use them
why did i know this was big bear without seeing the receipt
why does the dollar sign have lines through it
i once had an airbnb that put a limit on the hot tub shit was not hot shit was in the snowy months of lake tahoe never using airbnb again i hope you left these clowns a bad review i would left my trash spread out on the ground
not putting the dishes away or taking the trash apparently
also service fee for what
that stuff wasn t in the terms when you agreed soo you don t have to pay it right if you do then you should be able to cancel once they change the deal
hosts should pay for the cleaning themselves with the money they get from the nightly rent
the cleaning fee is so you think they didn t just remake the bed from the last stay
nickel and diming just charge for cleaning ffs
every decent human being takes the trash out and does the dishes even so the note seems a little passive aggressive since it s not agreed to up front
for for two nights i ll just go to the fancy corporate hotel
i don t do airb b but me and about friends rent a house in the south of france every year it s one private listing websites nothing to do with airb b it has always been asked to take care of your own trash which kinda makes sense that you d do your own dishes and take out your own trash i feel like the cleaning fee is for the actual cleaning the floor with water cleaning the sheet putting everything back to the way it was before that being said the agreements are always made up front but this ask of cleaning up after yourself has always been included
more than half a thousand for two nights ridiculous
it means that you should just stay at a real hotel
another added tax to boost profits it means nothing they probably paid a company to clean the unit and kept the other i m super done with this shit lately it s on every receipt you get now days there will be a charge for some random service that s always outrageously priced or like a dollar convenience fee
i thought airbnb was a great idea until i started looking for places to stay with their ridiculous fees and rules why are we cleaning the place for you when you are charging a cleaning fee hotels it is from here on out
the cleaning fee is for cleaning out your wallet
go to mammoth big bear isn t worth the headache
i ve stopped using airbnb no longer reliable and has become a total rip off with utterly entitled and lazy hosts
those big bear airbnb s are a fucking joke pics online looked amazing we get there and it looked like shit had a jacuzzi which was nice but the pair of dirty underwear next to it made it unusable and were pretty sure there was someone staying in the garage we never felt like we were alone never again
i haven t stayed at an airbnb for a few years but i don t remember it being this ridiculously expensive it seems like hosts can get away with just about anything now am i correct on that assessment
it is also not a hotel they legally can t keep any money for a cancellation air b b maybe but these listings these days are crazy a star resort with a buffet is cheaper than this
i ve never wanted to poop on a box and hide it in someone s house as much as i do at one of these ridiculous airbnb ruining the legit rental markets in towns then screwing guests and putting invasive cameras everywhere please stop using these creeps by the number of complaints it s run it s course that s why towns like mine are legislating so no one but on site homeowners can have air bnb it was intended as a side hustle and has become just hustle
how do you capture a hair in a screenshot
it s my understanding that the cleaning fees paid to the hosts are actually not taxed and claim it under the table whereas the nightly fee for the room is taxed another fucking disgusting cash grab from these greedy predatory neighborhood wrecking cocksuckers
gone back to using hotels fuck your fees i m not your fucking cleaner booking com is really cheeky with this as well
i d take a massive shit on the middle of the lounge floor cancel my credit card and leave
basically nothing airbnb are basically just lazy owners that think they deserve more than a hotel for none of the hotel cares because they don t want to work so the is a tip for renting you the place
it s just an extra cash grab lower the per night cost and make it up somewhere else every business does it really
the word is entitled learn it it s underused for most of the human scum who look at everything as an investment or a way to rip someone else off
ok i don t think the cleaning fee is for the dishes its a basic cleaning fee that happens in between each new guest i have no idea what that sign about the dishes is about my family has a beach house its not up for rent but we can either clean the house from top to bottom or we have to call a cleaning service this fee is industry standard and i hope people aren t leaving a sink full of dirty dishes its takes minutes to put them in the washer and turn it on before you walk out the door
i ve owned and rented out condos cleaning covers full scale cleaning of a place all surfaces all floors full bathroom scrubs and changing of linens asking someone to remove their trash because if you don t they also leave everything behind in the fridge and throughout the site or running the dishwasher before they leave is minor to me remember that typical checkout in hours are typically so all that has to happen across multiple units while the new tenant is typically begging to check in early now do i understand that that cleaning fee may not make sense from a buyer s perspective after a two day weekend vs a full week stay absolutely but the same cleaning practices have to happen regardless of your length of stay you would not want the cleaners to assume they can half ass it because the guests were only there a couple days i think things are going to balance out and people will find that airbnbs are appropriate for some trips and hotels are better for others

doesn t say anything about leaving a turd on the floor
this is reasonable not atypical to have check out responsibilities
not even higher end hotels charge a cleaning fee maybe a one but not at that point you might as well have stayed at a hilton or marriot location nearby it would ve been about the same if not slightly cheaper and you would ve gotten toiletries as well
random note is not a contract
you arent cleaning the bathrooms making the beds cleaning the sheets and doing laundry etc dishes and garbage doesn t seem like alotta work kinda basic stuff honestly
you don t know what else cleaners do other that wash dishes and take out the trash
ask them not us post ensuing response
easy one op forgot to wash the dishes times
you are paying to stay in their home be courteous and clean up after yourself the is for the deep clean flip after you have left leaving dirty dishes overnight is pretty foul leaving two nights disgusting take the trash out as you re getting ready to leave it s not a hard task
i d assume the bed sheets the floors and the bathrooms
be clean and respect other people s property maybe
this same picture getting posted over and over is mildly infuriating
don t you read the agreement that you signed before you even set foot in the in the room man some people are so naive
you were anticipating leaving your dishes to pile up for four days of course you need to do the basic tasks of cleaning up after yourself this cleaning fee is likely for carpets and the time it takes to clean between guests not to mention the occasional damage you had to have realized this before or you were expecting someone to show up every night and clean your dishes and wipe your ass
probably for the rest of the turnover cleaning toilets sinks showers changing sheets sweeping vacuuming and mopping all floors wiping down and disinfecting every single surface cleaning and disinfecting the couches cleaning the microwave and fridge of food mess restocking and putting everything back to how it was usually a cleaning service has to be hired for this or they do it all themselves plus i have to change the water in the hot tub clean it clean the grill pay a person to come by and clean the pool once a week to keep the pool and hot tub at temp it is difficult to work all of this into just the base price but much of it is for me when i did it myself this was an hour and a half of work if i did it as quickly as i could most cleaning services will charge at least for this and plus they have to drive out to the location they re not being paid to do your dishes and take out your trash and it s pretty disrespectful to just leave a pile of dirty dishes in the sink i agree it s pretty crazy to overcharge like this for dishes and trash but it s also really frustrating to clean someone else s mess up for them after cleaning their toilet and changing their sheets and everything else
in other words all i see is they re saying stop being a lazy f ing slob they won t clean up after your arsehole mess for free infuriating no it s justifiably reasonable in my opinion
to be fair your dishes and trash isn t a lot to ask they re not asking you to do laundry sweep clean the bathrooms etc
if it s at all helpful i used to do this with my school papers https://www.bloomize.com/how-to-bind-papers-without-staples-or-clips/

raked pavioli basta
been there my friend bigmenu scams us all
my salary on paper vs what i get in hand
somebody is about to be a notary private after this one
i don t blame the notary so much as the dvs it s unreasonable to think they d be this particular about the commission expiration date it s not even an inch away
the infuriating part is the person saying 1pm est which means 00pm
i might be missing the point of what is infuriating you said est but if you sent this message recently most of the eastern time zone is under edt until november i would ask for clarification too so i don t miss the meeting
this isn t such an issue in the eastern time zone but in mountain it could be because of arizona est and edt have specific meanings and diluting this creates confusion
i think they re being shitty about it being dst the kind of person who starts every sentence with actually
godddddddd i work with someone like this i will send them an email and mind you the email is short and to the point just like this and they will reply back every time with a question that is clearly answered in the email that they just replied to morons
she sent the invite for the correct time i asked for
that makes it more infuriating then
maddening
i ve literally replied back with a screenshot of my email with their reply included and highlighted the answer and said nothing else at all they still do it and after all that i don t reply lol
hahaha i love this and do this as well
i mean at this point why not just close
that s a whopper of a list that said yes it s a lot to read and i appreciate you did your best however most people will ignore what looks like paragraphs especially in their car not being critical of your efforts but might i suggest reworking the sign due to a missing delivery we are currently out of the following then make bullet point lists maybe columns so that they fit on one page if it needs two just continue the list on page no need to repeat we are completely out of just add those items to the list a bullet point list is more pleasing to the eye and quicker to scan through to see if their item is on it that doesn t excuse or justify the guy wanting a refund because you re out of ketchup packets that s just absurd
frankly i appreciate the explanation shit happens even burger king can t always have it their way
also not the customers fault for making an assumption that there would be ketchup packets when i buy fast food it s either drive through where it would be impossible to read all this or i m running in there quickly and not paying attention to my surroundings
idk what it is about burger king but i either never leave satisfied or they don t have what i want to order it s a shame too cuz i love that stuff
haha i wish they re too money hungry i swear
bullet list is the way to go sorted by like products as well for a bonus
yes that s why when someone would order something we re out of then we would redirect them to the sign also the reason why it repeats like that is bc my coworker put another sign up after the first one so that part had nothing to do with me
im in north dakota and we just got hit with a storm so the interstate is shut down and our truck is stuck about hours away it sucks
okay but if i m offering you ketchup in a cup and you say no and then demand a refund in a rude ass way when he did in fact read the whole sign bc he commented on it saying he ll just get whopper jrs since we re out of everything what else am i supposed to do give him the food and a refund that s just dumb i m not even authorized to give out refunds bc he paid with card
free delivery but not really teeheee
truly infuriating how many reposts this has
how is this infuriating the eyes are so high that it won t leak unless the coffee is so high it ll start splashing over the edges anyways i actually think this is quite genius as both an idea and a design to make the mug cry if you fill it too much
it s a mug to ruin your day even more
don t be an idiot
unless you re left handed
looks like my fallout camp
interesting design of outdoor toilet sort of a kami khazi
this is giving me anxiety
this is fucking beautiful and i want to live here more than anything
it s just a balcony that wraps around on one side
am i trippin or is that the same place from in yemen bo2

right lol
