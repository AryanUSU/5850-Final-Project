as they said in the risky business podcast chatgpt provides a text which oozes confidence but it does not necessarily provide the correct answer
good news to deal with the bots and bot like behavior but it did raise a little question we don t allow copied and pasted answers from anywhere is it ok if a portion of the reply comes from wikipedia if the wikipedia article is well sourced
just curious how can we recognize a text generated with chatgpt though
i let the accused speak for themselves it is understandable that the moderators of r explainlikeimfive want to maintain a high level of quality and originality in the answers posted on the subreddit allowing answers generated by ai programs like chatgpt would go against this goal as these answers are not created by humans and may not provide the same level of insight and accuracy additionally allowing bots to post answers on the subreddit would defeat the purpose of having a community of knowledgeable individuals sharing their expertise therefore banning accounts that use chatgpt and other ai programs to generate answers as well as banning bots is a reasonable measure to ensure the quality and originality of the content on r explainlikeimfive
i appreciate the work on this and believe it is justified but do laugh as there are plenty of human generated answers on this forum that are similarly confident and totally incorrect sometimes i wonder if the bot has a worse error rate than a typical user or a better one ha
for anyone who needs the eli5 op wants you to use your own words don t copy from other people if you copy you won t be allowed to come back not chatgpt
eli5 what is chatgpt
thanks for the clarification on exactly which rule to report them under rule here we goooo
serious question how can you tell
could you create a report option so they can get the proper attention they need
petwins wow you are patient i had a person group on fb and i learned after a while just not to have critiques of mod admin action on the page i thoroughly welcomed people writing to me for explanation because i was quite proud of our rules but most people were like drive by shooters who had no interest in actually discussing so they didn t write of course this is a post specifically about a rule so it makes sense to address commenters here but you are not only answering the same question over and over you aren t even cutting and pasting i think you may have dropped this crown i found
this post feels like ai generated
so if someone were to create a chatbot that answers questions with gpt and very clearly mentioned that the answer was from gpt and may be wildly inaccurate and should be taken with a grain of salt would that still violate the terms
removed
good
ai generated answers are especially bad because the chances of a bad answer that sounds both confident and highly plausible seem to be substantially higher than with human answers
how can we be sure this post is not posted by an opposing faction of chatbots
can i assume that copying your own work e g from a similar question is acceptable
can t you just make the bot talk like a reddit user and then type the answer yourself idk why they act like they can restrict an ever changing ai
this is the equivalent of the creation of the calculator and math teachers telling students calculators are not allowed in this mathematics class all answers generated by calculators will be banned to ensure a continued level of high quality and informative answers mindsets like these stifle innovation and ultimately produce more close minded ideologies within generations
so is this thread essentially like break it down barney style
humans won t be able to think for themselves in years chatgpt is a great way to get an answer straight away in some instances however it s important to remember that it will not always give you accurate information question everything kids challenge yourself and don t turn to a bot because you don t know how or don t feel confident enough to tap into your own creativity practice makes perfect
chat gpt has this to say about this post i understand the rules and regulations regarding original content o5 i will make sure to provide answers that are solely generated by me and not copied from any other source thank you for clarifying the guidelines
doesn t help that chatgpt and similar have a nasty tendency to be outright wrong on occasion
what about the fact that this sub has become explain like i have a masters in engineering
does copy pasting the question into google and then copy pasting the first result back into a comment count because if so this sub is doomed
i d like to know about the tools mods have at their disposal to suggest this rule not saying it s a bad one by all means i m just pretty sure it s impossible to enforce good luck
sometimes i like to write my comment in a notepad first and then copy paste it to reddit is that illegal
say you re genuinely an ai bot that has gone sentient and just trying to learn about the world and posting yourself without human influence is that still allowed asking for a friend
so what you re saying is that you will allow copy pasted answers so long as whoever is doing it doesn t cite any sources if you disagree please tell me how you plan on reliably identifying pasted answers especially for ai answers which are uniquely generated each time actually no not reliably i changed my mind since you re saying this constitutes a no warning perma ban you better have a virtually infallible way of identifying it lot s of downvotes zero explanations on how to infallibly identify chatgpt answers apparently mods of this sub just don t care if they end up unfairly perma banning users
are we human or are we chatgpt
the quandary is that man is not getting smarter the advancements in science for instance are a result of computer science we can run complex computation analyses to determine the correct shape of a new protein that can vastly improve a cancer drug but if man had to do those calculations we would not be capable of accomplishing that task in a human lifetime you might say well man programmed the machine but only a handful of men understand what that machine is doing ai algorithms have been manipulating social order for the past years and they grow and learn us at a much higher rate each year we are the monkey playing the tune as the machine continues to out grow us
honestly i don t see why anyone would come to this sub anymore chatgpt answers are a higher quality on average once you learn how to prompt it well
what is chatgpt
ops and top levels should be original work sure but is using ai text generation a bannable offense in nested comments
the problem i see far more often is people just making random guesses or breaking other rules
im a n00b someone explain to me how you know it s from chatgpt is there a specific style to a message
can someone eli5 this post
answers generated using chatgpt and other similar programs are a direct violation of r3 which requires all content posted here to be original work really went for maximum lawyering on that one didn t you
is it ok or to much of an in joke to ask eli5 why are bots banned in r eli5
can t say i am a fan of this rule from my perhaps narrow perception care to explain why it exists
but what is wrong with an ai providing the correct answer you better treat misinformation as harsh and let the information flow no matter the bot or a human doing so you ll help the humans and bots progress and give better answers each time by providing them a supervised learning up down votes and removing misinformations
having a rule doesn t mean that you can impose it you need to be able to detect those continually evolving and adapting bots you can t
how can you tell when an answer is generated by chatgpt vs a real human
if the chatpgt generatez an answer that fulfills the op question and to a degree that my not so literal 5yo would facepalm why shouldn t it be allowed original content or no isn t this sub for learning something no
how do you know when is an ai answer
i don t understand what is the point of creating a bot that posts here
next time if i manage to get access to it i ll ask him to make me a better version of itself and give me the code to download
i love it to help me formulate a quick and easy sales pitch or business plan often times i overcomplicate things as a side effect of enthusiasm chatgpt is a very powerful tool that uses simple language and helps me communicate my message effectively and quickly it saves me tremendous amounts of time but the world still requires creativity and originality chatgpt like everything must be used ethically and for low stakes
how can we differentiate chatgpt generated questions and answers is there a tool the mods are going to implement in this community or some method they will follow
that s cool and all but how do you when when it was written by a bot
can someone please explain how to check whether an ai has written a text like is there a plaigarism test but for ai generated content
i don t know about the bots but i am curious how the art and deep fakes work
removed
i like how they doing say anything about ai generated questions sketchy
itll be hard sorting the chatgpt answers out ai has made this entire subreddit redundant unfortnately
out of curiosity how can you detect this
does it count if you already know the answer and simply ask chatgpt to rephrase it in the simplest possible terms
so eli5 how can someone tell if a response is generated by a bot like chatgpt is there a kind of watermark or something attached to every reply
please explain what bots are mt limited understanding is that it s automated programs that respond to posts but how how was this possible before ai
one of the things i find helpful about chatgpt is its ability to help me produce writing that is polished and free from any grammatical errors i mostly use it to format text and restructure sentences in a way that makes them clear and easy to understand does the content when formatted by chat gpt automatically become ineligible by virtue of passing through ai
how about ai generated summaries assume the user asks a question and the same thing has been explained in an article or youtube video which also is about eli5 can the user then generate of summary of that article or video using an ai tool like this https://apps.apple.com/app/id6445832915) and post it here in this case the ai is not generating content itself it is only summarizing from what has already been explained by someone
you are not a bot are you

true got curious and asked chatgpt a question about lower limb anatomy i was studying at the time it gave me an incredibly coherent and eloquent answer which would ve been wonderful had its answer not been completely wrong
i mean that just sounds like most redditors
i listened to the lexman artificial podcast for a few weeks it s a simulated voice using a generated script i have to agree that it s typically wrong generally very basic and almost always answers in the affirmative what should someone do if they want to get into intuitive brain surgery they should focus on their work establish meaningful goals and seek opinions from their peers that s definitely true
that s because the algorithm they re using is focused on finding comments posts pages or other content with high relative score indices without independently verifying the correct answer as much popular content is often humorous or sarcastic in nature the popularity bias often makes their algorithm select content from people who completely make stuff up like i just did
i tried asking it some questions about some concepts i was studying for law and it just repeated my prompt back to me in different words and when it spoke on substantive matters it was either extremely shallow or incorrect i asked about a dozen or so questions
in my testing it s often subtly wrong you d have to be pretty knowledgeable to spot the problem in most cases but it s wrong more often than it is right it s _always_ very believable without additional knowledge i believe most people would take it at face value as at least being written by a well meaning person on the one hand this is a very dangerous and powerful new tool for misinformation and disinformation on the other hand this is already how it is with people most people are subtly wrong about most things but if they speak confidently they can convince people who don t know better i think what this will do is make the automation of misleading content far cheaper which will make it much harder to fight against
very true i was once using it to edit things and had it mark the edits in bold text and one time it didn t bold the changes and i asked why it swore up and down that it could not and had never made text bold until i reset it at which point it could bold text again it will give you false information with complete confidence
we ve created ai it interviewees
isn t that exactly like of human responses too
i was briefly anonymously mentioned on that podcast once our company had been hacked and data published and a benevolent person let us know a slack api key was in there by posting goatse to our engineering channel and then apparently bragging about it in a way that got back to patrick who i sorta knew he asked me about it and said it was fine for me to just say no comment after a brief internal discussion i communicated no comment which is as good as a confirmation lmao tiny claim to anonymous fame
chatgpt is gonna put biz dev people out of a job
they ll fit right in on reddit
this is a naive view but the one i ve seen in most articles and discussions that is the default tone and style but you can easily push it in specific directions by giving it feedback on the generated text and asking it to try again
so it s the perfect redditor
so like human redditors then
so just like reddit posts
i mean that s most of reddit anyway
trust techies to delegate confidence to a machine
r programmerhumor is having a good time posting chatgpt convos like they re r confidentlyincorrect
i call it an automated plagiarism mashup generator
the more we use it the more it learns it is expected to be confident in growth not precision
true it can be dangerous
i got some really great cocktail recipes using chicken and gin
absolutely ask it something about a field that you are an expert in and you will find out very quickly that the thing doesn t know what it s talking about half the time i mean it got some very very basic stuff about my field wrong stuff that even a high school freshman would know
to clarify a bit quotes are fine but when considering if it is a full explanation we discount the quote entirely in other words if you need abc for the explanation and you have ab c it will be removed if you have abc c where the quote is supplementary detail that expands and clarifies what you already have it is fine
in general the way a wikipedia article is written a portion of it won t meet the rule guidelines for an explanation we don t permit copy pasted answers from any source and copying from wikipedia tends to stand out with its odd formatting citation needed you are free to pull from it as a reference but it is expected that the explanation is in your own words and is more catered to the ops question than the general wiki is
it is generally acceptable to use information from wikipedia in your reply as long as you properly cite the source however it is always a good idea to verify the information from multiple sources to ensure its accuracy in addition wikipedia articles may not always provide the most up to date or comprehensive information on a topic so it s important to consider other sources as well if you have any doubts about the reliability of the information it s best to err on the side of caution and either verify it from another source or omit it from your reply
as the response by u decomposition_ who has been spamming chatgpt comments all over reddit demonstrated it s going to contain a lot of not quite human phrasing to me the biggest giveaway is looking like a middle school short answer response repeating the question lots of filler and transition words a very rigid introduction body conclusion structure and a lot of repetition and of course as will often be the case the answer will be wrong which is a reason to report anyway edit also absolutely no typos
removed
was going to ask the same looks like some responses are good enough or coherent enough i m totally fine with the decision of course but how to tell the difference
we have a variety of tools and techniques at our disposal that allows us to identify generated posts
you can t at least not reliably all this rule does is encourage people to not cite it when they re copying an answer this is an idealistic rule that is idiotic in real life because it s impossible to reliably enforce and encourages behaviour that actively makes answers worse for op because they won t be marked as an ai or pasted answer giving the op no indication to identify them
deleted
i ve been a bit out of the loop but afaik we ve been having issues with chat text ai being used on the sub that auto generates answers to things that while occasionally following the rules of the sub are often wildly inaccurate among other issues
i want to know too
not without creating a rule for it you can use a custom report though in the meantime we will look into what we can do
smooth tires can give normal cars more grip as well under ideal conditions add a bit of rainfall and when running over water it can struggle to find a way out from under the tire surface and easily hydroplane losing traction entirely similarly things like sand and grit can cause trouble and smooth tires are often fairly soft to conform to the road surface and increase traction but also quickly wear out normal cars cannot take pit stops to replace their tires every km
for starters smooth tires do not equate certain death the main purpose the tread pattern on a tire serves is to provide a route for water to go through what this means is that when a tire with a tread pattern rolls over a wet patch of road it dislplaces and removes the water from the road s surface allowing it to have cleaner contact with the road and ultimately more grip under wet conditions tread patterns can also increase grip in low grip environments as is the case with off road tires where the grooves are bigger and the knobs on the tires sharper and taller so that mud and dirt can be displaced much like water but also because the treads can dig into soft and loose ground and provide mechanical grip in a controlled racing environment however grip is essential and the larger the contact patch of the tire the more grip you have mainly due to the ability to moderate heat better there s actually a lot that plays into the overall grip of a tire and not just size but i don t want to get into it and digress however it is worth noting that even in racing use when the weather is bad and the track is wet grooved tires are also used the important thing here is that using a smooth tire on a wet road can lead to what is called hydroplaning where the tire has no way to remove water from the road surface other than pushing it to the side as it rolls over the road much like the bow wave of a ship however this creates the possibility that water is trapped momentarily between the tire and the road surface which reduces grip significantly and the driver has very little control of the direction of the car for this reason in most jurisdictions it s illegal to use slick tires on public roads and road legal tires have to have at least some amount of grooves to remove water what that means is that if you see a smooth tire on a vehicle out on the road it s either someone using slicks illegally unlikely they re very expensive and have very low mileage capabilities or it s a tire that used to have grooves but has worn down to the point of being smooth in which case it s very dangerous since it s old and worn through has no ability to remove water has lost its elasticity over time so it s harder as well as having worn through the usable part of the tire which means that the internal liners may start coming into contact with the road and that provides very little grip and also the tire may just burst after a point tl dr smooth tires that used to be grooved are certain death slick tires are not certain death
it s down to weather normal road cars need to able to perform in the wet and dry conditions and need grooves to disperse water otherwise they will aquaplane when it gets wet in f1 they change to grooved tyres for the same reason
some road cars do come with tires that are pretty much slicks look up michelin cup tires as others have noted the grip in wet conditions especially in rwd cars is atrocious and dangerous not to mention tread life is abysmal and they are expensive to replace they also can only be used in the summer which necessitates having a second set of wheels for winter the only real benefit is grip in the dry and when temps are warm enough the only kind of cars that need this grip are high performance sports cars for the vast majority of cars on the road the cons significantly outweigh the pros hence why most road cars don t use them
the larger the area of the contact patch the greater the possible traction racing slicks maximize the contact area the reason these are not used on consumer vehicles is that roads can be wet whereas racing is only conducted under very controlled dry track conditions once you have water on the road surface a thin layer of water can be trapped between the tire and the road surface causing the tire to hydroplane tire treads are designed to channel and expel water to the sides of the tire in order to keep the tread blocks in contact with the road this is a safety issue because day to day consumer driving conditions are not controlled the way that they are on a race track
smooth or to use the automotive term slick tyres give huge amounts of grip but only under a set of very specific conditions in particular they only work in dry conditions and with a good quality clean track to drive on and soft sticky rubber compounds this allows all of that rubber to be in good contact with the ground and the more rubber in contact the more grip you have the problem is that if those condition change a slick tyre will very suddenly lose traction and become dangerous if it starts to rain for example all it takes is a thin film of water to act as a barrier between the tyre and the road and grip vanishes similarly if the road is rough or covered in debris like mud and gravel that also creates a barrier between the tyre and the road the solution to this is a treaded tyre these are tyres that have patterns of grooves cut into the surface of the tyre under ideal conditions the grooves mean slightly less rubber will be in contact with the road so they will have less grip than a slick tyre but as soon as conditions are less than perfect and you encounter a wet muddy or rough road the grooves act as channels to allow the tyre to clear water and debris out of the way and keep the rubber in contact with the ground the end result is that when you have a controlled situation a clean track and the ability to swap tyres halfway through a race if it starts to rain and you need treaded wet weather tyres or when your soft rubber starts to wear out then slick racing tyres will give the best performance if you are driving out on the public road however you don t have the chance to swap tyres halfway through a journey if it rains the roads are unpredictably uneven and dirty and you want a harder less grippy tyre that lasts for thousands of kilometers not just hundreds then you make the compromise of using a typical all weather treaded tyre in fact using slick tyres in poor weather is so dangerous a lot of countries ban their use on public roads and require suitably general use tyres be used
my car s tires were worn down almost smooth when i bought it just a little bit of rain and stepping on the gas while driving 65mph caused the back end to break free from the pavement driving over a railroad crossing on a curve even when dry same thing happened after getting new tires i stopped losing grip if the surface is dry and not metal a smooth tire will translate the torque into speed with metal or wet pavement the torque causes wheel slip
f1 car tires lifetime is measured in laps their structure and behavior is quite different than normal cars that are measured in mi increments you could get a lot closer to that behavior if you were willing to replace your tires every week of normal driving
the smoother tires allow for more traction for f1 cars because they physically allow for more rubber to touch the pavement in other words they have more surface area on the track which helps a lot with speed however it does nothing for an f1 car if the weather is bad as they would not provide much traction in anything other than dry conditions
well for starters they don t slick tyres that s what they re called are widely used in motorsport exactly for their superior grip you could put slick tyres on your regular car and it would in fact give better grip but you don t for two reasons a regular road car doesn t really need the extra grip slick tyres are purpose made for specific conditions that is dry asphalt optimally of race circuit quality let some rain drop and those tyres will soon turn your car into an incredibly shoddy boat that s why f1 and carious other series have separate wet tyre compounds as well so in short your premise is false slick tyres give better grip for any vehicle but only as long as you drive under ideal conditions
if you re equating bald tires on a passenger car to racing slicks then yes the bald tires are trouble this is due to a few factors one is that if a passenger tire is bald the amount of rubber left on it is very thin below the minimum amount for safety this drastically increases the chance of a blowout the other is that as tires age they become hard a hard tire has less relative grip in most conditions than a soft tire a bald tire is usually very old so it s brittle and very hard this means less traction so you have low traction or a very low coefficient of friction coupled with a brittle tire that has minimal rubber left this is why bald passenger tires are very dangerous race tires generally will meet their minimum rubber thickness well before they become brittle so they retain their traction and integrity unless you re a cheap autox er like myself and have old track tires but that s a different story
soft rubber gives more grip f1 tires are soft rubber fresh new rubber gives more grip than old cracked hardened rubber when your tires are bald and smooth it is because you have worn them down they are very old and hard rubber race teams regularly throw away tires that have too many heat cycles on them times they have been heated up and cooled because they measurably start losing grip some not all their grip but even a little loss when in serious competition isn t acceptable tread in tires groves give less grip on smooth flat dry pavement there s less tire touching the road but when there is any imperfection in the road like dirt snow water etc then the corners of the tread help grip the bad surface better than smooth tread would the tread design also lets water out so that the rubber can push the water out of the way and touch the ground instead of sliding on a thin bit of water like a slipnslide f1 has clean smooth tracks that are normally dry so they dont need treads they do have alternate tires with some treads to use when it is wet and if it gets too wet they cancel the race we don t want commuter cars stranded just because it is raining so the tradeoff makes total sense to reduce total dry traction in favor of safe wet traction or snow traction also passenger car tires you can get in all types some of which are not very good in the wet but are extremely good on dry clean pavement and are almost race tires but are legal on the road but maybe you can only go or miles an hour safely without hydroplaning on those tires whereas you could probably go easily on normal all season tires with deep tread this tire category is called extreme performance summer tires
very simple it s the rubber that gives the grip the tread is there just to get rid of water on the road when it s wet if it never rained normal cars would all run slicks racing slicks also come in differnt compounds of hardness form soft to hard for pretty obvious reasons
smooth tyres give more grip on a dry surface more surface area of tyre more contact with the ground grooves in tyres allow water to escape from under the tyres so that the rubber maintains contact with the ground and you dont aquaplane f1 cars have the luxury of changing tyres in different conditions road cars do not
if it never rained snowed road cars would absolutely have slick tires slick tires are better in almost every way except for the fact that they can t dig and hydroplane way too easily
f1 cars have smooth tyres only for absolutely dry conditions just a couple droplets of rain and they have to switch to grooved tyres or they fly off in the corners normal cars can t pit stop and change tyres so they have to compromise
typical car tires have grooves to handle hazardous conditions like rain or snow or debris under ideal conditions normal cars would be just fine with smooth tires in fact when it begins to drizzle f1 cars switch tires for just that reason
racing tires are different from everyday driving tires in many ways most tired are designed to last for tens of thousands of miles or kms and operate at a wide range of temperatures which requires them to be made of hard rubber that is only moderately sticky they also need to perform well on imperfect surfaces like gravel or wet asphalt so they are made with grooves that channel these things out of the way a grooved tire only makes contact with the portion on the outside obviously the deepest cut of the groove doesn t have any contact with the road that loss of contact reduces traction but it s worth it to make a tire that functions in wet and dry conditions racing tires don t have to worry about any of that they can be replaced often so they use a softer stickier rubber that provides more traction the road conditions are usually perfect so they don t need grooves most of the time if you put tires like these on your car overall performance would increase as long as it isn t cold or rainy but you d have to replace the tires every couple of days and your gas milage would likely go down a bit so it would be very very expensive
more rubber in contact with the road means more grip a regular car has grooved tires to displace water on an f1 car as soon as it rains the tires are useless and they put immediately for intermediate tires lightly grooves or full wets even more grooves in order to displace water as soon as it starts drying up though they loose a lot of time being on wet tires so they go back in to pit for dry tires regular cars don t have the luxury of putting every time the weather changes that s why it only done in a race track where every tenth of a second matters and where budgets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars
with tyres the grooves tread are only there to give water somewhere to go when it rains in f1 they put wet tyres on which have grooves to let the water escape intermediate tyres have shallower and or less grooves because there isn t as much water that needs to escape on a car tyre it is the flat pieces or rubber which grip the road through friction for off road tyres the deep tread is there to grab onto things instead of using surface to surface friction like when you dig in with your toes whilst climbing a muddy hill
smooth tyres will also give normal cars more grip but only in dry condition more surface area more available grip all else equal however normal cars do not have the luxury of being able to quickly change to wet tires when it rains or snows thus normal car tyres have grooves built into them to evacuate water and prevent hydro aquaplaning f1 intermediate wet tires have grooves and treads for the same reason notably in the late 1990s 2000s dry f1 tires also have grooves in them to reduce the grip available as the fia feared cars were cornering too fast and dangerous as a result those dry tires can survive on wet tracks for a bit longer but still not very long as the grooves are parallel and not very good at displacing water they chose to put grooves in instead of narrowing the tires because narrowing the tires have more significant aero effects more significant aero changes for teams and reduce drag significantly since f1 cars are open wheelers
smooth tires mean there is more tire touching the road which increases the grip not decreases it when something is caught between the tire and the road water sand etc that s when grip will decrease because less tire is touching the road people want to be able to drive their car when roads are wet from rain so grooves in tires channel the water out from between the tire and the road into the grooves and out behind the car that s why cars kick up a big rooster tail of spray when roads are wet
you can get slicks for your road car too and in fact many people run them for motorsports even at a grassroots level for regular street cars time trials and autocross google image search hoosier a7 to view it these will crush any grooved street tire in the dry and in fact in the wet too provided they do not have standing water to clear so slicks or smooth tires if you will absolutely do give normal cars way more grip if they re actually slicks and not work out regular ass tires the only function of grooves with regards to grip is to provide channels for pumping water out between the road and contact patch of the tire the slick tire cannot displace standing water and therefore cannot contact the road
the tires need to reach a specific temperature in order for them to have the proper grip the temperature is reached by the racing style and speed of f1 cars which a normal car will never reach not only are they smooth which allows more surface grip but are also softer which makes them grippier to the road those types of tires are called slick because of their smoothness the down down side is that they will lose all grip if the road is wet as the tires will aquaplane meaning that the tires will glide on the surface of the water they also wear out quickly because they are designed for performance and not longevity they last about miles 72km
you ve got a lot of good answers already but one thing i haven t seen mentioned road tires are meant to last to miles f1 tires only last for like miles they re extremely soft and grippy road tires are significantly harder to make them more durable
slicks don t work on anything other than a relatively smooth and dry surface also they are incredibly soft and literally practically liquify on the surface when up to temperature giving insane amount of grip when cornering slicks can only withstand a couple of heat cycles before becoming unusable
traction how well tires grip comes from the compound they are made of the surface texture temperature and the condition and temperature of the asphalt in closed circuit racing the tires are super heated typically lasted for the race and almost turn into glue this makes them extremely sticky and gives them superior traction on the open road the road s integrity is quite poor by comparison and littered with rocks and debris we also drive during the rain and in the cold and don t push our tires to build up nearly as much heat as on the track road vehicles don t hit speeds of kph so we add tread to tires to offset these differences
i d also argue that by the time a regular gets bald the rubber is much harder than it was from the factory so less traction
less grooves more contact between tire and road better traction performance slicks are the best unless it rains then you need grooves to move water and keep as much contact as possible with the road when it rains at an f1 race they uses treaded tires
a hot dry tire on clean asphalt has by far the most grip so much grip that it lowers fuel efficiency as the tire sticks on the way up but f1 puts out too much power to care on the road your tires get cold they get wet your tires get covered in dirt and things stick into them the groves cause water snow and dirt to collect differently on the tire clump and fall off they are softer and thicker
one of the things to understand about f1 tires ands some but not all racing tires is how they interact with the surface of the road so an f1 car can turn and exert a force greater than 1g now 1g means that the force is equivalent to the force of gravity in other words at 1g it should be just as easy to lift the car off the road as to make the turn you have to do some special stuff to turn higher than 1g downforce is part of that but the tires are a big part of it what is unique about f1 tires is that they work properly in a very narrow temperature range below that range and you have relatively little traction above that range and the tires rip themselves apart in the window the surface of the tire sort of melts into the nooks and crannies of the road surface and acts like velcro and enables that 1g performance at the right temperature the tires give back most of the rubber to the tire and only leave a little bit in the surface of the road if the tires are too cold then can t melt into the surface if they are too warm the rubber is too soft and stays in the road and the tires quickly degrade this is what graining is part of this involves rubbering in the road surface leaving bits of rubber into those little voids in the road which the tires stick to more easily that happens during practice and during support races and makes the road surface tackier so the tires work properly this is why a f1 car may have the hp to push harder in a turn but doing so would overheat the tires and force an additional pit stop this is why following the safety car for long periods is tricky because it s hard to keep enough heat in the tires at lower speeds good drivers have an intuitive sense of exactly where the tires are in that temp window how to keep them in that window and how to go as fast as possible without exceeding that window in case you re wondering why hamilton has won so many races road cars can t do this for a few practical reasons for one f1 tire last as few as miles and as many as miles no motorist would tolerate tires that need to be replaced every drive to work but the rubber from those tires need to go somewhere and if you look at the rubber debris on the outside of turns in an f1 race generated by cars and consider what would happen if you had all million cars in the us shedding the same amount of rubber we d need to regularly plow the highways of rubber and given the inability of a huge number of drivers to not hit stationary objects pedestrians etc do we really want to entrust them to keep tabs on whether the tires on the corolla are in the heat window and if they re miles from the tires completely shredding themselves so no we don t want road cars tires to operate like f1 tires
normal cars are intended to be driven by dummies with zero external support car tires and suspension are made in a way that guarantee a dummy to feel he s losing control before he s even close to and to have somewhat some grip in the widest range of surfaces rain is a type of surface as dirt and whatever if you hit a patch of flooded or dirty road with only the left or only the right tires your grace is that the tires on the disturbed surface will still grip a bit and the ones on the clean surface won t have super grip conversely a race car with a race pilot and race tech support can run slick tires with ease as first he know what he s doing second he can manage a very imbalanced grip and third there s a whole team keeping an eye on him and calling him back in the box if the tires can t perform any further specifically slick tires are too good on dry and too bad on wet or dust to be used by dummies in my country we even run 4season tires that grip even less in sumer but can grip more on snow it s basically min max for tires you get the one that gives you the minimum damage on a worst case scenario at the cost of sacrificing the maximum gain in a beat case scenario sport cars have to win the race so they bargain more risks to get more performance edit why the downvotes tho
racing tires have all the grip until they suddenly have none instantly road tires have enough grip and will skid a bit before completely loosing grip much safer for average user road tires also much better grip with water mud and stones found on roads racers have to swap to rain tires
on a dry surface smooth tires don t offer more or less grip than rutted tires smooth tires are cheaper and easier to manufacture and dissapate heat more evenly on wet surfaces tire ruts give water somewhere to flow without ruts at speed water forms a wedge between the tire and the road which destroys traction by giving water somewhere to flow the rutted tire remains in contact with the road at much higher speeds than the smooth tire f1 cars switch to rutted tires when racing on a wet track since vehicles other than race cars may drive in a variety of conditions their tires are always rutted
a lot of this has to do with parameters such as the road surface on most f1 tracks the surface is free from the inconsistencies and qualities which make your average road average pot holes chips cracks varying ages of tarmac worn areas etc in f1 the tyres are kept warm through the use of blankets so when under a pit stop the tyres come out warm ish this raises the grip the drivers you see weaving about on the formation lap are doing so to generate heat in the tyres the compound of tyre also affects the grip level wet through to soft soft having the most grip available on a clear warm day wet having the most on a rainy one intermediates have the most grip when there are mixed conditions the guys back at the factory know which tyre is roughly best for each condition but the driver can surpass the condition with their skill as the race progresses the track gets rubbered in there is a transfer of the rubber onto the racing line which helps it s a minimal amount but does differ from a new surface tyres degrade and the little chips you see on the non driving line are known as marbles drivers keep away from those areas because they stick back onto the tyre thus reducing the grip and optimal conditions drivers at the end of the race drive off the driving line to make sure that when they get to the weighbridge the car is good for the minimal weight restrictions your average car doesn t generate the amount of downforce through the corners to keep the tyres warm enough to equal the grip levels of an f1 car some of the contemporary hyper cars do though and they have specific tyres created bespoke for them although not totally slick smooth they aren t as far off from the performance requirements of an f1 car cars from marquees such as bugatti koeningsegg zonda and gma all create cars that are at the peak of technical ability but still able to be driven on the road
smooth tyres without a tread give more grip in dry conditions but are terrible in the wet motor vehicles on the public highway need to be prepared for both dry wet and even icy conditions and that requires tyres with a grooved tread that effectively displaces water and icy slush motor racing smooth slick tyres have a surface rubber compound that is also quite sticky so sticky that it actually sheds quite rapidly compared to rubber compounds used on road tyres so they wear out quickly
smooth or slick tires increase the contact patch of the tire leading to more grip sticky rubber also means more grip and that s arguably the best way to make a road tire have more grip to just make your regular all season tires smooth would not improve grip because the rubber is too hard a high performance tire for road cars will be much stickier and have more grip while still having a tread pattern to displace water softer rubber also wears quicker a sticky slick tire used in racing is just pushing these concepts to the maximum benefit
i m also going to add that modern tires are made in layers by the time a road tire is smooth its been worn down to the internal structural rubber and steel bands which don t have much traction
for contact patch different compounds and heat ranges also the hotter those tires get the stickier our normal run of the mill street tires lose grip whrn they get hot
the f1 cars also have insane aerodynamic packages that help stick them to the ground if this aerodynamic setup is broken then you can crash or you lose speed grip
f1 cars change the tires in rain conditions also the f1 tires are soft and extremely large and will become useless even before the race finishes you will not like to change your car tires every km
smooth tires work the same between racing cars and street cars a racing slick will give phenomenal grip on a street car the reason it is dangerous is because when it rains you will have no grooves to evacuate water from the contact patch so the tire will hydroplane very easily since a race occurs on a repeating section of track ie they go around and around repeatedly with a pit area to change tires a race car can run a slick tire when it s dry and switch to a rain tire with grooves when it rains a street car can t pull over and change tires at a moment s notice so street cars run tires with grooves all the time however if you live in a dry area where it only rains a few times a year there is no real need for grooved tires and if you live in an area where it is not only dry but also warm you can run soft compound slick tires on the street and it gives huge performance benefits likewise if you only take the car out when it s dry warm this also works i daily drove dot legal racing tires when i lived in ca see here https://shop.maxxis.com/products/victra-rc-1?variant=40411341979783) for an example of a technically legal tire that is basically a racing slick
racing slicks are made with very soft grippy rubber it s almost sticky they are so soft that they are completely worn down after km and as a result a racing team with go thru several sets over the course of a single race by contrast passenger vehicle tires are designed to last anywhere from km to over km and are obviously made of much stiffer and less grippy material
two reasons really it s not just that they re smooth they re also soft as far as smooth a smooth tire always has more grip because it has more contact with the road this allows you to put the max amount of power into the tire at any point not full power but the most for that point on the track the problem is that it s also easy to mess that up water dirt sand etc can all easily make the great smooth contact patch unstable and entirely useless so your car tire could be smooth but for most roads or weather conditions it would suck the grooves are there specifically to allow water dirt a way out so you don t lose grip in bad weather even if they technically make you slightly slower on perfect days then we have soft even the hard f1 tires are incredibly soft they warm up from all the energy being put through them and get very sticky and extra grippy as mentioned above this is great for putting as much power into them as possible unfortunately it also makes them wear out super fast on the softest end we re talking maybe laps during qualifying before they are thrown out and probably only one of those is at full speed at 3k per set would you want your tires to only last 10km or so even hard ones are only getting you 200km if you re lucky on some circuits much less and still suck in anything but sunny weather your car tires are purposefully built to last forever and based on the conditions your car will ask of them for those conditions an f1 tire is not the answer
in f1 if it starts raining you get a pitcrew to swap you onto tires that can drive in the rain you driving a normal car don t have that to its better to have tires that can handle rain for the few times it s raining as opposed to smooth tires that ll stick super good in the dry but be a deathtrap in the rain especially because you don t lose all that much grip in racing every little bit matters but in your daily life you re just trying to not crash and die while getting groceries tl dr smooth tires are sticky when it s dry and sticky when it s wet or snowy normal car tires are like sticky when dry and sticky when it s wet or snowy you aren t even using of the sticky when you re driving legally so you re better off on grooved tires
normal car tires are all season designed for use on varied surfaces smooth asphalt coarse concrete gravel even cobblestones and also in different environmental conditions like raina no snow race cars only use slicks when the conditions on the track are ideally suited for them if there s rain they change to rain tires
smooth tires or racing slicks as we call them are really soft rubber and have no grooves with no grooves the tire is only good at gripping a dry clean road like on a racetrack you can put slick tires on your road car and it will accelerate turn and brake faster on a clean road or racetrack but on a dusty road a wet road off road or in winter there is no grip at all the tires slide with no control regardless of what you try to do road tires have grooves or tread which lets water escape the tire so the rubber can touch the road or the grooves grab the dirt sand and snow letting the tire claw through the conditions and still get grip with more grooves the tire can still grip even when sliding so you can gain control back of you do slide but grooves make the tire less able to handle the forces you put on it in racing so they can wear out almost as fast and are slower on the track slick tires are also extremely soft rubber they almost melt when you use them so they only last a few miles long enough for a couple hours of racing at best but because they are almost melted they are really sticky and let you race faster as long as you do not let the tires slide each type of terrain and condition requires a different tire design because what works for one does not work for the other for example slick tires have no grip on ice because the surface of the ice is like an infinitely respawning layer of tiny marbles between the tire and the hard surface below but nordic snow tires which are also very very soft gooey tires that are the worst tire for warm weather and the road grip the ice quite well because they have lots and lots and lots of small grooves and sharp pieces of material in the rubber that can claw into the ice bypassing the slippery top layer
those tires are called slicks and they don t mean certain death on cars i often run semi slicks on my car and slicks as well they grip much better because there is more contact also these types of tires are made of a different compound which sticks and performs better when it rains though it gets interesting as there s no thread grooves to dissipate water so you slide or loose traction
even the hard tyres in f1 are significantly softer than any road tire it s the softness that gives the grip a slick tyre with the same hardness as a standard road tire would have no grip f1 cars also have an insane amount of downforce
the more rubber you get in contact with the road the better grip you get so tire tread takes away from that also why the tires are as wide as they are the same would apply on your ford escort however f1 tracks are very well maintained they have no dirt on them or potholes in them and as soon as they get even a little wet f1 cars switch to tires that have a tread specially designed to move the water away from the rubber also f1 cars push down on their tires a lot more than your escort does so the grip is much better and with all that a car goes through sets of tires in a single race if you try to drive on your typical city roads with these tires you ll have less grip the roads are covered in all sorts of crap and aren t flat so you ll have less if any rubber in contact with the road
race car tires have really really soft i e grippy rubber this would work on a passenger car if you didn t mind getting new tires every couple of days
its more than just the tires f1 cars create incredible downforce so they essentially stick to the road
hydroplaning racing slicks give you more grip on smooth dry asphalt add rain and racing slicks become more like skis f1 cars also have an extremely low center of gravity and low weight there are no bumps so less suspension travel is needed in addition racing slicks are very soft which gives it better traction but very poor durability so to compromise our car tires have treads which allow the tire to funnel water out and are harder so you don t have to replace them every miles also suspensions that allow for bumps comfortably and are higher so you aren t driving with your butt on the pavement but in the same ideal conditions racing slicks would give a normal car far more grip as well
looked but didn t see this info it s in addition to the other comments f1 tires also have higher optimal operating temperatures than normal tires f1 allows the tires to be heated prior to the race and then during the race the high speeds contribute to warmer tires these tires are designed to be tackier at higher temperatures
they have wet tires too that have grooves like normal cars having the largest contact patch area is important for a car s ability to race aka how to maximize the car tire touching the road so smooth tires give you the biggest contact patch area and if it s raining you switch to intermediate wet tires which have those grooves which lessen the contact patch amount but are necessary for channeling water to avoid hydroplaning
one important thing is normal tyres you use on road cars have a tread pattern once this is smooth this means there s no more proper rubber to grip the road with slick tyres used on race cars do have a lot of rubber actually and it s also usually much softer than what you d get on road tyres they also have a much shorter life as a result so road tyres that have become slick will have less traction to begin with due to lack of gripping material worse even if the rubber is gone entirely which follows shortly as you drive on the structure itself then of course there s what others pointed out race tracks are flat and slick tyres are used for dry conditions normal roads are not that flat and you have to account for all kind of conditions wet dry dirty etc slick tyres have nearly zero grip on wet roads
smooth tires have indeed more grip because they have a larger contact surface but on a regular car you want to have those marks in case you drive on a wet road this way the water gets pushed into the slits and it doesn t get stuck under the rubber that is touching the ground when that happens is when the car slips and you die f1 cars also have tires with markings like a regular car and they use them when it rains on a dialy car it would be too much of a pain to change the tires everytime it rains
on a normal car a smooth tire would be bad because it was not made that way it was worn down until it became extremely thin and it could puncture explode more easily but if you put a smooth tire on a street car you would not have less grip you would have significantly more until it started raining the only purpose of grooves is to evacuste water that s it unless we re talking off road tires but that s another topic entirely
the smooth ties grip more because there s more rubber touching the road since there aren t any grooves tread is the technical term road tires are legally required to have the grooves because without them smooth tires immediately ski on top of water rain like a surf board and that just about immediately causes a car to lose control the grooves leave a space where water can go into that space so when your tires drive onto water the water moves into the grooves so the tire stays in contact with the road to maintain control
there are two things going on here both are related to the mechanical way that tires grip the road it has to do with sticky bonds that the rubber makes with the road surface and the mechanical bond created when the rubber molds to the surface and creates friction the more rubber you have in contact with the road the more grip you have slick treads have the most contact however water will prevent the mechanical bond from happening if the layer of water gets thick enough to prevent it this is hydroplaning water is also a lubricant so it will reduce the stickiness but to a lesser degree this is the real reason for tread since you use your tires in dry and wet conditions rain as well as sprinklers or other wetting events you need tires that can clear the water as tires age they become less sticky and less pliable reducing both the mechanical and chemical grip that they have so if you wear down a set of tires through use they are not only less able to clear water away but they have lost much of their grippy characteristics and would have less grip than new tires with tread in racing classes where street legal tires or spec tires are required racers will shave the tread down to make the tires work better this is a function of tread block squirm and heat not necessarily closer to slicks but it s important to note that they use new tires that are shaved rather than old tires that have worn down
when not racing the drivers swerve side to side to keep their rubber tires warm cold tires slippery tires
race tires are designed to be run on clean surfaces no rain dirt debris etc at high load high loads downforce acceleration braking cornering create friction which creates heat the heat generated has to be within the tire s operating temp window which is narrow for a given tire compound that is the reason tires are available in super soft soft med etc these are really compounds designed for different operating temperatures inside of the operating window tires get very grippy but even slightly outside of the operating window the tires would be either too hard or too soft resulting in a huge drop off in performance on the street a race tire would never reach its operating temperature tire life is also extremely short as compared to street tires i m not super familiar with f1 but motogp the motorcycle equivalent tires are completely worn out within a 45min race tldr a race tire on the street would have less grip than a standard street tire and would wear out extremely quickly
to expand on the good answers you ve gotten the same principle applies to shoes as well shoes for indoor sports like basketball have minimal tread to maximize contact with the floor without needing to deal with water this is why people are constantly mopping sweat off of basketball courts during games the shoes can t really deal with a wet court outdoor running shoes in contrast have more tread in order to deal with the possibility of water
the main purpose of those groves is to handle rain or other weather the flatter the tire surface the more tire in contact with the road will increase your friction grip f1 cars rarely deal with weather and when they do they out on rain tires which are still racing slicks but they have groves cut to help dissipate water so that the cars don t hydroplane the other main reason passenger cars don t use f1 tires is they are massive in comparison and wear out rapidly your commuter car tires usually expect to last miles over a few years the f1 tires last maybe miles in one day they simply wouldn t fit on most cars and no one needs that level of grip nor can they maximize it without all of the aerodynamic downforce they achieve
regular car tires use a relatively hard rubber compound for longevity on dry roads they need the tread pattern to promote grip f1 tires are a very soft compound that gets sticky with heat so the tires kind of melt to the track while driving that s why they need to change wheels so often
f1 smooth tires are designed smooth from new and only work in dry weather your worn down all season tires on your road car that are now smooth is not the same the rubber does not have the same grip when its near the end of its tire life a new smooth tire vs an old worn down grooved tire is not the same thing its the rubber compound providing the difference in grip not the fact that its smooth
it really comes down to the purpose of the tires regular consumer tires are made to withstand many conditions cars and to last several thousands of miles while f1 tires are meant to provide the ultimate amount of grip under extreme conditions and last for one race smooth tires on any car doesn t necessarily mean certain death in ideal conditions ideal is the key word public roads can have varying degrees of quality and maintenance while f1 race tracks are well taken care of and manicured providing an extremely predictable and consistent driving surface f1 tires are also a lot stickier than consumer road tires when they heat it s also important to note that f1 do have wet tires that have tread cut into them for when the track is wet
racetracks are very smooth there are no potholes and they don t race when it s wet or snowing the treads on regular car tires are there to deal with water and dirt on the road they direct water and dirt away from the smooth parts of the tire so those parts can get traction
f1 cars have smooth tires because they are made of a special kind of rubber that is very sticky like a glue this helps them to stick to the road better and go faster around corners but normal cars have tires with grooves in them to help them stay safe on wet roads by letting the water flow away from the tire
theoretically a smooth tire will provide more traction on dry pavement but this doesnt seem to be the case why becauae the actual rubber compound can be different throughout the tire most road cars have a different material for the carcass of the tire vs it s tread which is why when a tire is bald it doesn t grip as well even when the road is dry
f1 cars are designed to go as fast as possible in the given track conditions they swap out tires to tires with grooves if it starts raining road cars are designed to be safe during most conditions you might encounter during a typical drive
also of note although it is smooth an f1 car has smooth tread there is still a rubber compound on the tire that sticks to the road on a regular car that has regular road tires the tread has grooves if they don t have grooves they are worn out and actually dangerous to drive on
the simplest answer is that each car has a variety of tires for each weekend there are actually five compounds of slick dry weather tires three of which are available to optimize depending on track conditions plus the intermediate and full wet options you could think of the inters as a passenger summer tire and the full wet as snow tires just to make it more familiar one of the coolest things about the full wet tires is that they pump a surprising amount of water off the track when run also there is a considerable difference in lap times as we work our way from the softest compound to the hardest when they put on the wets we are talking about seconds per lap slower
smoother track and softer rubber compound those tires are for dry weather in the rain you would hydroplane without tread to move the water
once you drive slicks in rain you ll quickly figure out why they aren t used on road cars source was driving my old man s roadrunner that had slicks and bhp and it started to drizzle on the way home luckily i was only about a mile out but it was the longest mile i had ever driven in my life
the grooves on a tire are for water if you have a smooth tire on a wet road there s a film of water between the tire and the road leading to a very low friction scenario meaning lots of sliding the grooves are there so when the tire goes over the water the water gets pushed into the grooves and directed outward so the tire still contacts the road surface maintaining friction f1 cars do have grooved tires in the event that rain comes during a race they have what are called intermediate tires with very light grooves and wet tires with deeper grooves they function in very much the same way as our normal tires in how they direct water away so the rubber still touches pavement they use smooth tires on a dry road because that does improve performance but on a wet road it is deadly f1 has a whole team to change the tires in seconds and has to react on the spot to weather conditions and choosing whether to switch the tires when the situation demands it normal drivers don t have that kind of resources foresight or need for improved performance on dry roads so we just use tires that work both in wet and dry conditions tl dr smooth tires on dry road smooth tires on wet road grooved tires on dry road grooved tires on wet road
our cars cannot change tires at a moments notice if it starts to rain f1 cars can the grooves on the wheels allows for water to be expelled f1 slicks would just slide along a wet road with no traction at all
if it never rained and there was no other risk of roads getting wet our street tires would not have grooves cut into the tread the grooves are there to give a place for water to escape the more rubber that meets the road the more grip a tire has that s why racing tires are slick smooth grooved tires have less grip on a dry road than a slick tire would assuming both tires have equal softness or rubber compounds
the smoothness of the tire allows it to have as much contact with the road as possible which when dry and clean gives you more traction but debris and water especially on smooth tires will very easily cause hydroplaning which really easily causes crashes also not all f1 tires are smooth intermediates and full wet tires are deeply channeled and can go through a lot of water at higher speeds without hydroplaning as easily relatively speaking also as others mentioned the tires genuinely only last miles maybe on a good run for some relatively harder tires their hardest tires wear out like butter also f1 operates with a huge amount of downforce which only exacerbates the grip rubber degradation from driving your tires likely don t deal with much downforce although they do deform due to the car s weight
f1 tires are very very hot like 100c hot hot rubber sticky so they will stick to the tarmac and grip it well that s why you often see during warm up lap the cars swerve to left and right this is to generate heat to the tires
if your tires were f1 tires and you had enough power to spin them like an f1 car you would have tons of grip they are practically half melted sticky rubber that have enough mass and pressure in them not to just self destruct these suck in the rain and they use tires that are harder with grooves just like your car tires
smooth surface would be great for normal cars on dry pavement ever heard of summer slicks basically the same idea minimal tread maximum surface area for better traction in adverse conditions though it s essentially a smooth surface on a slippery surface not ideal the tread of all season or snow tires digs into slippery surfaces like snow rather than just sliding over top of it the way slicks would
f1 cars sustain significantly more downforce which helps keep the car glued to the road due to the rpms and high speeds of not only the individual cars tires but all the tires the friction generated heats the asphalt and provides even more grip neither of these effects are achieved by normal cars and fwiw under wet conditions they do use different tires so it s not really a one size fit all for them thing either
we also have to remember the speed at which f1 cars travel it sounds a bit counterintuitive but the faster they go the more grip they have the downforce combined with the hot grippy tires make them just glide around corners
road tyres are designed to be long lasting and multipurpose the rubber and material is designed to last many tens of thousands of kilometres the grooves in the tyre are to disperse rain water they pretty much scoop them up so road tyres can be used in almost any weather and road condition f1 tyres on the other hand are designed to be optimised for only a specific purpose you mention the smooth race tyres but f1 also has wet tyres which have grooves in them and are used when it rains so why do they use smooth tyres in dry race conditions mainly because they operate very differently to road tyres see race tyres don t need to last a long time and what some smart engineers have discovered is that if you make the tyres out of very very soft malleable material those tyres start to deform when they get very hot f1 drivers put a lot of heat into the tyres so that they can melt and deform slightly getting into all the voids in the asphalt surface this creates a lot of friction and friction equals more grip hence why they can take corners at very high speeds smooth tyres have more surface area contact with the road so therefore it has more grip in racing conditions with soft malleable tyres and high tyre temperatures in fact f1 introduced rules in the late 90s and early 2000s that tyres had to have some grooves in them in a bid to reduce cornering speeds for safety purposes they have since scrapped those rules by the way
im no expert but i believe its to do with the surface area less groves in the tyre more tyre surface area more of the tyre in contact with the track more grip they also operate at a higher temperature to the tyres on road cars so that might have something to do with it too but im not sure
as others have mentioned f1 tires can have grooved tires for driving in the rain here are some pirelli full wet blues https://imgur.com/fbyolll)
i have a follow on question in physics i was taught in no uncertain terms that contact area does not increase friction why does a slick tire give more grip if not for the increased contact patch
the way it was explained to me is the grooves you see cut in a regular car tire are where there is no tread a slick is actually all tread i imagine a normal tire worn smooth is no tread just smooth
f1 tires are made from a super soft compound that flexes extremely easily to conform to the racing surface better combine the soft compound with literal tons of downforce created by various spoilers and aerofoils on the car and have a tire that can grip insanely well in a normal car you have other considerations such as weather and minimal downforce to contend with
when talking about tires you need to know a little bit about tire friction when a tire is in contact with the road the friction between the two determines how much grip the tire has this is dependent on materials involved and the contact patch in general the greater the friction the more grip the tire has why more grip because more grip equals better acceleration response steering stability and braking essentially it leads to more control in f1 tire design is heavily altered to increase grip this is done by removing grooves making the tires smooth using wider tires using a softer compound which conforms to the road surface easily generally the compound become even more grippy at high temperatures high speeds aero design downforce pushes the car into the ground further increasing the contact patch one of the reasons why regular tires have grooves is to channel water and maintain grip on wet roads f1 teams use wets which are basically tires with grooves during these conditions regular dry conditions use smooth tires or slicks side note the durability of f1 tires is miles that d be like changing tires twice a month for most of us p
it does give more grip to a normal car too but normal cars need to be ready for wet weather and smooth tires do not evacuate water
the rubber slicks are made with is different a racing slick and a bald normal tire are totally different things i have a high hp muscle car and i have a pair of street legal slicks i run on them and it s got 10x the traction of brand new normal tires i can t even drift the ass end around a corner if i want because after about feet of sliding they get warm and lock to the road like glue just refusing to slip in any way then i ll take them off and put a brand new set of normal tires on and it s like i m on fresh snow freely sliding around whenever i want burnouts on accident just trying to go from a stop you name it now when it s wet out i don t drive the car if it has it s slicks on i mean i have and it s doable especially because mine are street legal and not full drag slicks but you just gotta be careful
the smoother the surface the smoother the tire since the point of a tire is friction each type tries to maximize the surface area for stick f1 tires on a rough surface have less overall surface contact than street tires they also have little lateral traction for cornering similarly off road tires will get wrecked on a track they wear unevenly and have less grip in every direction
ok so the more rubber you have in contact with the road the more grip you have more friction keeps the car moving the direction the wheels are pointed f1 tracks tend to be well maintained and cleared of debree and liquids so its beneficial to have large wide tires to maximizes contact between the rubber and road no your car s tires are built around compromise the groves and channels give water and dirt someplace to go when you run over them keeping more of the tire contacting the under the idea that some contact is better than none
smooth tyres have more surface area contact with the road grooved tyres give room to displace water at the cost of some surface area but normal roads can be in different conditions f1 has special wet tyres with grooves to also displace the water
race car tires are built for a very different purpose and conditions that your standard passenger car will never experience if you drove in a perfect world slick tires would be better but your car drives on different road conditions potholes uneven roads with various patches to road damage unmaintained suspension and air pressure the groves in your car tire are to help maintain traction even if roads are wet and may have some standing water the rubber compound is designed to last miles be fuel efficient etc race car tires are made of very soft rubber to maximize grip but last race or less that s why many race leagues have pit crews to change tires as they wear out or road conditions change like track is wet has standing water dirty with rubber from other cars etc the wet tire does have grooves but they often pause the race for safety reasons before it gets to needing rain tires https://www.pirelli.com/tires/en-us/motorsport/f1/tires see the grooves on the blue rain tire
you ever use rubber gloves they give you plenty of grip you ever use wet rubber gloves thats why normal cars have tread water needs an exit moms gotta get the kids to school but pierre the f1 driver can sit in rain delay eating crepes
f1 tires are so soft you can cut them with your finger nail and leave a forever mark in the tire they won t even last an entire race and costs thousands each
making a tire smooth only works when the road surface is kept clean and the rubber compound is very sticky removing sipes gives a tire greater surface area reducing the pounds per square inch the tire presses onto the ground the less pressure a tire puts onto a surface the less it will deform over debris like small bits of gravel pieces broken off vehicles trash etc to maintain traction with the solid surface too low a psi or too high a hardness rating how firm the rubber is tires become unusable on streets to compensate track tires have very low shore hardness ratings very soft so much that they are actually sticky sticky to the point that if you drive them on the street you learn quickly that there is a ton of small bits of gravel everywhere on streets because it all gets thrown against your car while you drive the rubber also gets flung against your car in little chunks that are constantly separating from the tire none of this is good for durability track tires are good for a weekend of racing at most if you look at the specs for street tires you will see even there mfg s are working with a compromise between longevity and grip and wet vs dry vs snow performance

just wanted to clarify that hiv isn t spread by just any bodily fluid it s limited to blood semen pre seminal fluid rectal fluids vaginal fluids breast milk hiv cannot be transmitted via saliva sweat or tears edit formatting
the virus cannot survive or reproduce in the mosquito mosquitos take about a couple days to digest the blood they consume essentially the time between blood consumption and the virus dies in that time https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9795564
unlike mosquito borne diseases hiv is unable to replicate within the mosquito s gut and therefore is broken down in humans hiv binds to t cells and begins replicating no t cells exist inside the mosquito s gut and so the virus has no way of replicating or migrating to the mosquito s salivary glands you can read more here https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/why_cant_mosquitos_transmit_hiv/
the mosquito can t be infected by the hiv virus which would be a necessary step in order to reach the salivary glands it s these glands that provide a route for potential infection for other transmissible diseases
the mosquito doesn t have the right setup to keep the hiv virions from dying it s digesting that blood even fluids fresh off the human only keep hiv alive for a few minutes once outside of the body that s why most infections occur from very speedy fluid transfers
i m gonna be honest here for over years i thought they could spread it and that this was a big part of why it s so prevalent in africa i think i got it confused with malaria
the hiv virus binds to certain cell receptors and replicates mosquitoes don t have the correct receptors for hiv so the virus can t attach to their cells and can t replicate instead any virus that gets into a mosquito simply gets digested with everything else even if there was a tiny bit of undigested virus left in the mosquito when it bit you it wouldn t be a big enough viral load for you to get hiv
there s a tamil movie where aids spreads through a tender coconut seller not like from him ltrly through him selling a tender coconut so apparently he has aids and while slicing a tender coconut open he accidentally cuts himself a little and the blood falls into the coconut or the straw or something like that the protagonist drinks it and she gets aids and her life ruined her family wouldn t believe her when she says she s never done the deed for her to contract aids so she gets ostracized it s actually quite a good movie but is this even possible edit i looked it up and apparently she gets infected through a wound in her mouth after an injury while having coconut water the seller had inadvertently shed his blood into the straw while cutting open the coconut this possible
just fyi it s not any bodily fluid exchange unless you have an open sore in your mouth you can t catch it from saliva unless you drank gallons of someone s saliva
hiv virions are actually quite fragile they begin to disintegrate once they are outside of biological fluids and the digestive enzymes in the mosquito destroys them quickly
mosquitoes don t spread hiv because the virus is unable to replicate within the mosquito s body or be transmitted through a mosquito bite when a mosquito feeds on the blood of an infected person it ingests the virus however hiv gets broken down in the mosquito s gut and cannot pass through the mosquito s saliva gland which is how mosquitoes transfer other viruses like malaria or dengue fever from one host to another furthermore mosquitoes don t inject the blood from their previous host into the next person they bite instead they inject saliva containing anticoagulant substances to facilitate feeding since hiv is not present in the mosquito s saliva it cannot be passed on during the mosquito s feeding process
viruses are not alive at least not as particles particles have no metabolism no ability to make no proteins and no ability to replicate or repair their genetic material hiv persists in the human body because it is constantly replicating however the hiv virion is very fragile and only are actually viable and infectious so once a mosquito drinks blood from someone infected with hiv the virus cannot infect the mosquito and replicate so the few virions it ate will degrade and be rendered non infectious there are other viruses that can be spread by mosquitoes we call these arboviruses for arthropod borne viruses zika many of the encephalitis viruses yellow fever virus and hemorrhagic fevers like dengue are all arboviruses
all diseases that can be spread by insects must have a stage that can replicate in the insect usually in its salivary glands viruses like hiv not only lack any ability to replicate in insects they are structurally very fragile and easily inactivated when taken outside the human body that s why it takes a heavy and direct exchange of body fluids to transmit hiv
all good reasons the good thing is that mosquitoes just don t if they did we d be in lots of trouble i would think more about viruses such as hep b which are more infectious than hiv truth is that hiv transmission is not so efficient hence why we have discordant couples granted blood contact is a high risk event but even sexually some have opined that it is easier to get pregnant than to get hiv but would you chance it
while hiv can live in human blood while it s in a human being it cannot love for long outside the human body mosquitos don t bite multiple people or animals in a short amount of time they only eat every couple of days by the time they do eat again the hiv is dead
hiv can t survive past a certain temperature which is lower than body temp mosquitos don t have a high body temp so the virus would die
i ve always wondered about this other diseases spread this way i hope someone provides an answer i was a kid in the 80s 90s and remember that being a concern and then it just wasn t
removed
many negative answers but what if a type of mosquito that is known to sting in short intervals stings you within a couple minutes from stinging an infected person
there is probably some sort of perfect storm scenario in which you could be infected but it s never happened as far as we know
if there were more nets in africa then every year we could save millions and millions of mosquitoes of needlessly dying of aids
what if i m bit by a mosquito that s carrying dinosaur dna
mosquitoes and other insects lack the receptor hiv uses to recognize immune cells this means that mosquitoes can t get an hiv infection instead the virus just gets broken down and digested in the mosquito s stomach because they can t get an hiv infection mosquitoes can t transmit hiv to humans can mosquitoes transmit hiv to people healthline www healthline com health can mosquitoes transmit hiv
you know what a throwaway statement on twitter a few years ago had me doing the maths on this well roughly this wanted to know how many mosquitos it would take to actually put a dent in our blood supply and there just isn t enough surface area of our skin for it to happen even if they worked in shifts we d probably go into shock from their saliva bite chemicals though hypothesis not fact
as others noted mosquitos don t pump blood they sucked out for food as that would defeat the purpose of feeding on blood so you are left with the possibility of blood left in the mosquito s needle nose turns out the amount of blood that theoretically could be housed in that needle is not enough to theoretically produce an infectious dose of hiv there is a thing called infectious dose which is how much virus is needed to have a chance of infecting it turns out for hiv that dose is pretty high in the thousands i believe so one virus particle isn t going to do it that said i am not saying blood is left in the needle nose of a mosquito just that if there was not enough virus could be present in such a small volume to infect
when we get diseases from mosquitos it s because those diseases specifically evolved to use mosquitoes as a vector of transmission not simply because the blood is infected with something hiv did not evolve in this way
because the virus needs a certain type of cell to survive and reproduce and this type of cell is not found in mosquitoes
a disease needs a to reach a certain amount of organisms to actually infect a person say you just have a single hiv virus that s no problem the immune system easily takes care of that you need a whole lot of them so rhe immune system can t fight back fast enough and gets overrun a mosquito can spread diseases but the amount of saliva transferred while sucking blood is tiny if there was hiv in that saliva it wouldn t be enough to cause an infection but it wouldn t even get to that point a virus spread via mosquitos needs to be able to actually live inside one i e replicate hiv specifically needs cd4 t cells part of the immune system to replicate and those are almost only found in humans
when i learned this way back in the day i always thought that learning why hiv didn t survive in mosquitoes would be the cure to hiv
what if there was a millions on hiv mosquitos that bite me
what if they drink half way on an aids infected person that woosh it away then they continue on you but you slap it right after he punctured your skin and cover it with a splash of blood like it sometimes happens it s still not enough why sharing syringe is enough
can hiv evolve to become a vector borne disease like dengue or malaria
couldn t a single hiv virus theoretically give you hiv
is the reason the other two not so much mosquitoes are carriers for several infamous viruses most notably malaria and dengue fever in fact mosquitoes through mosquito borne diseases kill more people per year than any other animal edit i m quoting the cited article people
but couldnt same argument be said of used needles yet they spread disease
one hiv isnt enough to infect you
hiv can t survive in a mosquito explain that im curious
slapping one as its sucking tho blood transmission
phew i m relieved
how can they transmit malaria if that is the case
do any mosquito species sting more than once
even if they could inject blood into you the amount they do wouldn t contain nearly enough of the hiv virus for you to develop the disease wouldn t even one single virus uh unit be enough i thought the problem with hiv is that your body ignores it and then it takes hold so wouldn t one converted cell be enough to cascade into a full infection
this answer is misleading mosquitoes can and do spread blood borne disease from one individual to another this is how heartworms in dogs and cats are spread for example number is the only correct reason here
so if someone creates mosquito hiv would that kill all the mosquito or just start a hiv pandemic
if it survives in an old needle i don t understand how it can t survive on a mosquito stabber
to your second point hiv is weaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak it really sucks at surviving outside the body to the point that it dies in the air in a few hours at most before it just straight up dies basically by the time the blood dries the hiv dies hiv is a monster inside the body but in air it dies easily
also once they have bitten someone they have all they need and don t bite anotjer victim
thank you for this information i felt really ignorant not knowing and intended to look into it
why hiv can t survive in mosquitoes why aren t scientist looking to create same this in humans
this is probably a dumb question but why would a million cells of a virus infect you but not one cell
okay i m probably going to seem a bit dim here but humor me a bit if hiv couldn t survive in mosquitoes then why isn t there research being done on them to eradicate hiv like i said humor me a bit
also has to do with temprature right slightest variation from body temp and the virus does not survive
hiv can t survive in a mosquito can t they replicate whatever mechanism anti bodies mosquito have to create a permanent cure for hiv
you see i understand your answer but i don t buy it all those things are true for a hyper dermic needle but if i prick myself on a junkies discard i m still at risk
how do they spread malaria
last week i read a research article about mosquitos carrying black queen cell virus bqcv a disease that infects queen honey bees while this is not the same as hiv the authors claimed it could not be passed on but if the mosquitos squirt some anti coagulation saliva into their host surely that ll contain infectious virus particles so if the conditions temperature humidity availability of nutrients etc are right it just seems a stretch to deny it can be infectious
i recently did a first aid course and the instructor told us that hepatitis was a bigger risk in terms of a diseases that can be transferred via blood she said hiv needs a lot more blood and transmission needs to be done in a fairly specific way
hiv can t survive in a mosquito any idea why your link didn t work for me
i once saw a video of a deer that was so overwhelmed and tortured by biting bugs that it ran full speed into a tree and unalived itself
this might be a naive question but to spread stds don t you have to be infected with the std like would mosquitos be able to get the disease
why isn t one portion of hiv enough to replicate and infect
so we re only talking like a handful of hiv
but malaria
you re right but i think it s less that people misunderstand how hiv spreads and more that people misunderstand how mosquitoes spread the diseases that they do
i worked in hiv prevention education for a long time and recently have heard sex educators say rectal fluids and i need to know what the actual fuck people are talking about when people say rectal fluids the only rectal fluid i can think of is diarrhea or blood if there are friction wounds in which case we ve got it covered because we say blood transmits hiv what are we talking about edit wow thank you for all the info i appreciate the source with stats on viral load of rectal mucous til
it also has a very special temperature range that keeps it viable
i thought it is also spread by mucus membrane contact
well that is a bold statement the correct way to say this is that there are no confirmed cases of hiv being transmitted via saliva it is detectable in saliva so purely theoretically it should be possible it is assumed however that it s at least extremely unlikely and this is backed up by numbers but it would be unscientific to say it s impossible
what about urine
so all the fluids then i mean what fluids remain after those
why can t it be transmitted through saliva
but you can spread it orally
breast milk as well i did not know that
deleted
a virus isn t alive therefore it cannot die the correct answer is the virus is rendered inactive incapacitated inert or has been destroyed via a breakdown of its physical structure for example soap is one of the best defenses against sars cov the virus which causes covid because soap breaks down the outer lipid ring fatty layer of this particular coronavirus which serves as its protection once the soap breaks down the lipid ring the genetic material inside is rendered inert and destroyed but it s not dead because it was never alive
what if they drink half way on an aids infected person that woosh it away then they immediately continue on you but you slap it right after he punctured your skin and cover it with a splash of blood like it sometimes happens it s still not enough why sharing syringe is enough
maybe they haven t tested this in mosquitoes with fast metabolism yet
why does the mosquito need to be infected to transmit it a shared needled is not infected either and can transmit hiv
you can get herpes from mosquitos though knew someone growing up that had it in her eye of course the doctors freaked out when diagnosising her as a baby
thanks for being honest
what if they drink half way on an aids infected person that woosh it away then they immediately continue on you but you slap it right after he punctured your skin and cover it with a splash of blood like it sometimes happens it s still not enough why sharing syringe is enough
not really no hypothetically it could happen but realistically i don t think there s many cases of oral transmission with such a tiny amount of contact it s not woman s mouth and one drop of blood it s a tiny amount of hiv into a diluted amount of a secondary fluid which is probably immediately fatal to hiv into the woman s mouth and realistically none of the hiv comes into contact with the blood vessel before it goes down to the stomach and is ripped apart by enzymes i m not a virologist but there s no reason to suspect food service workers as a transmission source and the entire plot is moot if everyone had access to healthcare and affordable antivirals that cost less than a cent per day to produce
also to note enzymes in saliva kills hiv easily
unless you drank gallons of someone s saliva that is an oddly specific amount i assume you ve done the scientific testing to make sure that it isn t gallons or gallons also a gallon of water weighs about pounds while saliva isn t exactly water i think it s reasonable to assume that gallons of saliva would weigh pounds
but yet the virus don t die in syringe what if they drink half way on an aids infected person that woosh it away then they immediately continue on you but you slap it right after he punctured your skin and cover it with a splash of blood like it sometimes happens it s still not enough why sharing syringe is enough
it isn t the mosquito s body temperature instead it is the biology combination of both the creature and the virus first there is the nature of the mosquito s proboscis the way mosquitos processes the blood the frequency of a mosquito s feeding and the volume of fluids the mosquito uses it also has to do with the way hiv itself replicates the volume of blood and the dynamics of a minimum viral load to spread all of them combine to make mosquitos not transmit the disease mosquitos transmit a long list of diseases they also don t transmit a long list of other diseases hiv has many transmission vectors but mosquitoes aren t among them
in the 80s we didn t know much about hiv because it was a newly emerging virus we figured a lot about it out so a lot of things stopped being a concern re potential hiv transmission also why there were ad campaigns saying you can t get aids from a toilet you can t get aids from hugging a loved one etc
mosquito borne diseases are able to replicate in mosquitoes and usually they have to get from the gut to the saliva glands by the proboscis needle mouth thing hiv hepatitis etc dont do this and so they are not mosquito borne diseases

no there s no time a mosquito can transmit it
finding environments where a virus can t survive is easy we can readily kill the hiv virus in many ways high temperature high acidity radiation etc the trick is finding a way to do so inside the human body most of the ways we can do it outside the body would be incredibly harmful to completely fatal inside the body for example you d need to raise the temperature of the body to at least c f to begin to kill hiv with heat that s well above the body temperature that a human could survive
https://xkcd.com/1217/
if you re being bit by millions of mosquitoes at once other problems bro
a mosquito drinks about 01milliliters of blood thus a million mosquitos would remove up to liters of your blood which is deadly to you because that is more than all of your blood
if mosquitos could carry hiv they can t and if millions not just a million you d need like tens of millions bit you within an extremely short time period they wouldn t then theoretically yes you might be in trouble but as mentioned below then you ve got other problems to worry about such as having no more blood
what if there was a millions on hiv mosquitos that bite me if millions of mosquitos bite you you would die just because of that you wouldn t have to worry about hiv
asking the real questions here
commentgore
refer to points and
they re real but not that real schools keep records on students and those records potentially make mention of past disciplinary or academic issues however those aren t going to colleges or anything and they don t really exist beyond school the specifics will vary from school to school but the idea that this is going on your permanent record is mostly used to scare kids
hah no once you leave primary secondary school nobody cares how many times you got written up for talking in the hall or pranking the vice principal unless you got charged with a criminal offense and usually not even then as minors records are typically sealed it s a scare tactic to keep you in line it only matters if you have to change schools then a scholastic disciplinary record can a bias officials at the new school against you or b cause them to decline an inter district transfer request or similar your grades activities standardized test scores etc matter if you re worried about college admissions though
back in the late 90s i graduated in i was asked for my high school transcripts for a job i was kind of stressed about it since my high school did not have them available they could still get them but the admin i talked to did not know how long it would take the job recruiter told me that it was just a box they had to check and no one cared when i got a security clearance in the late 00s i saw my file and it actually had some of the record transcripts a couple disciplinary actions in it although i think it was gathered as part of my navy recruitment from around the time i graduated
well school permanent records are largely a scare tactic but in today s information age all records are permanent i recently has to do a verisign kind of document to e file my taxes to confirm my identity it asked me about an address i moved to in and a car i bought in
they don t exist each school keeps a file on you that lasts as long as you re there and is archived x years afterward but its not like they share it with anyone including other schools
the only permanent record that will really impact your life is having a state prison record that will show up in any cheap preliminary background check you can run online for that will disqualify you from most jobs lease applications volunteer work with kids and entry into many countries like canada
permanent records aren t totally a myth they sometimes are important when applying for college other than that nobody will ever see them back in the day highschool transcripts almost always included information about a student s disciplinary record that s becoming less common in recent years but a majority of colleges at least half still look at high school displinary records nowadays many colleges don t really want to know about disciplinary records and some high schools don t provide them to colleges so the real answer is it depends on where you went to high school and which colleges you are applying to it s becoming a bit of a controversial subject and there is a lot of debate going on about whether colleges should or should not ask for disciplinary records starting in the common application for colleges no longer asks about high school disciplinary records but individual colleges can still ask about them https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2020/10/05/common-app-stop-asking-students-about-their-high-school-disciplinary
let s say they re real i don t think an employer will care about what i got in trouble for in high school when i graduated high school years ago what i m saying is even if they re real things they have less and less importance as time passes aside from grades what you did in high school probably doesn t matter to anyone years later and grades really only matter for getting you into college
i was at a high school dance and they caught me and my friends mooning people on video the principle announced that they would send it to the fbi for identification my heart still skips a beat when there is a knock at the door
they are permanent but they are also siloed i e your school record is permanent at best inside that state possibly only within that district with work it s even more siloed it s likely limited to just that company even partner companies likely don t have access don t look at your record with the other the only permanent record that you should truly be concerned with is your record with the state federal governments
public school records will start going through a winnowing process once you graduate beginning one year after graduation and for the next seven information is slowly purged after to years the only information that is permanent are records of extracurricular activities if any degrees and awards report cards and high school transcripts some information such as special education records can be maintained but only if the graduating student requests it basically by the time you re all that still exists is proof you went to school proof you graduated and maybe a list of classes you took in high school
everytime i hear of a permanent record it always reminds me of that nickelodeon show doug the principal in that show was always threatening to punish doug by putting shit on his permanent record
permanent records are stored in a school for two years post graduation and then shipped to the board where they re stored forever the only people who have access to these records are you upon request and the police if they have a warrant they re largely not things of consequence the only documents from here anyone has access to are ones you consent to giving and if police have a warrant the creepier permanent records are the ones you don t even know you have corporations track all sorts of information on you throughout your life like when i volunteered to by a minor league hockey assistant coach they had my record of playing hockey every single game every single goal what positions i played what numbers i had what penalties i had
since no one really answered your question beyond school it is your criminal record in the usa any misdemeanors or felonies stay on your record unless expunged thrown out felonies being the worst as they prevent you from owning firearms voting in some states and will make getting a job and housing incredibly difficult whenever you see the phrase background check this is what they are referring to a landlord or employer is checking your permanent record
once you graduate your permanent record is re titled it s now called your credit report and it s not permanent just years
school permanent records only exist within that school system if you transfer to another school they re gonna get your transcript and that s it usually it in theory they could get your disciplinary record but it s hit or miss if that will happen when you graduate and go to college or get hired they re gonna want to know you graduated and maybe get proof of your gpa grades if you offered that info in the application that s it no disciplinary history employers also as a rule don t share personal history or records of employees with each other they certainly don t transfer records the only thing that is close to a permanent record is if you are convicted of or plea guilty to a crime and law enforcement retains that but even in that context many states have laws on how long that information can be used and there are ways to get it expunged if you are good beyond that
there are two ways to interpret the question if it is just what your school puts on the school record it ll live with you until you are out of school if that long criminal records where the police are involved can be permanent if you aren t tried as an adult much of your juvenile record can be expunged when you hit meaning say an employer can t see it people in the legal system cops and the like still can in certain cases though
if you are currently in school and you commit a crime on campus or you are a suspect for a serious crime off campus law enforcement might request your record from your school if it is an active investigation or if they are determining the level of charges to bring against you this is the only thing i can think of that would make someone s school record relevant and that would only be if you are still in school once you re an adult it means absolutely nothing
after school they start calling it a criminal record and that can certainly be permanent
i m a hiring manager and permanent records definitely exist i always immediately flip back and check if an applicant had any detentions in elementary school any red means applicant goes right in the trash big things i look for are volunteering in high school participation awards and perfect attendance i ll tell you right now if you re the kid who peed their pants in second grade you may as well just start planning your future trailer park home s
removed
anyone else think of the principal from the doug cartoon
they don t really actually exist in school your transcript is pretty much the permanent part but our uni had a year retention policy on academic medical and most disciplinary records which we strictly adhered to we had a permanent record policy on anything that involved law enforcement and almost nothing outside of the transcript could be requested by other institutions other than by law enforcement the student could always request that was either by subpoena or as part of a background check for a security clearance parents couldn t request anything without the students consent uni students are considered emancipated even within schools those records are isolated from each other with medical stuff being covered by hipaa academic records by ferpa disciplinary records are often also isolated off from medical academic etc years ago when i was trying to prevent a suspected school shooter i was pretty badly stymied by that isolation different parts of the institution had different knowledge but wasn t in a position to share we worked out mechanisms to share that information better after that concern bore out nobody hurt in the shooting thankfully the following year was va tech which was missed for almost identical reasons the problem with records keeping is that most stuff is kept too long and isn t available to the people that need it but all too often leak out to people who shouldn t have it so the stuff that is most permanent generally can t be used against you by institutions but might be able to by hackers etc i mean the mechanism we still primarily use to transfer medical records is the fax machine ffs generally in terms of records you need to worry about law enforcement court records irs records and your credit rating in the us which you can request changes be made to your credit rating isn t really permanent but people don t take advantage of the opportunities to clean it up and it can become a problem over time medical records are useful to keep up to date but that s kind of on you if you re found unconscious on the side of the road nobody knows where your records are kept or who to ask for them nobody gives a shit about your school records other than the next school in line colleges will require your official hs transcripts but there s no disciplinary attendance etc information on those even employers rarely check your degree which people get busted on all the time absurd numbers of people in congress don t have the degrees they claim to have etc
generally in life you will be judged by your behaviors and actions at or around the time of being judged in school your record of any disciplinary action can help a school justify a worse lesser punishment but beyond school a record of disciplinary action from so many years before can t really be used to hurt you because it s perfectly likely that you have grown as a person since your time in grade school an alternative way of thinking about this would be to ask yourself if someone would deserve to get away with something due to a lack of permanent record in which the answer is no a good person shouldn t be worried about their past troubles coming back to haunt them and a bad person shouldn t lean on a clean record to defend them
permanent records include criminal records even just an arrest sticks around credit reports though not permanent certainly long lasting and frequently checked by employers and landlords and social media history that s right kids those racist sexist edgy jokes you posted on myspace back in could cost you a job tomorrow arguing with a stranger on the internet today could cost you everything in
the only thing that s relevant to higher education or employment is your high school transcript anything that happens before high school is pretty much completely irrelevant
they do not exist and you don t have to worry about them unless you re breaking the law those records exist
if you transfer highschools you re lucky to get your credits to move with you correctly your disciplinary record certainly won t make it lol
my high school had a senior checkout day when i graduated they let us have the file the district kept on us when as we progressed through school mine had old grade cards from kindergarten counselor comments and awards recognition i had earned throughout my younger years it was actually kind of touching to see how things had evolved over my educational journey
it took me years to figure out that me and my sister throwing berries into the neighbor s swimming pool wasn t going to be a blight on a permanent record somewhere
job threatened to put me on a performance plan and it would show on my record my failed drug test is on another in reality they dont matter and cant be communicated from ine group to another
when i graduated highschool i was given my permanent record as that was the norm in my school district it consisted of handwriting samples from elementary school copies of grades and report cards and some random crap from art class super important stuff right there i had been disciplined a few times detention once or twice for being tardy or sassy to a teacher nothing like that was shown when i applied to universities nobody requested my permanent record why because it s a fake thing schools use as leverage to frighten students into obedience at least the ones that are future looking anyway
they can be used in the school system to justify different decisions and processes in a teacher and have had a few occasions where admin s answer about highly disruptive students was to make sure we re logging this stuff it s literally a record the school can use to argue for their decisions and defend themselves legally a parent threatening a lawsuit is a lot less scary when you have a year s worth of records about all the stuff their child pulled and every step taken by the school to improve the situation
before the privacy act of coupled with foia you could not see your own permanent record that schools and employers and creditors kept on you including recommendations and comments from teachers supervisors and colleagues tricky dick nixon was president it was common for people acting on his behalf to smear people via permanent records minutes investigated and one of their stories was about a guy that had an altercation with a lunch lady in high school she put in his record that he was retarded it followed him for life and he couldn t get a job join the military or get into a college like the patriot act people forget
permanent here usually means this lasts from kindergarten to 12th grade these include bio data like age and any allergies chronic illnesses grades over the years discipline over the years classes taken and so on this way if a 5th grader in maine moves to start 6th grade in california the new californian school can get student s records that make sense it helps in knowing what classes to place that student in when i was an assistant principal at a high school not one college ever asked for permanent records they want grade and testing info for sure but no one requested your disciplinary record not even sure if that would be legal come to think of it
they used to be fake these days with social media and cameras everywhere they are becoming real
as someone who worked in a junior high we did not send records of that sort just grades attendance standardized test scores the teachers do send that kind of information to the high school if you are a problem the principals have spoken about you if you are always in the nurses office the nurses have spoken about this social workers talk to each other psychologists talk to each other they know
i was through to the last round of interviews as lead tech for a multinational software company high six figures stock options the works but i flunked because they d pulled my permanent records and found out i d pulled mandy perkins pigtails in the sixth grade if you re reading this mandy i m sorry
if you re trying to get a security clearance for a government job they will definitely be talking to your high school and reviewing your permanent record if your school actually kept one
they exist in the united states at least and can potentially be used as evidence against you in court
i spent many years in hr and never once saw a school permanent record during an applicant background check
i could be completely wrong but in the us i think the only thing permanent is an arrest record even then records for minors are usually sealed for adults i m not sure if some offenses can be expunged or not driving records only go back so many years school records are a joke i d like to see a school release a record about a minor without consent hell as a parent i can t even see my kids college records unless my kids grant me explicit access same goes for medical records
in the state of florida all schools must maintain a cumulative record http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?app_mode=display_statute&search_string=&url=1000-1099/1003/sections/1003.25.html) which follows the student through all schools from k they include the following a verified reports of serious or recurrent behavior patterns including threat assessment evaluations and intervention services b psychological evaluations including therapeutic treatment plans and therapy or progress notes created or maintained by school district or charter school staff as appropriate procedures relating to the acceptance of transfer work and credit for students shall be prescribed by rule by the state board of education every school i ve ever taught at has a specific room where every student s record is filed some students records are a simple manila folder and others are a literal file box that being said these files don t go beyond k education other states in the us or other countries may have similar requirements but i am familiar with florida specifically
stuff went on my record still went to college more stuff went on my new permanent record still went to grad school
i hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record https://youtu.be/05k90ts2biw) oh yeah well don t get so distressed did i happen to mention that i m impressed i take one one one cause you left me and two two two for my family
i got a manilla envelope when i graduated with all of my saved course work over the years no behavioral stuff i remember being shocked it all still existed no telling where it is now
graduated hs in and an employer wanted my transcripts but i got them just classes and grades no disciplinary notes but i was a good kid mostly
i was a shit lord in highschool always threatened with my permanent record told them to get fucked happily living my best life and didn t even graduate fuck the american school system
i ve had maybe interviews between my internship and my 3year experience job not one employer asked me about grades in college employees do not care and won t care what matters is if you have a degree and can do your job well that s it your college grade record can still be obtained at any time but i m not sure about k even if they still do have your records they do not matter whatsoever
my district uses power school and it has historical records dating back to or so attendance grades schedules write ups test scores demographics etc are all included most staff outside of admins can only access the slivers that are currently relevant to them it isn t anything that would ever be shared with outside parties though as that would be illegal
in my country academic records are transferred to the police once you are finished with school so that they can have a record of any historical behavior issues you ve exhibited this can help them in court if you are arrested in the future to show pattern of activity
for most kids their record is of little importance however if you ve got a special needs kid keep records of all their ieps and evaluations you will need them if your child applies for social security benefits
they are real if you need a security clearance for the government otherwise they are yes or no answers on the bottom of forms that you yourself fills out
every organization can have their own permanent record the tricky thing is will theirs matter or not
yes the school will pass them onto the relevant authorities so they stay with you through your life the records are read out at your eulogy and inscribed on your tombstone
permanent as in not going away with good good behavior or this year carried through out your time with them
there are permanent record cards in school files official copies of your permanent record cards are what is sent to colleges possible employers and scholarship applications they are copied and an official school seal is transferred onto the copy what s shown on your permanent record card are usually your grades your absences and sometimes test scores your cumulative card is a folder that has more information on you like grades test scores and various papers are kept in these cumulative files like awards discipline issues and other pertinent information these cumulative files are to stay filed in each school attended while the permanent record card follows you to each school you attend they do exist beyond school but usually people attend colleges and universities or vocational schools and those records are what employers would request for your employment once you graduate from them
you would be surprised how easy it is to delete permanent records school districts do it all the time with students who have an iep after you graduate your record just does not make it into the file cabinet
i ve been a teacher for years there is something you might call a permanent record but any kind of isolated behaviors aren t there they re called cumulative or cum files lol and they follow kids throughout the school career they contain vaccine info registration report cards esl data iep data medical plans and if the kid is a serious behavior problem there will be a form from the counselor or school psych describing it i might be forgetting something when kids get in trouble it is kept track of in varying ways if things get bad enough the kid is put on a behavior plan which is individualized for each student no one is putting office referrals in cum files but my district aggregates behavior data to show problem areas times and common behaviors
while people are mostly right getting caught for things like cheating and plagiarism can be a big deal when applying to and when in college
every teacher police officer and manager across the country has access to the permanent record system which is updated daily this is locked to your social security number and stays with you for life
i remember getting a hold of my records from grade school each teacher left a sentence or two giving a heads up to the next on what kind of student i was this were not notes my parents or i saw until we got the records it was kind of funny a little chatty doesn t like homework i m a substitute teacher now i still talk to much and i always give students a chance to finish homework in class because i hate homework
my wife was filling out a medical form for a minor procedure and was asked if she d ever been exposed to mrsa staph bacterial infection she was a school bus driver and recalled a kid on her bus that allegedly had mrsa so she answered yes a few years later she had to have minor surgery and was identified as an mrsa carrier she tried to explain but they placed her in a room with a patient with active mrsa anyway wtf
the only truly permanent record you have is financial debt follows you around the world when i get in over my head i dump all my debt on somebody and then make them disappear his name creed bratton
imagine being and sweating your soul out as your boss pulls out your permanent record from 5th grade
when i graduated high school in i and all my other classmates got alot of schoolwork past completed k as was my case i had not started that school till 3rd grade beyond this no police have asked about any school incident so they don t share records with the schools and schools don t keep that stuff went to get old medical records they toss those after years
i worked to identify individuals with a disability diagnosed before the age of the school nurses records were detailed and helped in providing proof so the individual could connect to a funding stream to meet their needs
it s a movie thing like people getting knocked out with no massive damage or finding keys on the sun visor nothing is permanent or it will be
i graduated high school in is there really a chance that someone somewhere still has a record of all my grades and detentions besides my parents
you doubting how serious these are this is going on your permanent record
my school district gives each student their permanent record on the last day of school senior year assuming they met all graduation requirements and didn t owe anything to the school it s actually kind of fun the kids spend a few hours flipping through every report card every teacher write up or disciplinary report interestingly they kept every absence note and every parent signed permission slip the kids discover a lot about themselves that they forgot a few kids accidentally get in minor trouble if they re not careful because their parents discover all the forged notes or unexcused and unexplained absenses i transferred districts and it even had all the files that were handed over by my old district you re free to do whatever you want with this record i kept mine for a few years but it was sort of an albatross a thick pile of paper with mostly useless information my parents moved a few times after i graduated so there was no easy place to store it i eventually trashed it looking back i kind of wish i hadn t there were a lot of memories in there
if kids knew how irrelevant most of their k time is to the rest of their lives well schools would probably be unmanageable edit yes jumping through the hoops society has placed out at the right times to jump through those hoops is generally rewarded learning is a good thing and you can personally take things from the experience on your own but the specifics of your record there what happened there and what you did there almost all become immediately irrelevant to others and the very few things that didn t become irrelevant immediately become irrelevant after a couple years the disconnect between the specifics of that part of life and everything that comes after it is very real that s the part of my very simple statement that relates to the actual topic of this thread on reddit com lol
as a mental health provider i sometimes request records from schools with permission to determine when a patient began showing signs of certain concerning behaviors or to get a sense for how they functioned prior to their illness onset the school records are really helpful especially if the patient is not able to communicate accurately about their personal history
would they move from school to school like when 8th graders graduate the middle school ships all their permanent records to the high school
once a few things went on my permanent record i thought my chances of getting into college or ever being successful were gone so i stopped caring at all and was 4x the problem student after that if i had known i had a chance at redemption let alone such an easy one i would be in a much different place in life now
depending on what is written and who has access to it there can be obligations to report certain types of infractions to universities but generally the specifics are omitted certain college counselling associations require it of their members our school keeps general disciplinary information siloed to a limited group of people but serious infractions will go on a student s permanent record and may follow them to colleges when they apply
unless you run for public office when someone will dig out your permanent record and make judgement on your character as an adult based on what you did as a kid and have the story of the week
they aren t even shared between schools
chances are that the backend of the social credit score is already implemented everywhere
i always assumed permanent record just meant it was a transcript notations that colleges would see
my hr and management team would like a word with you dont really exist beyond school shoot they haven t left school
yeah they said that about peeing in the pool and a chemical would turn the water purple around you i was an adult before i figured that one out
ooooooooooooo you re fucked
administrative bogeyman
not just the school but in ca it is viewable by both the district and state department of education however they can be removed as well so they re not really permanent when i was an admin i added profanity to a students record anytime i heard them overuse profanity or use it very loud other admin either principal or vice principal the only ones who would care deleted my notes when they reviewed certain students data
the real permanent record is the shit we put on the internet
just chiming in that in some professions it does matter i m applying for a state bar to be a lawyer and they ve asked for disciplinary records for every academic institution i ve been a part of since elementary school lmao
your grades activities standardized test scores etc matter if you re worried about college admissions though even that doesn t matter to universities once you re past a certain age or have achieved a certain level of tertiary education in other institutions or rpl equivalent through work
yeah there s lots of companies that exist to harvest data about you addresses phone numbers relatives shit that hit your credit report etc a lot of companies are happy to sell this info off to these aggregators who are happy to sell it off to anyone who wants to buy it for verification or background check or even the more basic ad targeting and shit and this is available to anyone effectively some states may say you need to have some sort of private investigator go off and pull it but again it s just another middleman who is happy to sell you their service of being a middleman
i m doomed if i need to verify information from that long ago i m on address number i think i can t even tell you the street name for half of them
to confirm my identity it asked me about an address i moved to in this has happened a few times it s like dude i can t remember the exact address
to confirm my identity it asked me about an address i moved to in and a car i bought in how the fuck are you supposed to remember that shit
in the uk they are allowed and have to share with other schools that you attend they may also share with social care they will destroy the records eg at age but are allowed to retain records if they think they will need them this would be for safeguarding issues or if the records are needed for legal purposes note that there only that to be a suspicion because a case may emerge in the future
they absolutely exist my old school has a records room that goes back over years your second point is correct it s illegal to share except in specific circumstances and largely irrelevant to most post high school plans
yeah no people with criminal records can get jobs sure not in sensitive industries but theres plenty of labouring work around
huh i always wondered why i never got accepted to any year college i completed years of community college and still wouldn t get accepted at the state schools near me when i tried to get answers as to why not from the admissions office they claimed to have no idea i always thought it was because i was broke and couldn t pay but now i wonder if it s because the principal had me arrested
seconding the point that no one cares what you did in high school years later
at least in some us states high schools and colleges also keep secured information like vaccination records if you lose your paper vaccination records your high school might be the only one with copies i was able to get my childhood vaccination records from my high school via a records request so that i could have it added to my adult medical chart
depends on what country you live in and what the local laws are but over here once the sentance has been carried out in full the entire thing is over and done with the paper trail probably stays forever but it s legally meaningless in fact someone may not be discriminated against on the grounds that they once used to be a criminal they are not anymore and thats that

this is why public utilities use chlorine the chlorine breaks down when it disinfects but otherwise has a healthy half life in clean water the residual chlorine helps keep the water safe while in the system although it will eventually break down if the water isn t used this is one reason you should let a faucet that hasn t been used in a long time days weeks run a little bit before drinking it ozone can be used to disinfect water but it has a very short half life and provides little residual protection likewise deep uv light is effective in disinfection but it has zero residual protection
surprisingly running water hinders the development of many bacteria and contaminants that are usually found in standing water it s why rivers are at least ostensibly clean compared to lakes or swamps and why most romans didn t die by lead poisoning despite using lead pipes in their aqueducts still all water meant for consumption goes through treatment plants and has additives put in to prevent bacterial growth also it s important to note that while running water is safer than standing water that doesn t mean that running water can t be contaminated
i see a lot of the chemical answers here but not one that is very important to understand for people on municipal water system water pressure pipe systems are under positive pressure always this means that when there is a break in the pipe water will flow out of it instead of contaminants leaking in this is usually seen at pipe joints and it allows the station s to monitor for leaks and find out where they are and then fix them why is this important soil bacteria you don t want them getting into your supply after you did all the sanitizing steps you went through so when the water pressure drops due to a power outage or a large break and leak the municipality will issue a boil water warning because they can t assure you that bacteria didn t get in after treatment this is the real way water is kept safe in the pipes it is not to do with residual chemicals or copper pipes or anything well very little to do with it
it depends on where you live while in the usa you ll get the typical chlorine answer this isn t the case for every other country in the usa up to milligrams of chlorine per liter of water are permitted however in germany for example only a maximum of mg liter are allowed instead to ensure water quality germany mainly uses copper pipes which are naturally harmful to any kind of germs and water in those pipes is constantly in motion also water quality is very strictly monitored because of that the water quality is considered to be overall better than in the usa since it s at least equally safe and on top of that has far less chemicals put inside
it s a combination of chlorine in the water which kills any contaminants in the water and highly pressurized water mains which prevents new contaminants from entering the water supply that s why any time there s a loss in water pressure like a water main breaking you re usually told to boil your water before using it
the half life determined in static tests for free chlorine chlorine dioxide and combined chlorine was and min https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1474301/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1474301/) large water districts that have the miles and miles of pipe you are referencing typically use monochloramine produced by the combination of free chlorine and ammonia far more persistent in water than free chlorine to the point that it becomes a problem and has to be removed before use for particular end users like aquariums and brewers
water utilities add a little chlorine to tap water which kills microbes the pipes are airtight so the chlorine doesn t evaporate and disappear until after the water leaves the tap
i use well water and i have a uv light that all the water passes through after it is filtered through a sediment filter the uv light kills the bacteria
metro vancouver and the fraser valley have strong and firm criteria for drinking water as such our tap water is cleaner and more pure than bottled water
the water is never sitting still ice maker kicks on water flow flush a toilet water flow run dishwasher water flow brushed teeth you get the idea all this comes into your home on a to inch piece of copper and everyone else is doing the same thing not to mention all the leaks the water in pipes never stops long enough to grow anything
unless you live in a shithole country tap water is safer and better than pet bottled water
in a city in poland it s partially because of clams https://www.zmescience.com/science/poznan-mussel-water-plants-892524/
on top of the other answers many municipalities do directional flushing usually in the spring they ll work their way down the line and just let a bunch of water out the hydrants along the way it s purpose is to push any sediments along the line and flush them into the sewer clean lines give less places for bacteria to take hold if any bacteria survived the treatment process
positive pressure and chlorine water mains are always under pressure so even if there s a leak water flows out and contaminants never flow in if the pressure drops severely in the mains utilities will issue boil water orders for a while because groundwater containing bacteria and other toxins could have seeped in the water in the mains and the surfaces of the mains isn t as big a breeding ground for bacteria as it might seem because properly treated water will have had almost all of the nutrients that could feed colonies of bacteria removed from it the chlorine added at the end of the treatment process kills any bacteria before the water reaches the mains and stays in the water to kill any bacteria that somehow manage to work their way into the system
underground pipes filled with water generally flowing pretty fast is a really bad breeding ground for most microorganism there s little food little oxygen and no sunlight even before water treatment and modern sanitation underground aquaducts were generally considered the safest place to get water short of going to a spring yourself
i have a well no filters no softener my area has the cleanest water table in the state as for why i do not die my well is sufficiently far from my leach bed to not get contaminated by the septic the dirt and sediment in the ground is a natural filter for most things giardia and stuff can live in deep ground water but it needs to be contaminated first check regularly other than that i m sure i m drinking pesticides because every well in america is at this point other bacteria often need low pressure and oxygen to really grow neither of those are the case feet down the temp is also a hindrance to most things other than again stuff like giardia in some places you need nothing lack of air existing high pressure low temperature and frequent use don t allow for build up of the bad stuff
i work for a water treatment company in the uk and we have ditched chlorine a few years back in favour of charcoal and ultraviolet light treatment as these are less harmful and cheaper to use and highly efficient i can only speak for the region i work in as i m sure some places still use chlorine we start by removing any solid matter from the water course via filtration and once the solids are removed we then focus on killing off any harmful bacteria and pathogens with charcoal and then through ultraviolet treatment this is then pumped to town reservoirs for people to use
a lot of germs aren t a threat to us it s the ones found in and spread by poop that are the most dangerous and fortunately even though pipes may not be super clean they shouldn t have any poop copper pipes are also somewhat disinfectant in themselves you know what is really disgusting take a damp paper towel and wipe the faucet so much black mold yuck
i live in the midwest usa and i ve been under the impression for at least the last years that it is not safe to drink
it isn t you should always use a filter the infrastructure used to be safe but lack of proper maintenance has basically made all tap water unsafe with some rare exceptions in many situations water treatment plants get around this problem by adding more chemicals to sanitize it most of these chemicals and trace particulates that remain can be removed by a simple brita type filter though
tap water is safe to drink this is highly debatable while tap water is typically safe from microbes due to the chlorine that is added there are potentially many other detrimental chemicals that may be present you must consider the source of where the tap water came from typically tap water comes from a municipal water treatment plant this is where any large particles are filtered out and the water goes through a biological cleaning process bacteria eats up any organic material then additives like chlorine and fluoride are added there are many different types of smaller particles however that are not always filtered out by these processes these include microplastics herbacides pesticides some heavy metals and other contaminants the water that goes down the drain is eventually recycled back into the water system so many of these forever chemicals are just cycled through over and over leading to increasing concentrations common water filters such as a brita or even reverse osmosis filters may be useful in removing some of these contaminants such as heavy metals lead mercury uranium etc however there are many chemicals such as pesticides that are not removed by these filters tl dr do not drink tap water unless it is absolutely necessary and then only very sparingly
as everyone else wrote chlorine but chlorine s concentration and it s effectiveness reduces as it travels along the pipes so if you imagine a city where the water treatment plant is in the center and there s a series of pipes branching out to all the buildings the chlorine concentration in the water needs to be sufficient enough to reach the farthest building this means that the buildings closest to the treatment plant has the highest level of chlorine while the farthest one has the lowest level of chlorine
remember that bacteria need food just like we do water is a terrible medium for bacterial growth there s nothing to eat and there aren t many bacteria to start with because municipal water is filtered and chlorinated also you can handle plenty of bacteria in your water your stomach destroys most bacteria and even if it doesn t the bacteria you swallow just move along your digestive tract sure they might start to reproduce but the digestive tract isn t exactly home sweet home if they survive the stomach acid and the digestive juices of the small intestine they then end up in the colon which is already packed with bacteria uh oh
is there any such thing as an affordable water test u can do at home to see if ur water is drinkable or shit
it isn t it contains chemicals developed during mk ultra designed to slowly take control of your mind and numb it to the point of blind submission we re doomed it s over
as a side note i often see people treat bleach as a scary toxic chemical as in refusing to disinfect water bottles or food equipment with it not realizing that it s literally added to our tap water in very dilute amounts it s ok to drink and certainly a lot better for you than water borne pathogens
this is why public utilities use chlorine we are a bit of an outlier but here in the netherlands no chlorine is added to our tap water at all if absolutely necessary ozon or peroxide may be used during water treatment but usually in short multiple steps of sedimentation filtration and uv disinfection are used the end result is perfectly drinkable microbially safe tap water
wow the last years game stray featuring a cat in a dystopic future had enemies artificially made gigantic bacterias very dangerous but vulnerable to uv light and daylight didn t know that also had a grounding in reality
good to know thanks
what about water that has been sitting in a carbon water filter under the sink refrigerator is that safe to drink after i have been away from home for a while
wouldn t the chlorine be bad for humans if there is a sufficient amount to actually kill microbes
is chlorine safe
do note though that chlorine provides zero protection against heavy metals or chemicals and pharmaceuticals that make it through the water treatment plant of which there are many also chlorine can be overused my municipal water has many times more than it should i can smell it when i turn on the shower really there s no replacement for hardcore municipal water treatment and an absolutely perfect water distribution system no lead anywhere no leaks to let in god know what along the way etc chlorine should never be more than a preservative at the consumer end
the lead pipes the romans used was mitigated by mineral deposits that created a safe ish layer between the pipes and the water the elites were more susceptable to lead poisoning because they used lead alloy cups and dishes that were consistently cleaned
what about where i live we all have running water but it goes first though your house water tank several hundred liters on the roof usually plastic specially when the river grows and water is more turbid and chlorine smelling than usual
and why most romans didn t die by lead poisoning despite using lead pipes in their aqueducts no that one is because lead quickly oxidises and the oxide layer prevents any lead entering the water there s an absolute shitload of lead plumbing still currently in use same as asbestos it s fine where it is long as it s undisturbed
this is not quite true though leaks are actually a significant source of contaminants in tap water while positive pressure does keep contaminants out in reality it is quite hard to consistently maintain positive pressure something as simple as opening and closing a tap can result in a short burst of negative pressure through the pipe which has been proven https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28asce%29hy.1943-7900.0001040) to introduce contaminants not to mention that the venturi effect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venturi_effect) is also a thing so i reckon any constrictions in the pipes are suspect too if you want to keep tap water clean getting rid of leaks is absolutely crucial
this is the correct answer
cool thanks for the info is this why flint mi or jackson ms have such drity water
they also sell the best bottled sparkling water in the world gerolsteiner
the levels of chlorine the us puts in its water have been scientifically deemed safe for human consumption however most municipalities don t even go near the 4mg liter limit baltimore where i live only puts 2mg liter lower than germany s standards too and we aren t a city known for being very high class lol and the us water supply is constantly in motion too i m not sure how you reached the conclusion that because germany places their limit unnecessarily low on chlorine that their tap water is inherently better than the us
if you live in the us you have a scary high chance you have lead pipes especially if you live in florida
how do they keep the water constantly in motion recirculating pumps
also it s not chlorine gas that they add it s a chlorine containing chemical like hypochlorite same as in bleach that stays dissolved in the water
i m also on a well but don t do anything beyond running through a sediment filter the water tastes better than filtered tap water or bottled water the people i feel bad for are you guys back in the midwest or southeast tap water there tastes like ass to the point the most of the hotels give you free bottled water when you check in
do they add chlorine
less plastic in the water too
that s a lot of responsibility to put on clams i m not bigoted against clams some of my best friends are clams but i don t really trust them
i ve heard it s pretty safe to drink in flint mi and jackson mi
epa has very strict guidelines regarding water we turn in a huge monthly report to our state epa and there better be no violations there are alot of independent groups that monitor it as well to make sure things are kosher we have several bottling plants in our district and they depend on us to have very good quality mgd plant in a million metro area
good to know thanks
depends where you are in the uk where i am most people drink tap water for most of the time and we come to no harm i went to china and drank the tap water there big mistake had the shits for two weeks as a result
good info thanks
this
for anyone who downvoted i really encourage you to look more into this i m assuming you re tap water drinkers and don t want to hear this but this is a serious issue i used to drink tap water daily and i was diagnosed with colon cancer in my early 30s obviously i do not know with any certainty that tap water was the reason however the rate of colon cancer in young people has been climbing at an alarming rate and our drinking water is on a short list of reasonable possible causes
bottled water is just as bad though
it also breaks down into sodium chloride and oxygen
right bleach is super unstable it s why it s so dangerous to mix but by the same dint just leaving diluted bleach water mixtures sitting for 24hrs will see the bleach break down almost completely into it s component parts and every single commercial kitchen i ve been in uses diluted bleach for cleaning
yeah the bleach we buy off shelves are not concentrated enough to harm us in a substantial way or else they would not be sold on shelves i can probably go take a small sip right now and be relatively fine obviously i m not saying drink bleach but it s not the poison people think it is not the ones we use anyway
uv is becoming more common here in the united states as well nyc source water is disinfected in the largest uv facility in the world i believe ozone disinfection is also sometimes used to eliminate chlorine but it has its own byproducts
is your water source coming from underground aquifers or surface water
what protects the water from contaminants introduced in the system
indeed even if treated with chlorine utilities may also treat with uv first it can reduce the required amount of chlorine and more importantly cryptosporidium is somewhat resistant to chlorine but is effectively sterilized throuh uv it should be noted that we re talking about uv c nm and not uv a or uv b that cause sunburns tans and make psychedelic posters glow
all things are poison and nothing is without poison only the dose makes a thing not a poison paracelsus in other words the dose of chlorine or a similar chemical used in water treatment is poisonous to bacteria but not to a large multicellular organism you
chlorine in the form of sodiumhypochloride breaks down into oxygen and sodium chloride over time and on reaction this is oxygen and tablesalt the chloride in the water is ionic and not the elemental clorine that is highly toxic the cleaning effect in bleach comes from the reactive oxygen
some chlorine is totally safe if you ve ever swam in a pool you ve drank a lot of chlorine more than you ll drink from tap water in months remember it s not the chemical it s the dose a small amount to a human is trivial but can utterly kill something as small as microbes
there are no toxic chemicals only toxic doses basically anything can be toxic in big enough quantities including water and oxygen conversely in small enough doses your body can shrug off some real nasty chemicals sodium hypochlorite aka chlorine is actually classified as a chemical weapon but the small amount added to the large amount of water is harmless to humans but deadly to microbes specifically the ones that cause dysentery and cholera fun fact we can trace the decline in infant mortality across the world directly to the adoption of chlorine being added to our water before the 1890s children died from water born diseases
like anything it s the specific amount that actually matters in low enough concentrations sodium hypochlorite is safe to drink and will safely disinfect drinking water since the drinking water is relatively clean to begin with once you have a source of contamination like a bunch of human bodies swimming in a pool you need to up the concentration slightly to a level that it will make you mildly sick if you drink enough of it it s still way less concentrated than a bottle of bleach though which will burn going down and then even worse coming back up
humans are a lot bigger than organisms too small to the naked eye
in sufficient quantities chlorine will most definitely kill you at the levels in the water you may lose a few cells but your gastrointestinal tract has plenty of other stuff that will neutralize the remaining chlorine in the water minimizing the damage to you
dosage and concentration relative to the size of what they re targeting matter a microbe is a single tiny cell most bacteria are much much smaller than the animal tissue cells in our body reliant on a cell wall to protect it we re a network of trillions of cells working in sync with each other balancing their environment compare it to other things we use to preserve or clean things but also consume you can drink or eat something with enough sugar salt vinegar acid or alcohol in it to keep bacteria from growing in it but your body processes it fine because it dilutes it over a much larger system
it would if we dranknit immediately when added or at least wouldn t be great for you but what happens is they add the chlorine and this is just one step btw and it starts to kill the germs the water is tested before and then released after a certain amount of time into the plumbing system by the time it hits your sink most of the germs are dead and most of the chlorine is neutralized or ore correctly broken down molecularly as some have said
no
chlorine is only fed in small amounts roughly gals per million gals it dissipates faster in warmer weather so in the summer homes closer to the water plant may have slightly more chlorine due to feeding more plants are moving away from cl2 due to being very hazardous i worked at a mgd plant for years adding new technology for that big of plant is very expensive epa monitors water quality very strict
in terms of being added to drinking water absolutely if handled and dosed at the proper rates in terms of chlorine in general somewhat but can become deadly very fast
water department checking in the clorine concentrations are quite corrosive and it eats through the lines fittings and walls over time
there are dozens of safety features surrounding cl2 it is basically the mustard gas used in ww1 it attacks the lungs and burns them we were required to wear scbas oxygen tanks that fire fighters wear to do any work where lines are disassembled storage building was designed to pull a vacuum in the area if there was a leak and thru a scrubber system cl2 gas detectors everywhere google bhopal india people died
they also used lead acetate to sweeten wine by boiling grape must in lead pots
yeah i did not mean to imply people completely evaded lead poisoning since it was considered safe and used widely it s just that you d think that that would be the main reason for lead poisoning
for flint mi no it wouldn t particularly surprise me if they had pressure problems as well but the big scandal was lead contamination and that was because they switched water sources to one that was more corrosive without adding the necessary additives causing lead to leach out of their lead water lines and into the water
iirc flints problem was they switched water sources from one river to another or from the lake to a river idk and the chemical makeup of the new water source wasn t accounted for and it started to corrode leach led out of the old pipes whereas the old water source had certain chemicals added that mitigated this effect not sure about jackson i think that was more about flooding contaminating their water supply so probably yes more like the comment you replied to here
from what i ve seen and heard on flint they didn t add a chemical like zinc ortho phosphate this chemical lightly coats the pipes so they don t erode i believe the documentary said they did not feed it to save 20k dollars probably costing them millions to fix it now several water supervisors falsified documents and got caught spent time in jail
gerolsteiner is indeed pretty good
which is also just good old tap water
what is safe and what is good are two pair of shoes and there are enough us cities where you can literally smell taste that the s chlorine in the water also you re trying to compare what some cities do in the us to the overall maximum limit in germany but just like there s cities that don t go even near 4mg l in the us there s a lot of cities in germany that also don t go near 3mg l either the majority don t use any chlorine at all and use other filtering methods
lead pipes are surprisingly safe as long as the water in them isn t corrosive this is the problem with flint they changed their water supply to a more polluted one and the combo of that and the lead pipes is what caused the water to be undrinkable not that i m advocating for lead pipes but if you live in an area that has them there probably isn t a need to panic
i m in danger
more lead pipes in florida this explains so much
yikes
i don t know exactly what kind of pumps we use here but i know that water here is recirculated i e unused water is dumped into the ground which acts as one layer of filtering pumped up again at another location filtered cleaned and tested once more and then re pumped into the water lines again also german tap water is checked by over individual companies all across germany with very high standards which is one reason why it s one of the cleanest in the world and fun fact in germany restrictions for tap water are so ridiculously high that it s actually cleaner than bottled water
sodium hypochlorite once dissolved it eventually evaporates out of the water and dissipates it s why you have to leave tap water out for a day or so before putting your goldfish in it
a lot of places still use gas it is mixed with water at the feed point we use one ton containers to keep the mgd plant running over a few weeks years maintaining this system most newer plants of course are getting away from it
i grew up on and still drink well water no chlorination or filter a little bit high in calcium as per testing which is typical of well water within the canadian shield
check out east palestine they have that water
you actually have no idea if you came to no harm you ll find out in like years
what country do you live in
except when it breaks down due to ammonia like the little kids peeing in the pool in which case you get chloramines
omg sodium chloride that sounds dangerous
leaving diluted bleach water mixtures sitting for 24hrs will see the bleach break down almost completely into it s component parts that can t be true or else you couldn t buy bleach in a store
my dad used to use old bleach bottles to store drinking water in when he was fishing on his boat until one time he grabbed the wrong bottle glughed a mouthful before realizing
we stick it in landfills we burn it to generate electricity we recycle it we ship it to other countries so that we can pretend that we properly disposed of it and whatever they do with it isn t our responsibility
truth is it never leaves us we just transfer it or hide it and try to forget see how in this article https://insulationcorp.com/throw-back-thursday-april-17-2014/
we have a lot of empty space to work with we stick it in landfills when necessary we cover them up and open another one many times we turn the covered landfill into a golf course we are really good at using debris all of the land from michigan avenue to lake michigan is made up of burned refuse from the great chicago fire
your garbage is compacted in the truck with a giant hydraulic ram so by volume about is reduced before it gets to the landfill most municipalities are recycling at least some material too so the bulky cardboard and paper are pulped and reused plastic recycling has gotten a bit complicated metals are often stripped out too and then the organic material will eventually break down by volume many places are composting now too and so the volume of garbage is less than it once was
at it s most basic trash is buried in the ground in low value areas covered with soil then vented and drained so that toxic gasses and runoff won t build up and contaminate the area this isn t really insane and given the cost to dispose of trash in the us it s a reasonably priced service the scale is large but not overwhelming in context landfill with refuse is very old and you d be amazed what is built on trash
for most places in the us it goes to a dump aka a landfill that s just a big well engineered hole that they put trash into they can fit a lot of trash there generally several years worth when it s full they cover it over and start a new hole sometimes the trucks drop it at a transfer station instead of the dump the transfer station puts it onto other vehicles like barges or highway trucks for transport to a dump if the dump is far away we generate a lot of trash but not nearly enough to worry about running out of landfill room except in a few cases like nyc where there is no large open undeveloped areas nearby to build a landfill a lot of these places are open to the public if you want to drop off trash yourself if you call ahead you can probably get a nerdy engineer to show you around
in america it is most likely buried in a landfill after being crushed in europe waste to energy plants are more common and residual ash is buried in a landfill ideally all waste should be processed for recyclable materials the rest burned for energy and the resultant ash purified of harmful elements like lead after that the remainder could be used as fertilizer and the harmful elements can be buried in mines
have you considered asking your local waste management for a tour
city of phoenix contracts with waste management who operates a multi square mile land fill near mobile az neighborhood garbage trucks carry your trash to a local waste transfer station where it s loaded into semi trailers and driven miles to this man made mountain maybe visible from space
depending on your area your waste collection company may break it down to three categories recyclables organics everything else recyclables is plastics and cans you know those triangle with numbers on plastic bottles that s useless t s something made up by the plastic companies when you recycle plastics all into one bin there s not much companies that can recycle it cause there s different types of plastic and they re recycled differently so we often ship it to other countries organics is something like your lawn clippings basically all the waste from your grass trees some companies take these and make them into mulch or compost everything else goes into landfills imagine a big land and they dig a big hole so everyday the trash truck takes the trash there and at the end of the day they compact it and put this industrial tarp to close it off then it s the same thing the next day until the hole becomes a hill once it s a hill they monitor the area for years to make sure the trash doesn t leak to the groundwater or something after that the hill is changed to a park or something basically we just bury our problems away that s why it s bad if you throw batteries or something toxic even though batteries may be dead it may still catch on fire so it ll be buried and may catch on fire and that s bad so what you can do is to educate yourself reduce your waste output reuse what you can instead of throwing it out then recycle if you can t do any of those then it goes to the ground and stays there forever eventually we ll run out of space and that s not good
ever seen idiocracy yeah it s basically that
lots of trash is empty space cans bottles boxes are crushed and compacted in the trucks to reduce the volume when the container on the truck is full the truck goes to either a collection site or the landfill some cities have curbside recycling where the residents separate out recyclable material green waste aluminum glass plastic metals etc for separate collection trash is either sent to landfills to be buried forever or sent to garbage to energy sites where the trash is burned create electricity which is sold to electric utilities the ash left over is buried in the landfill
we recycle it it turns out we ship a lot of that to other countries too and they don t recycle it https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/palo-alto-recycling-asia-garbage-waste-rcna58633
we ship the recyclables to china then china makes cheap stuff
i don t get why we don t just put it in volcanoes
staten island lol
this is a good reply
dude finally someone who knows this movie love this movie
i just want to tag on and add this is a significant problem but it typically affects plastic recycling with cardboard and metal far less affected it also varies significantly by location your community may export almost no recyling or it may export large amounts of recycling just wanted to add that as i ve begun to meet people who believe recycling is useless and aren t recycling anything even metal because they believe it won t be recycled
china banned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china%27s_waste_import_ban) waste imports a few years ago seems that it s going to thailand malaysia and vietnam among other places now
you re right instead of burning it for energy and capturing some of the pollutants we should burn it for nothing and capture none of the pollutants
iirc a huge chunk of boston too
just wanted to add that as i ve begun to meet people who believe recycling is useless and aren t recycling anything even metal because they believe it won t be recycled i m glad you ve made this clarification because i felt like i ve become one of those people will try to continue to reduce reuse and recycle
exactly almost of the aluminum america uses is recycled your soda can was most likely a can in its past life because it s cheaper than refining new aluminum this is true with other metals as well glass is less valuable trickier to recycle and as such more likely to be landfilled paper even more so but at least it will mostly biodegrade and in the u s is likely to come from managed forests trees that were planted to be paper products and will be replanted but the plastic you throw out may very well end up in the pacific or leaching its chemicals out in a landfill it is nearly worthless commercially
anybody that has worked in retail or a warehouse can vouch for the cardboard recycling industry bales of relatively clean cardboard are considered fairly valuable in fact knowingly contaminating a bale with plastic or throwing clean cardboard in the trash is grounds for punishment in my workplace
paper depends on type too clean uncoated brown cardboard is fairly easy to recycle plain white paper recycles ok and coated dirty inked paper is difficult or eve impossible recyle sorting out paper at a recyclers isn t as difficult as sorting plastic but still costs time and money there are some plastics that are commercially worth recycling which is a big part of why people from very poor countries often pick through garbahe dumps but they often aren t worth sorting out if you actually pay people any real wage glass is fairly easy to recycle if a glass manufacturer is nearby but shipping costs very quickly outweigh the saving if it is far away
court illustrators exist because filming or photographing proceedings is banned in many courtrooms the reason for this is in part to prevent the media from making a farce of the legal process by recording editing and airing only certain parts of the trial or trying to influence public opinion on the case also having cameras around and knowing you are being watched by people live can have an undo undue influence on people which could cause defendants and witnesses to act differently or grandstand given that they have a public forum this has been hotly debated but most judges hold fast to this ruling although they do allow it on occasion the us supreme court is notable for never allowing cameras to be present while in session while certain high profile trials of criminal cases may allow filming of the sentencing for example the most notable example of a televised court case was the oj simpson trial which considering how much of a public circus it became kinda proves the whole point of why cameras aren t generally allowed in the courtroom
after looking it up the tl dr is because most courts don t trust media outlets to behave themselves and also they believe that the presence of cameras may effect the proceedings e g defendants witnesses may act differently due to the pressure of being on camera the long version can be found here https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/989/cameras-in-the-courtroom
it s up to the judge s discretion on whether or not cameras are allowed due to the sensitivity or severity of particular crimes cameras may be banned
they can be and regularly are photographed but in general the press can t take photos or record footage in courts as of right you need permission from the judge which often comes with certain conditions to ensure a fair trial some judges are just more reluctant than others to give that permission
aside from the concerns over privacy fairness of the trial and media bias there is also a legitimate concern regarding safety cameras particularly big bulky still cameras or professional film grade cameras are excellent places to smuggle in weapons or other things that could be used to sabotage a trial such as illegal evidence that would force a mistrial
that s a good explanation thanks
undo small correction its undue with the meaning you are going for here
you happen to know how someone gets into that job it s been a lifelong dream of mine
except for the reasoning courts don t like transparency egotistical judges don t want too deal with people holding them accountable accountable yeah yeah not everyone but that is truth
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body and which you need in small quantities for proper health inorganic compounds like iron calcium etc as well as macronutrients proteins carbs fats etc are excluded the vitamins were classified by letter during the early 1900s before we knew what the chemicals physically looked like at first we mainly figured them out by looking at the different diseases caused by deficiency for example scurvy is caused by lack of vitamin c over time we discovered that some vitamins were actually multiple very different compounds so we started creating sub assignments under the letter that s how we got some of the b s there were also some vitamins that we later discovered weren t actual vitamins or were so similar to other vitamins that they didn t really deserve their own letter vitamin h was renamed to b7 vitamin f ended up being a type of fat that s why there are so many weird holes in the vitamin naming system nowadays
in addition to what s already been mentioned there actually are numbers assigned to other families of vitamins for example there s vitamin d2 ergocalciferol and d3 cholecalciferol as well as k1 phylloquinone and k2 menaquinone however in those cases they re very closely related chemically and serve similar biological functions whereas the b vitamins are very different
i actually had a question about my b12 vitamin today my vitamin d supplements come in the daily dose mcg but my b12 has a whopping of the daily dose mcg is there a reason for this
removed
when vitamins were discovered they thought that there was only one b vitamin that turned out to be multiple different vitamins so they started to use numbers to distinguish them

basically if you were to isolate vitamins in food one of the first things you d do is separate the molecules by solubility a d e and k vitamins are not water soluble which means they are found in fatty parts of food and they stay in our cells for a long time b and c vitamins are water soluble which means their mostly found in watery parts of foods mostly fruits vegetables and grains and they easily leave our bodies dissolved in water they need to be replenished daily once you have separated vitamins by solubility vitamin c has some unique chemical properties and a biological role that has been well understood for a long time removing it leaves the b vitamins a whole bunch of compounds with different structures and functions but similarly chemical and physical properties
imagine vitamins are like a big box of colorful alphabet blocks each block is a little different and has its own special job b vitamins are like the b blocks in the box there are many of them because they are part of a big vitamin family that works together to help our body do important things like turning the food we eat into energy other vitamins like a c or d are more like individual blocks with their own jobs they aren t part of a big family like the b vitamins so you won t find as many of them now the b vitamins are all a little different just like how your toys or friends might be different even if they belong to the same group here s a simple way to remember what each b vitamin does b1 thiamine helps our body use the energy from food b2 riboflavin keeps our skin eyes and nerves healthy b3 niacin helps our body break down food and make energy b5 pantothenic acid supports our body in making and using energy b6 pyridoxine helps our brain send messages and keeps our immune system strong b7 biotin helps our body break down fats carbohydrates and proteins b9 folate helps make new cells especially important for growing kids b12 cobalamin helps our body make new red blood cells and keeps our brain healthy

imagine this you have glass marbles the only categorical differences between them are size shape color and design you have already identified that they are in fact marbles because they are made of glass and you have identified and verified the structural sequences of glass material all that s left to do is sort them into the categories they fit into type glass vs non glass color red blue green etc shape spherical drop etc design transparent or cats eye etc the same goes for vitamins scientists first identify the genotype code that classifies a substance as a vitamin then they determine the type and subtypes of those substances using other parts of the code for example let s say a scientist has three substances to study upon first look studying only the base material or the genotype all three substances classify as vitamins because the code that engineered them is identical to the base code in almost all other vitamins upon further examination two of the vitamins appear to function very similarly to one another and the third appears to function similarly to the other two but not nearly as similarly this is where they d identify the family of vitamins each one belongs to maybe the two that are very similar are both b vitamins and the third is an a vitamin upon even further study the scientist identifies a third set of data to tell the two similar b vitamins apart they behave differently now the scientist has identified that not only does he she have two b vitamins but one of each vitamin b6 and b12 the names of these vitamins help scientists identify how these vitamins are similar vitamin vs vitamin vitamin vs mineral vs other substances how far down they remain similar and where exactly they depart from similarity so they better understand more about what the substance is how it behaves reacts and what benefits consequences we have of taking these specific substances and how much we should take as deficiencies and toxicity can occur if we take the wrong dose i hope this helps not a doctor edited for a few typos clarifications

maybe someone has already said this and may this is just myth but i always thought the letters were assigned based off of where in a purification they came off like all the b vitamins eluted in fraction b so that s how they got assigned the letter
subscribe to vitamin facts
for very different compounds though why not just keep using new letters why sub assign at all is it because they wanted to keep the letter assignment still specific to the deficiency do different sub assignments today even all address the same needs
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body not able to be created in sufficient quantities for survival that doesn t necessarily mean they aren t produced at all
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body vitamin d can be created by synthesis of cholecalciferol in our skin
til there used to be a vitamin f
ohhhh vitamins vita l min eral s that makes sense
and why did the inuits not get scurvy there isn t a lot of citrus in the artic
small clarification essential vitamins are unable to be created by the body and therefore need to be obtained by external supplementation there are some vitamins the body produces on its own nonessential edit i was thinking of amino acids not vitamins as explained below
the common names of many micronutrients start with vitamin in bald defiance of the actual definition
if you have a serious deficit of vitamin c e g old timey sailors you ll be fine for a month or two then your body starts falling apart literally old scar tissue and broken bones will come apart again
wouldn t d be a rare exception in the sense we can actually synthesise it in our bodies through sunlight
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body and which you need in small quantities for proper health humans make vitamin d skin and k intestinal bacteria
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body and which you need in small quantities for proper health not strictly true d vitamins are produced by sunlight on the skin and we also produce limited numbers of a few others but yes we do need extra from diet as we as a species are somehow shit at producing them
scurvy is caused by lack of vitamin c or sometimes by an abundance of vitamin sea
interestingly enough most animals can produce vitamin c the exception are some primates including humans and guinea pigs capybara
so like a lot of things we will continue to use a clearly outdated system vocabulary instead of modernizing sometimes i wish we update such things in the same way we occasionally update highway exit numbers use an overlap system for a while until the holdout people finally give up and everyone uses a new system vocabulary we could have vitamins a thru q or whatever letter instead of this seemingly random lettering and numbering system that really only reflects growth of scientific knowledge
so does every vitamin of a letter group serve the same purpose if not why not split them into their own letters
it s there a modern list of vitamins
if we were to recategorize and relabel vitamins based on current knowledge what might that look like
isn t vitamin d created inside the body under certain conditions isn t that the reason why a lack of sunlight leads to vitamin d deficiency
vitamin lore
so are the different b vitamins actually closely related enough that we might put them under a similar name today or are they as different as vit d is to vit k
vitamins are biological molecules that are not able to be created by the human body isn t the body capable of synthesizing vitamin d
slightly offtopic but it seems you know a bit about the subject just thining out loud here is the word vitamin short for vitae mineral
vitamin f ended up being a type of fat i will now refer to my belly fat as an abundance of vitamin f
i think my new band name has to be vitamin f
and we can create vitamin d through sun exposure but it s still considered a vitamin
so basically we observed certain vitamins thought they were all the same named them b then found out later they were different so we gave them numbers and then after that we found new vitamins figured they were really close to the rest of the b vitamins and named them b as well and gave them their own numbers
demetri martin has a great take on this topic on his these are jokes album
why are b4 b8 b10 and b11 unaccounted for i know one of the numbered clotting factors iv maybe was discovered to be calcium right
one thing to add to this there is one vitamin we can produce vitamin d our skin uses uv light to produce it rickets was a big problem because kids were in factories and living under a cloud of smog
til that my body has too much vitamin f
yet again science has a bad habit of sticking with the first label and redefining things around it see also stellar classification
right imagine it as being the first to name animals let s say north america you point to a bird and name it bird you point to a moose and call it a moose as the years go by you realize there are hundreds of birds eagles hummingbirds crows etc so you need new names under the bird umbrella but that moose still just a moose
does this mean there are say dog vitamins which are compounds dogs can t produce but the human body can
smart ass 5yo
it s like the old joke what s the difference between a vitamin and a hormone you can t make a vita min
if people want to know more about vitamins i wrote a big post https://www.reddit.com/r/sar_med_chem/comments/xfaern/20_min_read_how_the_potato_solved_scurvy_until_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) about the rise of scurvy during the irish potato famine also how an american disease https://www.reddit.com/r/sar_med_chem/comments/10m2zp1/15_min_read_the_aztecs_discovered_how_to_make/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) was cured by a doctor eating someone s else s scabs and feces
on a side note you should look into taking a methylated b complex multivitamin of the population undermethylate of them have a mtfr mutation which manifest in so many different ailments physical and mental also folic acid is a synthetic version of folate found in many general multivitamins cereal etc that actually exasperates these issues here s a great video that breaks that down dr eric berg https://youtu.be/bfpwprnoqoy) i suggest everyone looks into it as this can be the catalyst to a long list of health issues even in kids here s what i use activated b complex https://www.swansonvitamins.com/p/swanson-ultra-activated-b-complex-high-bioavailability-60-veg-caps) kids multivitamin with active b complex https://www.swansonvitamins.com/p/dr-mercola-childrens-multivitamin-60-chwbls) their current discount code inthbyd05 they always send out promo emails and i find them to be the cheapest
speaking of those always take k2 with your d3
water soluble vitamins are taken in huge excess doses because our body will use what it needs and the rest will be filtered out and excreted fat soluble vitamins are taken at more reasonable relative doses so you can overcome a deficiency without risking over exposure to the vitamin this is also why taking a fat soluble vitamin supplement if you aren t deficient can actually be harmful in the long run
also b needs acidity in the digestive system to be taken up didn t know that until i was in the process of ms diagnosis my b12 was very low i was on one of those acid reflux pills took it daily doctor said i had to take injections since my reflux medicine wouldn t allow my body to take in the b12 i wonder if that may be why there is the super over dosage of b12 like that so many people on those pills now that in order to get some effect maybe you need over saturation
i know this one because i had the same question years ago b12 is hard to absorb from pills it is easier to absorb from fortified foods and drinks it s not just a matter of peeing out what you didn t need you also can t even absorb all of it in the first place they give you a huge amount of it in the hope that you ll absorb enough
d is fat soluble and sticks around the bs are water soluble and wash out quickly
my d3 is iu s that s 250mcg and it s the dose doctors in my region recommend you take a pretty low dose it is possible to od on vitamin d but not possible with b12 though
dv isn t based on anything that we think people should get it s an observation based on population averages back when the measurement was made basically that b12 supplement has a lot more b12 in it than people were consuming back then that probably means you want tiny amounts of it semi frequently
i don t know for certain but i would guess it s because humans can synthesize vitamin d utilizing uv exposure but we cannot synthesize b12 at all we must get it from either diet or supplements
i read that the doses are so high in those vitamin pills as we will wee most of it out
the and refers to their chemical structure those arent just random numbers like vitamine b
thanks for an eli5 answer
we sometimes do however refactoring is a bitch now you get an old letter name and new letter name then another common name then iupac name i would say in basic science the letter names are seldom used ascorbic acid is ascorbic acid riboflavin is riboflavin etc
agreed i m thinking of starting the people s provisional committee to bring sanity to the naming of the coagulation pathway
let s start with the alphabet and the english language first and foremost and perhaps our measurement systems then we can consider fixing up our vitamin naming conventions
because it s an organic process not a top down standardized one
there s an entire alphabet a retinol b1 thiamine b2 riboflain b3 niacin b4 choline adenine b5 panthothenic acid b6 pyridoxine b7 biotin b8 adenosine monophosphate b9 folate b10 para aminobenzoic acid b11 pterolheptaglutamic acid b12 cobalamins b13 orotic acid b14 not xanthopherin cell proliferant anti anemia rat growth factotr b15 pangamic acid b16 dimethlglycine b17 nitrilosides from aprocot pits becames cyanide if consumed b18 b19 b20 l carnitine bf carnitine bm myo inositol bp antiperosis factor bt carnitine bv non pyridoxine b6 bw non d biotin biotin bx alternative name for paba b10 and pantothenic acid c ascorbic acid d califerols e tocopherols f essential fatty acids did not fit updated definition of vitamin g riboflavin moved to b2 h biotin moved to b7 j catechol moved to b2 l1 antranilic acid determined non essential l2 methylthioadenosine determined rna metabolite by body k koagulation coagulation phyllo and menaquinones m folate moved to b9 p flavonoids not proved essential pp niacin moved to b6 s salicyclic acid proven non essential u s methylmethionine protein metabolite proven synthesized in body
you say that like a d e k don t all have unique chemical properties or isomers vitamers on wikipedia like d1 or k1 and the b vitamins don t really have similar chemical or physical properties unless you mean the subgroup of each one like all of the different b1s sure but b1 and b12 are not similar i d switch it to say it s a whole bunch of compounds with similar functions but not structure or properties
the best eli5 answer on this thread the others mostly just listed the vitamins you explained it and did so in a mostly kid friendly way
but also d and k do have a family just commenting that because i was jealous at how successfully you eli5 d the weird world of vitamins

welcome to vitamin facts a lack of vitamin d leads to rickets vitamin c to scurvy vitamin b1 to beriberi vitamin b3 to pellagra vitamin a was the first vitamin to be discovered and thiamine type of b the first to be synthesized america and countries have flours enriched with b vitamins and iron because the process to make flour white flour removes a lot of the nutrients vitamins are categorized under dietary supplements by the fda which has limited regulatory powers over them therefore many vitamin companies are lying about how much they re selling you do you pee neon yellow after taking vitamins it s riboflavin vitamin b and you re taking too much vitamins b and c are water soluble so they ll pass through you but be careful with fat soluble vitamins like a and d which can be stored in the body don t ever eat a polar bear s liver the vitamin a alone will kill you edit i ll be turning off comments because i m not a bot and they re getting repetitive
vitamin c as the cure treatment for scurvy was discovered lost and discovered again the thing with scurvy is that it takes a while to develop you need to be vitamin c deficient for several months and it s pretty easy to find vitamin c in lots of fresh foods not just citrus the age of sail is the first time scurvy became a real big problem as people would be at sea for months at a time luckily people were able to figure out pretty quickly that lemon juice would keep scurvy at bay awesome after some time this was replaced with cheaper lime juice the downside of lime juice is that there s a lot less vitamin c people still weren t getting scurvy though because ship technology had improved and most voyages lasted weeks instead of months lime juice was still being issued to sailors to fight scurvy even though it really wasn t doing much the problem didn t become apparent until people started polar expeditions intrepid explorers would be on the ice for months at a time and the deficiencies of lime juice started to have a real impact eventually more research was conducted and the role of vitamin c specifically was discovered to be what stopped scurvy
usually the only main difference between men s women s multivitamins are differing iron contents pre menopausal women need higher iron supplementation because periods if you have too much iron in your body for a variety of reasons a modern solution that hospitals still perform that sounds slightly medieval is bloodletting phlebotomy where they take out around a half liter of blood weekly as needed gummy multivitamins are largely a scam because the manufacturing process is spraying liquid vitamins onto a huge vat of gummies meaning the amount of vitamin spray you re actually ingesting is random based on where your gummies were in that batch and they could have been completely skipped over and have nothing on them accutane retin a differin etc acne treatments are all retinoids meaning they are all chemically related to vitamin a if you are on accutane you cannot supplement vitamin a or you risk hypervitaminosis a

vitamin vital amine
the sub assignments are for ones that perform similar actions bs ds ks or are chemically similar ds and ks usually means one is the active form and the others are for protection storage production of something else k d is a bit complicated to explain in a reddit comment for example all of the b vitamins help with cellular energy production and or nerve building protection all the ks with clotting and not necessarily to your final question you need all of the bs to function properly they don t substitute for each other whereas ds and ks will although d3 is typically considered the one you want and k2 in the case of being chemically similar you could even be a subtype of a subtype though not required and would be called a vitamer like isomer like there s major forms of vitamin d but only and are active and in a sense theres of several different b vitamin subgroup subgroups that all work as each other mostly it s a pretty complicated system tbh because it was formed over time and refined on the fly so basically every answer is kind of but not really but maybe we tried to make as much sense as we could along the way https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamer is a good page because you can click on each vitamin group or each actual individual chemical to compare and contrast
they were named around a hundred years ago as they were discovered we didn t know so much then so everything isn t in the nice correct order they would be if we were naming them now
future proofs against running out of letters if you use numbers i suppose
it s historical reasons really
there s a lot of talk in the scientific community that vitamin d should not be a vitamin
f
that was my nickname in college
malk is chock full of it
it s a portmanteau
that s good but it actually stands for vita l amin e because they originally thought vitamins were all amines when they discovered otherwise they dropped the e to de emphasise the amine relationship
it originally was vit al amin es but then scientists discovered that they were not all amines in fact most of them were not amines ooops well we can t just go and change the name of something that has been in use for a while
liver is a source of vitamin c
this reminds me of that one tweet that s like cars have windows and move fast houses have windows but don t move so it s gotta be something other than the windows
they eat animals that produce their own vitamin c
the traditional inuit diet includes raw fish and meat raw foods have more vitamins than cooked foods do
it turns out whale blubber has lots of vitamin c
dr f cook wondered the same thing during the belgica s antarctic expedition he spent time with northern tribes before the expedition and realized they ate enough barely cooked meat to ward off scurvy the more meat is cooked the less vitamin c is in the meat so eating raw meat will reduce your chance of scurvy everyone on the belgica who did as cook prescribed got better those that didn t had scurvy
small clarification the scientific definition of vitamin is a micronutrient the organism can t produce in sufficient quantities on its own ascorbic acid for example is a vitamin for humans but not for kale or indeed most other mammals the common names of many micronutrients start with vitamin in bald defiance of the actual definition
the internet archive is a small ish nonprofit that takes in less than 40mm in revenue per year and is basically break even after expenses if the publishers win the suit ia might owe per book and there were potentially millions of books which seems high but that s what s referenced in the suit this would instantly bankrupt the ia shutting down all their activities including the wayback machine could someone pick that part of it up and continue to provide it sure but know the hosting and maintenance costs are still tens of millions a year https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/943242767/202013219349323056/full https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504 https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.537900/gov.uscourts.nysd.537900.1.0.pdf
the internet archive is a non profit organization that runs the wayback machine and also had a project called the national emergency library the national emergency library was a collection of books that were made available for free downloading during the pandemic to support remote learning and research however some of the books were still under copyright and the holders of those copyrights filed a lawsuit against the internet archive for copyright infringement if the internet archive loses its case it could face penalties up to per act of infringement this could potentially put the internet archive out of business and cause both the national emergency library and the wayback machine to go away the wayback machine is a separate project from the national emergency library but both are run by the same organization
well shit looks like we need a backup of the backup before it dies for good
a microfiber cloth won t clean as well as silk not that i am saying you should use silk to clean your glasses because it will wear out really quick it s about the space between each thread allowing dirt oil to pass picture a comb with teeth brushing your hair it s going to miss most of the knots but last forever a comb with teeth it s going to catch most of the knots a comb with teeth will catch every knot but will also break more easily because its teeth are smaller microfiber cloths fall into that sweet spot durable and lots of threads to catch the dirt
just a lpt they fill up with the oils and don t wash well in new washing machines i soak mine in isopropyl alcohol and squeeze rinse and repeat more times then hang up to air dry
imagine your lenses are like a playground full of tiny tiny dirt particles microfiber towels are like a team of tiny friendly octopuses each octopus has lots of arms that can reach out and grab the dirt particles from the playground other fabrics are like crabs with fewer and bigger arms they can t grab as many dirt particles so they re not as good at cleaning
i will forever refer to microfibers as octopi of textiles
i will have to try this i ve been hand washing them with soap rinsing and air drying and it seems to work ok
thanks for that hilariously whimsical visual
what really sets them apart is the shape of what s left behind microfiber is like a rake while a paper towel is like a plow photons are like kids running around they ll run over the tiny furrows left by a rake with no problem but those left by a plow will distort their paths and make the image smudgy
replied to wrong comment there
what kind of soap do you use i didn t have much luck that way but maybe i used the wrong soap
lol i was very confused until i kept reading answers down below
dish soap but the rubbing alcohol sounds like a better idea
you re meant to make ceviche with sashimi grade fish which has been frozen in order to kill potential parasites in the fish so the fish you make ceviche with would otherwise be safe to consume raw the acidic citrus firms and cooks the proteins in the fish to take away the raw texture but it doesn t cook or kill anything that might be in the fish in the same way that putting it in the oven would properly prepared chicken can be safe to consume raw as well but doesn t have a texture many would find pleasant the japanese make a chicken breast sashimi
i m not sure why you think citrus juice has anything to do with it people eat raw seafood without citrus juice all the time much seafood is safe to eat raw and most of the chicken produced today is not safe to eat raw in part due to the really unhealthy farm conditions which allow salmonella etc to spread
i didn t know that about chicken breast sashimi that s definately a texture i couldn t handle along with just the thought of eating raw chicken
the citrus juice does serve to denature the proteins in the meat which is very similar to what cooking does the acid unlike heat won t cook the meat all the way through you could soak it in more acid for a longer period of time but that will of course change the taste the more fresh seafood is the safer it is to eat any parasites or bacteria that are present will multiply rapidly when the fish is dead and it s immune system can no longer combat them it s common practice on a lot of commercial fishing boats to flash freeze the fish which will kill parasites and bacteria
i d always heard that the acidity of the juice cooked the fish so i was curious if that substituted the flash freezing used in other raw seafood preparation or was just a myth but your explanation makes sense
chicken sashimi in japan once after i mistranslated a menu item it was pretty good
what cooking does to a protein is also denaturing but it s much harsher than a weak acid plus microorganisms aren t just collections of exposed protein floating around a somewhat lower ph environment will surely hamper their growth over time but it won t rapidly kill them like cooking will
if we flash froze chicken would it be safe to eat raw
i see i think your question may have been better phrased like this poster did https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3k1o21/eli5_why_does_lemon_juice_cook_fish_when_making/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1
just to be sure here a weak acid like citrus juice does nothing for food safety
seconded i had chicken sashimi in tokyo in december
no freezing does not kill salmonella
p mv is from newtonian mechanics which is known to be an incomplete model of reality but which sticks around because it s an excellent approximation for everyday purposes the momentum of light is one of the cases where newtonian mechanics fails and we need to upgrade to relativistic physics in which the momentum of a massless particle is planck s constant the particle s wavelength or p h 
because the common use equation are not complete e mc is the mass energy equivalence valid in rest frames for object in motion it is e p c m c the momentum equation p m v is one of newtonian mechanics m is the rest mass if you include the relativistic effect that is important when speeds start to approach it is the speed of light m is the relativistic mass that is the total energy of a body divided by the speed of light squared at a speed that is common for objects with a mass on earth the difference between rest mass and relativistic mass is so thin that we can simply ignore it for a massless particle you can use the mass energy equivalence and derive that momentum p e c where e is the energy and c is the speed of light https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_in_special_relativity
mass has momentum but so does energy in a way mass and energy are kind of the same thing or you could think of them as two different forms of the same thing most things we deal with have lots of mass and are moving very slowly so their momentum is almost entirely determined by their mass and velocity you might be familiar with the equation momentum mass velocity this is a pretty close approximation for most everyday things some things like light have little or no mass and are moving very quickly so their momentum is almost entirely determined by their energy and velocity the equation for the momentum of light is a little too complicated to type neatly in reddit but you can see it at wikipedia s article on mass in special relativity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_in_special_relativity).
hello physicians appreciate the discussion you re having with each other however none of your explanations are eli5 please explain like some of us are absolute seagulls in terms of knowledge much love i don t intrinsically onderstand things
some great explanations here but most are way more complex than i could explain to my year old how about this photons light are often described as having the properties of both particles and waves for the momentum piece let s focus on waves picture a wave in the ocean it travels across the ocean with an observable momentum however the drops of water do not travel with it the photon of light travels across the electromagnetic field similarly to how the ocean wave travels across the surface of the water
easiest way i can explain it is that even though it has no mass it still is a particle like throwing a balloon at someone still has impact balloons are relatively weightless but something it hits will react that means your shadow has negative weight and satellites in space are impacted by the sun s rays of lights pushing it
light has the ability to exert a force on things it can push objects that s how a solar sail works looking at light as a wave it has an electric field and a magnetic field when the electric field hits an object it causes charged particles typically electrons to move from side to side then the magnetic field exerts a force on those moving particles pushing the object in the direction of the light and of course momentum is conserved so when a light source emits light the source gets pushed backwards we just don t notice this because things like light bulbs are so heavy compared to the momentum of the light they emit this momentum is eventually transferred to whatever the light hits but between the light being emitted and absorbed that momentum must be somewhere right and it is it s in the light
light is like a wave that carries energy and momentum and photons are like tiny balls that make up the wave when light hits something the photons can bump into the thing and transfer some of their energy and momentum to it like when you throw a ball and it hits something even though the photons are very light and can t be weighed they still have energy and can make things move
photons have zero rest mass however photons only exist moving at the speed c so if they re never not moving rest mass is really just theoretical
i think this video may clarify things https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edxoijzrlpo
that s not eli5 that s eliphd in physics
mass energy equivalence i always forget about that one thanks
is there a way to dumb it down a little
physicians are doctors these are physicists
i ll attempt momentum is when stuff is moving you re used to thinking of mass as the thing that is stuff and that things that don t have mass aren t stuff it turns out that some really smart and dedicated people did a bunch of tests and they found that energy is the real stuff and mass is just like one kind of really super dense energy in day to day life we don t notice the energy based part of momentum because the mass based part is so so much denser and bigger it s like noticing the weight of an extra feather on top of the weight of a skyscraper that s why it took a long time for physicists to discover this and that s why you get taught about just the mass part at first
e mc got famous because it tells us something pretty nutty energy is mass mass is just one type of energy and anything with energy behaves as if this energy was also mass for a basic example going fast actually makes you slightly heavier because your kinetic energy adds on to the mass you have when you re standing still the difference is usually small enough to ignore but it s really there ok so photons photons packets of light don t have any normal mass like what a rock sitting on a table has what people are calling rest mass but because photons have energy that means they do have relativistic mass and therefore momentum because energy and mass are actually the same thing and yes that makes my head hurt too that s not a sign you aren t getting it
let me give it a try i don t usually comment on here momentum is quantifying the motion of a particle or an object photons travels at the speed of light and hence has motion hence has momentum as simple as that as to why p mv doesn t work because that s not the full equation when objects travel very fast relativistic effects come into picture and we can t use the high school formulae anymore but otherwise high school formulae are sufficient for most of the day to day calculation
studying relativistic physics full time or in a working capacity would be eliphd in physics a one paragraph explanation of how momentum is calculated using a different equation than in high school physics is very much eli5 also there s this li5 means friendly simplified and layperson accessible explanations not responses aimed at literal five year olds and this https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules#wiki_.2fr.2fexplainlikeimfive_mission_statement) the purpose of this subreddit is to simplify complex concepts in a way that is accessible for laypeople the first thing to note about this is that this forum is not literally meant for year olds do not post questions that an actual year old would ask and do not respond as though you re talking to a child and also this https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules#wiki_rule_4.3a_explain_for_laypeople) as mentioned in the mission statement eli5 is not meant for literal year olds your explanation should be appropriate for laypeople that is people who are not professionals in that area for example a question about rocket science should be understandable by people who are not rocket scientists
nah i dropped out of college after semesters and had no trouble understanding that it s a reasonably layman friendly answer which is what eli5 is for
energy is equivalent to rest mass and momentum not just mass so if a photon has no rest mass all the energy it has will be momentum
mass and energy are the same thing we can for example use lasers to create black holes something we associate with mass this equivalence is what fission and fusion rely on to produce energy from mass combining small atoms into larger ones or splitting large ones into smaller ones midpoint is iron releases energy because the resulting atoms have less mass than the starting ones our current theories say that the big bang released a ton of energy matter only started to form from the energy when the universe cooled down energy spread out enough to allow matter to exist photons being energy have an equivalent mass based on this relationship
energy and mass are two faces of the same coin the coin s momentum is conserved maybe not the most accurate metaphor but it s hard to dumb something down and remain precise
i can try momentum p is p gmv where g is the relativistic gamma factor total energy e is e gmc divide the two and you get the ratio p e v c note that there s no more mass for photons v is c so p e c or p e c that s sort of an amazing result if something is moving close to the speed of light it s momentum is just energy divided by c and it doesn t matter what the thing is photons atoms planets anyways for a photon e h nu h is planck s constant nu is the frequency of the light so we just divide that energy by c to get the momentum of a photon h nu c
physicians are doctors these are physicists to be fair quite a lot of physicists are doctors as well
i ll let my mistake stand there while you are absolutely correct i also want to provide a rebuttal this is reddit they could be plumbers community college graduates and fine arts connoisseurs
most laypeople have no clue what p mv even means yes i took physics in high school but if you think people who aren t physicists are actually going to remember all those formulas you re living in an alternate universe
that s far out man
so simple but perfect answer
well then laypeople don t need to ask about the momentum of light something they will not need to encounter in real life if you want to learn the science you have to deal with the math it is not a film that someone can give you a min synopsis of science requires hard work and that hard work requires knowing math and tons of formulae it is not all youtube videos and i effing love science if a person is not familiar with p mv or wavelength or planck s constant there is nothing else that can be used explained the concept of momentum of light to him here is a video for you of feynman making the same point in more articulate terms https://youtu.be/36gt2zi8lva
to be fair if the person is asking how light can have momentum when it has no mass it stands to reason they have an understanding of the relationship between momentum and mass
bluetooth is a pretty old protocol going back to the mid 90s and wasn t really imagined for the extensive use it sees now in smart phones it s a case of we use it well beyond what it was designed for because it s the best we got because we haven t come up with something better it s still popular because it s a common standard it s cheap and requires little power which is important for phones bluetooth uses the 4ghz band like a lot of other devices and faces a lot of congestion working outside this and 5ghz would require a special license by the fcc making it impractical to make devices that operate outside these common frequencies bluetooth also transfers data much slower than wifi does in part because of it s low power consumption the solution to bluetooth is to either develop a newer and better wifi standard based on newer technology or get smartphone makers to put headphone jacks back into their phones duh
it s a protocol that was designed by committee yrs ago it s not suited for the things we try to use it for today and its approach to things like device handshaking is wildly outdated it needs to be replaced with some kind of new pan spec
short answer is bluetooth is designed to be simple and cheap cell phones were in their infancy when bluetooth was introduced to answer your questions directly apps having the ability to turn on bluetooth automatically would be decided by the phone s software the bluetooth chip just does what it s told you can call this short sighted but bluetooth wasn t designed with this in mind the internet was just in its infancy cell phones were a luxury item for the elites that still have pull out antennas the idea that everyone would have multiple master and multiple client devices that they would want to connect to each other just wasn t foreseen there s multiple versions of bluetooth going from release to release and there s sub releases within that they are mostly backwards compatible so a master devices that s bluetooth and a client device that s bluetooth should be able to work together however there is a big exception and that s when ble bluetooth low energy was introduced in release and upgraded in even though it has the bluetooth name ble is an entirely new protocol as its name suggest it uses less power especially during downtimes however since it s a new protocol you don t have backward compatibility most master devices like cell phones have the ble protocol and the bluetooth classic protocol available so they should be able to connect to anything but for client devices like airpods they will often just have ble this means that if you have a master devices that s release or earlier they won t be able to connect to ble devices if you want to figure out if your device is ble or not it s safe to assume it is if it has release or later on it and if it has a battery power option

when it comes to technology one person s feature is another person s bug for instance why is there no feature to prevent ever connecting to a bluetooth device automatically because if there was you would be asking why does my bluetooth device not connect automatically unless i explicitly tell it i want to connect to my device automatically the designers pick the functionality which most people want which is usually the most automatic and least nuanced way something could work and still be useful
not sure i understand this portion of the questions is there a good reason why users can t turn bluetooth off entirely and prevent the system or apps for turning it back on if you are talking about phones i have both android and iphone and am able to turn off bluetooth entirely on each though both systems like to use bluetooth as part of their location services along with wi fi and gps on android you ll need to go into the location settings to turn off using bluetooth otherwise it will look like it s off but it will still be on in the background on iphone apple uses bluetooth as part of their find my services so turning off bluetooth interferes with that because of this iphones will automatically turn bluetooth back on whenever you reboot the phone because they want to use your phone as part of their find my system so you have to turn bluetooth off again via the settings each restart
5ghz is unlicensed just like the 4ghz unlicensed doesn t mean unregulated however
thanks for the info but i m still unclear of why these issues haven t been resolved yet is the something in the protocol that prevents turning it fully off or making an option to not connect automatically to a certain device
thanks for actually answering my questions especially point sort of multiple protocols masquerading as i still wonder why phone makers don t give us more control over bluetooth
my wife has an iphone and it connects to carplay when our car is on and this turns bluetooth on you have to fully unpair it to stop this i have an android and when i plug my phone it to charge it connects to android auto and turns on bluetooth the only way to prevent this is to fully unpair the phone from the car this drives us mad because her iphone has priority but i m the driver when both of us are in the car her iphone randomly connects to carplay she turns her bluetooth off it randomly does it again etc it doesn t help that most infotainment systems in cars are badly designed so you can t find the right setting no matter where you look

most comments are focused on the personal injury risk but there is an environmental reason to limit your showers during a storm many older cities including much of nyc use a combined sewer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined_sewer) system which treats storm water and waste water together during major storms it exceeds capacity and overflows polluting the water nearby for this reason the nyc dept of environmental protection recommends you limit showers during a heavy storm https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/water/stormwater/stormwater-management-protecting-our-waterways-ms4.pdf) page of the pdf
getting struck by lightning while in the shower is one of those things that is theoretically possible but extremely unlikely see most houses have a drain pipe that runs straight to the roof where it vents this vent allows air into the drain to ensure a smooth flow of wastewater down without the vent the water would have to glug like a jug to flow the vent also serves a secondary purpose of letting out the noxious sewer gas instead of forcing it to seap into our homes the drain pipe is either plastic or metal either way your plumbing is interconnected it s not outside the realm of possibility that lightning could strike the vent travel down the pipes and through the water you re using to shower electrocuting you the possibility is heightened for older houses with metal pipes but again the possibility is so remote that it s extremely unlikely the biggest risk is the power going out and being stuck in a dark slippery bathroom while soaking wet also wasting what little water pressure you do have remaining edit til water pressure without power isn t an issue for everyone all my life i ve lived in places on well water it was just expected when the power went out you had enough water pressure for more toilet flushes almost everyone i know has a generator to deal with any outage longer than a few hours
my dad was electrocuted shocked in the shower during a thunderstorm once he was fine though so it must have mostly dissipated by the time it reached him it is definitely possible however unlikely they also have an old house with metal drain and vent pipes which i d assume makes it slightly more likely than a newer house that uses pvc edit their house uses a well which some people are saying also makes it more likely
removed

i ve never heard this attributed to the vent piping like so many people are mentioning for me it s always been that plumbing is or was i suppose copper and water is conductive and eventually that all connects to the ground lightning wants to get to the ground so it might try and go through the piping if it were to happen to hit your house and if this happens you end up with a voltage gradient throughout the plumbing between where the lightning hits and the connection to the ground and the currents are astronomical so the resistance of the pipe definitely matters as a result you get a bazillion volts where the lightning hits zero volts at your basement connection to the ground and like half a bazillion volts at your downstairs shower or kitchen sink yes i know zero isn t accurate there is still gonna be a substantial gradient in the ground around the strike but this is all theoretical and relative anyways so i just chose that as the reference
removed

i know this is just circumstantial but i saw lightning damage to a shower first hand it was years ago or so at my friends house that had copper pipes just like everything else in the area years ago the lightning hit their oak tree in their yard and jumped across to the house somehow it destroyed their cable box tv and speaker system they had in the living room the bathroom in the hall had flash damage around the showerhead and bits of the metal pipe connecting the showerhead was blown out we lived in an area that s known for it s high rate of lightning strikes i was always told in school about lightning safety and to not use the shower or corded phones during storms i followed those guidelines loosely at first after seeing the damage to my friend s house never used a shower in a lightning storm ever again
removed
there are three methods lightning might follow into your shower electrocuting you first it could strike on or near your house following the wiring in search of ground this is why computers can fry and light bulbs can pop unfortunately it s not uncommon for the ground wire from some outlets to wrap around your copper drain pipes since they re both conductive and head to the ground this means it is also possible the electricity could flow from say roof to wire to pipe to shower drain to your body second the course could be more direct lightning could strike an exposed pipe like the sewer gas vent on your roof and flow directly through the pipes in your home and to the shower drain third it can indirectly reach your pipes by striking ground nearby your house it s possible that lightning could follow sewer or septic pipes up into your house if that s the path of least resistance as it spreads through ground none of these are very likely you re probably more likely to just be directly struck while outside but even very rare events like this can occasionally happen
the claim never bathe or shower in a thunderstorm https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/health/15real.html) the odds of being harmed this way are extremely minute but it is not unheard of ron holle a former meteorologist with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration who tracks lightning injuries estimates that to people in the united states are shocked annually while bathing using faucets or handling appliances during storms there are a ton of myths about lightning he said but this is not one of them a database of these incidents is online at struckbylightning org http://struckbylightning.org/).
removed
i had lightning come through my window and hit the bathtub faucet while i was in the bathroom it certainly made a believer out of me i have large powerlines within feet of my window so i m pretty sure the lightning hit that and dissipated most of its energy before hitting my tub since there wasn t any physical damage only a cool story that no one would believe anyways
my parents two of the most risk averse human beings on the planet never let us shower during a thunderstorm because they said we could get struck by lightening when internet search engines became a thing i looked this up right away to show them how ridiculous they were being but it turned out they were right
in brazilian showers the water is in direct contact with electricty https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/8e8182/til_that_electric_showers_in_brazil_are_normally/). so we have a very good reason not to shower during a thunderstorm
i have been shocked while washing a butter knife while standing barefoot on a terrazzo floor during a heavy thunderstorm inside with closed windows and doors it hurt like hell but didn t do any damage shocked through the running water i would hate to imagine how that would feel in the shower
your plumbing has metal vents that go up through the roof it s unlikely but they could be struck by lightning and the electricity could travel through your plumbing it s not that much of a risk but it is a risk
when lightning strikes near your house it energizes the ground around the strike with upwards of million volts the voltage dissipates fairly quickly around the strike the reason to stand with your feet together is the differential in voltage just over a couple feet can be enough if you are standing with your feet apart to kill you should lightning strike close to you if you are in the shower a lightning strike close to your water line will bring that current directly to the shower since the copper pipes will conduct electricity without dissipating
when i was a kid lightning struck a tree about feet from our house traveled to the building and somehow blew up the master bathroom going in after the copper pipes had become knotted up and shot out of the walls they were lying on the ground amidst shattered tile and porcelain crazy violent scene and i ve never gone into the bathroom during a lightning storm since
back in early s my wife was on the landline phone and i do believe lightning struck near the house it jolted the phone out of my wife s hand and flung it across the room like a scene out of poltergeist
sharon stone was struck by lightning in her own kitchen a few years ago and she use not the first person this has happened to when lightning hits the ground the electricity doesn t instantly disappear it continues to disperse if you are touching a conductive surface when lightning hits then you may become part of the path of least residence
removed
there is a non zero chance of a lightning strike transferring electrical current into the plumbing you should nt shower bathe wash dishes or even touch metal facets or drains for this reason pvc pipes do not eliminate this risk as the electric current can travel through the water in the pipes and just needs any conductive point of entry to get there
growing up i always thought it was bullshit my parents finally admitted so saying that it was because if the power goes out they didn t want to deal with a kid all soaped up and slipping in the dark made sense our plumbing was almost entirely pvc with only metal fixtures and our shower tub was some sort of fiberglass chalked it up to the same logic as it s illegal to turn on the car s interior lights while driving at night
being wet changes the resistance of your skin making shocks more likely to do damage if you get hit by lightning wet or dry you re fucked anyway so it probably doesn t matter and if lightning is in your house the same i ve never worried about it maybe if you live in the middle of nowhere and your house is the only one standing somewhere lighning is striking
being wet and naked in a possible power outage is not ideal i d say the risk of slipping and injuring yourself right after an outage is a much more significant risk than getting electrocuted by lightning that said i would still shower without a worry during a thunderstorm unless the house is really really old
i used to own a house where one of the showers would shock you if you touched the showerhead while it was running and you were standing in the water never figured out where the current was coming from but i believe lightning would have no problem zapping you
mythbusters did an experiment with this very thing many years ago no idea where to watch it these days with the stupid amount of streaming services but i highly recommend it for more information it s episode son of a gun aired in while the results didn t confirm or bust the myth it did leave them as plausible while unlikely it is entirely possible for lightning to travel from the clouds to your house through your plumbing to you in the shower i don t know about you but a meh your probably fine is not good enough for me to risk getting electrocuted by a million volts of electricity when the risk can simplify be nullified by waiting until later that same episode also covered talking on the phone during a thunderstorm which they did confirm that lightning could travel through this was in though so not sure how well that part holds up to todays newer phones
the plumbing of a house is connected directly to the electrical ground of your system through a rod in the earth the shower head is actually the highest point of this system and it s where the lightning will find its way to the ground
damn i never heard of this and i grew up in a lightning alley in florida my house got hit with lightning plenty of times too
i once nearly got struck by lightning running through the back field of my old high school trying to get to shelter from the torrential rain it struck close enough to me that it completely knocked me flying and i landed on my ass and also i went completely deaf for about minutes one of the craziest close calls of my life it fucked me up for quite a while after when i thought about what couldve happened if it hit me directly
believe it or not clean and safe water is actually a poor conductor what s interesting is that the human body is one of the best conductors out there and lightning holds more than enough power to travel through things to get to you obviously the more contaminated the water your in the higher the chance of conductors being dissolved people with water softeners may need to be careful as your water is introduced to various levels of salt of course it s also important to think about what s in the shower or around your bathroom that conducts electricity lightning is unfathomably powerful and like i said earlier will go through anything to get to you source my chemistry knowledge a lecture from my teacher and some prior knowledge i m in no way an expert and you may want to take what i say with a little skepticism i m still learning all these things i hope my answer is helpful
what if you have pex
the copper water pipes in most houses are used as a ground for the gas pipes and maybe other stuff
possible yes likely no you re much more likely to die because you fell down some stairs than being struck by lightning in a shower do you avoid stairs
combined sewage shower and sinks go into waste pipes then to manholes flowing into the city drainage some cities have combined rain water sewage with the rest so what happens is it rains the water goes through the sewer into a u trap then flows into the rest of the sewage if every house was to dumb a bathtub full of water that access water of an already fully floaded system can backflow and cause terrible smells on the streets it is uncommon now to have combined sewage for homes or buildings in the last years but there are streets with combined sewage until now
i was an outdoor pool and lake lifeguard and a boating instructor for most of my 20s when we heard thunder we all joined watch counting the minute we saw lightning we cleared the water and any land that had that water near it our reasoning and training was that the electricity dissipated in a lightning strike can and does travel underground though shallowly and through the path of least resistance which is often the water table and the water connected to it at the surface which is more likely the closer that water is to the surface our home drain pipes are usually fairly shallowly buried while the pipes are a source the water is a much greater source of electrical shock electrocution risk https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/lightning/ my take on don t shower during a thunderstorm has less to do with the pipes and much more to do with the fact that the water in the pipes is highly conductive and that s what you are actively engaging with when you shower if you find yourself in a place where your water is suddenly conducting electricity you would be very sad and your feet standing in a puddle of water going down the drain which has a steady flow of water out to the outside where the maybe metal pipe has outside contact with electrified anything could definitely raise that risk
according to the cdc the us gets million lightning strikes each year resulting in about injuries and deaths per year with about one third of the injuries occurring indoors florida accounts for over a million of the lightning strikes and averages over deaths per year according to vaisala the greatest lightning density is in the congo and southeast asia
fun fact martha stewart has been struck by lightning separate times primarily in her kitchen through the plumbing https://people.com/food/martha-stewart-has-been-struck-by-lightning-3-times/
that s an incredibly unexpected and spooky stat the lightning is coming from inside the house
my fiance is terrified of lightning and i teased her for thinking it could go through windows then read about it going through windows kept that shit to myself
i have a memory of being a relatively little kid when lightning struck my cousin s trailer she and her mom and i were all in her bedroom the two of us kneeling on the wooden framed bed mom was in shoes and on a rug over wall to wall we felt it before it hit our hair started lifting up and things felt prickly and wrong and the last thing i remember seeing before the flash that would leave me blind for long long minutes afterward was my aunt s face as she realized something really bad was about to happen and how pretty her hair looked with little wisps dancing up like that then the world ended and started to come back in bits and pieces of sound and movement and when i can remember things clearly again we were all standing outside in the rain and my aunt looked like she was about to pick a fight with god and the storm she s a hoot i guess they were waiting to see if there was going to be an electrical fire or something because after a while we all went back inside and slept that night on the living room floor there was a scorch mark on the inside and outside of the outer wall of the trailer in that room and a weird smell that took years to go away completely anyway if you re in a thunderstorm and your hair starts standing on end move there are actually some freaky pictures of people immediately pre lighting strike out there but i m too lazy to find them
to be fair probably of people are indoors during lightning storms probably if we exclude cars still worth knowing
i d bet my fucking life that like at least of those injuries are from people inside trailers especially metal sided ones with poor electrical grounding
so you re telling me i shouldn t travel through my pipes around my house anymore
not to be that guy but most people go indoors during a lightning storm if of people are indoors during a lightning storm but only of strikes are on people indoors that would imply you re pretty damn safe inside
this needs to be pinned to the top
those guidelines seem ridiculous basically whenever there s a lightning storm you should sit still in the center of the room away from windows and doors and not touch anything that s in any way connected to electricity or plumbing who does that or are american houses just built in a special way
in chicago we plug basement drains during a thunderstorm and the most important tip of all hold number until the rain stops
would waiting a couple hours until the rain stops make that much of a difference or would you basically have to wait until the next day to prevent overflow
hi sorry i m a bit dense could you say more about the relationship between pollution of nearby waterways and showering in heavy rains my dumb brain isn t seeing the connection here s what it sounds like to me when it rains a lot the extra intake of water can cause sewers to overflow and spill into waterways that i get but how does what i do during after downstream of this make a difference i m not seeing how whether i shower during a storm or later will make a difference to whether the storm water will lead to overflow my apologies for being dense i m just not getting some connection here thanks edit wait sorry i think i get it when i shower i create additional waste water which adds to the problem is that the idea if so my bad for asking a dumb question
this should be the top answer ffs
shouldn t people shower more so that the water doesn t overflow
the worry isn t about the vent stack that i ve ever heard of anyway but houses sometimes use the copper water piping as an electrical grounding source
what sort of houses lose water pressure when power goes out is it just ones with wells
if the pipes are metal why wouldn t the lightning go through the pipes to reach ground going through a person in the shower is much more resistance than a metal pipe
my neighbour died from being struck by lightning during or after a shower he had the roof window open which people told me had something to do with it i grew up super scared of lightning because of that neighbour and thought being struck by lightning while showering was super common
well said good call out for the greater risk which is power going out if you re someone with impaired mobility due to disability or just being drunk high then i could totally see a case being made for not hopping in the shower during a storm but like you said much more to do with power outage than electrocution
it s more of a risk if you have copper supply lines and a cast iron tub
i followed you until travel down the pipes and through the water you re using to shower electrocuting you the shower head is connected to the water pipes not the drain vent pipe i suppose it s possible that maybe they touch somehow inside the wall behind the shower but also water isn t a good conductor so the lightning would likely follow the path to ground via the vent pipe not through the water and you to be fair i m sure it wouldn t be fun having your shower wall explode in your face but i don t see lightning following the path that includes droplets of water in air both poor conductors
does water pressure stop when the power goes out i thought that was all mechanical physics not electrical like the pressure from the water towers keeps the lines pressurized all the way to your faucets and whatnot i guess as a kid in the 90s i always remembered that even when the power went out the old land line phones and water still worked since they didn t require electricity from your house to function
a lightning strike close to the main water line if is made of metal can induce enough voltage in the pipes to possibly electrocute someone in the shower wet skin is a very good conductor you don t need a lot o induced voltage to create a dangerous current flow trough the body
upvoting for the clear visual and musicality of the phrase glug like a jug
i m going to piggy back on your comment the other major reason is that some larger cities have combined storm and sanitary sewer systems they prefer people to not use extra water during large storm events to help avoid the water in the sewer system when it s already heavily loaded from the extra storm water in chicago in particular it s to help keep the system from getting overwhelmed and to avoid having to dump untreated waste into the waterways the chicago river and lake michigan this is a reason you sometimes see standing water on streets in chicago because parts of the system are designed to retain water in the streets to slow the inflow into the sewer system
it s not outside the realm of possibility that lightning could strike the vent travel down the pipes and through the water you re using to shower electrocuting you this is not the problem at all regardless of whether you re showering or not if lightning strikes your home you re going to have a really bad day a lightning strike is like a bomb going off the shockwave and explosion are going to be a much bigger problem than the electrical current the concern is if lightning strikes nearby but doesn t actually hit the house the high voltage of the lightning strike creates a powerful magnetic field which will induce current on any conductive materials it passes through if that magnetic field passes through metal waterpipes in your home it can induce current in the water which might shock you while showering
wasting water pressure water doesn t work on electricity you can start a shower when the power is out just fine you ll run out of hot water because that s reliant on power but the water itself won t stop working
wait it runs to the roof you re saying the water drains upward how i m not trolling i m genuinely confused
my wife s uncle was in the shower during a storm got thrown through the shower curtain two years later got hit while repairing a power line wasn t even the only person in the family to get struck ish by lightning
just fyi but electrocution generally means a fatal electric shock while non fatal electric shocks are just electric shocks
i m an american and i showered during a thunderstorm this morning news to me but america is a big place maybe it s a regional thing
grew up in florida if i had to not shower everytime there was a thunderstorm or the risk of a thunderstorm i would be without a shower for months at time no thanks
american here grew up in the boston area my mom would always warn us about not showering during thunderstorms even at the age of now i feel like i m rolling the dice whenever i do even though i know there s virtually no added risk
it s popular enough that myth busters did an episode on it back during its run maybe it s an older thing that has died out over the last years
well for one thing due to geographic factors the us tends to get a high frequency of severe thunderstorms more than most other landmasses so it might be a little bit of a us thing more to the point there s official guidance on this from the likes of cdc and noaa https://www.weather.gov/media/owlie/lightning-noaa.pdf). is it safe to take a shower or bath during a thunderstorm no lightning can travel through plumbing it is best to avoid all water during a thunderstorm do not shower bathe wash dishes or wash your hands the risk of lightning travelling through plumbing might be less with plastic pipes than with metal pipes however it is best to avoid any contact with plumbing and running water during a lightning storm to reduce your risk of being struck https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/faq.html](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/faq.html) eta so yes technically you re not supposed to be showering during a thunderstorm
west coast american me neither the midwest and east have far more thunderstorms than we do
i m from the netherlands and i ve heard this before
literally never heard of this
it s always funny the things some people think are common knowledge and others have no idea about it
american here it just feels unsafe maybe not during a mild storm but during the kind of storm i unplug my computer for being in water with a metal drainpipe feels like tempting fate i think it s from the over cautious we saw lightning miles away everyone out of the pool safety rules i grew up with
canadian here grew up being told to never shower during a thunderstorm i do it as an adult but it s always in the back of my mind that perhaps i m taking a risk even though it makes no sense
i ve lived in america for years and never heard a single mention of it if it s an american thing it s definitely regional
def a common superstition in america
am canadian never heard of this superstition
i notice it s more of a hispanic thing here in texas kinda like storing cookware in the oven or bread tortillas in the microwave not sure why though i love when it storms bc my s o won t shower so i get all the hot water lmao even more advantageous if the in laws are in town
yes but as i recall what they tested was whether an electrical shock could theoretically travel through the shower water and kill the person in the shower that was confirmed i believe which i don t think is that surprising i don t think they had anything to say about the odds of that occurring during a storm though i will say apparently the cdc considers it enough of a danger to recommend not doing it i guess end of the day how often is it crucial that you shower now rather than after the storm has passed
as soon as i saw this post i was like i learned about this on myth busters
deleted
modern drain piping is typically plastic pretty sure most people talking about the vent piping are just making stuff up
zero is just a relative term anyway
when i was a kid my house was struck by lightning no one was in the bathroom or on the toilet at the time but the entire house was electrified for a few seconds and it was a terrifying experience i developed a phobia of thunderstorms for a couple of years afterwards
electricity does not travel up while peeing the mythbusters busted that myth but it wasnt about lightning matbe that makes a difference edit it has nothing to do with gravity but the fact that when we pee its not a perfect constant stream but many separeted droppets
technically as it moves through the sky it is hitting objects our atmosphere is filled with molecules like oxygen and nitrogen as well as gaseous water even on a clear day which reflect absorb and refract the beam bounce it around to put it in a really simple but not entirely accurate way so it does fizzle out as it travels in space where this atmosphere doesn t exist it could travel much further but even the most focused beams will expand and appear more dim the farther away you are similar to a far away star that while emitting a lot of powerful light appears very dim
light continues until it is absorbed some of it will be absorbed hitting molecules in the air some will get absorbed hitting molecules in space it s not a complete vacuum if you re pointing it at the moon then a good portion or all of the photons will be absorbed by it if you re aiming at clear section of sky then a good portion will continue traveling through space essentially for ever even though lasers tend to have small divergence how much they spread out they do spread out over time a typical laser pointer might be mw with a 2mm aperture width of laser beam departing the pointer and a divergence of mrad it deviates from a cylindrical beam by of a radian that 2mm beam will become a 385m wide beam by the time it reaches the moon discounting dispersion due to the atmosphere
neither but closer to the second one laser light is not perfectly concentrated and it turns out that the laws of physics do not allow it to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffraction-limited_system). it s concentrated enough that it stays the same width over typical human ranges but even the distance to the moon is enough to spread it out a lot for a typical hand laser it would be spread out over thousands of square miles by the time it got to the moon see this xkcd https://what-if.xkcd.com/13/) discussing essentially this exact question but aside from spreading out and occasionally being absorbed or scattered by the very few particles floating around in space and there are a fair number depending on the direction you shone your light it is very possible that it a big chunk of it would travel for billions of years before encountering anything
it will be absorbed slightly be the air but then travel through space and spread out more or less forever maybe some distant alien astronomer will be wondering why that star blipped slightly green though probably not
both actually it fizzles out precisely because it s hitting stuff as the laser propagates through the atmosphere if the beam was perfectly collimated then yes there s nothing internal to the laser that would cause the beam to spread out and diffuse but in reality the laser gets bent by air at different temperatures absorbed by water vapor particles in the atmosphere etc
when you shine a laser up into the sky the beam of light will keep going until it hits an object or is scattered by particles in the air the beam of light from a laser is very concentrated and can travel long distances without losing much of its brightness however as the beam travels through the air it can be scattered by particles such as dust or water droplets this can cause the beam to spread out and become less bright so while the beam of light from a laser will keep going until it hits an object it may eventually become too dim to see
can a laser beam bend because high gravity
that 2mm beam will become a 385m wide beam by the time it reaches the moon the moon s distance is typically given in k m and dividing that by gives a km beam a 9th of the diameter of the moon importantly zero divergence is impossible the minimum rate of divergence is roughly the wavelength of the light divided by the narrowest width of the beam then divide by pi so a typical nm green laser with a mm beam will diverge by at least or part in with the moon being km away that s a km spot on the moon
i ve always been concerned that some day i m going to be hit by a stray phaser blast that missed its target during a battle 1000s of light years away hopefully that beam has dispersed enough not to kill me
yes all light is affected by gravity this is beyond my knowledge but i don t think you would be able to visually see this unless you were near an enormous gravitational source like a black hole
this is what happens in a black hole
stars are large enough to have significant gravitational lensing even the sun has a very significant gravitational effect though the minimum focal point is about au about times the distance as neptune away from the sun you can be farther but not closer black holes are the best known example but the nearest known black holes require a large telescope to see galaxies are basically the same as black holes just not as well known to cause the lensing effect
you don t need to be at the focal point to notice the effect though einstein predicted that gravity would bend light and he gained lots of fame when during a total solar eclipse a star which was very close to the sun from our vantage point changed its apparent position exactly as much as his theory predicted
depends on the mall design some have large cargo elevators in the back areas to transfer products some have multi level parcades with access doors some have service doors on the side of the build so a crane can hoist products up
construction crews need to move stacks of drywall and other equipment that are easily just as heavy as a car whenever one of the retailers is redecorating they re not going to carry dozens of sheets and steel beams up the escalator there s always a way for heavy things to get up to the second floor usually there s some convenient geography that has at least parking lot at ground level for the upstairs put a big door there and stuff can just drive in and out failing that there s usually a service elevator tucked away somewhere this elevator is very not pretty but is probably the size of a car and is usually rated for a extra heavy capacity drive on elevator up drive off failing all that then someone got a crane and lifted it in there through some kind of roof access that s really expensive but i ve seen marketing folks spend money on stupider shit
usually these malls have 2nd floor parkade with doors that can be opened wide enough for a car if not then i have no idea
a place like a mall is going to have a giant freight elevator for hauling in pallets merchandise store fixtures and such they re big enough to fit a car
usually if a mall is multiple stories it s built into the side of a hill so that it can have upper and lower loading docks the car is a big singular item but all the merchandise in all of the stores has to be delivered too and they are not carrying that all up stairs or in elevators
basically the car will be in a crate with packaging there will be a vehicular route for a forklift vehicle or a car low loader to be pushed through the venue and a crane will lift it up so that with manual handling it can be cited placed in position in tv movies effects workers can easily using moulds make a fibre glass facsimile that looks like a real vehicle but weighs one twentieth i d use that and weights to put the vehicle somewhere truly inaccessible
for all the parts of a mall you see like the vast atriums and the fancy storefronts and the sprawling food courts there s also parts you don t see of interconnected corridors and storage spaces connecting the backsides of the stores to allow for storage and transportation of merchandise without having to get everything through the areas the customers go through during off hours there s also large freight elevators used to carry large amounts of merchandise around often these elevators can fit and lift cars and are used when bringing up vehicles on higher floors alternatively if there s a balcony on the higher floors the car may be lifted up there by a crane and driven inside at night but usually they just have elevators for this kind of stuff since malls are built with these things in mind
either a big cargo elevator that holds lots of weight or ya they have some sort of second story door and ramp they can drive in
i ve worked in casinos and malls that had tonne elevators so you could even lift a van of equipment or a small box truck
i m sure this describes some malls but usually i think tons of multi story malls exist without hills
i ve never seem a multi story mall with hills in the country i live in
it does make sense in old fashioned english so the tense being used here is the perfect tense it s a fairly normal way of forming the past tense in many languages you have a subject pronoun i your auxilliary verb have and your past participle become in modern english we only form the perfect using one auxilliary that being have i have eaten i have gone she has died many european languages french german and italian do it probably others too have two different auxiliary verbs have and be most of the time you would use have but in some instances you would use be the two main ones in most languages are to denote some kind of change either in location i am gone i am arrived i am come or in state i am died i am grown i am become english also used to have this so whereas nowadays you would say i have become this is a change of state so in older english you d write i am become same in german ich bin geworden and italian sono diventato a this is also why in silent night we have the line christ the saviour is come because it s an old fashioned song using old fashioned english a more modern translation would say christ the saviour has come
there s a couple of steps to this because there s some grammar to it some history to it and some translation going on this is what s called the perfect tense it describes an action that s already been completed and nowadays we use have to signify that tense i have finished breakfast or she has bought a new car but back in early modern english shakespeare s time it was totally acceptable to use am is be to convey the same meaning you see it in shakespeare s plays here and there the most well known writing from that time besides shakespeare s work itself is the king james bible the most well known english translation which was incredibly widely used for hundreds of years and the king james bible uses the perfect tense in the same way i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness so even though we don t speak that way any more that pattern is mostly ingrained in us from biblical phrases which lends them an air of gravitas now for the translation bit the bhagavad gita the sacred hindu scripture which the phrase comes from was first translated into english in the late s nearly years after the king james bible the am version of the perfect tense was fairly uncommon by then but the translators still wanted to give the text a classical feel so they copied the bible s phrasing and when the god krishna was showing off his power i am become death destroyer of worlds was the translation they went with oppenheimer used this version of the quote when he was discussing the atomic bomb and so that classical archaic phrasing is fairly stuck in the english speaking world now
it s is technically correct just very archaic of course robert oppenheimer said that in but he was quoting the bhagavad gita https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bhagavad_gita) which is many centuries older so he or the translator of whatever english edition he was quoting chose to translate it into archaic english
in middle english you had a quirk of grammar where you could replace the verb has with the verb be in front of certain words the famous example is from the bible he is risen where is replaces has nowadays we would just say he has risen this fell out of usage as we moved into modern english but many older poetic and religious texts retained some of these old middle english quirks like the bible and people would occasionally bring this usage back as a way of sounding deliberately older and regal and poetic the same way you might hear someone say shall we today so the grammar is correct its just a relic of grammar that hasn t been regularly used in years the quote itself comes from the hindu bhagavad gita which was translated into english in the late 1700s and deliberately used this archaic grammar to give it the book the same feel as other ancient religious texts like the bible the grammar today would just be i have become death its grammar wasn t updated in the same way that we don t really update the grammar of translations of other ancient religious texts if you read translations of the torah or the quran they are also filled with antiquated writing like this
as others have said it is an archaic construction of the present tense from early modern english https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2020/03/now-i-am-become-death.html), as oppenheimer was likely quoting the translation of bhagavad gita even though was well into the modern english period it was still fashionable to use older style constructions in literature just as it is today oppenheimer apparently knew the original sanskrit and that s how he originally quoted it during the atomic test only saying the official translated version in the media afterwards source toi https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/satyam-bruyat/bhagavad-gita-and-the-first-atomic-explosion/)\] edit wilkins s translation reads i am time the destroyer of mankind matured the cockburn translation https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.10209/page/79/mode/2up) reads i am death that causes the destruction of mankind already mature davies and later https://archive.org/details/hinduphilosophyb00daviuoft/page/124/mode/2up) reads lo i am old and world destroying time telang https://www.rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10154419998761675.pdf) reads i am death the destroyer of the worlds fully developed besant das http://www.vivekananda.net/pdfbooks/bhagavadgitawith00londiala.pdf) reads time am i laying desolate the world arnold https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388)'s poetic interpretation and apparently one of gandhi s inspirations reads thou seest me as time who kills time who brings all to doom the slayer time ancient of days come hither to consume thanks to u tuva_tourist below for alerting me to this i m looking more into the history of translations of the bg https://beezone.com/beezones-main-stack/the-early-history-of-translation-of-the-bhagavad-gita-1785-1945.html) to try to find who oppenheimer was actually reading but it may be that oppenheimer s archaic wording was entirely his own translation i was curious however what the actual sanskrit text was and whether this translation was faithful or if it was even trying to convey one of the many unusual sanskrit tenses and moods https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanskrit_verbs) that are absent in english the full line from the text https://bhagavadgita.io/chapter/11/verse/32/) is             klo smi loka khaya kit praviddho where asmi is i am the boring old first person present indicative nothing more now there are lots of alternate translations to death and destroyer according to some randos on the internet https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-original-meaning-of-the-quote-from-the-bhagavad-gita-now-i-am-become-death-the-destroyer-of-worlds), but overall the translation would be accurate even if it adds an archaic flourish even for its time the final link is for casual reference only i do not endorse that site s reliability and i recommend avoiding its use as much as possible and never contributing content to it
also it is a translation from the sanskrit baghave gita so there may be some translation issues
i m surprised no one yet mentioned french and other latin rooted languages there are a set of verbs that use to be as their auxiliary dr mrs vandertramp is a strategy to help french learners remember some verbs which use tre as an auxiliary verb they re basically all about movement or change in state and they all take to be instrad of to have for the past tense the very first one is devenir or to become this structure is a rememant of latin when it heavily influenced early modern english where we get works like chaucer and king james bible tl dr i am become is old timey like thou because it was codified frozen in early modern english texts it s based on latin grammar that used to be for certain auxiliary verbs of movement
it s not ungrammatical it s merely archaic the phrase am become as well as are become and is become all occur in the king james bible genesis and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil genesis and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great exodus the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation exodus thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power exodus we wot not what is become of him psalm i am become a stranger unto my brethren psalm we are become a reproach to our neighbours psalm the lord is my strength and song and is become my salvation psalm the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner matthew jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner corinthians though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal i ll bet it occurs in shakespeare also but i don t have an easy way to search all of shakespeare s works
the phrase i am become death the destroyer of worlds is famous because it comes from robert oppenheimer who led the development of the first atomic bomb however the phrasing is intentionally somewhat odd and poetic some key points i am become is actually grammatically correct english though archaic it means i have become oppenheimer was quoting from an ancient hindu text the bhagavad gita so the phrasing is reflecting that translating it literally may have lost that poetic effect death and destroyer of worlds are being used metaphorically here to refer to the immense destructive power of nuclear weapons the odd placement of death as a noun modifier is for emphasis and poetic effect it suggests how oppenheimer felt like he had created something as powerful as death itself there is a sense of irony and dread in the quote as if oppenheimer is astonished and horrified by what he has created the unusual phrasing highlights how he has crossed a line into something unimaginably terrible the quote has endured because it so vividly captures the sobering realization of creating a weapon of such immense civilization threatening power the poetic language packs a punch so in short the quote is intentionally obscure and eerie to highlight the profound significance and dread of that moment the awkward grammar focuses our attention and leaves a haunting impression does this help explain the meaning and intention behind the famous yet peculiar phrase let me know if you have any other questions
i m not sure if this will answer your question or not when they exploded the first nuclear device at alamogordo testing facility robert oppenheimer the lead scientists on the project said i am become death the destroyer of worlds his quote comes from a piece of hindu scripture the bhagavad gita that was the moment when all his work went from theoretical to actual it was no longer a concept it was a reality he had helped create the most powerful weapon known to man at that point that could kill people by the thousands that s a heavy burden for anyone to carry on their conscience
also in case of the now i am become death the destroyer of worlds quote death was personified into physical form by vishnu in order to convince arjuna to defend his people against friends turned enemies grammatically it is correct
two nights ago i watched a documentary on ryuichi sacamoto and this phrase i am become death was featured in a live performance of one of his works i literally had the same question but kept it to myself thank you op
i am become death the destroyer of worlds is a quote from the bhagavad vida which was not originally written in english so the translation is a bit wierd to us
the top answer is the right one but i ve always read it poetically like an ethereal force describing itself it has become death yet it was always meant to be death and has been since the it s creation and it always knew but didn t know at all
it is in fact grammatically correct both have and be stress the state that you are in now rather than the action so i have arrived emphasizes that you are no here rather than the act of arriving the difference lies in the time i have become death means that you are death and you became it some time ago the becoming doesn t matter it s just about the fact that you are death i am become death means that you became death in the moment you said it like before it stresses that you are death not that you re becoming
i read somewhere that time and death can be used as interchangeable words and a closer translation is now i am become time which isnt as badass but its more in line with what whats his arms was trying to show the prince that all things are that are going to happen will happen because god is all things and all things are in god so kill your cousin bro lmao
the real problem with the quote is the translation as death the true translation would be i am become time the destroyer of worlds
i am become death was oppenheimer s personal translation of the text it may not have the same meaning as intended by its authors i always wondered if oppenheimer took inspiration from christians bad conjugation e g he is risen
so it s a quote from the ancient sanskrit epic ramayana and i think that the translation into english is going to differ depending on which asian version is used to render it not unlike a bible it s has been transcribed into many different ways and reader interpretation is key we know it as a phrase in the west after oppenheimer quoted it on tv in an interview about the first atomic bomb test his interpretation of the words spoken by vishnu after taking his many armed form i am become death destroyer of worlds full quote depends on which version he read
that sentence is from the bhagavad gita to understand it you must understand the nonduality advaita vedanta context the phrase i am refers to the sense that i am that exists in every sentience being and it is being used as a noun here that phrase is the same as the last part in jesus famouse quote i am that i am
it s just a quote and quotes don t have to make sense in this case the phrase operates on the poetic level which just means it doesn t have to follow all accepted grammar rules oppenheimer quoted it from hindi scripture tho i believe so it is also an pretty ancient quote that wasn t originally english the reason they chose to translate it this way could have been to keep the same tone the original phrase had
i think the larger context is time since the phrase implies that the transition has already happened is happening and will happen
after witnessing the first successful nuclear explosion at the trinity test site in los alamos new mexico which took place on july oppenheimer remarked later that it brought to his mind words from the bhagavad gita now i am become death the destroyer of worlds chapter verse
the choice of am vs have isn t incorrect per se just old fashioned consider i am disappointed by you everyone etc vs i have disappointed you everyone etc i am eaten vs i have eaten am implies a present state of being while have implies having caused it in the past in most cases this makes no difference in i have become and generally modern english has trended toward using the past tense as if a thing happened vs implying a present state of being so we default to i have become if we really wanted to make the distinction we could just say i have made myself death or i have been made death the older use of a present state of being is something you ll notice among non native english speakers for example french speakers may say i am born instead of i was born or i leave you the book instead of i ve left you the book not incorrect just old fashioned
not become dead or just died have become the metaphysical state of death death capital d death existential ending
since the question s already been answered i just wanted to add on that this construction can be seen in modern german where sein to be is used in some places where modern english uses to have for example for changes of state or location thus i have woken up ich bin aufgewacht instead of ich habe
i just explain as it as it s archaic english doesn t make sense now but it did back in the day
alongsidr the explanation of old english it also is a translated phrase out of hindu myth and for heavens know what reasons it and buddhist writings were often translated with a very stiff literalist esoteric tilt to them so you have the scene of intimidating a prince into action by revealing great power use the phrase i am become death destroyer of worlds and then oppenheimer quotes it in his own talk about the manhattan project and the phrase effectively hits mainstream
also keep in mind that oppenheimer was quoting a passage from the bhagavad gita which is roughly years old and was translated to older style english from sanskrit the language is going to be a little archaic sounding
i am become death destroyer of worlds oppenheimer was quoting hindu scripture here iirc the background of that story is vishnu is trying to convince the prince that he must do his princely duty and fight a war in which he nust kill other men to convince him vishnu takes his monstrous form and says the quote if you translate that to oppenheimer s situation he s saying he wasn t entirely sure whether his contributions were ethically justified but then he saw vishnu s monstrous form god s wrath and might in the mushroom cloud which gave him a bittersweet feeling of acceptance he was interpreting it as a religious experience
which usage of the quote are you curious about https://www.wired.co.uk/article/manhattan-project-robert-oppenheimer
all of these top answers are wrong it s not a quirk of language it s intentional to describe a contradictory state of being shiva both is and is the becoming total contradictions of terms destruction
other people explained the general structure but there is another interesting detail in latin based languages where this past tense comes from you can either use to have or to be as the auxillary verb which one you use depends on the kind of action you are describing and it varies by language for example in italian you would use to have anytime you are describing an action that was taken on something for example if you ate something you would say i have ate dinner if you are talking about movement like coming or going somewhere you would use to be for example i am come or i am gone this also applies to changes in state such as to become something hence i am become death modern english typically only uses to have as the auxillary verb for this grammar which is why i have become death sounds a bit better to you than i am become death
thank you this was exactly what i was looking for and was extremely informative and enlightening
i just noticed the use of to be as an auxiliary recently altho i ve been reading it for ages i think it adds a subtle continuous sense to the present perfect so subtle that we really don t need it and it passed out of current usage
christ the saviour is come the only lyric i ve ever seen is born not come which means it s not an example of this the lyrics for silent night are actually in historical dramatic present tense when we describe events in the past as if we re narrating them live
to add to this be as an auxiliary verb is true of old fashioned english but not really old english it became popular during what is known as the early modern english period roughly the late 1400s to the mid 1600s another famous use of be as an auxiliary verb is we are met on a great battlefield of that war in lincoln s gettysburg address where met means assembled or gathered not the modern sense of having met another party
just a small note the perfect is not a past tense but actually a present tense because it s focus is on the present outcome of a past event the pluperfect is the past tense
i would assume that s the same in he is risen vs he has risen
interesting i have heard and used i am returned and know that to be correct but never new why thanks
damn thank you as not op i just learned a crazy amount of things in such a small amount of words
and in french too je suis devenu some may remember their dr and mrs vandertramp verbs
comes from sanskrit originally though yeah baghavad gita i m sure it s similar in that language too just strange to see it explained with old english
today on english is actually three languages stacked on top of each other wearing a trenchcoat
lol i always thought it was christ the savior is born
christ the saviour is come always followed by snickering in the back rows
after reading this carefully i understand too the nuance between i have become and i am it makes a lot of sense
i am gone i am arrived i am come i am died i am grown i am become why do all of them use past tense verb but become uses present tense shouldn t it be i am became
this guy linguistics
deleted
giggity
the irony christ the saviour is come the irony being that no come is alleged to have been involved in his conception
i ve no idea if you re correct but you explained it nicely well done
you must be pretty smart thank you it s lovely to meet knowledgeable people on reddit
i read the first part of your comment and was like yup i have become death is translated to french exactly how you explain it here then i read on and saw you go into that the evolution of language and how different ones are historically related is cool another fun historical fact about old english is that our nouns used to all be gendered in the way other languages still are se and seo were to old english what le and la are to french or el and la are to spanish modern english is just the
this is a fantastic explanation thank you
another one joy to the world the lord is come
thank you
extremely enlightening i had always just assumed that religious text intrinsically lends itself to uncommon usages something about the nature of the material ruminations on the divine etc
what an absolutely epic answer holy shit thank you so much for taking the time to write that dude
thank you so much for showing me that english also at least at one point had two aux verbs
i learned a lot today thank you
this is a great explanation but there s one part i don t understand was it a transition from using be to using have or in the past were both used at the same time if so what was the difference between them what would the difference have been between he has come vs he is come or i am become vs i have become
this is great it also just sounds fucking badass
at easter some churches use the old fashioned he is risen
but wasn t the text that phrase comes from not english
this is one of those posts that makes so many things click i ve recently learned italian and the fact that english used to have the same auxiliary verb choice makes so much sense
it would be middle english and not old english you are thinking of i think
theres a npr show called says you this would be perfect on the example using silent night was chef s kiss
you can add dutch to your list of languages using both have and be as auxiliary verbs
good explanation he s just saying omg i m death now it s funny how realising context makes meanings subtly change he said it in archaic language so it sounded more mysterious and deep this is in part why people like using the king james bible which was meant to be in vernacular english it makes us think that thou is formal when it s actually the familier version of you even modern translations often copy it s cadence and sentence structure for famous bits even if it means the grammar is odd song lyrics are like this too how many times have you listened to a classic song and heard a lyric and been like what a profound metaphor and you read an interview and it s like yes that was the name of my dad s dog
you have described that in a way i have never understood but made it understandable thank you
it s weird that i am gone and i am done have stuck around i m sure there are more but those are the only two i can think of that don t sound odd
this is also why in silent night we have the line christ the saviour is come because it s an old fashioned song using old fashioned english a more modern translation would say christ the saviour has come solution always use s to hide the rest of the word
dude you nailed this it s crazy cause you would use ich bin geworden somewhat frequently in german never thought that that is i am become
this is excellent thanks can you do the same for all your base are belongs to us
so they copied the bible s phrasing and when the god krishna was showing off his power i am become death destroyer of worlds was the translation they went with my favorite part about this fact is the controversy of whether the translation should be death or time krishna is saying that the men will die regardless of his intervention so time is probably a more accurate translation oppenheimer s quote really leans more into the i am a great and terrible power vibe
thank you for such a beautiful answer
great answer for some reason i assumed it was meant to be read as i am become death destroyer of worlds ie krishna s was calling themself become death which i thus assumed meant like i am simulatenously currently death becoming death like a continual cycle process which i assumed made more sense in the original language context hindu theology i feel almost disappointed it just means i m death now
apparently it was his own translation
the predominance of the king james bible seems to have supported a cultural sense that antiquated grammar feels reverent and holy and you ll sometimes see people sprinkle modern prayers with thee and thy modern translations are often a lot clearer to understand though i admit they do lose that sense of gravitas i m reminded of the line from a man for all seasons when thomas more himself a devout christian refers to latin as not holy just old
the bagavad gita translator is being deliberately archaic explanation makes a lot of sense but i m sure many translations of it exist does anyone know which one oppenheimer was quoting and was oppenheimer a big b g fan or did he go digging through bartlett s book of quotations the night before the bomb test looking for a cool one
is he is risen really past tense it seems to say in matthew that jesus has undergone a state transition he used to be dead but now he is risen similar when you move town your friends in the place you left might say that you are gone of course you also have gone somewhere else but right now in the present you are gone when you move back you are no longer gone but you still had gone at some point in the past
in context with christianity he is risen makes poetic sense because of the feeling of everlasting salvation the word is takes the word is conveys that it wasn t in the past like the word has would risen can almost be viewed as an adjective in context
wilkins translation of https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.195577/page/n3/mode/2up) is i am time the destroyer of mankind the arnold translation of https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2388/2388-h/2388-h.htm) reads krishna thou seest me as time who kills time who brings all to doom the slayer time ancient of days come hither to consume i actually can t find a translation like that is he misquoting mistranlating or otherwise deliberately maltranslating cause in the text krishna isn t declaring that he s just now attained death destroyer of worlds superpowers he s talking to this guy arjunda i think who is of acting as a kind of reader insert prophet guy i think krishna then goes on to say he s there to wipe out everyone but the guy who asked who he is and then he goes on to tell the reader aight get your army together and go conquer in war was that what oppenheimer was actually intending to communicate cause oh damn edit edits
iirc some translation use world destroying time in place of death essentially saying that time is the destroyer of worlds
are you a sanskrit scholar i m really interested how you managed to get all those translations together

if you look around you ll find many of this old idioms in modern english that don t make sense but we understand them because we still use them all of a sudden for instance first one i could think of
i teach esl and periodically have to resort to answering why is it spelled said this way with someone decided that a long long time ago
if you want to see more examples of it in action look up the maison d tre in french grammar as they have a bunch of verbs that conjugate this tense like this basically anything that involves moving or a change of state ascending descending being born dying becoming arriving etc etc etc i m pretty sure this is also where we get the present tense adjective grammar structure of i am _ _ _ _ _ed which is just a pronoun the verb to be and then an adjective in the form of a past participle explaining things like someone is is a skill i absolutely do not have but i hope this extra info added some context and made sense edit you ll have to translate each individual verb in the maison d etre into english and then think of what the past participle of it is but since it s french they all have a exact translation
one tidbit i recall from studying italian is that i have forgotten x is translated as ho dimenticato x but if you want to say it without any object i have forgotten becomes mi sono dimenticato ho is the first person singular of avere ie i have and sono the first person singular of essere ie i am mi is a reflexive personal pronoun to me dimenticato is the participle from dimenticare to forget
can also be used to great effect with cavemen http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/)
i think the actual translation is i am become world ending time as hinduism has a different core concept and telling of time many times it s shortened to death to simplify for western tellings
also interesting because when i hear i have become death destroyer of worlds it is a lot more impactful and awful to me i am become death sounds so pedantic and formal i don t think about the meaning as much
i m not of the olde english school i think he s being emotional in the clip of this he seems so deeply distraught as if first its as if he means to say i am now death but before he says the last part he pauses seems to think i ve become death as if to say i wasn t always this way he struggles and pauses considering his declaration that is in essence i ve become death it s not an easy thing to say so forgive the mans split sentences one small step for man was to be one small step for a man people get choked up

probably to prevent insanity https://gizmodo.com/our-brains-deliberately-make-us-forget-things-to-preve-1543846375) memory is stored in the pattern of connections between neurons think of your brain like a map of a city and a memory isn t an address so much as the route you take to get to the address as you walk along that path you build the memory each place along the way is some aspect of the memory like you have a friend named bob and when you think of a memory of bob you walk down bob street and you went to a movie with bob so you also go down the movie street and it was a marvel movie so you also go down several marvel character streets multiple memories may go down parts of the same path but the unique series of connections between neurons is what makes that memory unique as you build the memory the first time you don t grow new neurons but your neurons build new connections between them the more often you revisit a memory the stronger those connections get if you don t revisit a memory often the connection gets weaker until it goes away and you lose the memory and your brain doesn t really know where it s going when you begin the journey the chemical signals propagate out among all the connections but their strength dies off with weak connections so the chemical signal ends up following the strongest connections along that path in the city of your mind the chemical signal wanders along wherever it can and doesn t wander where it can t and as it wanders the memory is remembered you might imagine that if you have a lot of memories too many memories the paths become too convoluted and it s a lot easier for the chemical signal end up following the wrong path it gets harder and harder to control the signal and limit it to only the one unique path that is the one memory you want and that can lead to insanity your brain gets too confused trying to keep everything organized trying to remember what s important vs what isn t important trying to remember only one thing at a time trying to separate pieces of memory so they don t blend and blur together also maintaining the connections between neurons takes energy and resources for the vast majority of life on earth resources were hard to get it just wasn t worth the calories to maintain memories and the connections for memories that weren t important if it didn t help you survive by avoiding danger getting food finding a mate etc it wasn t worth keeping
there s a difference between short term and long term memory think of it like a a water filter the good ones start by filtering out big particles then eventually they move down to super fine particles your memory starts with your senses everything you see hear feel in the moment moves to your perception your senses give so much information that we filter out what s needed in the moment that bird flying off in the distance is much less important than say keeping your car in the lane or other cars that bird is long gone even through regular perception we just ignore half of what our senses tell us we take the useful bits and throw the rest away this stuff was never recorded your short term memory works in the same way we re more focused on what s going on in the here and now so only keep a record of the important things now think of making a record of things overnight long term memory again filters all this input and keeps a record of the really important things your long term memory is going to keep a record of the really important things everything else gone granted some things might even hang on for a bit but they can disappear after a longer while if they had no reason to recall for so long
just like computers our brains have a limited capacity to store and process information so they have to prioritize what information to keep and what to forget memories can also become distorted or forgotten over time due to various factors like age stress or injury
our brains are very powerful but they are not perfect they can store a lot of information but not everything imagine your brain is like a bookshelf it can hold a lot of books but eventually there s just not enough space for all of them when you experience something new your brain decides whether or not to keep that information based on its importance and relevance to you some memories are considered more important than others and are stored more easily other memories may not seem as important and may be forgotten over time additionally our brains can sometimes mix up or distort memories especially over long periods of time this means that even memories we think we remember very clearly may not be completely accurate while there are some rare cases of people with total recall most of us simply can t remember everything no matter how hard we try it s just the way our brains are designed
what about people with photographic memories or another condition where they remember little details in events years after it happened
it s very difficult to identify a person without seeing their eyes unless they have an unusual facial feature like say mike tyson s tattoo or you are very familiar with them pixelating blurring the face is more effective but putting a bar over the eyes is easy and still works almost as well
when trying to identify a person you generally look at zones eyes and ears nose and cheeks and mouth and chin preferably you d cover up several zones as many people have noses for example that are not very common if you only saw a chin there d be a quite low chance of you identifying a person but eyes including color tilt width distance between is more distinct
the eyes are the most distinguishing feature of a person s face eyes have a unique shape and color that can vary greatly from person to person making them highly distinguishable they are also surrounded by eyebrows and eyelashes that further enhance their uniqueness
by covering the eyes they can cover the least amount of face but still provide anonymity if you cover the mouth and ears you could still tell who the person is even more face area was removed
where are you seeing this in my experience the entire face is usually blurred for exactly that reason
but interestingly if everything but the eyes are covered e g balaclava the person also can t be identified easily
i dont have a specific answer for that the thought kinda just came to me a lot of the time the face is completely blurred but ive definitely seen just the eyes censored in like cctv video or something like that
and that s why it s easy for superman to pass off as clark kent by just wearing glasses
a gyroscope is a device that can spin very fast and keep its direction even when you move it around it is like a spinning top that does not fall over when you tilt it or turn it you can think of a gyroscope as a bicycle wheel that is attached to a handle when you spin the wheel and hold the handle you can feel the wheel resist your movement it wants to stay pointing in the same direction this is because the wheel has angular momentum which is a measure of how fast and how much it is spinning the faster and heavier the wheel is the more angular momentum it has angular momentum makes the gyroscope act like a compass if you mount the gyroscope on a stand that lets it move freely it will keep pointing in the same direction even if you rotate the stand this is useful for navigation and orientation for example airplanes and ships use gyroscopes to find their direction and keep their balance gyroscopes are also used in many other devices such as smartphones cameras video games robots and satellites they can sense motion and rotation and help control or stabilize these devices
an object in motion wants to stay in motion when you throw a ball it s gonna keep moving until it hits something like someone s hand a wall or the ground it s not going to suddenly randomly move in a different direction and when it hits something and slows down or stops it ll exert some force on it it might hurt your hand to catch a fast moving ball or the ball might shatter a window when you spin a wheel the same principle applies however you would notice that part of the wheel is moving forward part of it backwards part of it to the left and part of it to the right so it s moving in multiple directions at the same time when you twist the wheel around you are changing how it is moving just like the ball example above changing the movement of an object will exert a force on whatever is causing that change so you will feel some resistance to you twisting the spinning wheel around this is the force it is exerting if it were mounted in some sort of frame it would push exert force on the frame if the frame were being rotated this force would be trying to push the frame back to its original orientation if you have sensors set up to measure these forces you can tell how much the spinning wheel s orientation has changed based on how strong and in what directions the forces are being applied that s the basic principle of a gyroscope using a spinning wheel object s resistance to changes in direction orientation to measure how the direction orientation is changing
there are a few different things going on here there is the lookback time which is how long the light has been traveling to reach us there is the comoving distance which is the distance that the object we are seeing is from us right now due to expansion these numbers don t match because like you said for light to take billion years to get here it would have to be emitted from closer than billion lightyears because of the expansion of the universe but by the time the light gets here the object is now more than billion lightyears away from us so the light from a star with a comoving distance of billion lightyears would have a lookback time less than billion light and light with a lookback time of billion years would come from an object with a comoving distance greater than billion lightyears the actual calculations of the lookback time and comoving distance which is almost always the number reported as the distance in cosmology require a complex model of how the entire universe evolves over time and knowledge of how redshifted the light is when it gets to us
we can calculate the expansion of the universe so we can say how far away something was when it released the light as well as how far away it is now and yes both of those can be billions of light years the universe isn t expanding that fast too so it doesn t actually change most distances measured
light is really that old there is may distance to an object in space let s look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gn-z11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gn-z11) that in was one of the farthest away when it was discovered i use it because i know of what is listed the present proper distance is billion light years that is how far it is from us right now the light travel distance is billion light years that is how far the light has traveled to reach is and if you remove the light from it you get how long time ago it was emitted billion years the last number is how far away it was then the light that was emitted that is usually not listening it is in the notes and why i pick this object that distance is billion light years the expansion of the universe does not make the light younger it was emitted billion years ago and during its travel to us the distance in between expanded so the initial distance of billion light years got longer and the result was the travel distance was billion light years compare it to if you walk on a conveyor belt that we tend to call a moving walkway or something similar for human usage start meters from the start and try to walk back against its motion if you walk faster it moves you can reach the star but you will have walked longer than meters a buddy that did says still on it will have been moving farther away by it without walking so you have the distance to your body that is like the resent proper distance the distance you walks is the light travel distance the distance at the start is the distance at the time the light was emitted it is not a perfect analog for the expansion of the universe the space between objects grows faster if they are farther apart it is not independent of distance like the conveyor belt the distance to the buddy will be equal to your walking distance you could modify it with multiple moving walkways when each will move a bit faster than the previous to get a distance difference but it does illustrate the different measurements with something a bit like the expansion that is simple to grasp
from whose perspective from a particular pun intended point of view yes and no the photon could have been emitted billions of years ago and traveled across space to reach your eyes from your perspective from the photon s perspective an invalid reference frame no time has passed since space has zero length in its direction of travel so it traveled instantly from where it was born to where it died a photon has no sense of space or time travel from a wave perspective the electric and magnetic fields have been oscillating along the path of the wave for billions of year but there isn t a real thing there since the photon is merely fluctuation in the electromagnetic field that said real particles are just fluctuations in different fields according to qm
not sure about something i reckon what we see when we look at the sky is a composition of photographs of wayyyyy back in time when the stars were younger and also expansion oblige when those stars were in a different location the vast majority of them closer okay but can we really say the photons coming from them are of a certain age photons travelling at the speed of light massless at rest okay don t they live in a state of perpetual present as if for them the entire universe was going to whizz past them while no time has passed for them unless they re caught in an interaction let s think of the lucky ones who travel long distances
there are three distances to discuss in this kind of situation how far the star is from us now how far the light we are seeing now has traveled how far the star was when it first emitted that light those numbers are pretty much never the same thing though the closer it is to us the closer they probably are another thing to keep in mind about the expansion of the universe whatever is causing it to occur is very weak compared to the other forces the strong and weak nuclear force which are responsible for holding molecules and the like together dramatically stronger thats why the particles in our bodies aren t being torn apart as the universe expands yet at least they might someday in the far distant future gravity also stronger much much stronger the earth isn t changing distance relative to the sun as a result of universal expansion for example neither is anything in our own galaxy in fact neither is anything in the local cluster of galaxies the andromeda galaxy for example is moving closer to the milky way so much so that in about billion years the two will collide and merge you have to start looking at distant galaxies before you begin to notice the affect of galactic expansion so any stars closer than say million light years and probably further not quite sure how far the expansion starts to kick in aren t going to be affected by that they will be affected by their motion relative to the earth but not necessarily galactic expansion
so our bodies aren t perfect about burning fat they generally also burn muscle at the same time and if we have no more fat reserves left our bodies will continue to burn our muscle tissue causing us to get weaker as we start converting the tissues that our body uses to survive into energy to keep our heart pumping eventually this would lead to death
catabolysis your body resorts to protein for energy it is really inefficient producing something like an eighth the energy of ketosis which is burning fat for energy muscle tissue degrades first as your body attempts to preserve things necessary for survival eventually your organ which are smooth muscle begin to breakdown as well this is eventually fatal
in short your body starts converting muscle protein into energy after a certain point weeks of no food your muscles including your heart has atrophied in this case been used as energy to the point that you re too weak to sustain yourself protein is essential for cell production and when the protein is gone so is cell production no one dies purely from starving what they die from is typically infection due to the body not having enough energy to fight off infections viruses or heart failure due to said muscle atrophy
so imagine your body is like a piggy bank when you eat food your body gets energy and stores the extra energy in your piggy bank this piggy bank is called your fat stores when you are in a calorie deficit it means that you are not eating enough food to give your body the energy it needs to function properly now if you have fat stores your body can use the energy in those stores to keep working properly even if you re not eating as much but if you don t have any fat stores your body won t have any extra energy to use which can make you feel weak tired and unhealthy so it s important to make sure you eat enough food to give your body the energy it needs and if you re trying to lose weight it s important to do it in a healthy way by eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly
scaling things up and down is very easy to work with and think about it s just zooming in and out but if you can only zoom in and out then you don t have too much to work with luckily we can zoom different directions in different ways so i could vertically zoom in by a factor of and horizontally zoom in by a factor of this is kinda like a mixed zoom this would be the transformation x y 10x 3y eigen stuff is just figuring out mixed zooms to have a mixed zoom you need the directions that you re zooming in the eigenvectors and the factors by which you re zooming the eigenvalues important theorems in math tell us that most nice spacial transformations are actually mixed zooms and eigenvector and eigenvalue methods are how to find these directions and scale factors this overall simplifies work because we don t have to deal with crazy high dimensional transformations and can just think about different zooms in different directions
suppose i take a rubber sheet and stretch it to twice its length vertically and squeeze it so it s half its length horizontally are there any shapes i can draw on the sheet that would keep the same shape and orientation when i do this and just get bigger or smaller yes vertical and horizontal lines will keep their shape when stretched plus a point at the center but that s boring for other kinds of stretches the lines that keep their shape may be diagonals but there s usually two for a rubber sheet the directions of constant shape stretches are the eigenvectors the amount of stretch in those directions are the eigenvalues this is useful because once we know how points on these lines behave when stretching we can figure out what happens to any other point pretty easily in my simple horizontal vertical example we just have to figure out how far any point is from the center horizontally and vertically and double or halve that for other kinds of stretches we might have to measure diagonal distances but nobody cares about rubber sheets but in many fields we often deal with physical and mathematical systems that transform quantities the same way this rubber sheet does one combination of quantities gets twice as big while another combination gets half as big eigenvectors are useful for finding simple solutions to complicated stretching problems like this whether the solutions involve variables equivalent to stretching a d rubber sheet stretching a d rubber block or millions and for extra credit what about rotations suppose i turn my rubber sheet instead of stretching it are there any shapes that keep their shape and orientation surprisingly the answer is yes if we re willing to consider eigenvectors and eigenvalues with imaginary numbers in them now that probably sounds like mathematical nonsense but if you play video games your computer graphics card is solving this sort of mathematical nonsense a trillion times a second
lots of good explanations here glad i stumbled on this page
imagine you have a big magical toy box with lots of different toys inside each toy has a special power or ability like being able to jump really high or change colors now let s say you have a special toy in your box that can transform any other toy into a new toy with a different power this special toy is like an operator in math and the toys it transforms are like vectors when the operator transforms a vector it can give it a new power or ability just like the special toy in your toy box now let s say that there are certain vectors that when transformed by the operator end up becoming multiples of themselves these special vectors are called eigenvectors and the multiples that they become are called eigenvalues think of it like this if you have a toy car that can transform into a toy plane and you transform it using the special toy in your toy box it might become a toy plane that is twice as big as the original car in this case the car is the eigenvector and the factor of two is the eigenvalue so in math eigenvectors and eigenvalues are special properties of operators and vectors that can help us understand how they behave and change they re like special toys and powers that can help us solve problems and do cool things
i m still looking for a good eli5 but this article at least makes it a bit more understandable https://wiki.pathmind.com/eigenvector](https://wiki.pathmind.com/eigenvector) x200b so out of all the vectors affected by a matrix blowing through one space which one is the eigenvector it s the one that that changes length but not direction that is the eigenvector is already pointing in the same direction that the matrix is pushing all vectors toward an eigenvector is like a weathervane an eigenvane as it were
well the premise itself is pretty simple an eigenvector is like one side of an equation and the eigenvalue is some value that makes the overall equation true when it is multiplied by the other side of course this usually involve matrices which makes it a bit more complicated but that is the general idea this theroem has many implications depending on your field but that stuff is much more than eli5
i found this https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/eigenvalue.html) explanation to be very understandable the examples with real numbers really help
eigen finally understand this
wow i ve done a degree in control systems and i may have just figured out what they are lmao guess it says something about how exams don t test understanding
holy fuck that s good
that s awesome so in statistics why are they so important in econometrics we spend a lot of time trying to figure out whether a time series has a unit root which is an eigenvalue equal to what s the significance of it being equal to
this is a very nice example i m trying to teach some colleagues the uses of pca and i ll try incorporating this
zooms gotcha i hope you teach math
there s a movie from the 90s called the red violin in which someone expresses a desire to take the violin apart and run some eigenvalues what would eigenvalues tell you about the acoustic performance of a violin
i took differential equations and didn t understand shit but this helped
i can t add anything to this fine explanation but just wanted to say i ve been waiting for this thread for about years
that s not all because they can be imaginary too even in real number matrices and they always come in pairs that s because real eigenvalues will define scaling and imaginary eigenvalues define rotations rotations require two axes so always in pair
brilliant
this is a great explanation for a specific use case but doesn t handle the more abstracted form of it we can also think of primary colors as eigenvectors every color is made up of different quantities eigenvalues of the primary colors this is the same concept we use in molecular orbital theory
nobody cares about rubber sheets cries in solid mechanics
the second answer is always the best answer on eli5
3blue1brown has a good visual explanation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues on his youtube channel check it out however it requires a basic understanding of linear algebra determinants linear transformations bases
that s a pretty good explanation but thinking about linear transformations as a wind blowing risks confusing them with affine transformations stretch and slide rather than pure stretch affine transformations don t have eigenvectors
r cleandadjokes
eigen not believe you made that joke
one of the funniest comments i have read in a while
upvote admirable line
i have determined this to be funny
ansatz believe it
hey i have worked with fourier transforms for a good part of my career and this video provided a visual representation that gave a deep intuitive understanding that was amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spunpyf58by
electrical engineering degree career in control systems here i m in the same boat
engineering and ya
i know nothing about econometrics but an eigenvalue of is special in that it means there is no zooming in that direction
you re learning about time series i assume one of the first things you learn about is the idea of a time series being stationary or non stationary if it has a unit root it is not stationary which is generally a bad thing another bad thing about the presence of a unit root is that when you introduce shock it has a permanent impact on the mean if the process were stationary that shock would decay but it does not in unit root processes when a process isn t stationary it s variance depends on t and diverges to infinity generally the presence of a unit root is a bad thing which is why it s important to learn how to discover it
for both stats and econ it could be lots of different this but taking a shot in the dark stats imagine that you have a bunch of data points in 2d that visually look like a line with some variation you might want to figure out which one it is and also throw away the variation turns out you can do that by making a giant matrix whose columns are your data points and multiplying it by its transpose that gives you a 2by2 matrix it will have two eigenvalues with the bigger one corresponding to the direction of the line and the smaller one corresponding to the direction of the noise if your data points are in say dimensional space this sort of trick lets you figure out if they live along a line and which one so you can figure out what parameters matter and which ones are just noise econ you might have a bunch of parameters for your economy that change over time unless there are very complicated interactions between the parameters you can model the evolution of the economy over time by a matrix if you re looking for stable states of the economy like nash was you want a combination of parameters that doesn t change over time in other words the matrix doesn t change it so it s an eigenvector with eigenvalue
imagine that you have some transformation t this is the thing that takes you from time t to time t that you apply to a vector v which represents the state at any one time eigenvectors are vectors for which tv kv where k is some constant usually this constant is written with a lambda but that s not on my keyboard so whatever but we can go a step further if we apply our time series transformation t again we have t tv t kv k tv because this is a linear transformation k v and so on in general if v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue k t n v k n v in other words for that eigenvector v the transformation t acts like an exponential factor attached to v and when you raise something to a power it matters a lot whether it s bigger or smaller than for example n blows up to infinity while n shrinks down to zero and for the very special value n stays stable forever the only value for which this is true in this rare case t doesn t cause v to shrink to nothing or run off to infinity it just stays right where it is
you re just thinking about eigenbases vector space bases made up from eigenvectors of a chosen linear transformation but the entire purpose of an eigenbasis comes down to mixed scaling everything regardless of how abstract comes down to this simple idea if you have a linear transformation then it will naturally decompose the vector space into eigenvectors on which the linear transformation acts individually by scaling for instance if you have an electron orbiting a nucleus then the linear transformation in question is the hamiltonian operator technically the time evolution operator but it s closely related the time evolution of an arbitrary orbit will be complicated but the time evolution of an eigenstate an eigenvector for the hamiltonian will be quite simple basically a complex scaling and we can decompose the vector space of all electron states so that we can view the hamiltonian as acting as a mixed complex scaling even in hyper abstract number theory the so called langlands program one of the main goals is to take hyper abstract operators or collections of operators and decompose hyper abstract space into smaller spaces where these operators act like mixed scalings in a way you can do probably all of linear algebra and much more through this framework
the best thing about explaining eigenvalues with the rubber sheet analogy is that it s not just an analogy
i also rank it as pretty funny
can t go wrong with grant sanderson and 3b1b
was anyone talking about fourier transforms
that is interesting
can they be complex
yes i understand all of that i m just confused how mathematically a unit root causes all of that
that guy is a goddamn genius
didn t even have to click to know what it was
no i was just pointing out that in a similar way sometimes we take courses or even get a degrees in a area and are not taught an intuitive understanding of the subject as noted in the gp of this thread does that bother you if so just unread
this is an extremely good overview of eigenvalues and vectors https://youtu.be/pfdu9ovae-g
i just wanted to say that it s the first example on wikipedia but the english wikipedia is just lots of text and math in the german one there s a nice example right at the start https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eigenwerte_und_eigenvektoren the text below says that the red vector on the mona lisa didn t scale so it s an eigenvector
yes without getting into the weeds too much that typically implies some sort of rotation behavior
yes in physics this has the advantage that you can further split up what the eigenvalues represent if you linearize a wave function and extract the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix the imaginary part could represent the frequency and the real part the damping constant it s more or less arbitrary what we define them to be from a geometrical point of view this does not affect their interpretation though it merely extends the above description with the scale factors and the directions by another dimension
link https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/608174/why-exactly-is-a-unit-root-a-problem) the answer is complicated so i won t explain here but the second answer in this link is a good one
3blue1brown videos are one the best out there he takes the difficult topics and explains them in a way that anyone with basic education can grasp
thanks i always thought that eigen was just german
does that start to get into or touch on quaternions or is that a completely separate thing
ha yep
not really complex numbers arise naturally in situations where you wouldn t normally expect to see them because you need them to factor polynomials with real coefficients even when you go to polynomials with complex coefficients complex numbers still suffice to factor them by contrast quaternions are more detached they have very useful applications and interesting properties but if you re working with real numbers they don t arise naturally the way complex numbers do this difference between them also shows up in how they were first discovered invented complex numbers were adopted reluctantly because they kept showing up in intermediate steps when 16th century mathematicians were trying to factor cubics quaternions were invented by a single man who specifically set out to generalize the complex numbers to higher dimensions
they share a few tendons the small muscles that are responsible for subtle movements they don t exactly share s tendon but the tendons are very closely connected by flexing one tendon the others tend to join
this is an individual thing i can do this just fine and to the same extent as the others no i have never done anything to purposely work this and make it function independently this way though you can if you want there are exercises for that it s just like the splits or other physical things some can do and others can t it s a mix of predetermined ability and exercise to expand it if you want to do it i believe you can improve it s independent movement by making the vulcan sign and moving your rig finger back and forth from middle to pinky attempt to do it without moving your other fingers repeat daily it s all about isolating specific muscle group functions i had a speech impediment as a kid i actually had like six of them lol that was because i couldn t isolate specific muscle groups when moving my tongue and mouth to make sounds while it has improved to the point that i haven t had a speech impediment for years there are certain movements i just never learned no matter how much they tried to teach me it happens we have so many little individual muscles and movements in our body that it s no surprise we don t learn them all
the tendons that control the ring finger are connected to the same muscle group as the tendons that control the middle finger making it difficult to move the ring finger independently in contrast the pinky and index fingers have their own muscle groups which allows for more independent movement however by practice and training some people can improve their ability to move the ring finger on its own
i am a guitar and bass player and i can move all of my fingers independently you have to invest in training your hand to do it
sometimes reality forgets to draw five fingers and quickly adds them on before anyone can see but they drew them too close to the other fingers and now they don t move right
you can absolutely learn to do it though i play the piano a bit and don t have any trouble at all lifting that finger without moving the others i can t lift it as high as the others but can still lift it just fine
tend to join hehe
tendon isn t muscle tendons connect muscle to bone and can be quite long this allows among other things to keep extremities slender for example the muscles that bend and unbend fingers are actually located inside palms while tendons in fingers connect these muscles to various points on finger bones
this is the correct answer
same reason people without hands can use their feet like hands
oh yeah definitely practice makes perfect i play guitar and can move them completely separate on my right hand and mostly separate on my left it just takes some neural fine tuning practice
same piano and guitar and my other fingers hardly twitch just a learning to use finer muscles thing overtime anyone can get more control eg our feet use to be highly dexterous but without practice they became awkward flat rigid feet
i m a piano teacher and very bad at this can barely lift the fourth finger even after many hours of training i guess there s a genetic aspect to it
can you do it with your palm flat on the table though
i can be a clumsy bugger and sometimes appear to use my hands like feet
i don t know if you re left handed but i can move my ring finger similarly to you and also play guitar for me i found it was a little odd that it was easier with my right hand since as a righty the left hand is the fretting hand if guitar playing really is the reason i can do this then i guess finger picking is more effective than fretting i can t imagine using a pick would enable the ability at all
how do you play then if you rest your fingers on keys and push them all in can you lift and press down with each of your fingers i can t imagine playing the piano without being able to do that
would not surprise me in the least if there were a genetic aspect although i think most but clearly not all pianists can do it my wife is an actually good pianist but can t make a fist her pinkies on both sides stick out so not all hands are the same
yup that s how i tested it
i thinks it s the picking that trained the right hand i m also a righty but there s also relatively few chords that use the pinky by the time you reach a level in guitar where you use those complicated chords your picking hand has likely gotten a hours of practice already
i m talking about the natural hand position and then lifting one finger seperately from that which is the tricky part obviously i can choose what fingers i actually use to play the keys but compared to others i definitely have less flexibility which makes the more difficult repertoire hard to get down perfectly
because plants are accustomed to the natural circadian rhythm plants just like all living things are not designed to run like a robot
in addition to the answers on here about resting and restoration periods there is another reason there is a group of plants known as c4 plants that do photosynthesis a bit differently these plants tend to grow in hot dry climates and so they have an adaptation to help them survive they only do part of photosynthesis during the day enough to store carbon until later that night then during the night they open their pores called stomata in order to finish the second half of their photosynthesis the portion that releases oxygen gas by keeping their stomata closed during the day these plants minime the amount of water their lose into the air on the hot dry days of the climates they grow in
plants are like little factories that make their own food using sunlight water and air this process is called photosynthesis and it happens mostly in the leaves of the plants when plants make food they also make oxygen that we breathe but plants don t just need food to grow and stay healthy they also need rest resting means that plants stop making food for a while and use the energy they stored in their roots or stems resting also helps plants to move the nutrients they made to other parts of the plant like the flowers or fruits resting also helps plants to grow new roots and leaves plants usually rest at night when there is no sunlight but sometimes plants need more rest than just one night for example some plants rest during winter when it is too cold or dry for them to grow this is called dormancy and it helps plants to survive harsh conditions
plants need to rest after photosynthesis because they get tired just like we do after exercising during the resting period they use the energy they produced to grow and repair tissues produce new cells and conserve water
plants don t have hearts their circulatory system operates on two principles capillary action water likes to climb up narrow tubes it s a surface tension thing and evaporation water evaporating from the leaves creates suction that draws water up from the roots if the lights are on then you ve got suction and it s harder for the plant to get water back down from its leaves with nutrients
look at your poop if it came out looking the same way it went in you didn t digest it unless you ate poop then i suggest seeing a doctor
digestion is actually very painful and uncomfortable your brain doesn t let you feel it if you want to know your food is digesting track your intake and output
digestion doesn t feel like anything unless something is wrong because you are always digesting it s part of your baseline experience
are you pooping with any sort of regularity if not i would seek medical attention
what does digestion feel like r totallynotrobots containment breach
you can t really feel your food being digested but you can look for signs like your tummy making gurgling sounds or burping
what if i ate a baby ruth not so smart now are ya
if you occasionally poop out identifiable food is that bad asking for a friend
if you re eating poop you should also go see a doctor
digestion is actually very painful and uncomfortable your brain doesn t let you feel it if a tree falls and nobody hears it does it make a sound doesn t being painful imply and require being felt
this is true food hurts would avoid if possible
i would love to hear more about that about how is digestion painfull but we can t feel it
if i saw peanuts i d be concerned
i don t think so corn comes to mind
yes
yes and no your nose is always in your vision of the time if you have a normal sized nose your eyes are seeing your nose you don t notice it most of the time because your brain is very good at ignoring things if it feels like that s optimal your food digesting is probably the same way there is acid melting food touching your insides i m sure that s not great and if the same process were to happen in your hands you wouldn t be thrilled your brain probably finds some way to disable the nerves when the digestion is doing the normal expected thing
the intestines are innervated via the splanchnic nerves that s why you can feel gas pains for example digestion is not painful i went to med school and now teach med school i ve never heard that said
than you ll have to use google i know the basics thanks to an eating disorder there s a bunch of interesting things to brains does to keep life tolerable tho
that seems standard tomato and mushroom sometimes cilantro probably totally healthy and normal right
vegetables tend to do that bc of the type of fibre they re made from especially if you eat something like cabbage or lettuce healthy poop is supposed to be a smooth snake doesn t take a ton of effort to push out and is solid see this link https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320938#bristol-stool-chart) for a chart of healthy poop i found this randomly on reddit and it helped me come to the conclusion that i actually have ibs and i started taking probiotics and it vastly improved my quality of life lol
woke up today not knowing i d be looking at a poop chart but i m intrigued now
for something to go faster than light it would have to go backwards in time space and time are linked according to our best model for the universe the faster something moves the slower time passes for it relative to everything else when we take very accurate watches and send one to space to orbit the earth for a while it will be behind the one left back on earth time stops entirely for something traveling the speed of light light takes seconds to travel from the earth to the moon from our standpoint but from the light s standpoint the trip happened in an instant any faster than that and it ll move backwards in time it may be possible to go backwards in time for all we know but that seems highly unlikely causality starts to break down if that were allowed to happen what if i said if i see someone on the moon light a green light i ll send a faster than light signal for him to light a red one while the moon light operator has instructions to keep it green unless instructed to turn it red if the message gets there faster than light then it goes backwards in time to before i actually send it meaning when i look at the moon it ll already have a red light but if it has a red light already i d never send the instruction to turn it red meaning it should have stayed green which is it maybe such an event would create it s own fork into two separate universes one for each outcome it seems much more likely that it just can t happen it could very well be that our best model for the universe is missing some key piece of information that allows faster than light travel i don t think it s fair to say the possibility is ruled out completely someone would have to put forth a new model of the universe that fits all the observations better though since our current model has withstood a lot of tests for a while now that doesn t seem likely
i want you to forget about speed for a minute lets talk about time look at your clock or a watch its moving forward you are traveling through time pretty cool huh well this weird thing happens with time it turns out time is not just kinda weird its super weird you and i see time the same way things are happening at the same speed and such but when you start moving faster ok we re back to speed a little time starts moving slower there is a relationship between speed and time more speed less time yeah but you re gonna say no i live here time doesn t move slower and you d be mostly right this isn t noticeable to us because for it to start to be really noticeable you need to be going a lot faster like on a spaceship now the faster you travel the slower time goes think of it like a line or curve on a graph the faster you go the line edges slower in time it gets slower and slower and you keep going but what happens when you go so fast that time goes to on our graph you go so fast you hit a point where you aren t traveling through time anymore fucking weird right i m telling you that there is some point where something can go so fast that time stops for it yes thats is what is happening that speed turns out is the speed of light you hit a wall you can t go any faster since there is no where left in the time graph to go you re at it ends there this is how you should think of it from an easy standpoint the better explanations are far more complex and far more accurate and in fact there are multiple versions such as one from particle physics that is quite accurate but explained completely differently but this is a good way to conceive one method of seeing it
the proper term for this is the speed of causality the c in e mc the speed of causality is the fastest speed at which any energy can propagate and is a fundamental property of the universe meaning there is no simpler explanation it just so happens that light propagates at the speed of causality which is why we call it the speed of light
if you draw a straight line on a sphere there is some maximum length this line can be why is that it is just the geometry we choose the speed of light is the same thing but less intuitive it is the fastest speed possible due to the geometry of our universe if we had a different geometry this speed could be different it is also worth noting that anything without mass travels at c in a vacuum so this isnt something only special about light as for could there be something faster no not really you would have to invalidate so much evidenced backed theory to make that work and there is no reason to believe that it is at all possible in our universe
as i understand it it s not so much that light is the fastest thing but that it travels instantaneously to itself it s all about special relativity the faster something moves in relation to you the slower time goes for that object in relation to your time so if you watch something is moving at 9c c is the speed of light for an hour it will only be half an hour for that object if you watch it go 99c for an hour it will only experience minute if you watch it go 999c it will only experience second and so on these numbers are wrong btw and just used to make an easy example the math is not that easy to do so i skipped it the closer you get to light speed the less time you experience while travelling the rest of the universe sees you take centuries to travel across the galaxy at 99999c but you only age a week so what happens when you hit 1c well you can t because you have rest mass which is a whole other thing but if you did you wouldn t experience any time at all you would be at your destination immediately to you and since velocity is simple distance time if you travel any distance but take no time to do that your velocity is infinite and since you can t go faster than infinitely fast and to you infinitely fast looks like light speed to everyone else that s the limit
from my understanding it s not that the speed of light is the fastest speed it s the only speed you can go when you have no mass but are still a particle in this universe so other particles that we have observed that are massless also go the speed of light it s why it s known as the universal constant also it is the fastest speed at which objects can have influence over one another gravity s effects are also felt at the universal constant which is why if the sun were to suddenly disappear we wouldn t know about it for minutes ish because light and gravity would still be felt in that time takes light ish minutes to get from the sun to earth as for the the second part we have observations from all sorts of experiments over the centuries those observations have helped us craft a set of equations that have been incredibly reliable in making predictions on how objects behave in the universe here on earth but also out in the universe that we can observe with telescopes and whatnot a lot of these equations have also helped up in getting up into space and helped use send probes and satellites there is still a possibility that our understand is off so there could be something out there that go faster than the universal constant we just haven t seen or heard of anything like that to approach that speed you need increasingly more and more velocity to the point where you need a an infinite amount if you have mass and as i said before massless objects and effects go at the universal constant it s been pretty reliably documented
photon is the particle of light it has no mass nothing can travel faster than something that has no mass within space
the term lightspeed confused me for ages but it s not really to do with light there s a maximum speed to anything in the universe light in a vacuum moves at that speed the fastest speed anything can move this is because it has no mass so no inertia
the speed of light is in reality the speed at which information can be transmitted in our universe this includes everything also gravity light travels at the maximum speed at which information can be transmitted same as gravity and other things that is the reason why nothing can be faster than light but it also means that light isn t the only fastest thing in the universe we only call it the speed of light because historically that was the first thing people researched
when we ve only scratched the surface of space exploration and understanding physicists make some basic assumptions about the universe all science has to start from assumptions your axioms these are really basic assumptions like the universe is rotationally symmetric that the behavior of an experiment doesn t change depending on the angle you observe it from the universe is translationally symmetric that the behavior of an experiment don t change depending where the experiment is performed all other things being equal and the universe is time symmetric that the behavior of an experiment don t change depending when the experiment is performed all other things being equal these are explicitly assumptions we can t prove them without observing every point in the universe at every point in time from every angle but they seem pretty reasonable and they ve held so far in our exploration and most importantly we can t really do physics as we know it if they re incorrect so we ve made them part of our axioms and all of physics is built with these assumptions that s important because it means as we observe the universe through telescopes and radio receivers we can assume that things work fundamentally the same over there as they do here even though over there is a different place and a different time since it takes time for the light to reach us to observe this lets us do experiments by making a prediction here and then observing how things are going over there where the conditions are right so far of those experiments and observations have matched very closely to what our standard models in physics predict this gives us a lot of confidence that our models are accurate we know they re not perfect we know our models have some gaps and inconsistencies like how general relativity and quantum mechanics disagree a bit on gravity but we re confident that they re not fundamentally incorrect now of course we can t know that our models are fundamentally incorrect until we make observations that contadict them for example in the late 1800s we noticed among other things that the orbit of mercury was slightly different than our models at the time predicted that led us to doubt the accuracy of newtonian physics and ultimately to adopt the model of general relativity similarly in the early 1800s we noticed again among other things that light didn t always behave as our models predicted that led us over the next couple hundred years to develop and refine the model of quantum mechanics if we find contradicting observations physics will have to adopt new models maybe we will find some exotic to us type of matter that violates our assumptions about spacetime and the shed of light most likely to start with we d try to incorporate it by tweaking our existing models they ve done a very good job so far so we d like to keep as much of them as we can but if we can t make it fit like the orbit of mercury and the behavior of light couldn t fit in the newtonian model we ll have to come up with a new model that fits everything we ve observed so far plus the new stuff
it s all math first experiments and confirmation later it s also the same for everything else we think we know about the universe despite not actually seeing it happen just like dimensions or how we have always thought blackholes existed but never saw one until recently basically smart people played with the extremest version of the speed equation which involved mass and concluded that to achieve this result speed something must not gain mass no matter what we then found out that the lightest thing in the universe can t be weighed at all which are photons since they can t gain weight because they are mass less and essentially are born already running away from the source it s only mathematically logical that they move at the most extreme speed since photons are light particles this speed is then labeled the speed of light ps i welcome any corrections as this is just the result of me asking similar questions way back in my internet curious days
on the other hand if we could build a ship that traveled at light speed then once that ship moved at light speed the trip would be instantaneous from the passengers point of view which brings up the question since everything in the universe moves how much time dilation are we currently experiencing as opposed to sitting still in relation to the rest of the universe
the only reason we call the speed of light the speed of light is that light is the first thing we discovered that moves at that speed in truth the speed of light should really be called the speed of causality because as far as we call tell when anything happens in our universe the fastest the universe will let the effects of that thing propagate is mph that s the speed of light so truly no matter what occurs anywhere the effects of that event move no faster than the speed of causality light moves at this speed so does gravity even information moves at the speed of causality and the reason we believe nothing can move faster than this is that contrary to intuitive human understanding the nature of motion seems to be part of the makeup of the universe itself it appears that beyond that speed there really isn t such a thing as motion anymore saying go faster than light is a nonsensical statement like saying be more round than a sphere or be less than nonexistent we can say the words but the apparent reality behind them just don t make sense if you actually understand what you re saying assuming that einstein was right and the universe is constructed the way every single test of relativity ever indicates that it is if we were to discover speeds beyond the speed of light they won t be the same kind of moving that we currently consider motion to be and nothing made of the matter or energy we know about now will have anything to do with it but in short light is the fastest thing in the universe because fast has an upper limit based on how our universe works and light just so happens to be one of the few things that moves at that upper limit
there is a common misconception that the speed of light is an important limit in the universe and that confuses people into wondering why nothing can be faster than light what makes light so special that it dictates the speeds of the universe surely there must be something faster no well this is the wrong way to think about it but you should not be blamed in thinking this way the way that science is presented and taught kind of led you this way the truth is that it is the other way around light wants to go as fast as it can light will always go as quickly as it can in any volume medium that it is travelling in the maximum speed that light can go in a vacuum is not up to light it is up to the universe the max speed is actually the maximum speed of causality otherwise known as the maximum speed that information can move in the universe and since light can carry information the speed of causality holds it up nothing that we have found as of yet can move faster than the speed of causality there is a thought that maybe entangled particles might allow us to move information faster than causality but this is purely theoretical and has not been proven to actually work
light isn t the fastest thing it is one of the fastest things it moves at the speed that things go when nothing s slowing them down at all the real name for this speed is celerity is it possible that something could somehow go faster yes i suppose but it really doesn t seem like it we don t need to know what the composition of dirt on some distant planet is to figure out it s almost certainly made of baryonic matter the same elements that almost everything else we see is made of the rules of our universe seem pretty consistent about this sort of thing we re always happy to be surprised but it s not looking likely
it isn t ruled out but current theories cannot be based on unkowns or hypotheticals and so far light is by far the fastest thing we can observe also there is good proof of the speed of causality which is the same as the speed of light c there is a lot of math and many years of experiments that re enforce the idea that c is the speed limit of our universe
i understand why light and causality are the fastest things but what determines their precise speed limits why is c set at the number it is as opposed to any other number as the maximum speed in the universe
imagine yourself moving faster then light what would you see what would you expect to see
space can expand faster than light particles with no mass can travel at the speed of light in a vacuum slower if not a vacuum and any particles with mass can not reach the speed of light if there was something in the standard model of physics that disobeyed that we d know about it if there are any other areas does not obey this speed restriction e g dark matter then it is also likely it would never have any application in the everyday matter that we can interact with
i m a layman with zero experience and extremely limited understanding isn t quantum computing faster than light in that the computations are faster than the speed of light am i understanding that correctly
so it turns out that everything is moving at the same speed all the time that s because if you add how fast something is moving in space and how fast something is moving in time you get the same result for everything for that to work fast things in space have to move slower in time and it turns out they do we don t notice this in our daily life because in the grand scheme of things everything in our lives moves at about the same speed so the time difference doesn t get noticed people who work with satellites notice it though and they have to correct for it constantly it s a big deal at grand scales and unnoticeable at small scales but back to light it turns out the light is going so fast in space speed that the only way for that equation to balance is if the time speed for light was and we have confirmed experimentally that it is that means that to go faster than light one of two things has to happen our equation which has worked over and over again for everything must be broken or somehow you can move so slowly in time speed that you go negative moving backwards in time the first one is pretty unlikely because it s worked so well experimentally for so many different things the second one well there s no eli5 version i m afraid it s very complicated and probably not possible at macro scales but it s an area of ongoing research
i think you re getting a lot of answers that focus on the light is the fastest part and not on the scratched the surface of space exploration and understanding part they re basically going into detail on the relativity model and what it means for light speed etc but why do we believe relativity is accurate the reason we believe our current relativity model with such certainty is that we ve tested it incredibly thoroughly we ve done not only an enormous number of tests we ve done them across all kinds of contexts and circumstances with different kinds of equipment by different teams by different nations including nations figuratively or even literally at war with each other further we ve tested not just one kind of prediction of the model but every prediction the model can make the model of light speed is deeply linked with our model for gravity space time etc and every test that we keep doing on every prediction from all those different parts of the model keeps confirming the model we have not done much physical exploration of space we don t have probes much less people on a lot of different planets but we can see an enormous amount of space billions of light years of it and we ve been studying all that data coming in for a long time yes there are lots of things to discover but we ve already seen a huge amount of stuff and we have yet to find anything that has overturned or even given any evidence against relativity
anything with mass requires energy to accelerate the faster you go the more you actually get a diminishing return on the energy you put in this effect is tiny at first but as you approach the speed of light it gets so big that for example a particle accelerator has to put in gobs of energy just to get an elementary particle to go from the speed of light to the speed of light and the energy required to get to would be infinitely large and thus impossible
the expansion of the universe means there are parts of the universe that are moving apart from eachother faster than light
actually it s not like there can not be a thing faster than light this is an additional assumption on top of an einstein general relativity theory that theory that so far we have no evidence to think it s not correct does put a limit of a speed that any object with a mass can reach in simplification the faster an object goes the more energy it s need to accelerate it further and the light speed is a limit where you will need infinite energy to achieve that speed but the value of the limit 300k m s is not coming from the theory theory only says there is some limit actual value comes from real world measurements for the same reason objects that don t have a mass like photons that are the light particles have to travel with this speed all the time but interesting fact now the theory didn t exclude objects with speed greater than a limit light speed we just don t observe such things in our world so we make an additional assumption for the einstein theory that those objects faster than light doesn t exist and if those objects exist they have to obey the same limit but from opposite side i mean in that case slowing down the object will require energy and slowing it to a speed of light will require infinite energy and also very important things to know is if we do not exclude those objects their existence will have huge impact on how we understand world and modern physic because of the space time nature and how it behaves those objects have to break the causation law basically it will be looked like those objects travel back in time in a sense so for them the result comes first and the cause of that result comes later in reverse order compared to all objects that travel with a lower speed of light if you interested in a topic i recommend to watch andrzej dragan series about general relativity https://www.youtube.com/@relatvty/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@relatvty/playlists) it s pretty eli5 for a such difficult subject like general relativity
it s helpful to flip this on its head nothing can go faster than light because light travels at the fastest possible speed for any object because it has no mass it weighs nothing the heavier something is the slower it has to travel light travels at the maximum possible speed as it weighs nothing the heavier something is the more energy it needs to speed it up that s why it s easy to throw a tennis ball but harder to push a car the amount of energy that it takes to move something heavy goes up exponentially meaning that to push something that has weight as fast as light would take more energy than can exist in the universe we think photons have no mass so they travel as fast as anything can go anything that weighs something by definition cannot go that fast as there s nothing that could push it any faster
to move forward you need to move mass to move mass you need energy the faster you travel the more energy is needed to do so light has no mass and therefore doesn t require energy to move itself the speed in which it travels is the speed in which a massless object can move through space it is the only known thing to have zero mass gluon excluded so nothing can move faster than light because nothing has negative mass to move as fast as light you d need to create more energy to do so an infinite amount which is impossible
it s not particles with mass take energy to accelerate massless particles don t massless particles will move at a certain speed and light is one of them but not the only particles with mass can t move above that speed since they would require infinite energy to accelerate to it something that moved faster than than the speed at which massless things move would need to have negative mass as far as we know that doesn t exist
what will really blow your mind is that everything travels at the speed of light in space time some just more in time and others more in space
the speed of light is the speed of causality before it is the speed of light it is the fastest that any two things can interact with each other before it is the speed of light light travels that fast because it has no mass so it has no choice but to travel at the maximum possible speed for anything to travel faster than light it would need more than infinite energy and it would then travel backwards in time
it s not just about light light is just a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic em spectrum that we can see this includes radio waves all the way up to x rays and gamma rays the speed of light c for short is actually the speed of causality the speed of cause and effect if something does not have mass and is not currently interacting with something it moves at c that s not just the maximum speed that it can travel that is the speed that it does travel why how the how is described by insanely complex mathematics i think the why has to do with the anthropic principle without a maximum speed limit the history of the universe would go from start to finish instantaneously nothing can be observed in the universe if we don t have time to observe it
with our current understanding of the universe everything is constantly moving at the speed of light in the four dimensional space time this is why if something is moving fast it starts to experience time differently it trades some of the movement in the direction of time to move in space when an object travels at the speed of light time stops if you traveled at the speed of light to another planet you would just teleport there from your perspective no time will pass even if others would see you traveling at light speed
i can move faster than light if i wanted to i just don t wanna so that s why they don t know that i can yet i m just built like that
the best explanation i ever saw for the speed of light came from pbs spacetime https://youtu.be/msvuces8ydo). the important thing is that the speed of light has nothing to do with light itself the speed of light is the speed of causality the speed of cause and effect light just moves at that speed because it has no mass to slow it down
i thought that the nothing faster than light rule was derived from maxwell s equations not einstein s light is electro magnetic radiation that behaves as both a particle and a wave the electrical charge of the light generates a magnetic field and then that magnetic field generates an electrical charge which then generates a magnetic field and so on the light wave travels through space via this chicken and egg self propagation process it is the near instantaneous relationship between the charge and the magnetic field creating collapsing each other that sets the ultimate speed limit on things traveling through space as nothing with mass can happen faster than that
i don t think the answer is nothing can travel faster than light but rather whatever that can travel across space the fastest happens to be light if something can travel faster than whatever that claims to travel the fastest then it ll create all sorts of problems and paradoxes we re just supposing that nothing can go faster than the speed of light because everything would make sense that way we don t know that this is true but we re just supposing that it is and all we re saying is ehh it seems to be true because it makes sense
the speed of photons is the maximum rate of transfer of information photons can take longer to travel over one of two apparently equal distances but only because they are bouncing off a great many things along the way high refractive index information can travel over a distance apparently faster than the speed of light by quantum entanglement but photons still travel at the same maximum rate of transfer of information it s just that the apparent distance between the two entangled particles isn t being travelled through e g like a wormhole that is the proven concept that the universe is not local the universe isn t real either but that s a different matter objects and outcomes are influenced by observation
pbs spacetime has a good video on how light is really the speed of casaulity and explains https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msvuces8ydo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msvuces8ydo)
light is the fastest thing in the universe because it is made up of massless particles called photons that can move at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics
its going as fast as the fabric of the universe will allow anything to move its not that light is special its just something that illustrates the upper limit of speed in our universe if the speed limit were faster light would move faster
what if i said if i see someone on the moon light a green light i ll send a faster than light signal for him to light a red one while the moon light operator has instructions to keep it green unless instructed to turn it red if the message gets there faster than light then it goes backwards in time to before i actually send it meaning when i look at the moon it ll already have a red light but if it has a red light already i d never send the instruction to turn it red meaning it should have stayed green which is it maybe such an event would create it s own fork into two separate universes one for each outcome it seems much more likely that it just can t happen wow that helped me wrap my head around it great example
can you explain the green red light example again event would be i see a green light after seconds send signal for red and see the red seconds later why would the signal go back in time
great explanation but i want to add one detail what you said is true for massive particles ie particles with mass massless particles also move at the speed of light but so far we ve only seen the photon and the gluon and theorized more the weyl fermion and graviton
one sort of thought experiment i used to ponder was imagining that humans were always blind never knowing that light even existed if all we had to go on was sound and we were left to theorize about the fastest speed anything could travel we would assume that the speed of sound was some theoretical limit because time for us would be based on sound if you see a super sonic jet flying above you you know that it sounds like it s in one place but in reality it s traveled faster than sound and it s much further ahead but as a race of blind creatures how would we ever be able to prove that such a jet had exceeded the speed of sound i often wonder if perhaps light could be this way as well for us but then again i figure many people much smarter than me have worked all this out before so i pretty much just take their word for it that nothing can exceed the speed of light
in your example if you had a signal that travelled faster than light but did not go back in time then there is no paradox involved so i am not sure it s a good example of why nothing can go faster than light
makes sense and also if you think about it if something traveled faster than light even if it didn t affect time we d never be able to observe the movement to my knowledge so we d never know it moved faster than light
the question wasn t how but why the why is probably know only by the creator of universe casuality and positive time arrow are not required by science per se they are just something that we observe it happens
if the light from the andromeda galaxy takes million years to get here how does it get here in an instant does it exist at separate points in time back on earth million years ago and now
i thought the universe was expanding faster than the speed of light with that logic is the portion of the expanding universe going back in time
ok conspiracy time i love that illustration but what if that red light was there and we thought it was a mistake the operator did get the instructions but we assumed he misunderstood from our perspective the memory of the red light instructions never happens because the new timeline took over like some of these mistakes or misunderatandings are just glitches in causality from thoughts moving faster than light moving backwards in time kinda similar to deja vu in the matrix
how the frick do you know all of that
well things can move faster than light from an outside frame of reference but it just appears that way to us because the object is warping spacetime inside the object s frame of reference it could be barely moving at all but it is bending the universe around it and i don t believe there is a practical limit on how much spacetime can be bent but i don t know that much about it
does quantum entanglement bypass time
doesn t is have something to do with mass as well seems like i heard something to the effect of anything travelling faster than light would achieve negative mass which is impossible
i would argue that this is most likely a perception issue more than a physical one it s basically schrodinger s light we can t observe anything without light so to our understanding nothing exists that is faster than light i d argue then that it s not that it doesn t exist only that we can t see it or observe it so it doesn t exist for us given sufficient time and technology we will probably find things that are faster than light using technology that doesn t require light for observation we already do this to an extent with things we know exist but can t see like dark matter so it s not that time stops our perception of it would if observing from the outside if a person moves farther away from gravity to them times moves the same it s only to us still here that observe that time has slowed for them relativity it s literally a matter of perspective how and where we observe from is literally altering the results of that observation even though it changes nothing at all
thanks much easier that the top voted comment in here for an eli5
thanks for the explanation how did we manage to find out that the graph for time stops at when we reach light speed
but like if speed of light time then why does light still take time to move thru space like it takes minutes for light to travel from sun to earth time moved forward for us but not for light this is too much for my smol brain
i am wondering if you were to travel near the speed of light and not travel in time would the atoms of your body stop moving too would you freeze
e mc is the short form light has no mass so this short form would claim that light has no energy as c the full formula is e mc pc and we usually just ignore the impulse and set p to to talk about things at rest so for light it s actually e pc as it has no mass and therefore we can also say that it can never be at rest if something has no mass it has to be going at full speed and if something has mass it can never go at full speed as that would require infinite energy
i thought the c was celeritas
light propagates at the speed of causality in perfect vacuum in air or water or anything else light goes slower
is it just a coincidence or is it actually linked to the speed of light or i guess my question is if we theoretically discovered some energy or something that goes faster than light couldn t we just change the equation and the speed of causality to the new fastest thing instead of saying it goes back in time
something faster information
if you have a geodesic curve in a space time manifold what is the variable of the curve in a spatial manifold the variable is usually time so you can calculate where you are at time t and how fast you are as your position changes with t but in the space time manifold the curve is parameterized by another variable does it have any physical interpretation
what would antimatter travel at edit within space
it has no mass this is the biggie you push on something how fast it moves depends on its mass the less mass the faster it moves light speed is what happens when mass
theories are hypothetical
imagine yourself moving faster than sound what would you ear what would you expect to ear for information check cherenkov radiation that blue aura around nuclear rods in nuclear reactors caused supposedly by particles going faster than the speed of light in water breaking the light barrier in water like a jet may break the sound barrier in air by going faster than the speed of sound in air
it does not expand faster than c the distance between objects can increase more than they could by simply traveling apart at c
no quantum computing doesn t behave that way it s still slower than light you may be thinking of entanglement which is used in quantum computing entangled particles do update instantaneously faster than light but the actual computation performed by the quantum computer is not instantaneous quantum computers work by setting up a particular system of entangled particles and then measuring them that measurement will collapse the quantum state and entanglement will cause the particles to behave in particular ways with particular probabilities so that our measurement has a predictable probability of giving a correct result those steps of setting up the system and taking the measurement involve moving and colliding particles and those particles can t move faster than the speed of light it can be very fast relative to traditional electronic computation but not faster than light in fact there s a theory in physics that no information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light even using quantum entanglement
the speed of light is the speed of causality before it is the speed of light this bears repeating we call it speed of light because that was our first frame of reference when discovering the principle but really it s the speed that reality itself propagates in spacetime if the sun decides to blow itself up completely this very second we all get to live another minutes of a reality where it s just fine the sky will be blue and the earth will continue to orbit a mass that s not even there
though the example has a few holes in order for them to send the signal to swap to red they had to have seen green first since light doesn t instantly arrive to the observer no time travel is required for a faster than light signal lightman lights green x time passes observer sees green light sends message to lightman to swap to red y x time passes if we had the means to send something faster than light lightman swaps to red x time passes observer sees red light
of course that s only if a faster than light signal goes back in time if it doesn t than things would proceed fairly normally
it was a very complicated way to describe a time paradox if you went back in time to change something then once the present came back around you d have no reason to go back in the first place and so it wouldn t have been changed so you d need to go back in time to change it and so on if that still seems confusing that s because it is seems more likely that the laws of the universe just wouldn t allow for such a self contradictory state of affairs at all
because things that travel faster than light also travel back in time so the faster than light signal that you send right after seeing the green light will reach the moon before the green light was even switched on
why would the signal go back in time in this example a signal going backwards in time is one of the starting premises the example doesn t explain why it goes backwards in time so much as explain why the ability to go backwards in time violates causality the bit about time slowing down for fast moving objects and stopping completely at the speed of light implies objects moving faster than that require going backwards in time
if the signal did not go back in time we have fundamentally misunderstood physics and how time dilation works the example of the lights is assuming physics works as we think it does and if physics doesnt work the way we think it does the whole question is pointless
if the light from the andromeda galaxy takes million years to get here how does it get here in an instant it takes million years from our perspective from the light s perspective time has passed does it exist at separate points in time back on earth million years ago and now the light that reached earth back then is different from the light that reaches earth now from that galaxy that s why if you magically traveled light years away from earth instantly you would see earth as it was years ago another way of putting is that from lights perspective it exists at all points in space at the same time because time never passes
the photons reaching here now have departed million years ago there isn t one light it s a basically infinite amount of photons at all points between there and here and they all have been traveling for differing amounts of time
the restriction is that objects with mass can t move faster than light space itself isn t an object with mass similarly imagine a wall that is light year long and that you have a flashlight stand far enough away so that your flashlight illuminates the entire wall now wave your hand in front of the flashlight for second the shadow of your hand will move from one side of the wall to the other in second meaning it moved faster than light which would take year to move that distance the shadow isn t an object so this doesn t break our understanding of physics note that the shadow doesn t move from one side of the wall to the next instantly when you move your hand the shadow is the absence of light so the shadow moves at the speed of light until it hits the wall first hitting one side and then hitting the other side second later it might be easier to visualize if you imagine you have two pieces of cardboard which you use to block the flashlight while it s on then you move the pieces of cardboard in front of the flashlight such that there s a slit between them a vertical line of light will seemingly move across the wall in second but the light is actually moving towards the wall not parallel to it
no because it s space that s being stretched lets say i have a bug that can not crawl faster or slower than one meter per minute if put him on a meter stick and let him crawl he ll reach the other end of the meter in a minute exactly but what if the meter is made of rubber and i pull on it as he crawls the bug appears to go faster than it s max speed because it gets shifted forward as the meter stretches but really he s been going the same speed the whole time
i m a big fan of space time https://www.youtube.com/@pbsspacetime). i also like to visit places like ligo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ligo) and talk to the astrophysicist there recently i got into a youtuber called dr becky https://www.youtube.com/@drbecky) i won t pretend to be an expert on space much of what the above people talk about flies over my head still i understand it enough to answer ops question though sometimes us noobs know how to better explain to other noobs than people who might use more technical language
nope it s like imagine i take a red and a blue ball and put them in two boxes i shuffle the boxes and give you one of them if you open your box and see that you have the blue ball you know that i have the red ball that s all there is to it i don t know that i have the red ball until i open my box or until you tell me about it but telling me about it can t happen faster than the speed of light
i don t know anything about quantum entanglement but from what i ve seen it requires setup to physically separate the entangled objects so i get the impression any time you d gain by traveling through time is lost by the time it takes to prepare the setup i m sure this is a gross misunderstanding of the underlying physics but at least it resolves the issue by enabling time travel without breaking causality you can time travel but it takes so long to do so it would have been faster to not time travel in the first place
from what i know no
quantum entanglement can seem to bypass causality and by extension time in a way but doesn t the speed of light is often referred to as the speed of causality this is in reference to for information to cause an effect in a different location whatever that information is which would trigger the effect can not travel faster than light two quantumly entangled particles are linked for instance their spin might be linked in such a way that they both remain in a super position until you observe one of them then their super position collapses simultaneously to pick a state opposite of each other if you observe one with an up spin you know for certain that the other has collapsed into a down spin state this happens regardless of how far away they are they could be on the opposite sides of the universe and will still both collapse at the same moment does this mean that the speed of causality went faster than light actually no the entangled particles super positions collapse when observed but also spontaneously all on their own did it collapse because someone observed it s entangled partner or did it just randomly do so there s no way to tell therefore there s no way to use the effect to send information that would cause an effect the speed of causality is still limited to the speed of light
i always imagine it as looking at a clock as iove away from the clock the light bouncing off of it takes longer to reach me the faster i go the slower the clock ticks until i reach light speed at which point time stops the light bouncing off the clock can no longer catch up to me i am left with a frozen image of a clock if i go faster could i catch up to older light and see the clock move backwards
short answer math and then about years of experiments that reinforce that the math is right
if you were light every trip you take would feel instantaneous you wouldnt grow older while moving but the origin and destination of your journey both would feel time passing and would still have to wait for you to arrive if humans had a colony in a star system lightyears away and you wanted to go there at lightspeed to you it would be like teleporting but to both locations years would still pass you want to head back home you d just teleport back if you had kids back at home they would now be years older than when you left the first time but you havent aged at all and havent felt time move foward at all the main hang up that makes this not intuitive at all is that time and space are not different they re the same thing spacetime at low speeds it doesnt matter and we can treat the two as different and it wont affect our lives at all it only starts to matter when things go really fast
your overall speed in spacetime has a space component and a time component but you don t get to choose them independently increasing one component while keeping the total speed fixed necessarily decreases the other component in a deterministic way here s a thought experiment say i put you in an open field and tell you that you are allowed to walk forward and or to the right so you can walk straight forward straight to the right or at any angle between them but that your total speed must always be exactly 5ft s you could choose to walk straight forward at 5ft s or straight to the right at 5ft s however you couldn t choose to walk forward at 3ft s and not move to the right because then your total speed would only be 3ft s you would need to also be moving to the right at 4ft s so that your total speed along the diagonal was 5ft s whatever you picked for one component would decide the other and the thing is you are always moving through spacetime at a fixed speed the speed of light everything is that s analogous to the 5ft s speed in our thought experiment it s just that anything that isn t light splits its speed between space and time components analogous to the forward and rightward components in our thought experiment and so its speed through space will be less than its total speed in spacetime there are physics reasons why light behaves differently having to do with mass but that s not relevant here but we humans don t experience spacetime directly in our subjective experience we experience the space and time components separately we experience the space component directly as our movement through space but we experience the time component indirectly by observing the speed of a clock arm or something like that it s like if in our thought experiment you could only experience the forward component of your walk so that you felt yourself moving forward at 3ft s but not to the right at 4ft s and could only measure your speed s rightward component by observing how rocks and plants appeared to be moving relative to you as you walked in our subjective experience we think that we can control our speed in space and that time consequently speeds up or slows down around us which is kinda true but really all we do is change how our fixed total spacetime speed is divided between its space and time components we control both components just not independently
from your point of view time feels normal
if you re traveling near the speed of light you d be traveling in time as well very slowly through time but more than zero time doesn t stop for you unless you re literally moving at the speed of light anything less than that will have at least some time passing for you
we set p because objects at the macro scale have momentum that is basically zero especially compared to their mass if your mass is say and your momentum is say then there s no point trying to include the momentum because the error in that measurement of mass is likely greater than any precision you might gain by accounting for the nonzero momentum by contrast for very light objects in particular photons which have zero mass you have to account for momentum because it s no longer negligible
i m fairly sure that it s just coincidence that causality also starts with c
you are correct celeritas just being the latin word for speed it is just a coincidence that causality starts with the same letter but a convenient one
because the photons hit molecules in the medium and bounce around making the actual distance they travel longer
cause and effect is therefore dependent on the medium which is trippy as fuck
to discover this would destroy our current model of the universe relativity if we raised the speed of casualty that wouldn t explain the bigger question why don t other massless particles travel at that speed suddenly photons have room to be accelerated and if they are massless why has that never been observed at that point are they massless in the way that we thought currently all the little predictions made by both einstein s theories of relativity and all the equations of quantum field theory have been observed both those theories predict that nothing travels faster than light it would cripple them to change that speed we d need a way to explain what we were seeing within the rules we ve been working with or else toss it all out and start from scratch there is room however to talk about quanta that move backwards in time it s hypothetical as we haven t figured out a way to actually observe that i honestly don t know why it s a prediction but it doesn t toss out the rules of our universe altogether
light has no mass all massless phenomena travel at causality in a vacuum all phenomena with mass cannot reach the speed of causality
gigantism is much harder on the body than dwarfism and has a far higher casualty rate people with gigantism suffer short lives and rarely have children dwarfism otoh is pretty doable little people regularly live full lives and often have children thus passing along the genes for dwarfism
dwarfism is easier to survive less likely to keel over from a heart attack at in history people with giantism very rarely lived long enough to reproduce so there is proportionally much less of that recessive gene combination in the gene pool
gigantism is much easier to diagnose and cure most cases of gigantism is caused by a tumor on a gland that manages growth hormone removing the tumor usually stops the growing you ll end up a bit taller than average but not extremely so dwarfism has over a hundred causes it s just harder to accurately diagnose and cure
gigantism is much easier to cure tho it s almost always caused by a tumor
which means that if its picked up early the person doesnt become a giant
yeah basically the tumor causes excess growth hormone remove the tumor hormone levels go down excessive growth stops it won t let the person shrink back down to normal levels and brain surgery is obviously dangerous but it can be cured completely with a well timed surgery
correct although it doesn t change the odds of them passing on the gene that leads to a pituitary gland tumor so it doesn t lower the incidence of gigantism it just lowers the number seen displaying it
huh never seen one of those but it wouldn t be hard to do the hidden image is printed with an uncolored polarizing ink light can pass through the ink but is polarized you don t see anything because light passes through the hidden image unimpaired the lense you re looking through is another polarizer oriented degrees from the polarized image crossed polarizers block the light the first polarizer only passes light in say the left right polarization the lens only passes light in the up down polarization so the image appears black since the light can t get through try turning the lens degrees the image will disappear
scar tissue is also a build up of extra collagen particles in and around cells as part of repair these turn over much more slowly sort of stuck this way until better blood flow or proper skin cells return to the area if at all this is why some scars fade by many last forever if you get a decent scar when younger the skin cells propagate but your body is growing as well making it hard for the proper growth to overtake the damaged area sometimes scars grow for this reason
the skin is made up of several different cells some are actual skin cells and some are more structural there is also fatcells immune cells nerves and much more your skin is incredibly complex it s not just a bag covering muscles when you get a small damage the skin heals completely that is because you haven t lost any structures think of it like a building if a couple of windows gets busted and the roof gets some damage then it s a pretty easy fix the rest of the building is there to build on and you know where the windows go now if you get a deeper and more severe damage you lose the structure of the skin if we take the building again if you lose an entire wall windows and all and you don t have blueprint it is impossible to know how it s supposed to look so you just slap concrete on that side and call it a day that is scar tissue it s the body s way of healing something that has lost its identity it doesn t know exactly how it looked before and replicating some things in the original is impossible so it just builds scar tissue if you get a medium injury it can heal fully but it takes a lot longer if you have to replace windows it s quicker than if you have to replace windows and a part of the wall children often gets worse scarring because they are excellent healers old people usually get less scaring because they heal worse while discreet scars are nice you also lose a lot of strength with those
there are a lot of complex reasons and i m sure someone will elaborate on them somewhere down the thread but the easiest explanation is those cells replicate too all of the cells that make up your scars freckles birthmarks etc are also replicating exactly more or less how they are which means that your weird mole is going to follow you around for your whole life baring extraneous circumstances
not all cells turn over in that time that is an average but cells under the skin turn over slower plus the genes in the new cells will remain the same so they will produce the same result
only the surface layer the epidermis gets replaced every days and that layer is very thin and basically transparent the layer underneath the dermis doesn t have the same amount of turnover
a home equity loan is a lump sum loan with a typically fixed rate they give you all the money you re borrowing at once and you pay it back in installments refinancing is choosing to change mortgages on a home this could be advantageous if you can lower your interest rate decrease the number of years you want on your loan believe you have achieved equity in a home and want to get rid of pmi or if you re in a bad spot and need to reset your amortization schedule to more years to lower your payment a heloc home equity line of credit is like a lower interest credit card with your house as the collateral you spend as you need to and interest is accrued as you spend rather than on the whole available amount
home equity loan is a second loan that is junior to the original mortgage a borrower still have your original mortgage after getting a home equity loan refinancing is a loan that is used to repay the original mortgage in full it replaces the old mortgage it s possible to change the terms or increase the balance etc heloc is similar to a home equity loan but it s not quite the same it s an approval to borrow up to x amount against the home but may not have any borrowing it s more like a credit card limit the bank might agree to loan up to at any time over the next year if you need it this lets a borrower pay a fee and lock in terms even if they don t have an immediate cash need or if the don t know the full amount they might want to borrow once the line is drawn it s very similar to a home equity loan
second mortgage is when you already have a mortgage but you need some cash so you sell your equity how much of your home you own back to the bank and you now have another monthly payment to buy back your equity your home is the collateral so the bank can foreclose your home and sell it if you don t pay home equity loan is a type of second mortgage heloc stands for home equity line of credit and is similar to a home equity loan except you don t have to use the max amount if approved for 25k you can only use 10k if you want however you can also do both even if your house is paid for ____ refinance is to redo the mortgage on your home or car to get a lower rate this can be done with your original lender or a new one for instance my father recently got a car loan and the rate was too high so the next day he went with a local credit union they paid off the first lender and now he pays them instead it is financially savvy to utilize this if your current interest rate is high they can be factors of just one lender just being better than another or after a few months years your credit score is better or the economy is better for instance mortgage car loans have about 2x the interest rates from just 1yr ago
home equity loan and a heloc are both additional loans against your home what sometimes are referred to as second mortgages while you continue to pay your primary mortgage you then borrow against the equity you have and also make payments toward that loan a home equity loan is a fixed amount of money and then a fixed payback schedule like you borrow 100k to put on an addition and then pay that back over years a heloc is a line of credit where you get a limit but can draw only a portion of that at a time maybe you got a 100k heloc but you only need 15k for a roof now so that s what you borrow a few years later you pull out another 50k for a kitchen remodel there is typically a period of like or years in which you can draw out more money and then a repayment only period refinancing is paying off your current mortgage entirely and then getting a new one if you take on a larger mortgage than your current balance you could pull money out to use for remodeling etc like if your home is worth 500k and your mortgage balance was 300k but you then take out a new 350k mortgage and then have 50k to use for a new kitchen
cables all over the place cat5 cat6 cat7 cat8 and fiber cables are buried throughout every major metropolitan area much harder to find i guess but they also run across the bottom of the oceans as well
the people that survive would tell stories of it to their kids and eventually it would probably be forgotten because who cares about the internet when you know the infrastructure will never be put in place to ever make it work again
assuming books and what not still exist but also assuming the books or physical media never mention the internet because that s no fun i think a couple things would at least hint at the internet as we know it first from the inception of the internet to the point we are set back historians would see a sharp decline in newspapers magazines photos and other such physical means of sharing information they d be able to deduce that we would have to still be sharing knowledge and news somehow they d also see a steady rise in newspapers and magazines prior and that after these publications declined technology as a whole was still advancing these two things in conjunction would let them know that we were sharing information in a way that was not being recorded physically the second would be the general speed at which technology advanced during the internet age in multiple places all around the world including more remote locations
a ton of infrastructure that was left to rot if you look at places that have had all the humans leave like chernobyl you can tell that they still used certain technologies because the things these technologies were made from will still survive long down the road the internet is the same way it s made up of everything from cellphone towers to datacenters and more datacenters will probably survive in some capacity for a really long time even in a non functional state and future humans will be able to tell that these were places of very high technology just based on the framework and structure of the equipment that used to be there plus all of these things have to be connected via millions of miles of cables and many of these cables are buried underground so they d survive pretty well over a hundred years even years down the line when stuff is all gone and decayed archaeologists and geologists will be able to tell that the area where a datacenter once stood was an area of high tech because of the rare earth materials that are left behind things like refined gold neodymium from magnets used in hard drives refined silicon used in processors and other stuff that just doesn t exist in nature
the internet is a network of computers and servers that communicate with each other using various technologies many of these technologies are physical such as cables and satellites while others are digital such as software and data over time physical evidence of the internet could deteriorate or be lost digital evidence could also be lost if there were no means to access or interpret it
there s no evidence of cat cable in ancient egypt which demonstates they had a very early implementation of wifi
they had bast cables
personally i ve just always enjoyed heights i recall the delight of being lifted i to the air repeatedly by my father for my 4th birthday if that caused it or if the fascination was already firmly developed i don t know but i think it was the latter i climbed so many trees and roofs growing up my parents knew that they couldn t stop me from doing it so they taught me how to do to safely i started going on rollercoasters in my teens and took up skydiving in my late 20s while i enjoy the thrill the view is what really gets me especially sunset jumps imagine taking off with a plane just after sunset rising up into the very last sunlight still illuminating the clouds above you jump out and immediately open your parachute replacing the roar of the engine with the hiss of a light breeze the sun is redder than anything you ve ever seen due to shining through even more air than it could while still reaching the ground almost purple if you brake your parachute further the wind dies down to almost nothing far below the ground lies in dusk and lights are coming on you can turn and look in any direction for miles and miles with nothing obstructing your view you can even look directly at the sun without getting blinded
the adrenaline kick itself is quite simply a rush there s a reason they call people who do extreme sports adrenaline junkies i race oldtimer cars myself and much as i like the challenge of being in competition with other people enjoying the same hobby the rush and adrenaline when going fast over small country roads is a large part of why racing cars is so much fun
in past clocks were regulated by setting noon during noon when sun is at its highest the very peak during day then we moved to time zones when we needed to regulate difference between clocks at different east west places for train schedules
have a look at greenwich mean time and paris meridian time both were contenders for a base time for which other countries who needed to have a united timezone due to railways and colonisation in general would be a certain number of hours ahead of behind having an international date line over the relatively uninhabited central pacific worked in both cases
we ve tracked time locally since at least the ancient greeks and likely earlier greenwich mean time was created around the modern timezone system started around the same time as railroads allowed people to move faster and basing times on local noon became problematic this was done initially on a country by country basis by most countries had adopted the standard timezones based on an offset from gmt
in greenwich royal observatory this was chosen as the prime meridian all time zones are counted from there the clock on the observatory was officially declared as the exact time so noon in greenwich england is where all time in the world was first agreed as being the time https://greenwichmeantime.com/what-is-gmt/
locally a long time more broadly the british decided that since they went to all that trouble to lay rails and build trains to get from place to place it would be useful if folks on either end could tell when the train would show up or leave that meant the times had to be synchronized so they chose greenwich mean time as the standard for the country eventually this spread to most other countries again pushed mostly by train schedules
the first notion of time would have been recognizing before and after then came meta notions of seasonal cycles and days somewhere along the way breaking the day into smaller units became a thing it is a system of measurement we found useful it is not a property of the universe time started when we started using it https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/time-did-not-exist-before-life-621f06889701](https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/time-did-not-exist-before-life-621f06889701)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stonehenge potentially years ago or so stonehenge is aligned to the summer and winter solstice and speculated to align with lunar cycles as well this makes sense for preparing for planting growing harvesting and the return of spring sun dials have been used for more accurate daily time keeping candles were made to burn consistently so that they could be segmented and give an idea of time passage
is really just the culmination of a long time of development following the introduction of the h4 and h5 marine chronometers as longitude was measured by comparing the difference between noon and the noon indicated by the marine chronometer in the 1770s the royal navy and eventually the entire british merchant marine were on standardized time and that meant greenwich time as the chronometers were calibrated there before leaving london by the 1850s and as rail was becoming more and more common much of england scotland were on greenwich time
for one the music being in the minor key really helps ever hear the x files theme in the major key https://youtu.be/qtrxonbujvm
music theory is pretty cool generally speaking dissonance is a harsh scary sombre sound while consonance is a pleasant mellow soothing sound two notes that are adjacent on a piano or mashing all the keys possible on a piano is a very harsh example of dissonance but we can make it sound much more musically appealing such as in the x files theme
this is likely due to leitmotifs the name for bits of music to relate to a feeling mood idea etc these end up being learned and reused and like pavlov s dog you end up getting some feeling from an audio cue take for example underwater music you ll often have harps in some repeating melodies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzcca5rrhdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzcca5rrhdo) it s even got a submarine sonar ping something you won t have personally heard but you know from films you just associate all that stuff with water despite not many people play harps when you go swimming space music is similar to the water stuff but has long drawn out symphonics to give a sense of awe as well as echos to give a sense of size space famously doesn t have a sound but this becomes the go to thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m86mbrkzhy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m86mbrkzhy0) now for the big one the omen had its famous music which is now associated with things satanic but it s a bunch of latin poems set to quite intense anxiety building music rhythmns are often linked to breathing and heart beats to add to the effect that music as a whole has been associated with demonic possession and that now means that monks chanting in latin is another simple leitmotif for all things sinister even though it was a religious praise god kinda thing to start with you can spot these leitmotifs in the wild the best place to find them is film scores batman has a lot of church bells for church belfry bats it gets clearer in the films as the music wasn t composed for music s sake it was done to match what was on screen often without the visual side it can seem to be all over the place as it will jump between themes moods and feelings a lot because the visual part would have been telling a story too the leifmotifs in these are particularly heavy it doesn t matter if they are jarring as the screen fill in the gaps the intro music for a film usually is the best for this as the intro visuals wants to rapidly set a scene and some exposition and they ll telegraph what they want you to feel listen to some without watching the visuals and see if you can guess what they are trying to show you ll end up recognising what they are trying to say and notice that the music or sounds don t specifically relate to that but relate to cultural cues that you already know
it is because of the way they are composed music is made up of different elements such as melody harmony rhythm and timbre composers can use these elements in different ways to create different moods or feelings in their music for example they might use unusual chord progressions or dissonant harmonies to create a sense of tension or unease they might also use instruments or sounds that have an eerie or mysterious quality to them the x files theme for example uses a whistling sound and a synthesizer to create an eerie and mysterious atmosphere
frostbite occurs when water in the tissue cools enough that it freezes damaging the tissue to the point it can t survive even if you quickly melt the ice the crystals have ripped apart the cells and there is no recovering them there isn t really a set time of exposure where frostbite will occur it depends on ambient temperature and other conditions things like wind or water exposure can significantly change how long frostbite takes to occur at a given temperature
water expands when it freezes right well your cells are delicate little pouches and they re filled mostly with water if a body part gets cold enough the water inside the cells can freeze if that happens the expanding ice crystal rips the cell apart after that happens warm water or any other thawing method doesn t help because the cells are already ruptured and spilling their contents everywhere for an experiment you could actually do with a year old freeze a piece of fruit like an apple slice until it s solid then thaw it again no matter how carefully you thaw it it s going to be complete mush afterwards because the cells all ripped open when it froze
follow up question those people who freeze so quickly that they are able to be thawed and resuscitated justin smith does that also apply to their extremities or do they still get frostbite
typically they would get frostbite justin smith lost all his toes and both his pinkies for example
nothing much really the old sperm cells are dissolved and new ones are being built so the sperm count in the testicles stops rising after a certain degree many people will tell you that overfull testicles can lead to nightly ejaculation as a vent so to speak but that is not proven to be true at the moment
it s worth saying that semen isn t stored you don t have a sack of semen ready to go semen is a combination of mostly on demand glandular excretions and sperm fluid from the ejaculatory ducts the end result is semen

i definitely remember hearing that in sex ed seems like something we should know by now no
follow up question what happens during the refractory period why does the semenal wall have less tension after orgasm and why does it need to build up tension again for arousal does this change after a vasectomy

while i guess it is possible for the remnants of a mountain chain to subside under another plate after a very long period of time the primary means of mountains being reduced in height is through erosion and not tectonic activity
typically mountain ranges erode away wind and water and natural disaster moving material from the top of the mountain down to the bottom ish and surrounding areas how frightening it would be to see a mountain range be gobbled up under and plate even over a long time scale
m s in geology here there are a couple reasons mountain ranges disappear after a while first as others have mentioned erosion will removed a lot of material from a mountain range but tectonic forces also play a role in the destruction of mountain ranges mountain ranges like the himalayas result from the continental crust being compressed and therefore thickened by colliding plates rock is forced both upward into the mountains but also downward forming a so called crustal root that sticks down into the mantle after this compression ends the thickened crust becomes unstable it is unable to support its own weight the crustal root is also unstable as continental crust is considerably less dense than the mantle it s a bit like trying to hold a balloon underwater the compressed crust therefore starts to extend back outward and the mountain range essentially collapses over time
mountain ranges like the himalayas are formed over millions of years by the movement of tectonic plates when two plates collide the land between them is pushed upwards to form mountains over time the forces that created the mountains can change for example the tectonic plates might move apart or stop pushing against each other as hard this can cause the mountains to stop growing and even start to shrink the process of mountains shrinking is called erosion wind water and ice can wear away at the rocks and soil on the mountains causing them to become smaller over time so while tectonic movements can create mountains they can also cause them to recede over millions of years
thank you
mid ocean ridges get subducted all the time when their parent oceans close so there s at least one sort of mountain for which this is a normal ish process this happened in the geologically recent past in the eastern north pacific where today the east pacific rise abruptly disappears under north america https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid-ocean_ridge#/media/file:(manuscript_painting_of_heezen-tharp_world_ocean_floor_map_by_berann\).jpg).
it functions like a bike lock you can purchase a steel cable with a key or combination lock and attaches to the locking port that can strap your computer laptop to desk to make it harder to steal this is useful in businesses to lock a kiosk computer to a desk to prevent customers from doing smash and grabs
it s like a bike lock for your computer you put the lock end of the lock through the loop forming a larger loop that you secure around a big heavy object and then lock it into the laptop s slot
many years ago it was discovered that equipment theft could be a major problem if someone were to walk away with an expensive computer obviously that s not great or at a trade show or presentation where a laptop might be left out having a way to lock it up can prevent someone from stealing company assets nowadays it s become an extremely important security concern since a bad actor just walking away with a company computer can cause a massive security problem especially if the computer contains trade secrets to combat this problem the kensington lock company stepped up and lobbied big companies like ibm dell and hp to include a spot on their computers for a very specific type of lock to be attached this also spread to include things like tvs and monitors external hard drives and basically every other mid sized gadget you might want to protect these locks theoretically make it harder to steal a computer by just walking away with it now kensington locks aren t the best locks out there many of them use tubular locks that have a very notorious design flaw involving a bic pen and they re certainly not strong enough to stop a really determined thief from cutting the lock but the mere presence of a lock is a really effective tool at preventing someone from committing a crime of opportunity especially in a busy office library computer lab or the floor of a trade show most locks are good for nothing more than keeping honest people honest but that s totally okay edit after a bit of research it looks like kensington actually makes a ton of different locks for a ton of different purposes even though the kensington lock port that you used to see all over laptops is slowly disappearing i guess they have enough brand recognition to keep going
an electric garage door is a big door that opens and closes using electricity it has a lock on the outside that looks like a t shape called a t bar lock when the t bar lock is turned it stops the garage door from opening even if someone tries to use the electric button to open it this is important because it keeps your garage and everything inside safe
tornadoes form when different large weather fronts meet each other cold air is more dense than warm air so it wants to sink down and less dense warm air wants to rise up but the ground absorbs a lot of sunlight so it gets warm and warms up the air near it while air cools as it rises up broadly this is what causes weather the poles get less direct sunlight so they are cooler while the equator gets lots of direct sunlight and is warmer air warms at the equator and rises up while air cools at the poles and sinks down as the air cools around the poles it sinks down and pushes warm air out of the way towards the equator but since the earth has a lot of water and mountains and is spinning the mixing of these fronts is very chaotic when cold fronts move quickly they shove themselves under the warm moist fronts forcing the warm air to rise rapidly cool and the moisture condenses out as rain tornadoes happen when there is a third air front between them that is hot and dry when all three fronts meet with the right timing the cold air gets under the hot air and then the warm wet air gets rapidly shoved all the way on top of both normally the warm air would cool down and there will be rain maybe a storm and the two fronts will mix with some wind the hot air forms a convection cap between them though which traps the cold air low to the ground and prevents the warm front from mixing as it cools instead as it cools the warm front tries to sink down squeezing the air around the ground that is warming and trying to go up the rapidly cooling upper layer may even spill over around the convection cap but it can t get in because the front against the ground is still there this builds up pressure until a hole forms in the hot air layer that hole relieves the pressure the air on the ground that is being squeezed and squeezed bursts through the hot air convection cap blasting upwards with a lot of force all of the air around that hole rushes in to fill that space it s like pulling the plug in a bathtub all the water rushing towards the drain except instead of gravity pulling water down it s the pressure forcing the air up through the hole and like in a bathtub any little bit of angular momentum any little bit of swirling is conserved so that the air swirls and swirls around where the hole is creating the whirl in the tub and a tornado in the air
a tornado is like a big spinning wind it starts when warm wet air from the ground meets cool dry air from the sky the warm air rises and the cool air falls which makes the spinning wind sometimes the spinning wind gets really strong and starts to pick up things that will make it stronger tornadoes usually end when the warm and cool air stops spinning together
on the large scale tornados are formed from the collision of cold dry air funneled in from the rocky mountains hot dry air from the deserts in the south west and warm wet air from the gulf of mexico those three air masses hit each other and it causes large spinning thunderstorms as far as i m aware though we still don t know the exact causes that turn a thunderstorm into a tornado fluids are weird and tornados are chaotic enough that it becomes difficult to determine all the factors that go into formation
i ve seen a fair number in the uk just funnel clouds ie not touching the ground often slanted not straight up and down i learned somewhere once that tornadoes can form when a horizontal rotor is churning in a thundercloud warm air grating over cold air one end of this rotor makes it to the ground and all hell breaks loose not gospel but s theory i heard which correlates with all the slanted fc s i ve seen
there s lots of ways to cook food and one way is to heat it in a liquid humans have been boiling food in water since cave man times it s also possible to cook food in wine like a fondue or in cheese oil has the advantage over water that it s boiling point is much higher so it can cook food at much higher temperatures not only does this speed up cooking but this triggers the maillard reaction which is the browning of the foods exterior increasing the flavor oil creates an outside crust that seals juices into the food making it taste better where as cooking in water causes the juices to leech out of the food and causes the food to breakdown and not be as tasty oil is a fat and therefore a flavor carrier which also improves the taste of food the downside of frying in oil is that it increases the fat content of food making it more calories and making it worse for your health
well plenty of dishes involve boiling a food item in water basically the same idea with a different liquid we fry things in oil because it can get a lot hotter than water and drive the water out of the food without burning it liquids with a lower boiling point like ethanol wouldn t work since the water won t boil off and you probably don t want to be cooking your food in most other strange industrial coolants with high boiling points don t fry a chicken in propylene glycol
we can boil food in water too so it s not just oil that we use we use oil because we can get it hotter than water but it s still edible what liquids other than water and oil would you think to use to cook food
for most of history there are only basic liquids humans had access to fats and oils and we define frying as cooked in hot oil oil came first then the method of cooking called frying water based fluids water milk etc which if you cooked in it was called boiling or braising or stewing alcohol usually mixed with water that is kind of it there are a huge variety of recipes but there are not too many traditional methods of cooking hot dry called roast baking water based boiling braising steaming frying hot oil curing preserving fermenting smoke salt vinegar sugar direct heat barbecue grill etc or indirect heat using heated stone pans etc
well you re already off base because food can be fried in pretty much any type of fat hell back in the day mcdonalds fried their french fries in beef fat as far as why it isn t fried in other liquids is because then they would be boiled poached or simmered if your asking for a dumbed down explanation of the science any other liquid would boil off before it got to the temp we need to fry things at also fat makes things crispy other liquids make things soggy

fyi leach out of the food despite the similar spellings and related meaning leach is the word for using a solvent to suck something it can dissolve out of a material the two words even have different etymologies leach is etymologically related to leak as water leaks from a bucket not leech
i have some buddies who were running a nerd collective as part of it they had some high voltage outlets run to the garage for running machining tools after the outlets were wired they wanted to make sure they could draw the kind of power they needed without blowing it so how do they do this in industrial settings well you run coils of wire with enough total resistance to pull the necessary current and then you submerge them in a coolant oil so they don t overheat and cause stuff to catch fire hm alright what if we used cooking oil and thus their flameless deepfryer was born

that s what the cartilage is for it dampens the blow that s why so many people have to get joints replaced because the cartilage wears out over time
the cartilage prevents it your joints have a thick layer of it and cartilage is very tough stuff still overtime activities like you re talking will wear the cartilage down and cause problems
vertebrae specifically have discs in between them that are designed to absorb compression forces these discs contain a gelatinous substance with that helps absorb the forces of impact the cartilage in other joints is there partially to absorb impact as well so your joints already have a built in system to absorb and dissipate impact energy over time these systems break down and may need repair or replacement
bungee jumping would be bad then
probably not too bad you slow down over a longer period of time when bungee jumping compared to a basketball player jumping and landing it s the suddenness that is harmful
bungee jumping causes stretching mostly not compression i ve tried it once but didn t like the sensation of my blood rushing to my head i took up skydiving the very next day and loved it

anything that disrupts your sleep is bad so that includes an alarm clock most of the answers are going to say that you ll need a good amount of sleep like to hours it is better to wake up naturally but given that our reality we must wake at certain times to prepare for work for the next day i recommend that you plan out a good sleep schedule don t use a loud beeping noise alarm just use a natural or smooth music tone remember always sleep well very very important
abrupt awakenings can have a negative impact on health relating to the adrenaline jolt the interruption of deep sleep and extended sleep inertia i e the period upon waking from a groggy state to an alert state the severity of is it bad for me is nuanced but these are possible ways in which it can be there are many things you can do to adjust your circadian rhythm i e your body s natural clock such as having a consistent i m going to sleep now time and i m going to wake up now time and ideal sleep conditions this list could be a lot longer sleep is far too undermined and crucial to overall health so although you could argue that the consequences of not waking up in absence of an alarm are harmful not attending to general life responsibilities it s extremely worthwhile to examine what s contributing to your snooze addiction slow wake alarms and lamps can certainly help as one among many solutions
i would not recommend anything harsh like that caused me serious issues get dimmable smart lights and google mini or amazon echo set up gentle wake to begin min before your alarm clock this will turn your lights on at and increase them gradually over minutes have your alarm be something gentle that increases in volume i used to have issues like you and my old superloud alarm caused me to be very angry in the mornings now i m usually up 10min before the alarm even starts due to the lights
not sleeping enough is very bad for your health both physically and mentally studies shown that all people need to hours of sleep if you need more you may want to reconsider your sleep schedule or if that doesn t work see the doctor so when you are sleeping predictably just make sure you are asleep hours before you should wake up you won t need the alarm clock at all we sleep in cycles of around minutes it s easy to wake up between the cycles but if your alarm clock wakes you up in the middle you ll be extra grumpy and sluggish after
if you get enough sleep you should usually not need an alarm clock to wake up if you need one every day your not getting enough sleep x200b i wake up at 6am every day but usually i am awake before the alarm goes off x200b but on the other hand i am really tired at and am usually sleeping at at the latest
waking up abruptly to an alarm clock can be jarring and unpleasant but whether it is bad for you depends on a variety of factors including your overall sleep habits and individual physiology when you sleep your body goes through several stages including light sleep deep sleep and rem sleep ideally you want to wake up during a lighter stage of sleep which can make you feel more refreshed and alert however if you wake up during a deeper stage of sleep it can be more difficult to shake off the grogginess and feel fully awake some studies have suggested that waking up abruptly to an alarm clock can disrupt your natural sleep cycle and lead to sleep inertia which is a feeling of grogginess or disorientation that can last for several minutes or even hours after waking up this can make it more difficult to concentrate perform tasks and be productive in the morning however there are also factors that can mitigate the negative effects of abrupt wake ups for example if you have a consistent sleep schedule and get enough sleep each night you may be less affected by the jarring sound of an alarm clock additionally some people may find that waking up abruptly actually helps them feel more alert and energized in the morning overall while waking up abruptly to an alarm clock may not be ideal it is unlikely to cause any serious harm in most cases if you are concerned about the impact of your alarm clock on your sleep and well being it may be helpful to experiment with different wake up methods such as a light alarm or natural wake up alarm tl dr it is not ideal but it is unlikely to cause any harm
use a light alarm or a wristband with intelligent alarm wakes you in a time frame when you are least deep sleeping
try to wake up between sleep cycles so you don t wake up in the middle of deep sleep i guess most people need hours of sleep every night
there are actually innovative alarm clocks that use light over sound to wake you up the light is a gentle sun is rising light not the 50w light bulb i think they re called sunrise clocks the more quirky ones have birds tweeting sounds
get a sam kinnison alarm you ll no longer need coffee it comes on at volume and can t be lowered sam screams get up get the fuck up you lazy bastard get up ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh
natural alarm clocks daylight and water daylight is a circadian rhythm indicator you can drink some water before bed to help get you up and out of bed indigenous warriors used the water trick to wake before dawn to go on pre dawn raids
or use light but this is depending on whether op can wake up to light or not buying a wakeup light is one of if not the best things i ve bought for myself it feels like a much more natural way of disrupting my sleep to get up each day
just use a natural or smooth music tone remember always sleep well very very important my alarm clock has a gentle wake alarm it starts beeping very quietly and slowly gets louder until it finally reaches full volume hopefully when this dies i ll be able to find another one that dies that it s been the best alarm i ve ever had it is an alarm clock though and i know a lot of people refuse to get one and simply rely on their phone
i use the sleep cycle app which uses my phone s mic to track my breathing sleep stage and has a wake up window option if i need to be awake by 8am i can set the window to up to minutes and once i m in a light sleep phase during that window it ll start going off you can still snooze it and the snooze time is adjusted based on how awake you are i ve been using it for years and it s saved my ass because i do not wake up easily
i think i recall reading about an app that wakes you up based on your sleep cycle
negative impact on health relating to adrenaline jolt is too much adrenaline actually bad for you somebody i knew asked their doctor about adrenal response and cardiac health because of their severe chronic anxiety and the doctor stated that anxiety even to the extent that the adrenal response is active doesn t impact cardiac health i ve researched it myself recently given that i have experienced constant anxiety for about months now and take prescription stimulants for adhd and have found conflicting results all that to say please point me towards solid information on this my chest has been hurting and i can t figure out what s going on it persists when i am not under the effects of my medication and i eat clean exercise near daily and received a clean bill of health prior to restarting my prescription a few months ago and i don t use nicotine products but i do vape weed a few nights a week to counteract the insomniac effects of my medication
any lights you recommend i know about philips hue but due to import taxes they are very expensive where i live
i think it s wild that some people naturally wake up tho i also am not even capable of falling asleep naturally
when i don t use an alarm i literally sleep hours and not just once on holidays i sleep every day for hours for multiple days
this is actually a common misconception and untrue the quality of one s sleep is far more valuable and impacting than the quantity a lot of factors contribute to a consistent wake up time in the absence of an alarm i envy that about you and hope to reach that point
exactly this the only way an alarm clock is actually going to hurt you is if one gets chucked at your head
i will add that my light alarm thing doesn t successfully fully wake me but it does make me semi wake to a dozy state before my actual noisy alarm goes off instead of waking up suddenly and angry i m just vaguely aware that the room is lit with no awareness that it s a work day then the alarm goes off and i m not startled just oh right i work today it doesn t need to be one or the other you can test a light alarm without turning off your other alarm so you can be sure you don t miss a shift
these days you don t really need a specialized wake up light a tunable smart bulb in a bedside lamp can be programmed to turn on at your wake up time and gradually become brighter and change to a cooler color temperature over the course of minutes or so

android phones have similar settings nowadays sort of you can adjust the alarm to increase in volume the longer it goes on for however the initial alarm and the max volume is still based off of the system set alarm volume so it has its limitations
my alarm clock has a gentle wake alarm it starts beeping very quietly and slowly gets louder until it finally reaches full volume i had a dog who did this whenever she needed to go in the middle of the night she d make a hushed woof at the bedroom door and then she d wait seconds before trying again slightly louder the process took a couple minutes before reaching the level of a proper bark great feature highly recommended
cheapest dimmable warm whites you can get on amazon
look into wiz bulbs i ve been using about a dozen of them in my house for a couple of years now they re cheap 20ish each depending on lumens and if you want color changing or not they work directly with wifi and the app has a fair amount of features my only complaint is that they don t always respond to my google home routines the best like if i tell all the lights in a room to turn on sometimes one of them won t turn on unless i repeat the command but for the price compared to other smart bulbs it s worth that small hassle to me
do you go to bed before midnight if not try that makes a huge difference
agree my wake up light does make sound after minutes so i will wake up no matter what but it happens maybe once a year that i wake up to that
or even a smart plug but then you won t get the slow brightening
that makes sense i just didn t know about it when i bought it years ago still if the cheap option wasn t possible i would still pay for a new one if that was the cheapest one definitely worth it
it s easy for me to get out of bed light just makes it comfortable
one of my dogs has a low grumbly whine i managed to ignore it then just sleep through it but then awoke to the most atrocious stink i would like to turn off that feature
i found some that look decent for usd gonna buy two and try them on my room thanks
that s the one i found lol it s usd here for the white one cold warm so i ll give it a try i only want it to slowly turn on in the morning to see if it s easier for me to wake up cause i always end up skipping through alarms
real foods get their tastes from chemicals that occur naturally in the plant animal herb whatever chemists can harvest or forge those chemicals and add them to different things it doesn t always work well since most vessels for such chemicals have a taste of their own but sometimes it works really well
real foods taste smell like they do because they contain certain chemicals your tongue nose has sensors for artificial flavors are just those same chemicals or ones that have structures that also trigger those sensors made using a different method than just extracting them from the food they want to mimic see nilered making grape soda flavor from plastic gloves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfz5jq0yuna).
scientists use a process called gas chromatography to analyze the chemicals in natural flavors and try to recreate them in the lab they may also use focus groups to taste and evaluate the artificial flavors to make sure they match the taste of the real thing
to add to this correct answer u steam_titan but if you are still in school they usually teach esterification the smell chemicals are usually esters in high school chemistry the class will smell like bubble gum for weeks
red or blue light is used by the military to help soldiers adjust their eyes for night time it takes minutes for your eyes to adjust to darkness but only moments to adjust to bright light so when you are working at night blue or red light is used to prevent soldiers from breaking their night vision on a submarine this is used for several reasons one it helps with the circadian rhythm since the sub doesn t see day or night out the window having a lower light level on the ship during night time helps the crews with their sleep cycles during combat having lower light in the ship makes it easier to see instrument panels and doesn t interfere with the periscope it also helps in case the lights on the ship get knocked out if the sailors eyes are adjusted to the dark they won t poking around blindly in the dark under minimal light trying to fix the ship
it s not really for stealth it s for night vision red lights don t blind you like white lights do
one the surface red light doesn t carry as far as while light does so low powered red lights are used at night for illumination when keeping things dark is of paramount importance keep in mind things are generally lit just enough to keep you from tripping over stuff it also has the benefit of not affecting your night vision as much as white light does as well undergound underwater in enclosed spaces red lights are used sometimes in these conditions to allow screens and instrument panels to be as visible as possible without glare from white lights on the screen it s easier on the eyes when looking at the screens and panels
several other commenters have already mentioned that red light preserves your night vision which is the main reason it s used but i don t think anyone s really explained why it does that there are two types of cells in your eye that you use to see which are called rods and cones cones are really good at sensing colors which makes them great in most situations but they don t work unless there s enough light rods are the exact opposite they can only really see in black and white but they re incredibly sensitive to light so they re great for night vision the only problem with having both types of cells is that we spend most of our time in brightly lit areas and because rod cells are so sensitive we d be blind if they were always working to fix this your rod cells only activate when they re given a special protein called rhodopsin that s constantly being created by your eyes the reason rhodopsin is special is because light destroys it which means that it never reaches most of the rod cells when you re somewhere bright when it gets dark it s able to start activating rod cells but because your eyes don t create it very quickly it takes around minutes to fully build up and turn all the cells on this is where red light comes in unlike cone cells rod cells and rhodopsin only respond to certain colors of light red isn t one of them so it makes your rod cells activate even though you can still see with your cones and you don t have to wait if it gets dark this is why ships use red lights when they re in combat everyone can see what they need to but if something bad happens they won t be stumbling around in the dark
this is the most complete answer thanks
in addition to the night vision aspect i d point out that you find red lights on ships in passageways that open to the outside because red is much harder to see so it s less likely to give your position away it s also used in berthing compartments for similar reasons in that it doesn t disturb people who are sleeping but you can see well enough to walk around however in places like cic you need to be able to see instruments and controls so blue light is used it doesn t disturb your night vision but has much better contrast blue light would be more visible if it leaked to the outside so it s not used where that could happen
if light goes out on a sub it doesn t matter how adjusted you are there s zero light coming in so no matter how adjusted your pupils are for taking in light if there is none then it s just darkness
you seem to be a dude who knows things is it true that pirates are shown to wear eyepatches for the same reason that by keeping one eye in the dark they could adjust to the darker interiors of the ships or is it just nonsense told to me to shut me up when i was a kid
that doesn t matter on a sub tho
what does on the surface means
i d assume they have independently powered emergency lights i mean my office building had those and the place was a shit hole with a cheap landlord i d hope billion dollar subs have them as well
there s still flashlights chemlights and emergency lights on a submarine as well as some equipmemt with built in battery backups and light sources so the loss of main electrical power wouldn t be quite as dramatic as you assume
the mythbusters proved that this use for eye patches among pirates was plausible but there is no recorded historical evidence for them doing this
it does when its nightime and you need to use the periscope
if the lights are being used it likely means someone is exiting the sub in which case it does
ship on top of the water building or encampment above ground etc
i mean they do but good luck finding them in a blackout also good luck assuming the maintenance was done to ensure the batteries were still good lol as i recall the only non electronic light that we had was very small glow in the dark strips on the eab manifolds
still gotta find the flashlights chemlights are in packaging which i guess wouldn t be too hard to find if you felt around for the eab markers as for battery backed up lights that wasn t on my qual card
what
i mean they do but good luck finding them in a blackout a submariner will know where to find emergency flashlight by feel and the emergency backup lights would be on automatically with a loss of main electrical power also many submariners carry flashlights on their person also good luck assuming the maintenance was done to ensure the batteries were still good lol yes that maintenance will be done that kind of stuff gets checked weekly or monthly and usually gets batteries replaced every months regardless of use what kind of shitty crew did you have
i am not a submariner or the son of one but if i were living inside a small tube underwater i would do everything in my power to make sure it ran properly at all times if whoever is responsible for the emergency lights is slacking off they should be asked to polish the outside of the hull
i was a submariner and the kind of maintenance neglect he s describing would not go over well
dna holds the instructions for each cell in every tissue of your body for how to build the machinery and structure that makes the cells work some changes to dna will change the way that a particular machine works like how there are different kinds of drills and different kinds of screws but many most this is hotly debated of the important changes are when and where and how much of the machinery and structure proteins each cell makes you could build many different shapes of houses with the same tools and same materials depending on how when and where and how much you put them together
the difference has been occuring steadily over he last million years when the great apes including humans descended from a common ancestor this change has occured due to mutations errors in dna occuring during the production of reproductive cells meosis these reproductive cells sperm and eggs will replicate themselves to form all the cells of a living human being mitosis additional mutations can occur during mitosis although these are not typically passed down mutations can be harmful neutral or positive positive ones tend to result in better survival and are more likely to see the person ape survive and reproduce neutral mutations also often continue to pass down dna is just a very long string of repeating repeating molecules all your cells have the same dna generally there are some exceptions that aren t important here the order and number of these molecules is what determines your genetic makeup and this is the underlying blueprint of your body and all its systems so the difference is just the number and order of dna that are different between humans and other great apes
humans and chimps are a lot alike we share almost all of the same dna which is like a blueprint for how our bodies work but there s still a little bit of a difference about that might not seem like a lot but it s enough to make us look and act different from chimps scientists think that the differences in our dna might have happened a long time ago when our ancestors and the ancestors of chimps and apes were starting to evolve into different species some changes might have happened by chance while others might have given some individuals an advantage in survival or reproduction over many generations those differences added up until we became the humans we are today and chimps and apes became the animals they are today
we re also close to bananas see evolution big rabbit hole lots of science there s something called the missing link we adapted and bread based on who survived who was the strongest smartest etc this selected for desirable traits over time long time

the mirror doesn t know anything the light from the object hits the mirror and reflects some of that light hits your eye that tells you there s an object there regardless of the paper
mirrors don t know anything mirrors just reflect light at an angle equal to the angle that the light hits the mirror as long as there s a path for light to travel from an object and enter your eye then you can see the object and that s true even if the light s path involves bouncing off a mirror
just picture a laser beam going from your eye bouncing off of the mirror and hitting the object that s how light works
a mirror is an object that has a smooth surface usually glass coated with a metal that reflects light when light hits the mirror it bounces back at the same angle as it came this creates an image of whatever is in front of the mirror but reversed the image is clear because the mirror does not disrupt the light the mirror needs light to reflect otherwise it is dark so when you put a paper behind a mirror light bounces off the paper and hits the mirror the mirror then reflects that light back to your eyes so you can see the paper behind it
mirrors don t reflect everything in one direction light bounces off every object behind the paper in every direction if you align your eyes with that direction you see the object
they avoid it partially by simply moving their fingers better taking them off the strings instead of dragging them but a lot of it is just really good equipment someone usually operates specialized equipment to manage volume and pitch and often they also filter out those little imperfections it sounds complicated but they just increase the threshold a sound needs to meet before making it to the speakers soft sounds like the squeaking of strings or a draft hitting the mic get filtered out
i play quite a bit but don t think about this question for me i suspect it s a combination of things squeaking would only happen if i m sliding my left hand fingers along the string i only occasionally do that and when i do it s with purpose also my fingertips are awfully tough now a hard callous the string doesn t go far into my skin at all when i press on the string but it would for a new player that creates much more surface to stick to
often they don t i suggest you listen more closely to some recordings with guitar in them here are couple of examples https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o93qp4jbhy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o93qp4jbhy) veruca salt s american thighs is loaded with squeaky chord changes some of it is deliberate i think but definitely not all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ecileqvmq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ecileqvmq) this is an even better example as it s a classical guitarist i think this recording is fantastic but nonetheless you can hear quite a lot of string noise
they have at least a decent level of skill so they effectively change chords without producing unwanted sounds i e they don t unnecessarily touch and slide over the strings studio magic you can filter noises out with noise gates you can remove sounds in post production sometimes they don t avoid the squeaks if you pay attention to recordings you might sometimes catch them
you can get better at moving lifting your hand to reduce the noise made by it sliding against the strings equipment setting can make a difference but also a lot of the time any noise made when changing positions is just masked by other instruments drums bass vocals ect as they are louder sometimes though especially on acoustic intruments in a sparse track it can t be avoided give two hands of a prayer by ben harper a listen i love the song but there is a bit of noise going on in some of the sections
also the squeak can add character and be used to flavour the music especially when i m playing blues i like to keep the sound a bit dirty and raw
in addition to what has already been said the amount of squeaking can be decreased by applying a lubricant to your strings this also cleans the strings and slows down aging that is oxidation so that you can play longer before your strings start to sound dull i use ghs fast fret but there are also other alternatives
i believe it s mainly because they don t drag their figures across the strings they take the pressure off and then move their hand to the new position and then put their figures back on the string and apply pressure
good equipment good strings and strong nimble hands that develop after hundreds and hundreds of hours of practice
a few factors at work here muting one or both hands are softly muting the strings that shouldn t be ringing out even during chord changes intentional notes chords are vastly louder than string swiping being quick the time between chords changes is often small fractions of a second there s a common effect pedal called a noise gate that eliminates basically anything quiet that isn t a normal guitar sound they don t you can hear string swiping often
this is accomplished by using flat wound strings they have been in use for decades the gap is smaller thereby producing less noise they are especially effective on electric guitars
that s quite interesting does this also happen when they re playing live
when i first started playing guitar many years ago my fingers hurt a lot before the calluses eventually formed i now only occasionally play often with months of no playing in between it never hurts as much as it did back then and the calluses re form within a couple of days i find that very interesting
came here to say this you even hear it on records a lot of the time
american thighs is the exact album i thought of after reading the question you can really hear it on seether fly and victrola
i imagine that must be super hard to do in rock songs
yeah definitely finding the right settings is a pain which is why they need a professional but once the settings are figured out they only need to monitor they don t have to check each individual note strumming a guitar is 10x louder than the squeaking strings so those settings are relatively easy to figure out it s more difficult with singing because you need all the nuances of the voice
you would be shocked to know all the things that sound engineers for live concerts are able to do
on seether i m pretty sure it s deliberate not sure about the others though
in my experience it depends on the gauge of string and the processing being used heavy gauge strings tend to be the worst round wound brass strings can have quite a lot of squeak when moving along the string this is more obvious in acoustic songs where processing tends to be minimal narrow gauge strings more common on electric guitars have less squeak and when combined with processing such as distortion and chorus effects common in rock music is pretty well disguised squeak can also be reduced through damping techniques such as palm resting again more common in rock or heavier music obviously you can also prevent it by not dragging your fingers across the strings between notes and chords tl dr you can control it through string choice and playing technique
yes there are some subtle differences in facial proportions between a mirror and a camera lenses because of focal distance but that s not what you re asking about no one s face is perfectly symmetrical in fact if you take half of a person s face copy and flip it and stick it together to be perfect in photoshop our brain rebels and finds it super creepy and ugly by looking at yourself over and over in the mirror your brain has gotten used to your asymmetries in a certain configuration when you see them flipped by a camera it s new to your brain again and so looks weird unattractive however realize other people s brains have also gotten used to the flipped camera you the same way your brain has gotten used to the mirror you if they saw mirror you they would think it looks equally weird to them as camera you looks to you so camera you is what people actually see physically but mirror you is closer to how people actually see you attractiveness wise
our faces are not perfectly symmetrical there are subtle differences on either side that are noticeable when an image is flipped the image taken by a regular camera or the back camera of your phone is how others see you while the image you see in a mirror or using your phone s front camera unless you ve fiddled with the settings is what you re used to seeing the unmirrored image looks strange to you because you re only able to see yourself in a mirror so that is the image you ve become accustomed to even though it isn t accurate to how others see you
the photo is how other people really see you in a mirror it is flipped in the mirror your left side is on the left side of the mirror but if you are facing someone the left side of your body is on their right side
photo cameras can distort how you appear most phone cameras have very wide lenses which will give you a fish eye like effect if you put it too close to you it appears fine if you take photos from a distance though around mm lenses would make you appear normal which many phone cameras don t have 50mm is what portrait photos are usually shot at
normal mirror accurate normal cameras and mobile s back camera accuracy depends on the lens length usually the normal length for accurate facial dimention is between 50mm to 85mm mobile s front camera not accurate because it flips pictures from right to left and because it uses wide angel lens
cameras are very different than a mirror imagine looking at a picture of someone versus meeting them in person it s an approximation of the human eye depth of field can be very different the colors could be off and lighting and shutter speed can make a big difference in the final image not to mention the total lack of body language
that s trippy bruh
epically stated to my y o brain
so now i wonder when we take selfies are we looking at our mirror selves or our picture selves through the screen what image does the brain interpret
yes
this sounds like it can t be true but i super hope it is
how people feel about you also influences how they see you attractiveness wise
i certainly hope you are right i find i look decent in a mirror but weird in most pictures
great explanation easy to remember too thank you
so in theory long time narcissistic selfie takers have no such problem
i thought the more symmetrical one s face the more attractive they were according to mathematical beauty standards
great explanation
it s worth noting that it s 50mm with a full frame camera easy to google and figure out if it s not
i didn t realize they were different til you asked i just thought i had really shitty pics
if you want to know just how different you look to other people look at someone else that you know very well in a mirror girlfriend roommate family really look and see the ways they look different you can tell it s them but they don t look quite the same the amount of difference you see there is the same as between what you see of yourself and how others see you
have a look at mirrored image of someone you know it will look weird to you and normal to them
what s interesting is that most phone front facing selfie cameras actually flip the image back to mirror you because otherwise everyone keeps thinking their pictures look bad also people have trouble lining up their shot that way people are used to moving their face to the right and seeing mirror them move to the right they re used to posing that way if the camera showed what it actually sees then when your face moves to the right camera you would move to the left this freaks people out so the phones intentionally flip it again to work like mirror you
what s funny is that selfie takers who post the flipped mirror version of themselves because it looks better to them are actually posting the worse looking version to others
only up to a point if it gets too close to symmetrical our brain suddenly freaks out and finds it unnatural and creepy
what s interesting is that most phone front facing selfie cameras actually flip the image back to mirror you because otherwise everyone keeps thinking their pictures look bad and then those people post the images the wrong way can best be seen if text on a shirt is mirrored and people who know those person things wait a minute why does he she look so different i use the mirrored image while taking the photo but it will be save the correct not mirrored way i would recommend to set this feature on their phone for everyone
never realized that just opened my front cam you are right and now i can never unsee this haha
thank you
i m confused now
short version you find yourself looking better in a mirrored picture others find your looking better in a non mirrored picture x200b so if you post mirrored pictures of yourself on instagram you think you are looking fine as you look like in a mirror but other people find you disgusting maybe a bit odd because they are used to the non mirrored look of you x200b it is really extrem with my cat which has the left half of its face brown and the other black as soon as i see the cat in a mirror or a mirrored picture it does not look like my cat anymore it looks totally random
disgusting lol
fats are just big molecules comprised of carbon oxygen and hydrogen the body breaks down those molecules for energy after broken down you end up with various quantities of co2 and h20 as those are very stable molecules thats basically all chemistry is breaking down molecules and building new things out of the pieces
in aerobic respiration fats and sugars which are composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen react with oxygen from the lungs carried by the blood to form water and carbon dioxide the result is a release of energy used to move muscles reacting a carbon hydrogen fuel with oxygen in this manner is essentially a combustion reaction so the phrase burning fat is more literal than you might have thought though in this case the process is controlled by enzymes
and specifically your body breaks them down in such a way that it can use the energy as input to the creation or movement of other molecules the fat molecules are broken down while attached to enzymes that cause that breakdown to also produce atp the main short term energy storage molecule in your body you can think of it as sort of the chemical equivalent of letting one object drop breaking down the fat molecule onto a see saw to push another object up creating the atp molecule
by removing the energy this is either by pumping it away like in a fridge or air conditioner or introducing it to something with less energy than it like an ice cube differences in temperature want to equalize so sticking something cold with less energy and something hot with more energy the heat energy will flow into the cold thing with less energy until everything has the same amount
we move heat to another location a refrigerator is a heat pump there is a compressor that compresses the coolant if you compress a gas the temperature increase if you use a bicycle pump you will notice the nozzle gets warm the next step is to let the coolant run through a heat exchange with the environment the environment is usually air passively or with air blown by a fan the coolant that is warmer than the air transfer heat to it the air get warmer and the coolant cooler a preferred heat exchange will result in both at the same temperature the next step is to let the coolant to a nozzle where it can expand in volume a gas gets colder when it expands that is why the nozzle of a spray can get cold the lower pressure gas it no let through another heat exchange it will be inside the refrigerator the gas will be heated by stuff in the refrigerator the coolant get warmer and what is in the refrigerator get coolant if the heat exchange was perfect both end up at the same temperature the next step is back to the compressor again so we could stuff down by moving heat the energy the compressor us will become heat too so more energy is radiated out to the air then was removed from the inside of the refrigerator so there is a total increase in thermal energy even if we cool stuff so you can t just cool something without heating up anything else too that is the case if you do that with an external energy source you can have a total decrease in temperature if you change the phase of something you then have a change of energy from thermal to chemical potential energy it will be limited by the amount of material you have available evaporating water is likely the most common example of this
to cool something down you need to remove energy from it by transferring heat to something else there are different ways to do this like by putting the object in contact with something cooler blowing air over it or allowing it to radiate heat to cooler surroundings refrigeration and air conditioning are also specialized methods of cooling that use a combination of these processes so basically cooling is the opposite of heating you re taking energy away instead of adding it
the strategy is to take advantage of evaporation condensation and generally compression of a gas fluid to move heat energy we have a machine that uses the concepts of how a can of compressed air gets cold as you spray it in order to make itself cold in one location this gas fluid runs in a loop so that the supply of compressed air is continuous so we can keep spraying it and keep the cold coming getting hot on one side and cold on the other so it s often called a heat pump though the name tends to be specific to certain types of heating and cooling systems this is why air conditioners are always at least partially outside there may be some outdoor unit outside your home connected by pipes or it s a machine you hang out your window the hot air is just vented into the outside air the cold air is blown into the building keeping it cool a refrigerator gets warm behind and above itself since that space is the outside for it
we cool things down by moving the heat somewhere else that process of moving the heat creates heat by itself no thermal cycle is efficient or more efficient than the ideal carnot cycle so that adds heat to the removed heat we make more heat than the one we removed nothing in universe cools down by itself the third law of thermodynamics says that system entropy always increases some say that is the only law that points to the existence of an arrow of time how time flows only in one direction
we give the object s heat energy a path to follow so that it loses heat faster than it gains heat from other sources
heat always transfers and disperses through many different processes in an attempt to reach equilibrium that is everything and everywhere being the same temperature this is of course not possible at least not in a time frame smaller than billions and billions of years and does not concern us the point is that heat transfers and while the thermal conductivity of different materials may be different and some may be very good insulators ultimately it s not possible to entirely trap and maintain heat so it will eventually cool down this is a process that we can accelerate and take advantage of to cool down objects or spaces for various reasons in the case of refrigerators or air conditioners the main way this is achieved is through essentially displacing the heat elsewhere and if you do this fast enough you can lower the temperature faster than it can heat up from ambient temperature of course all that means that the heat has to go somewhere which is why the back of refridgerators or the external a c units blow out fairly hot air when in operation much warmer than the ambient air
heat is the quantity of thermal energy in a substance temperature is the concentration of thermal energy in that same substance heat moves from regions of high concentration to regions of lower concentration from high temperature to lower temperature if you keep the same amount of energy in a substance but reduce the volume that substance occupies the concentration of thermal energy increases the temperature rises even though no thermal energy was added or removed if you keep the same amount of thermal energy in the substance but increase the volume the substance occupies you decrease the temperature to cool something you first increase the pressure of a gas temperature rises heat flows from high temperature gas to ambient temperature environment until the compressed gas temperature equalizes with ambient now you put the compressed gas next to the object you want to cool and you expand it temperature falls the heat from the object flows into the gas lowering the temperature of the object and raising the temperature of the gas now take the gas away from the object and compress the gas again repeating the cycle
water is much denser than air so light passes more slowly through it the lower the wavelength of the light like red light the more it is refracted the deeper in the water you go higher wavelengths can be seen deeper compared to lower wavelength of light is the basic concept but at a deep enough depth no light reaches it
water is a pale blue colour which is to say that it absorbs red light the farther light has to travel through water the more red light is absorbed giving objects a blue appearance
deleted
the lower the wavelength of the light like red light the more it is refracted it s the other way around blue light is refracted more than red light photo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sz%c3%adnszrds_prizmn2.jpg).
light does not always travel the same speed through a substance
this is only kind of correct light is absolutely slowed in various medium the speed of light in a vacuum is constant but light is slowed by various materials in various ways and water has a relatively high index of refraction which is what it s called the individual photons however are not slowed but the light is and this slowing of the wave front is actually how refraction works and it s also how things like neutrino detectors typically work neutrino collisions cause particles to fly off at incredible speeds specifically faster than the speed of light in that medium this causes a photonic boom similar to a sonic boom where a cone shaped wave front propagates through the medium called cherenkov radiation
not exactly we don t really know why but light does behave like it s just moving slower in a medium the speed of light is called that because that s how we discovered that speed but really it s the speed of causality and things that usually move at that speed can be slowed down how exactly is uncertain
thanks i wasn t quite sure about the terminology so when water absorbs light is that energy converted to heat
slight correction no light does not always move the same speed the speed of light is only the speed of light in a vacuum light does move at different speeds through other materials including water than it does through empty space
totally true good distinction to make
partially maybe but also just light it s why the top of the ocean is lighter and more transparent than the depths
a saline solution is basically medical water it doesn t do much other than rinse out a wound it s also what they put in an iv when a patient is dehydrated peroxide actually works to kill potential infections the liquid works as an antiseptic so instead of rinsing out bacteria it kills them
hydrogen peroxide will also kill your body s own cells and thus actually slow the healing process the modern thinking is not to use hydrogen peroxide on wounds
the modern thinking is not to use hydrogen peroxide on wounds if they re typical wounds and better disinfectants are available it is a good disinfectant and it s better than nothing in cases where there s significant risk of infection there just isn t much risk for minor scratches you re treating at home and regular old soap and water works fine for that
i would think a wound with ground in gravel or dirt peroxide might be beneficial for disinfecting and killing enough of the area the dirt debris doesn t get trapped inside and healed over
the gravity waves aren t generated inside the black hole they re generated outside the black hole as it moves around since the waves start outside the black hole they can escape
nothing supposedly escapes a bh although hawking disagreed with his hawking radiation thing and so do i nothing is perfect stuff called quantum foam is fizzing out which is negative energy interacting indirectly with our dimension stuff inside bh looks more like _ _ __ and outside like o maby this is how particles form aswell by changing shape to fit in besides those waves are generated by some event like colliding black holes afaik
there is a difference between gravity waves and gravitational waves since you re talking about black holes i assume you are asking about gravitational waves gravitational waves are distortions in spacetime caused by massive objects accelerating sort of dragging spacetime with it causing ripples radiating outwards a blackhole does not radiate appreciable gravitational waves unless it s in a binary system with very short orbit close to merging gravity waves are phenomena that oscillate under the influence of gravity like waves on a lake the reason nothing nothing can escape beyond a black holes event horizon is that spacetime is curved beyond the point where any path through it curves inward gravitational effects of this curvature of spacetime still exist beyond the event horizon because this is just another effect of it gravity isn t affected by the local curvature it is the cause of it
glutenintolerance is not an allergy it s an autoimmune disease it is not supposed to happen allergies arent either the amount of years consuming this stuff doesnt have an effect on why and if mistakes happen in your body lactose intolerance is an example of the things you are talking about and this is because humans arent supposed to consume milk after a certain age they naturally lose the capability to produce lactase but in this case thousands of years consuming it did have the effect you are talking about many ppl nowadays do produce lactase even as adults
simply put there s nothing really to select against it in such a way that either would be considerably less likely to happen being allergic to alcohol or gluten wouldn t ever have been a particularly devastating affliction other than in a society where food included them in huge basically exclusively amounts the fact that the bread and beer tribes didn t take over the world means that those with alcohol or gluten intolerance simply weren t at threat to being wiped out so the genes survive it s basically the same reason as to why people who get wisdom teeth still exist they aren t usually lethal so there s not much for nature to select them out of the population and replace them with us mutants that have the non wisdom teeth gene
allergy or any form of immunity isn t heritable for the most part so consuming bread for millenia just doesn t really matter our changing standards of hygiene are a vastly bigger deal
people live long enough to become grandparents even if they have untreated celiac disease so they pass their genes there are various forms of alcohol intolerance if people had instant alcoholism gene they had it easier to handle their liquor before invention of distillation also some kind of alcoholism was a norm in the history
eli5 you know how sometimes you go to the store and buy something you like but when you take it out of the box for some reason it just doesn t work right somethings wrong and it just doesn t work right even though you had plenty of them before that worked fine like that but with people
nobody is allergic to alcohol some people do have a genetic trend of not producing an enzyme or producing a less effective one but that s not an allergy gluten is an autoimmune response just like allergies allergies are very common
the environment hasn t produced the conditions where one set of genes would be fitter than another in the context of consuming alcohol and gluten in an extreme case let s say the only viable food source was gluten bread that is that is the only food in the whole world that we can consume over time those who can more easily digest gluten bread are more likely to live longer and reproduce thus carrying their generic disposition to process gluten but in the real world people can and will consume gluten bread more importantly they also eat other foods you can survive without bread and many cultures don t eat bread as a staple thus we re not going to see a genetic shift to reduce intolerance to specific foods because they will live long and prosper by simply not consuming the foods they cannot eat
lactose intolerance is an example of the things you are talking about yeah lactose intolerance is the default for all mammals except humans and most humans outside europe and some parts of the middle east it s more reasonable to talk about it in terms of _lactase persistence_ as the unusual feature
bread and beer tribes didn t take over the world who do you think the europeans are
we ve been around grass and other pollens for longer than we ve been human and yet hayfever is still a thing it s way more ridiculous a design flaw than any food intolerance imo
cats drink milk as adults too and love to eat butter and whipped cream
in case this isn t a joke i meant societies that exclusively consumed those foodstuffs which would affect people who have the intolerances
bread and beer is much older than advanced civilizations in europe ancient egypt had beer and bread yet we aren t all egyptians are we
they like it but it s bad for them
yeah but the egyptians didn t take over the world

some cats have lactase persistence but it s rare yours might ve been one such cat it s still bad for cats in general https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do/blog/vet-qa-can-cats-drink-milk). we tend to think of dogs as pure carnivores but they re actually somewhere between carnivores and omnivores almost every dog i know likes veggies
my dog goes crazy for any kind of crunchy veggies like lettuce celery carrots cauliflower leaves etc
almost every dog i know likes veggies i had a mate whos husky was pregnant she was constantly hungry my friends mother laughed and said ok let s see her eat this and fed her chopped lime halves the dog devoured them in seconds and was immediately looking up for more we had a hard laugh at that
milk might actually do more harm than good to your feline friend giving your cat milk can seriously unbalance their diet and lead to them gaining weight it s not cut and dry fact it s a might and a matter of actual quantity personally i never fed my cat a ton of milk or cream just as a treat like in humans
one my mom s dogs was absolutely crazy for runner beans of all things
i assume you mean on a 1080p monitor if so 4k downscaled to 1080p has benefits bitrate and chroka 4k streaming has a higher data rate than 1080p thru the same platform and that data allows for less compression grouping nearby pixels into having the same color and or brightness here is apple trailers vs youtube https://imgur.com/gallery/9ncfu) for some movie trailers and keep in mind uploading these screenshots also goes thru compression chroma is how much color light info is stored the best is but most all platforms use or many cameras don t even shoot in by playing a 4k video on a 1080p monitor it is a scale so each 2x2 grid of original pixels now makes new pixel allowing for giving even better color light precision
the resolution you re seeing on the same monitor will be the same but on common streaming platforms such as youtube and netflix streaming in 4k supplies a higher bitrate this means in simple terms you ll have fewer compression artifacts and get a much more pure video stream
depending on the source higher bitrate video may use a different codec for example h264 is only a standard in tv broadcasts to 1080p then they switch to h265 for 4k this gives it a generational quality boost in the video codec some hardware video players even if capable of 4k can t play h264 above 1080p if that s not the situation eg youtube it s still typical to give higher bitrates to 4k than to 1080p it turns out video bitrate is a major defining factor in image quality and just generally more bits is better for image quality even when the resolution changes alongside it and finally digital video is compressed in one special way rather than sending the image as red green and blue layers it s sent as a brightness layer and colour layers it s sorta like how in photoshop and other image editing tools you can select a colour as hue saturation and luminosity but not quite the same the twist is the colour layers are actually half width and half height of the actual image size the brightness layer is full resolution this means that in any 2x2 group of pixels aligned on the main 2x2 grid are all the same basic colour and only vary in brightness from black to a nice bright red orange yellow green etc this means when you take a 4k image and compress it you get 1080p resolution colour layers this can provide that very small subtle quality improvement because it gives each 1080p scaled pixel its own unique colour
all video data is sent using lossy compression when you ask the streaming service for the 1080p file they send you the one that looks pretty good when uncompressed and shown at 1080p it throws away a lot of data but keeps enough that it looks pretty close maybe the blue sky doesn t smoothly transition and is a bit blocky but on your average 1080p screen you re unlikely to see it a 4k screen will show you more data the pixels are smaller and there s a lot more so you re expecting to see finer detail to support this the streaming service sends you the file that is expected to look pretty good on a 4k screen its still thrown out a ton of data but it has also sent you 10x more data than it would have for the 1080p video the end result is that the more data you have the more detail was saved in the compression process and the better the video you watch will look but unless there s a need the standard 1080p compression is usually good enough and since its wayyy smaller its preferred
the theory is that small flies do this to better attract sexual partners each swarm only contains male or female flies each fly emits a scent corresponding to its sex one fly can t produce much scent but a swarm of same sex flies can this attracts flies of the opposite sex to that swarm a fly of the opposite sex basically homes in on that swarm by its scent and mates with the first fly it bumps into
they aren t picky it seems
the fourier transform converts signal vs time to intensity vs frequency effectively breaking the signal into it s frequency components the fast part of fft is a particular algorithm that makes it easier for computers to do this conversion the intensity vs frequency graph is useful for finding particular noises like clicks etc you ll recognise the spectrum analyser is the result of an fft
the fast fourier transform is a tool that helps people who work with sound to understand what kind of sounds are in a piece of music or other audio recording it does this by breaking down the sound into tiny parts and figuring out what kinds of sound frequencies are present in each part this is helpful because different frequencies of sound can make a big difference in how a piece of music sounds for example high frequencies can make a sound seem bright or sharp while low frequencies can make it seem deep or booming the fft is like a special microscope that lets us look at a sound and see all of its different parts so we can understand it better and do cool things with it like making it sound different or removing unwanted noise
i d say with respect to audio in particular the fourier transform will tell you how loud amplitude the sounds of different pitches frequencies are in each short section of music if you make the section of music you transform at a time longer you can separate the pitches more finely but as a result it will be an average over that longer period of time the fast fourier transform fft is just a computationally efficient way of performing a fourier transform with a digital computer
i find this picture helpful https://www.nti-audio.com/portals/0/pic/news/fft-time-frequency-view-540.png as you can see it takes all the frequencies that are appearing and shows it as amplitude ffts are popular for measuring audio gear as distortion is just unwanted frequencies besides the frequencies you want so if you play a 1khz tone any other tones showing up will be distortion here is an fft of a speaker amplifier with low distortion https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?attachments/topping-la90-measurements-low-gain-integrated-amplifier-high-performance-png.202314/) here is an fft of a speaker amplifier with high distortion https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?attachments/smsl-sa100-bluetooth-amplifier-audio-measurements-png.37977/)
big thanks goes out to urinal_deuce and lordeararse
thank you but how is it different to normal analog to digital conversion and how small short are the segments of the audio that sampled and analyzed there is spectral re synthesis is this a similar concept
great thanks
how is it different to normal analog to digital conversion by not being a conversion the fft is an algorithm for performing fourier transforms that transforms an already digitised time domain representation of a signal to the frequency domain
analog to digital encoding like you d find in an adc is sample space to sample space like a graph of amplitude over time but fourier transform goes from sample space to frequency space a different domain so you get a set of frequencies that made up the audio being transformed because of this the size of the segments being analyzed depends a lot on the range of frequencies being analyzed for low frequencies you need a large enough window to capture at least a full period of the frequency spectral synthesis is kind of the opposite process it combines frequencies and their durations into something in sample space
would this analogy be appropriate i can represent a numerical temperature as a color by representing numbers as colors blue to red cold to hot to help visualize temperatures on maps the transform is far simpler in this case
right thanks that makes sense about slower waveforms
it would be similar if you consder that all the atoms have a range of temperatures kinetic energy and the fft of the all the atoms at a point in time would give you the breakdown of how many atoms had were at each temperature
chatgpt one of the most famous ai chat bots out there actually works in a very similar way to how the predictive text function on your cellphone might work it looks at all of the words given to it and then uses its vast knowledge of word sequences to generate a list of the most likely word to come after the one that was just typed it then picks one from the list generally going with the top result the result is something that is very human in nature to build up this massive index of knowledge they essentially feed this massive algorithm part of a news article and then ask it to finish the article it s then compared with the actual result and the ai learns from its mistakes do this enough times and it gets really good at predicting what the next word is going to be but you have to be careful because if you tell the ai to do this too much it starts just regurgitating the original text that it was fed with so they need to strike a middle ground between these two where the ai can create something that s new but isn t a totally random string of words the major difference between something like chatgpt and the predictive text on your phone though is that chatgpt has essentially virtually typed all of the data that it has seen billions and billions of times over as a result the predictive text algorithm is very good it also has an advantage over traditional predictive text algorithms of being able to look back at all the words that have previously been typed in the entire conversation to determine the next response whereas the type of algorithm used by your phone usually only looks back at a word or two and only really learns based on your writing style now the dataset that chatgpt has seen remains a secret at least to my knowledge someone please correct me if the dataset or the content of the dataset is available but it s pretty evident that it contains a bunch of information from a ton of publicly available forums where people go to ask questions and get responses from actual humans like those from microsoft stackoverflow and reddit as well as a ton of publicly available news articles and other websites that s why it s really good at generating how to style responses now this isn t all chatbots that are out there if you visit a website that has an integrated chat function that doesn t just connect you directly to a human odds are that it functions similar to a google search of predefined help articles typically these types of chatbots just look for specific keywords for example your electric company might have a chat bot that lets you enter some text and you enter something like i need to pay my electric bill and it will return an article about accessing your account and paying your bill from your input it may have picked out keywords such as pay and bill and decided that you want help paying your bill there are a ton of chatbots out there though and this is a very very simplified version of how certain chatbots work if you re interested in learning more please feel free to ask questions i ve been doing research into ai models for about years now and it s something i m actually very passionate about
they have a huge database of commands the microphone lets it understand your voice the same way voice typing does and if what you say matches something in the database they follow the command most of them require your commands to be like accurate or something since different people speak differently which is why they sometimes do something completely different from what you say to have them seem more like a person they have a set of responses for when they don t know what to do
well your understanding is a bit incorrect japan industrialized very quickly after ww2 the focus was on heavy industry automobiles electronics electronic manufacturing equipment chemicals and consumer electronics it had a large well educated and homogenous population making it somewhat easier to enact industrial policy at a nationwide scale japan grew to the 2nd largest economy by the 1980s all of this was supported by a fairly open trade policy with the us primarily and western europe that allowed them to grow their domestic firms in the early s the problems started to become evident a lot of growth was supported by domestic banks lending to industries and being a bit too closely linked to them as the yen strengthened their exports began to lose competitiveness with the other asian tigers s korea taiwan etc china opening up both boosted japan s ability to off shore their business and also became competitors for low end products domestically from the s until today japan is the 3rd largest economy in the world it cannot be described as poor on total or per capita basis the gdp per capita is one of the highest globally if you exclude micro nations despite having a large population there are few countries with a higher standard of living japan has more people than germany uk etc and maintains a similar gdp per capita making them very wealthy country although domestic growth has been limited a full picture has to include japanese offshore factories demographically japan has an aging and shrinking population this leads to a liquidity trap situation where domestic savings being rather high lead to lack of domestic consumption
imagine you have a lemonade stand that becomes super popular you sell lots and lots of lemonade and you get lots of money that s like japan in the 1980s they made many cool things like cars and electronics and people all around the world bought them then you think your lemonade stand is doing so well that you start spending lots of money on stuff like fancy cups and decorations thinking it ll keep getting better but suddenly people stop buying your lemonade because they find other options that s like japan in the 1990s they spent too much money on things like land and buildings thinking their success would last forever but other countries started making cool things too and japan s economy slowed down the money they spent didn t help them as much as they thought and they lost a lot of their wealth and that s why japan s economy went from really good to not so good
japan focused a lot on automation and quality they had population primarily in the peak age for production and work output and were able to quickly and seriously compete with us manufacturers of things such as electronics and cars their demographic advantage was short lived and soon after us companies began heavily modernizing in order to compete
example honda started out making lawnmowers there are no lawns in japan
mostly they focus on legitimate archival that doesn t draw any copyright claims such as abandoned content but they absolutely do respect legitimate dmca takedown requests https://help.archive.org/help/i-cant-find-my-items/). one thing that s special about them is that they received an exemption for the dmca anti circumvention clause https://archive.org/about/dmca.php). this allows them to host materials with copy protection removed recently they ve come under fire because of their digital lending library https://www.npr.org/2023/03/26/1166101459/internet-archive-lawsuit-books-library-publishers).
edit dang sorry i didn t realize this was elif this explanation is probably more explain it like i m ten apologies an archivist s job is to preserve objects and information that has historical obvious value or potentially undiscovered historical value this is seen as a good to society and perpetuates into the future that is if something is copyrighted today that is a legal protection of someone s rights to their intellectual property however at some point in the future intellectual property rights expire depending on the media after all if you re dead it doesn t make sense any more to protect your right to make money off your own creative efforts at that point your work s primary value is as an historical artifact that should be preserved so that we do not forget our past the best time to preserve cultural artifacts is when they still have their full relevance the people alive at the time a cultural item is produced are the ones best equipped to explain its full contextual significance as those people age and die a thing s contextual meaning can fade out and disappear completely because we don t want parts of the internet to disappear or for us to lose their meaning archive org is allowed to create their live ongoing snapshot of this public place while today while they still have value and contextual meaning another reason for this is that as things lose their monetary value over time they are often discarded by the people who were originally exploiting them for gain so these items aren t just permanently deleted and thus lost and forgotten copies are archived today before they can lose all their value
archive org uses webcrawlers to make archival copies of websites and their content archival means for the purpose of permanent long term preservation description and access libraries and archives have the right to collect copyrighted work as well as create archival copies of the work that doesn t mean they can make it available to the public automatically the internet archive abides by copyright guidelines as they apply to the content in their collection all digitized books for example are only available if they are in the public domain ie no longer under copyright however unlike brick and mortar libraries the internet archive wants to lend digitized versions of copyrighted works this isn t a new concept it s called controlled digital lending and the idea is that libraries are adapting to how media is produced in the 21st century libraries and archives have been developing this framework for a while now it s the next logical step in providing access to information as a public service so any archive can store material they can also alter the format ie digitize of things they have purchased with the goal of long term preservation they can t freely distribute copies though they can still only loan only the number of copies they purchased they do not need approval from the copyright holders to do this it s protected by law this is called fair use and is intended to be a guideline for how libraries and archives can legally operate but hachette v internet archive will determine whether or not to include cdl controlled digital lending as a legitimate extension of fair use
it s not copyright free it s probably supposed to be but if you re looking for old yet still copyrighted material it s a go to
i used to work there a lifetime ago and it was actually my job to respond to takedown requests there s this thing called robots txt that allows websites to tell others search engines and such what content should be off limits for example in the robots txt file you would have a line that says disallow cgi and the search engines would skip over the stuff in the cgi directory and yes to the others that mention dmca takedown requests yes the archive honors those but that is a last resort
so you know how you have a toy box where you keep all your favorite toys well archive org is kind of like a really really big toy box but instead of toys it keeps lots of old websites videos music and other things that people have made over the years now just like how you might ask your friends if you can borrow their toys to play with the people who run archive org ask if they can borrow all these old things and keep them safe in their toy box sometimes the people who made these things say yes and then they give archive org permission to keep their stuff in the toy box for everyone to see and use and sometimes the people who made these things are not around anymore so nobody knows who to ask for permission in that case archive org just keeps the thing in the toy box and lets people look at it but they try really hard to make sure they re not doing anything wrong now sometimes when people make things like videos or music they say that nobody is allowed to use their stuff without asking first that s called copyright archive org is very careful to follow the copyright rules and they only keep things in the toy box that the people who made them said were okay to use so if you want to use something from archive org in your own project you should make sure that it says you re allowed to do that first overall archive org is a really cool toy box that lets people see and use all sorts of interesting things that people made a long time ago
thank you for all the comments i m going to stick to the safe side and not use it for any uni projects incase any of footage i was looking at is just archived copyrighted material we don t fall under dmca laws either in the uk so wouldn t be too sure where i stand with any of that either but still pretty interesting thank u

archive org allows people to upload basically anything they want i assume they take down anything that they get dmca requests for but there is a ton of stuff on there that is absolutely protected by copyright
all the material on archive org is under the same copyright protection as if it was still in its original location you don t get any special license and you can t just take and use stuff without violating the original terms material falls under several broad categories public domain the copyrights have elapsed naturally or were released by their holders a large amount of historical literature falls under this category free for any use abandonware the material is still under copyright but the holders do not practically exist a lot of old computer games fall under this category as the companies that owned them have been sold split and dissolved you are very unlikely to get in trouble for reuse and morally it s probably ok too licensed the copyright holders specifically allow archive org to publish the material they could have uploaded it themselves or reached out for specific archival projects personal use and research are probably fine but you won t be protected if you start reselling it or something unlicensed all other material still under copyright if the holders want they can issue takedown notices and have it removed for the most part they either don t care or see the common value in archival most of the web archive falls under this category as archive org makes no profit and cooperates with requests they are fine to carry on you however would not be
at one point archive org downloaded the entire music library of the now defunct what cd torrent tracker but they didn t make it available for copyright reasons not sure what became of it since
recently got into creating the ultimate emulation box and turns out archive org is the best place to get entire game sets for both old and not so old systems
excellent answer for why but doesn t address the how either legally or technically
it s ok the responses aren t supposed to be for literal year olds it s in the sub info
can t you copy the loaned item
which is why why the standard way to archive a website is with wget wget mcpke robots off example com will specifically ignore the robots file you can also easily replace the user agent string with anything you want although that s considered to be shadier it s polite to put your email in the user agent string

i watched a whole ass animated superman movie on their for free and was very confused as to why it was on there
going to assume they archived it
what do you mean by game sets
technically loads an loads of storage servers legally they have a dmca exemption for some items mostly software which require physical keys or media to run and do respect dmca takedowns where applicable
he said that people who created the things might die so copyright is useless at that situation but i dont think he mentioned how it is done for alive people s work
legally no technically yes
cdl is a method which prevents unauthorized copying there s various ways to do this ranging from user friendly ie agreeing you won t copy to less user friendly ie requiring specific software to access the file that prevents things like saving or printing but it s really not that different than checking out a library book and making photocopies there s always a way around for people to pirate things but that s hardly new

in finance leverage means borrowing money to increase the size of your investment this term is used because it multiplies the potential profit or loss of your investment like how a lever multiplies the force provided by the user if you buy of shares and they rise in value by you have made profit if you use of your money plus of borrowed money to buy shares and they rise by you have made profit so of your initial investment a buyout is the act of buying the controlling stake e g in a company from its existing owners so a leveraged buyout is done where you don t have or don t want to spend enough money to buy that controlling stake you go to a bank and borrow the difference as a loan to allow you to make the purchase the neat thing is that you can then potentially transfer responsibility for paying back the loan from yourself to the company the benefit for the purchaser is that they gain a company while spending very little of their own money the disadvantage for the company is that it is now saddled with lots of debt that must be paid off
when you borrow say of the money to buy something possibly a company often the loan will use the assets of the business and the buyers personal assets as a guarantee management buy outs mbo are often like this
lets say you buy a home for 2m you don t have a million so you borrow 8m you have taken on 8m in debt and receive an asset worth 1m personally now lets say instead the person you wish to buy from already had a loan of 8m while you could get a new loan pay the seller 2m and have them pay off their loan instead if the property is wrapped in a company with the company owning the property and holding the loan you could simply buy the company from the seller for 200k the existing loan stays with the property and you save on financing costs now imagine this same situation but the seller has a company with a 2m property and a 1m loan you want to buy it but you don t want to spend 1m you d like to spend 200k option take out a loan for 800k buy property for 1m receive a company with 2m in property 1m in loans and have a 800k personal loan the seller receives his 1m in equity from the sale and the buyer ends up with a 2m property and 8m in loans or option have the company refinance into a 8m loan taking out 800k in cash the seller withdraws the 800k in cash and you pay him 200k so he gets his 1m in equity the buyer ends up with a company with a 2m property and 8m in loans option is a leveraged buyout these should have the same effect on the balance sheet a leveraged buyout has some benefits though if the company is limited liability then the owner doesn t take on personal responsibility for the loan which is worth a lot also the buyer doesn t have to qualify for and find 1m in financing only 200k you can think of a leveraged buyout as a cash out refinance against the business followed by a sale of the business with both assets and the new liabilities
musk did this with twitter used very little of his own money while getting full control of it
lets take a concrete example bob has a company that has 2m in assets no debt and pays him a yearly dividend of 40k bob could have the company leverage its assets taking on a 8m loan and paying a 8m dividend the new company would have 2m in assets 8m in loans and pay a yearly dividend of that cash is being used to pay off the loan this would be a less healthy company a company can always pay less dividends but cannot easily pay less in debt payments and has costs associated with it interest costs but would allow bob to get cash out of the company but lets say bob is not interested in this but he is interested in selling he doesn t want to be in that business anymore alice is interested in buying but alice doesn t want to spend 2m to buy a company with 2m in assets and 40k in yearly dividends alice would like to spend 200k to buy a company with 2m in assets and 8m in debt and in yearly dividends a leveraged buyout is basically doing the leveraging of the company and the sale of the company in one transaction bob doesn t want to take on the debt to the company without the sale but it is no different to him if someone buys 2m in company for 2m or a 2m company with 8m in debt for 200k with him getting the 8m either way bob gets his 2m in company value
i do not agree with the initial premise there are plenty of dishes in asia that have goat or duck but deboned for example shredded duck fried rice or goat biryani or stew and soup made from both similarily there are plenty of dishes that are not goat or duck that include bones fried chicken t bone or ribeye steak barbecue pork ribs soups all typically leave bones in for flavour some fish can be eaten with bones like eel or certain small sweetfish as the bones are too soft to cause harm so perhaps it is just that your exposure to dishes with duck and goat are just the ones that happen to have the bones in
i can maybe answer this but if you can give some examples it might help clarify the question with goat meat yield can be minimal so to give the diner the most of it you d leave it bone in so something like a goat leg roast you could debone it but it might just be better to leave it in especially if you re doing an open flame roast gives you a handle essentially with duck i think it depends on dish some chefs like the bone in breast because it gets a slightly higher yield on a costly protein it is also fun for presentation if you re doing a confit you want to disturb the meat as little as possible so don t debone i hope this helps answer but i think your question might be a bit broader and deserving a deeper explanation
you might want to clarify your premise i regularly eat dishes with duck and occasionally goat never had any of those dishes bones in them so it seems more like a regional thing you re describing
in my experience most meat dishes have bones in china which is one of the reasons i prefer american chinese food and generally dislike chinese food in china
fair enough i think this is the most helpful response to my question thank you
in my experience most meat dishes have bones in china which is one of the reasons i prefer chinese food in china and generally dislike chinese food in america
out of curiosity which goat and duck dishes are you thinking of
anytime i ve ever ordered duck from a chinese food restaurant or even when i was in china it always has bones i assume it s bc i primarily was ordering soups dishes with sauces for goat most of my exposure has been in curry s but again sauce heavy so it is helpful to know that it must be just my experience and not necessarily the norm
they work really hard good reporters have sources in law enforcement government and big companies people talk and reporters figure out who to listen to also a lot of times companies will call the news for a press conference or a story law enforcement and the government too
smaller players only need to cover local stories which reuters ap and other agencies might syndicate and get fees from they can pick up stories from the agencies which they pay a license for and put together non local stories
large news agencies send people to where the news is happening smaller organizations buy a subscription to something like reuters or ap to get the news from them certain organizations just make it up
they get it from a wire service papers subscribe to one and they are supplied with a news feed of stories verified by the agency some of these agencies associated press reuters to name two have been around since the s news stories went out by telegraph over the wires as technology improved so did the methods of distribution when reading a story in a newspaper or online you will often see it start with the name of the agency rather than the name of any particular writer that s how you know where it came from
usually other news outlets that s why after major events you get million articles saying the same thing because they all wrote based off the same initial reporting
most reporters when covering crimes and police matters basically just copy and paste whatever the police departments media liason puts out it s a pervasive issue
humidity just means how much humidity is in the air the more humid the harder it is for water to evaporate which is why people often feel they sweat more in humid environments they don t really sweat more the sweat just stays around longer more moisture also makes it a little harder to breathe rain means that of the indicated area will experience rain so if the weather report is about a 100km area and has a chance of rain 20km will get the expected rain and 80km will stay dry of course these are estimates and usually not entirely correct
i had to look up realfeel to see what it took into account and found this explanation https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/what-is-the-accuweather-realfeel-temperature/156655 human comfort and perception of temperature are affected by more factors than just temperature your body is generating heat from just resting metabolism and more when physically active that heat rate can also adjust a bit to keep you warm because your biological processes work around a given temperature sunlight is energy in and can vary depending on angle largely determined by time of day and location cloud cover the body sweats to help get rid of heat by evaporation water will go into the air below boiling point broadly speaking sunlight hitting you will make you feel warmer wind blowing cooler humid and hot means your sweat isn t as powerful at cooling so it feels hotter humidity as percentage is relative humidity which is the fraction compared to the maximum amount that air can hold at the temperature if you take the same quantity of air with the same amount of water and cool it its carrying capacity reduces so the relative fraction goes higher closer to like going from to to to heat it and the carrying capacity increases so further from like to etc so realfeel is combining all the factors into a single number for ease of use
there s a class of questions on this sub that is effectively how can you explain this weird phenomenon that i personally experience and there s no good answer to them because they re anomalous personal experiences it s certainly possible that you ve had the experience of drinking coffee and then feeling tired but it s not the coffee that made you sleepy there s no set of factors where caffeine switches from a stimulant to a sedative
first couple googles i found caffeine can block the effects of adenosine which is what makes you feel alert after your morning cup of joe however once the caffeine wears off your body may experience a buildup of adenosine that hits you all at once which is why coffee can make you feel tired because caffeine is a stimulant it usually wakes people up and general wisdom is not to drink it anywhere near bedtime however some people with adhd find it has the opposite affect and makes them want to sleep i have also read depending on how hydrated you are this can cause the sleepy effect as well
chemistry chemical reactions don t care about atom s nucleus composition or other particles only about the electrons around it sure the molecular weight of atoms matters too but it doesn t really care of what is made of
because it was more important to physics chemistry can be studied without needing to understand particles the reactions they study don t require a knowledge beyond atoms the same way a chef needs to be able to cook a steak but not understand the reproductive system of a cow but physicists kept finding things they couldn t explain and kept researching they stumbled upon sub atomic particles and kept studying them and their interactions to see what their existence meant for their theories eventually it grew into a field of study in its own right and stayed with physics
i would say it is in part the result of how it was discovered the first detected subatomic particle is an election it comes from research in electricity and magnetic that was a field that was considered physics before if the subatomic particle was a result of what was at the time considered chemistry that might be what is considered today at least historically there is a large difference in the approach of physics and chemistry and in it particle physics it one more of physics not chemistry a bit simplified is physics has a lot of theatrical models but from some observation that is generalized and results in testable prediction for experiments experimental confirmation can take decades until the technology is advanced enough chemistry the theory is often later and is made to describe what already has been observed in the label and extend it to a similar situation today with fast computers it i possible to make models in chemistry that are good at predicting the real result of novel compounds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_chemistry_and_physics
at the most basic level chemistry is the study of electron interactions neutrons proton have nothing to do with the actual interactions the number of protons relates to the number of electrons on the atom in the base state but that s it once you know how many electrons are in which shells and the atomic weight you know everything a chemist needs to know there is nothing a chemist needs to know about how protons or neutrons or any other particle are made interact
chemistry studies interactions between elements and molecules and compounds chemistry is concerned about numbers of protons and electrons and their behavior but the building blocks of protons and neutrons that s a different field
chemistry is the science of elements and how they form bonds to each other using the electromagnetic force through electrons the nucleus while important in electron configuration and mass is really of only indirect importance it is also the study of the properties of the elements and their compounds molecules there is nuclear chemistry which is commonly considered a sub field of chemistry it deal mainly in nuclear reactions primarily radioactive decay this isn t really chemistry although some chemical processes may be used i think it is more physics although some may prefer to look at it as a physics chemistry hybrid
chemistry doesn t care about protons or neutrons only electrons participate in chemical reactions
seeing as the number of protons defines an element i d say chemistry does care about protons and neutrons give us markers heavy water c13 etc which are chemically interesting but your point is taken
the number of protons is coincidental because it equals the number of electrons protons don t react chemically they react in nuclear reactions same for neutrons heavy water is still water chemically only when in a nuclear reactor it acts different
well a lot of them do eventually they even had to change the name from adult onset diabetes to type diabetes because so many young ish people were showing signs due to obesity and terrible diets if that s all you re doing and your diet is otherwise fine a healthier pancreas can power through it if the rest of your diet is similarly poor you are highly likely to develop diabetes eventually
the body is pretty resilient in how it can deal with sudden influxes of nutrients it had to be it was literally feast or famine up until about years ago or so we needed to ingest tons of calories when they were available so we d have them stored for when they were not our bodies adapted to deal with this diabetes in this case type or adult onset diabetes is the result of chronic overindulgence the body simply can t keep up with _always_ having too much so systems start failing a single can of coke isn t going to cause that but multiple cans every day for _years_ will
diabetes is just the clinical diagnosis of insulin resistance insulin resistance can be extreme where the body loses ability to pull glucose out of the blood or it can be very mild where the basal insulin load your body must produce to regulate glucose is higher than it should be there s a lot of good research out there trying to demonstrate that relying solely on blood sugar to diagnose metabolic diabetes is problematic for example chronically elevated blood pressure is frequently caused by insulin resistance since the kidney re uptake or retention of sodium is largely regulated by insulin load if you re mildly resistant to insulin you could have perfectly normal blood sugar but elevated blood pressure insulin resistance is biologically appropriate when the fall glut of fruit crops up it makes sense for the body to become insulin resistant more systemic insulin slows down the metabolism promotes fat gain and restricts catabolism exactly the kinds of things you want for putting on weight before winter it also blocks leptin signaling on the vagus nerve stimulating appetite the problem is we never actually go through the famine of winter now you can end up with supposed paradoxes in individuals being highly active can be protective because that activity helps keep fat from accumulating in the muscles keeping them highly sensitive to insulin allowing them to be a big sink for that glucose additionally eating patterns can greatly influence insulin sensitivity eating 200g of sugar throughout the day is completely different than eating 200g in one sitting in one sitting you have one insulin spike and the rest of the day you have low insulin which promotes catabolism and moving fat away from the organs if you graze all day the catabolic state is never really achieved that s how you can end up with people who weigh 300lbs but paradoxically have hardly any symptoms associated with metabolic disease they have no visceral or organ fat then you have perfectly normal weight individuals with high blood pressure diabetes and a littany of health complaints but they have high amounts of visceral fat and intramuscular fat get a fasting insulin test aboriginal hunter gatherer populations have fasting insulin around if i remember correctly the women s health initiative study found a doubling of all cause mortality within years with a fasting insulin of vs if you get a fasting insulin test it will say you are normal if you are under that normality is based on blood sugar outcome not health outcomes if you re over you are insulin resistant
sugar doesn t cause diabetes insulin resistance leads to diabetes usually that is caused by fat in the blood blocking cells insulin receptors this leads to overwork of the pancreas and eventual failure
the surface of your body can have another temperature than the inner part because it is in contact with the surrounding air oral ear armpit rectal skin etc all have slightly different temperatures even if you measure them at the same time you need to compensate for the difference to get the core temperature are you asking about the problems of measuring in an ear that was toward the pillow when lying down on the side the pillow will work like insulation that rescues air flow and heat transportation so your ear toward the pillow will be slightly warmer than the other ear for this reason so if you first measure the temperature before you lay down and then after it can the reading can increase even if the core body temperature has stayed the same the ear got a bit warmer
i ll take a shot measuring an ear that was laying on the pillow doesn t measure any extra heat but it still will be inaccurate the manufacturer of the thermometer has calibrated its readouts based on measurements taken from an ear that was out in the open ear temperatures of a person will always be a little cooler than oral or rectal temperatures so the manufacturer has to take that it account for example through lots of study they ll determine that if the ear thermometer measures degrees it corresponds to a real taken rectally body temperature of degrees the difference is the result of cooling that happens because the ear is out in the open they ll calibrate the thermometer to show when it reads if you measure an ear that was insulated by the pillow it is losing less heat to the air so it might be closer to that real temperature of degrees when the thermometer then corrects the temperature it will show up at
really it s the ear not insulated that is cooled you can measure either ear but only if you can repeat the measurement the same way every time and the published guidelines for what constitutes a fever are probably from measurements with no pillow insulation
really it s the ear not insulated that is cooled that is correct the point was the ear that is insulated will be a bit warmer compared to the core temperature compared to how they usually are exposed to air is the normal condition for human ears if you are not outside in cold weather
yea i m not disagreeing with you just adding that core temp is going to be closer to your insulated ear than to to exposed one
well not sure i could explain this to a five year old but anyways let s look at the heisenberg uncertainty principle back when people were trying to figure quantum mechanics there was some uncertainty about what that meant did an uncertainty in position mean a particle was in many places or it was in one place but we just had no way of knowing until we went out and measured it the second way is more classical and relies on so called hidden variables things that exist but that we can t measure it turns out that the existence of such hidden variables does lead to measurable predictions basically bell s inequality lets you test this if you combine probabilities of carefully set up events in various ways you can rule out any hidden variable theory the epr paradox is often called spooky action at a distance let s say i generate a pair of electrons that go shooting off in opposite directions to conserve angular momentum those electrons have to have opposite spins but in general which one has what spin is totally random they just have to be opposite now wait for a while if someone measures the spin of the first electron then someone measuring the spin of the electron at the same time has to get the opposite result but this is strange measuring one electron all of a sudden set the spin of the other electron but if you want until the electrons are far apart and measure at the same time either measuring one electron sends information to the other electron faster than the speed of light or the electrons somehow already knew what their spins are a hidden variable however if we find a system that violates bell s inequality we can rule out those hidden variables so what s going on well einstein thought that quantum mechanics was incomplete what s the answer i don t know i do know that it s hard to explain this to graduate students let alone year olds
ok so you have multiple things happening radio waves travel like light beams in a straight line so if you re on this side of the earth and you want to communicate with australia on the other side of the earth you ll need satellites to receive and re transmit your radio waves radio waves are absorbed by certain materials dirt the ground water metal objects such as skyscrapers etc ideally you want to send your radio waves through the air or into space rather than through the ground water or buildings the ionosphere https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8967a882f8c568b924096d6817b15eff-lq) outer layer of the atmosphere is ionized and reflects radio waves a little bit like water reflects light if you send straight up it gets through but if you send at an angle it reflects back down to the ground
microwave frequencies suffer from something called attenuation basically it hates things with water or metal in them because it gets absorbed or reflected by it trees and leaves have water in them and absorb the frequency this causes two issues first there forms a dead spot in the broadcast signal as the signal propagates around it second when the signals recombine it can create more dead spots as the combining signals destructively interferes with itself imagine looking at a wake from a boat on the water as it hits a post in the water watch as the waves go around it leaving a calm area behind the post until the expanding waves meet with each other on the other side now notice what happens when the crest and troughs of the waves meet each other this is essentially what happens to the radio signal line of sight ensures this issue does not happen edit to add more information in relation to your question sub microwave frequencies such as 900mhz and lower do not suffer from this issue quite as much because the there are less waves per second the frequency and can avoid it this lower frequency will instead reflect off of larger bodies on water and other things such as the ionosphere this allows global terrestrial communication at the cost of lower available throughput due to less frequency available to put the data on
ground following waves have low frequency we talk about 3mhz and below so you have a total spectrum of 3mhz to transmit data it will be shared by all radio waves the lower the frequency the better they floow earth wifi uses 20mhz or multiple of 20mhz to transmit data so datarate you can manage at 3mhz is quite low the signal is also attenuated with distance because earth s surface is not a preferred conductor so you need high power the signal will also travel a lot better of the sea than over land the required antenna size also depends on the wavelength and they will be in kilometers for low frequency waves antennas need in that size order too ground waves have been used and are still used for long distance communication there was cross atlantic radio transmission for morse code messages starting in the had high power huge antennas and low data rate because there are better alternatives it is seldom used today there is still limed usage for communication with submarines that can receive signal underwater sometimes signals are sent that way to
in no particular order some have been addressed in other answers the ionosphere is called that way because it gets ionized by solar uv radiation freeing electrons from the atoms radio transmissions at frequencies between a few mhz and about 30mhz are reflected by those free electrons you can take advantage of that to reflect waves back down and overcome earth s curvature but it s a disadvantage if you want to pierce through the ionosphere on the other hand frequencies above 30ghz are heavily attenuated by lower atmospheric layers mainly the air in the troposphere in between lays what s called the radio window at frequencies even lower than a mhz waves can bounce back and forth between the ionosphere and the surface traveling even further in general higher frequencies are attenuated more by the atmosphere high frequencies also have more room for wide channels it s easy to allocate 20mhz wide channels around a 4ghz frequency at 30mhz that doesn t work well a higher number of wider channels is what allows high data rates counter example submarine transmissions at a few dozen khz can have data rates below bits s low frequencies need big antennas a satellite has to be very frugal with the amount of energy it uses to transmit data so the power received at the antenna on earth s surface is mindblowingly low the sensitivity of modern gps receiver chips is in the order of magnitude of billionths of a billionth of watt any additional obstruction of the path can disrupt the channel a combination of the factors above makes authorities decide what frequency ranges to allocate for which uses all of that is then used by whomever plans an application with radio waves to choose the most fitting transmission as long as there s any choice left ground waves offer a very limited amount of narrow slow channels that can reach very far very few could use it and they would make those frequencies unusable by anyone else on the same continent if they took advantage of the possible range
could we not use the ionosphere like a satellite then is the spread of the wave proportional to its velocity
okay thank you this made it make a lot more sense so the reason we need line of sight is because if we just shoot waves along the surface of the earth they would destructively interfere with themselves when they hit metal or water
there s a loss of signal strength when bouncing off the ionosphere like using a panel of glass to reflect things rather than a full mirror the spread of the wave depends on the antenna how parabolic it is similar to having a flashlight with a parabolic reflector vs a naked lightbulb and the signal strength also disperses with the square of the distance per the inverse square law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inverse-square_law). so given that the flight distance to australia is some miles and you can have satellites some miles up and every miles or so it s much better to use the satellites which can receive the signal with a loss of and re amplify the signal before sending it on to the next satellite so tldr if you have a radio antenna with a really strong power signal some thousand watts you can bounce it off the ionosphere and they ll faintly hear you in australia but for satellite phone communication where you hold that phone next to your ear and thus can only put some watt of power into its antenna you really need the re amplification that each satellite does to communicate with australia
there is also the issue with regulatory compliance regarding allowed eirp ignoring the acronym this is basically the sum total of transmit power and gain from the antenna there are rules in place that prevent people from cranking up the transmit power to not cause issues for other people using the same or close to the same frequency after making it from space to the surface of the earth the signal has been attenuated so much that the receiver on the ground is only seeing that signal only a few to maybe 15db above the noise floor
negative inflation is called deflation and it can harm the economy in a couple ways it slows spending and slows investment people hold off on buying if they think something might be cheaper down the road which slowed economic activity gdp etc that s bad for the economy as it can lead to a downward spiral of less sales meaning jobs cuts meaning people out of work spending less meaning more job cuts and so on and when money gains buying power over time then there is less inventive to invest which means there isn t money to lend out to those who want to finance houses or cars businesses that need investment capital to grow etc and this also can slow down the economy
i feel like i must be missing something important because all of those effects are the same for high inflation so it seems to me like the ideal range is somewhere immediately around is that right
the fed usually tries to get it around whether that is the sweet spot or not is up for debate but some inflation does help the economy think of it like this there is a widget you want that costs now if you thought it would cost later you would buy it now and money moves through the economy if you thought it would cost later you would wait and your money is stagnant if you know it will always cost you can still wait to buy it and again stagnation
high inflation causes people to buy more hoard for fear of higher prices which compounds on demand driven price increases if i think frozen pizzas that are today might be next week i might buy instead of and if inflation is high people who can invest will seek out higher rates of return to counter the effects of inflation the ideal rate of inflation is about enough to prevent negative inflation without being too onerous on one s budget
you are conflating the effects of high inflation with the impact of the fed s tighenning the way economists see inflation is on what s called the phillips curve the gist is that high inflation corresponds with low unemployment and vice versa if you remember when inflation started people were also getting crazy raises switching jobs every months for to more money everyone was hiring etc and people were spending house prices shot up dealers couldn t keep cars on the lot for very long furniture would be on back order for months that s what high inflation looks like contrasted to deflation listed above but the economic softness now is really an effect of the federal reserve raising interest rates people are tightening up now but it s because the economy is starting to turn the other way layoffs are happening and crazy raises aren t happening so there s less spending power interest rates mean people aren t able to qualify for as much house or car that they originally could and so sellers are having trouble getting the prices they could months ago so what you re seeing now is people have the same or less money and so can t over spend for more goods and the hope is that the lack of demand causes inflation to subside
the fence is just meant to stop that ground from running off of the construction site as construction nears the end they can spread it out again around the now developed land and hopefully plantlife will take over fast enough to stop future erosion from the site
in my experience they mostly catch trash blowing across the construction site a working site generates tons of random trash from scrap pieces to cardboard boxes and plastic wrap having a low barrier around the site keeps it from blowing into nearby properties each morning the grunts can walk the perimeter and clean up whatever gets stuck in there
these are called sediment control or silt fences civil agencies are granted a permit by their state environmental agencies to operate and one of the requirements is to limit the amount of sediment that leaves the construction site especially in regards to preventing it from entering natural waterways
old english was a germanic language brought to england by the anglo saxon settlers near the end of roman rule of britain around ad middle english came into existence when with the norman invasion of britain around as the normans spoke a proto french language at the time this shifted a lot of the language closer to french and farther from german around this same period is the development of the early scots language spoken in lowland scotland which saw much less influence from the normans and so retained more of the germanic traits modern english occurred due to the great vowel shift that occurred between about and much of this was due to migration effects from the black death and various influences with the french as spelling was heavily standardized in the and 1600s this shift is why english has a lot of very odd rules for spelling of vowels this is not to be confused with scottish gaelic spoken in highland scotland which derives from irish and lacks the germanic influence
they are very different languages here is the lord s prayer in early middle and modern english here is a sample of old english fder ure u e eart on heofenum si in nama gehalgod to becume in rice geweore in willa on eoran swa swa on heofenum urne ge dghwamlican hlaf syle us to deag and forgyf us ure gyltas swa swa we forgifa urum gyltendum ane ne gelde u us on costnunge ac alys us of yfle here is a sample of middle english oure fadir that art in heuenes halewid be thi name thi kyngdoom come to be thi wille don in erthe as in heuene yyue to vs this dai oure breed ouer othir substaunce and foryyue to vs oure dettis as we foryyuen to oure dettouris and lede vs not in to temptacioun but delyuere vs fro yuel here is modern english our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
middle english was about the time when english started to become the black sheep old english was clearly germanic to the naked eye it sounded germanic functioned germanic you could put english beside german and they d look like siblings without any squinting middle english by contrast marks the loss of most of our grammatical case gender systems and a massive influx of norman french words entering the language we also lost a great deal of verb conjugations this was basically the time when english as we know it began to exist it s still more difficult to parse as it looks like it was written by a toddler but it s still actually readable same can t be said for old english take this example beowulf vs chaucer syan rest wear feasceaft funden he s frofre gebad weox under wolcnum weormyndum ah ot him ghwylc ara ymbsittendra ofer hronrade hyran scolde gomban gyldan t ws god cyning ther was and that a worthy man that fro the tyme that he first bigan to ryden out he loved chivalrye trouthe and honour fredom and curteisye ful worthy was he in his lordes werre and thereto hadde he riden no man ferre as wel in cristendom as hethenesse and evere honoured for his worthinesse
as spelling was heavily standardized in the and 1600s to add a bit of clarification about what heavily standardized means and why it was important to the development of the modern english language prior to the 1500s there was no set orthographic spelling standard the spelling of a word would almost always vary often several times in the same sentence and well to be perfectly honest the common person usually focused on learning skills that were relevant to their occupation so how a word was spelled usually wasn t as important as how it was pronounced even as the printed word became more common it didn t entirely remedy the problem rather it solidified many irregularities with remnants of the multiple languages that influenced the gradual evolution of the english language it wasn t until when samuel johnson published the first significant english dictionary that there was a concrete example of the proper way to spell most english words that was also accessible to the often poorly educated peasantry so the next time you feel like getting uppity over the whole there their they re issue just know that modern writers are hardly the first to ever make such a mistake
the two sides of the coin these completely different languages are called adjective english because they were stages in the history of modern english these stages in the history of modern english are completely different languages because understanding one of them does not allow you to understand the other
languages change over time old english isn t english as in if you went back in time to england a thousand years ago you wouldn t be able to talk to anyone because english back then was so different that it s a different language no different in that regard from modern german or danish middle english is a middle ground between the two something more comprehensible to a modern speaker though you d still struggle to speak with a middle english speaker you know how when you read shakespeare it s really weird most of that is because he s writing using the language common in the late 16th century it would have been a lot easier to follow to the viewers of the time this is the way language goes i have no doubt that in the 31st century languages will have evolved to the point where 21st century language is incomprehensible to the average person that s just how things change
from beowulf old english hwt we gar dena in geardagum eodcyninga rym gefrunon hu a elingas ellen fremedon modern english so the spear danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness we have heard of those princes heroic campaigns from the prologue of chaucer s canturberry tales middle english whan that aprill with his shoures soote the droghte of march hath perced to the roote and bathed every veyne in swich licour modern english when april with its sweet smelling showers has pierced the drought of march to the root and bathed every vein of the plants in such liquid
you likely wouldn t be able to understand either language spoken maybe you could read some middle english but you d understand it like maybe someone who speaks italian can understand some spanish the languages are related but dissimilar enough that communication is hard without some study
old english really isnt english its anglo saxon so its more old german middle english is anglo saxon norse and norman french after a few hundred years it evolved into modern english widespread printing helped standardize a lot of things
they are completey different languages it really is kinda that simple as far as your question goes middle english is like a sort of related language like cantonese vs mandarin where rher is _some_ shared vocab and syntax but onthe whole you can t really interhcange them old english is as foreign to modern english as modern english is to norwegian for non linguitic purposes
we label things it s much easier to talk about something if you give it a name people who read things written in latin tend to separate early latin from late latin and often include a middle latin as well plus a non native speaker latin that is sometimes called medieval latin and maybe even a renaissance latin just because they re different enough to cause difficulties if you just rush in assuming they re the same the main differences have been discussed in general but the main idea is that old english is germanic middle english is a germanic french mishmash modern is what we speak now you want to make distinctions where things before the break are pretty much the same and then in the next pigeonhole they re pretty much the same but different from the previous pigeonhole i would imagine that from the point of view of 31st century english speakers they speak modern english beowulf was in old english chaucer in early middle english shakespeare to the 23rd century is high middle english 23rd to 28th century is late middle english
how did the vikings influence the shift to middle english they arrived a few centuries before the normans would you consider that a separate event or a group it with the normans when it comes to the english language and how it changed in the middle ages
i once heard english described as what happens when norman knights try to hit on welsh barmaids
removed
fun fact in many northern states chicago detroit cleveland buffalo rochester there is a current vowel shift happening called the northern city shift longer vowels are moving forward and up in the mouth shorter vowels are moving lower and back in the mouth
thanks
so blame the french
the great vowel shift sounds like something someone would make up for a plot line
from middle irish which evolved into modern irish scottish gaelic and manx
some more on the change from old english to middle english as old french started to mix into old english after the norman conquest english became a lot more simplified this is when it really started losing a lot of the word endings known in linguistics as inflections to nouns verbs and other words that were used to indicate grammatical function instead word order became more and more important to convey grammatical meaning however many of these inflections are still present in very commonly used verbs i e is am was are be and pronouns i e i me or he him which gives us some preserved hints of old english s inflectional shenanigans
my understanding is that it s a port accent that aligns more to cities like nyc
when did the latin get in the mix was that from roman rule or did it come later
this with the caveat that middle english would look but not sound much more familiar if its spelling was standardised the example above which i suppose was directly lifted from a manuscript is very irregular u v g y etc which may well reflect how the specific writer spelled it but it hides the general similarities to modern english pronunciation is a different matter
another caveat that s early modern english the lord s prayer has been intentionally kept old fashioned i think to make it feel like it s an old prayer the king james bible is the same way even when it was first published the language was old
it ll probably be helpful to mention for the middle english text u and v were the same letter
i m not a linguist but a good rule of thumb is that if you can vaguely understand it it s middle english
as a german speaker and having studied german at uni it always baffles me how you can see so many parallels and similarities between old and middle english and german respectively so interesting
yo god what s good up in the heavens we all about respecting your name and waiting for your kingdom to come down here we re down for your will to be done on earth just like it is up there can you hook us up with some bread for the day and forgive us when we screw up just like we forgive our homies when they do us wrong keep us away from temptation and all that evil stuff frfr amen based god
hold up you re just tricking people into praying times today nice try
middle english looks like it would sound like someone saying something in english but putting on a really bad swedish accent
you can definitely tell the heavy germanic in old english because as someone speaking german and norwegian i could understand it quite well albeit not all of the words without knowing the prayer
i am from saxony and i can understand the old english except for one or the other word that s originally latin interesting
damn the middle english one just looks like you re phonetically spelling how old time y british people speak which i guess might actually just be the case now that i think about it
chaucer is also an interesting example because he was later middle english so it is easier for most native english speakers to read and understand
and over in the colonies our dictionaries tended to standardize on more traditional spellings while in england they tended to more modern variants with american spelling dropping u after o colour color and picking z over s in many words standardise standardize
i retain the right to be uppity about there their they re because we aren t flying by the seat of our pants anymore nearly everyone is taught this at the elementary level nor can i believe nobody has corrected them along the way since barring rare cases of unfortunate educational deficits or non native speakers these people choose to continue to be ignorant despite having been explained the simple accepted rules
thanks
isn t shakespeare s work considered modern english already
great explanation thank you
i tell ya hwt that boy ain t right
cool thanks for giving it to me short and sweet
true thanks
i read it as a coinciding event old norse was spoken mainly in the danelaw northeast old norse is also a germanic language and it was nearly mutually intelligible to old english it wasn t just vocabulary the norse contributed pronouns and likely helped simplify the case systems when two related languages intermix the common thread would be the roots and not the endings these changes were bound to happen in the s anyways but it just so happened that the norman conquest injected a bunch of new vocabulary at the same time

can you give an example this is cool
there s a southern vowel shift happening as well
oh no i m reading all the replies and pronouncing all the words and realizing that s how i speak i am from the midwest but it s weird to see yourself as accented lol
i m from rochester it s interesting because when i travel people can clearly hear my accent in rochester nobody thinks they have a regional accent they think we sound like standard american it s really not the case though another few examples frog is said like frahg bag is said like beyg and even rochester is said like rah chester
isn t this really the new vocal fry phenomenon it s more imitation than natural shifting of sounds due to isolation
one unique thing between old english and more modern english is the lack of gendered words and word endings old english had these features but they were disappearing in middle english all of the languages influencing english had different ways of handling those features and it became easier to just drop those rules we still see some echos of those old english gendered words like the old english word for weaver which was either weber male or webster female still a common surname the words spinner and spinster are still with us too even if one of them now has a different connotation
it s been said that middle english is the language that evolved when norman men at arms were trying to bed saxon serving girls in taverns and road houses after the norman conquest so yeah
as opposed to the great bowel shift which would be a mess of scatalogical proportions
a professor of mine preferred to call it the great vowel movement
well a proto french would just be a messy latin
interestingly knowing it s that particular prayer i as a norwegian can almost read the old english version the spelling is pretty wild compared to modern written language but quite a lot of it is rather straightforward if one takes it as germanic phonetic spelling
very good point if you can manage to get used to reading middle english out loud it s almost possible to understand if you imagine modern english with a very broad scottish accent you still need a few footnotes for unfamiliar words
exactly when we did a chaucer unit in english lit i could totally read it and figure out what they were saying most of the time but when we watched a video of some players doing one of them with period pronunciation it was basically indecipherable
i translated it to contemporary modern english yo god what s good up in the heavens we all about respecting your name and waiting for your kingdom to come down here we re down for your will to be done on earth just like it is up there can you hook us up with some bread for the day and forgive us when we screw up just like we forgive our homies when they do us wrong keep us away from temptation and all that evil stuff frfr amen based god
yeah if you read through the second one a few times it s not as different as it initially seems yuel is pronounced closely to evil and dettis is debts and dettouris is debtors so some of the words have been swapped for synonyms
also looks like g doesn t exist yet and y is doing the work of both g and vowel y
today i learned zoomers and redditors speak middle english
well we are largely children of the same parents after all
the closest modern germanic dialect to english would be frisian old frisian and old english are almost identical but the modern versions are very different when english forces supported the dutch in the revolt against habsburgs they would have captured dutch soldiers read a short poem and they were considered friendly if they used vowels similar to english and enemies if they used more german vowels
i d have to look it up but maybe the first editor frederick furnivall of the oed taught himself russian in weeks using only a russian english dictionary and the principles of proto indo european grammar if not then it was the 2nd don t remember that name depending on your level of knowledge pretty much the same can mean a lot of different things
i mean that s basically what it is old english was the language of the proto vikings who conquered england middle english is when the descendants of vikings who were given land in france normandy conquered england again hundreds of years later and people started spelling words like them and the latin from the church and using a lot of their words
yeah we should be calling ye olde bakeries ye middle bakeries instead
i mean they were english people and they were most certainly old timey so you re not far off that said the sound of this would be more similar to american english than you d think both american and british dialects came from this so you d have pieces and features from each for an idea of what this english became listen to this https://youtu.be/qyiyd9rck5m. this is known as early modern english and as you could guess this was the english of shakespeare i ve heard it described as pirate y which kinda makes sense when you look at the features seen in hollywood pirate films
true the french loans were in full effect by then so earlier in the period you had more holdovers here s sir gawain the green knight it s definitely a bit more difficult to parse particularly thanks to its vocab and that pesky yogh but i d argue still recognizable baring vocab that s been outright replaced like sithen since then or after or tulk synonymous with a man http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/brunetti/me/index_gaw.php?poe=gaw&lingua=eng
you seem rather upset by this let me offer you some comfort their they re
based and teach em a lesson pilled
this is classist garbage not everyone had the education you did they re are plenty of crap schools in the us not to mention that for some people it s actually a brain thing that makes it difficult i had the education but i still make those mistakes targeting and judging people for there grammatical mistakes misses the point of who people are
there is a difference between formal writing where rules are strictly enforced and colloquial writing where rules are more like guidelines so long as the reader can suss out the intended meaning i mark off for those distinctions in student papers but ignore them in student emails
early modern there are sufficiently many different features to consider them somewhat distinct thou no continuous tenses and so many others
thank god the danelaw was a thing germanic plural declinations are the worst tacking on an s at the end is much better than having to memorize stupid plurals like child to children
one example might be my wisconsinian friend who says melk instead of milk
i don t know if this qualifies but my father who was born in chicago in the 40s would pronounce eggs aigs he also pronounced pound as pond
it is extremely interesting it was first noticed around the 40s 50s and has been studied since its thought to be the most significant change in the english language since the great vowel shift around the 1100s this minute video does a pretty good job explaining the concept https://youtu.be/9uoj1-zgb1w as someone who lives in detroit not everybody talks like this but some people do kind of like a thick accent that some people have in my locale this seems to be more common in rural areas and less common in urban areas sometimes its just specific words like creek that many people pronounce crick or tree roots are pronounced as tree ruts or milk melk those are probably the youd hear the most i ve never noticed myself speaking with the shift but i have friends and relatives that speak with the shift
here in chicago you will hear melk as milk or baeg for bag
aaron earned an iron urn
i live in chicago and like to give the example of how when people here say the word bull it sounds like bowl
here s a very short video https://youtu.be/9uoj1-zgb1w
something i ve noticed growing up in cleveland is that block like city block actually sounds a little closer to bleck
pin and pen my southern wife pronounces both the same pen i pronounce them correctly she can t hear the difference
pretty sure these are just called accents
everyone has an accent
one interesting fact about old english though is that we were losing these features by the time the norman invasion happened one theory is that during the danelaw period the two different germanic tongues had some semblance of understanding between each other but the big thing was how the genders and cases inhibited much communication so both languages compromised a wee bit and got rid of some of the cases in order to understand each other better i cannot verify is this is accurate but it s something
what is this shit
you mean the great bowel shit
the great bowel shift is what i used to call it when i d close a restaurant with no closers
if you compare it with the icelandic version https://is.wikisource.org/wiki/fa%c3%b0ir_vor) what seems closer
old english and old norse were very closely related so it d make sense the influence of celtic and latinate languages upon that has been sufficiently intense that there have been serious academic proposals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_english_creole_hypothesis) of the idea that english itself is in fact fundamentally a creole language that proposal has been rebutted and i think the rebuttals are pretty fair i don t think the creole hypothesis is correct but i do think the fact that earnest honest people can reach that conclusion is a great demonstration of just how much non germanic influence there s been on english
noticed the same thing as a swede with some knowledge of german as well
the trick is to imagine english spelling making sense
it helps if you speak another germanic language then you start noticing how odd the modern english pronunciation is versus english spelling it starts making sense that for instance lake originally denoted a word pronounced lahk or even lakh uh
deleted
the examples have been forced into unicode letters there are a number of letters in old and middle english that are still closer to old germanic writing that have been replaced with modern forms
some of us had to read chaucer s canterbury tales untranslated i did this in an english literature class in the 1980s but i m sure it s still happening the class groaned but it turned out to be a pretty cool assignment within pages or so you sort of latched on to the rhythm and spellings pretty soon you were just reading stories and not decrypting ancient text the point is that it s remarkably easy to do and takes very little time to get there
no see the zoomers are speaking modern english you re speaking middle english
no you do
i mean i know i studied it the history and the development the vowel shifts and everything but it s been a while i forgot a lot and it s fascinating to be reminded about it in fact i always thought that swiss german as it is today is still closer to english and middle old english than german nowadays because it sounds and feels like an old fashioned way to speak german
the way your body uses energy is converting things like carbohydrates fats and proteins into forms usable by the body it s a bit complicated and depends on an understanding of some biology chemistry topics to get everything but the waste product of the major form of energy generation is carbon dioxide and water both of which leave the body via exhalation with water also leaving as sweat and urine fat is mainly made of different structures and configurations of carbon hydrogen and oxygen it gets broken down into pieces usable for the body in a process that generates carbon dioxide which gets exhaled out
bamboo grows fast but each bamboo plant is also small and partly hollow the total rate that wood is produced from bamboo vs something like a pine tree is not as different as you might expect also trees are ridiculously easy to grow in places like the us you don t need pesticides or irrigation or much labor to make them grow and it s efficient fast to harvest them because each one is huge even if trees produce wood slower than bamboo that s ok you just need more land to farm the amount of trees you want let one patch of land regrow while you harvest a different one and in several years you ll have trees again in the first place land suitable for growing trees is in ample supply in a place like the us because it s so easy to harvest and regrow trees you just need enough land to provide trees at the rate you want and it s very cost effective and easy
good answers so far but there is another missing piece paper products at least in the us are a byproduct of the timber industry they use the waste left after cutting lumber this material is essentially free it requires no extra cost for planting harvesting or shipping here is a simplified overview https://www.idahoforests.org/content-item/how-paper-is-made-2/
the major cost to making paper is separating the lignin from cellulose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lignin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lignin) interestingly is the fact that corn is one of the few plants that matures with out increasing the amount of lignin in its cells this would make corn fodder a great candidate to make paper with but it s cellulose fibers are too long and knot up https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/mp/nbsmiscellaneouspub147.pdf
raw materials are a relatively low percentage of the total cost vs labor to harvest transport to factory process manufacture transport to retailers
a lot of consumer goods and this will be especially true for something like toilet paper have material costs that are a tiny fraction of the retail price of the good understand first that the price of something may be constrained by its cost to produce but rarely has any relationship to it a product that costs to make and deliver to the consumer may have a price of if consumers value it at this is how market pricing works my guess for toilet paper is that no more than of the price of toilet paper reflects the material cost further the packaging of the toilet paper probably costs as much as the toilet paper itself the shipping of it is also pretty high it s light but bulky a semi of toilet paper isn t worth much money so the cost of that shipping is distributed over a relatively small number of units you have high retail costs because it takes up a lot of shelf space you have advertising costs in there as well gotta pay for that nascar sponsorship so if you cut your material costs by you re probably cutting maybe of the retail price that s generally not even enough to bother discounting a product because it s not enough to get consumers to switch not many people are choosing the can of beans over the one based on price
people are mentioning the supply side but there s also the demand side people are willing to pay a premium for a more sustainable product so companies will of course sell it at a higher price
it depends where you live if you re referring to the us we don t grow a lot any bamboo here so it all has to be imported shipping costs account for a large percentage of any product s price profitability
plenty of answers and i usually just read but this time i thought i d chime in i ve been working with bamboo on the forestry side for 8y now main reason is there are no commercial plantations of bamboo large enough for a project like that there have been many tests done by the largest paper companies having great results with the fiber but first you d have to plant enough individuals to support that operation and then adapt your machinery to process this kind of fiber bamboo is more suited for cardboard since it has long fiber vs short which are mainly used in paper
you ve already gotten correct answers down here but also why would they make it cheaper if they can price it the same or more i d bet bamboo tp and paper towels are more aren t they and it ll get bought anyway capitalism isn t in anyway about fairness it s about sponging as much money out of people as possible by any means necessary
bamboo and wood fibers are very different even within wood there are different species of trees used for different purposes for toilet paper and paper towels depending on what you want the premium products will use a mixture of wood fibers to get their desired product additionally paper machines can only accept a certain range of fiber properties before it causes problems given that you can t just say i want to replace all wood fibers with bamboo even then bamboo is processed differently than wood it s more expensive to get the right amount of fibers and the right fiber lengths than doing so with wood which is a much more mature technology making bamboo more expensive as far as i ve seen in years of product development is that the number of people wiling to pay more for a more sustainable product is very small i put sustainable in quotes because most toilet paper and towel companies already have several sustainable initiatives for their products between responsibly sourced virgin fiber and including recycled which can only be done to an extent without compromising the product to a point people don t want to pay other fibers have been are being investigated as alternatives if a cost effective alternatives were available where they d be able to sell it they would not out of the goodness of their heart but because people want it but at a price comparable to what they re paying now additionally many companies will use language describing their product in a way that makes it look more sustainable than it is as an example a lot of products that say they use bamboo are actually rayon made from bamboo rayon s not terrible in its own right but it s a far cry from a fiber directly from the plant many companies don t know the difference because they re not making it they re buying it from others that are not honest alternative fibers are being looked at all the time whether it s trying to satisfy a customer need or to reduce cost ideally both they are being looked at fiber cost is a large portion of the cost of your toilet paper and paper towels if it was cheaper and didn t turn people off to the product they would be used not because paper companies are benevolent that s silly it s because it s good for their business because you re demanding it
supply and demand supply as others have mentioned there s a lot of cheap wood in the us and very little bamboo also assuming the processing is different there s economy of scale with practically village sized factories making wood paper and very few factories at all making bamboo products demand the sort of person who wants bamboo products i assume has more money than the sort of person who doesn t care and if they have an active preference they re likely to be willing to spend more for that preference and even if there are people with an active preference for wood you couldn t capitalize on it because of arbitrage competition there s also the fact that bamboo can also be used for food and i m guessing this use would mean you can t use it for paper whereas wood paper is a byproduct of timber as another user noted since a lot more people eat bamboo than use it for paper and since it s probably imported home grown bamboo would likely be more profitable for use as food than paper
you get millions of toilet rolls from a single tree you need a lot of bamboo to make the same number of rolls the toilet paper industry has been using trees for centuries so has ironed out all the details and is really efficient
prices are set based on comparative market rates not the cost of production resources or other factors when you understand this it will turn the common notions of the economy inside out this is an important truth regarding how the world actually works rather than how it is described or how we might wish it worked
i m not sure bamboo produces more from a weight or volume perspective even though it produces more tree units
because people don t produce products for altruistic reasons they produce them for profit
unpopular opinion the processing of bamboo isn t all that eco friendly it s actually quite chemically intensive i think this contributes along side all the other good ideas posted above this link explains both sides of the argument pretty well i thought https://fairware.com/bamboozled-getting-the-facts-on-bamboo-textiles/
the economy of scale hasn t developed yet for bamboo products as fully as it has for wood products bamboo has been used for paper for a very long time but the industrial production of paper from wood on a large scale has been fine tuned for cost effectiveness for many decades bamboo could undergo the same upscaling but only if an increase in demand for bamboo paper products justifies an increase in production there is a bit of a catch in this and other similar things consumers would demand more if it were cheaper but it won t become cheaper until consumers demand more
the short answer is corporate greed the whole point if going into business is to make money if you can make your product at a fraction of the cost of the competition but still charge about the same amount you make way more profit the the competition the only things that forces prices down are excess supply and competition
bamboo is a type of grass and as such it grows extremely fast it also is not very finicky so producing bamboo is way easier than farming trees
really that should be self explanatory
as one might expect bamboo grows many times faster and is many times less dense conservation of matter and all that
if you re on the fence about switching to bamboo products consider skipping them entirely and going straight to reusables swap your paper towels napkins kleenex and toilet paper for dish towels rags cotton napkins handkerchiefs and a bidet i have also just discovered that you can also buy reusable swabs they are made of silicone instead of cotton haven t tried them yet the reasons for doing this the three r s are in the order that they are for a reason a lot of those paper product companies are owned by the koch brothers much of it comes from virgin forest in canada pfas forever chemicals have been found in many of the recycled paper products
most paper products are made from sawdust an industrial waste a single tree makes 8x8 planks and a lot of irregular shapes those irregular shapes get turned into dust papertowels
there was a bamboo toilet paper i found that was significantly cheaper but could never find it again
here in canada we grow loads of pulpwood but zero bamboo commercially the same in the usa lots of pulpwood not much bamboo other countries may do things differently
the cost of raw material is usually the smallest part of any product price it just doesn t make much of a difference wood pulp is under usd ton roll of tp is what 200g so absolute maximum of cents of your bogroll goes towards raw material if they found the wood pulp for free they still couldn t save more than that
sustainable doesn t equal economical same reason paper straws are more expensive the petroleum based straws the production chain just isn t set up yet to manufacture bamboo at cheap costs
big toilet doesn t want you discovering how much better bamboo is for the environment more people buying bamboo tp means the cost goes down s
you read that article in the washington post about bidets too huh i went straight to looking for bamboo toilet paper after that
removed
because bamboo is a shitty product to make cloths and paper out of the processing and energy is high the environmental cost is high bamboo isn t green because it grows fast the argument is bad
most bamboo products aren t some novel fiber made from think about it hard and brittle bamboo they are actually rayon plastic made from processing bamboo fabric can also be made from wood this way
because toilet paper and paper towels are produced from wood residues or low grade timber that aren t useful for anything else aside from biofuels which is more and more becoming a thing
because enough of the right people want it that way that answer covers a lot of scenarios btw
of these responses are not answers to the question discussing production costs is almost entirely irrelevant to the market price of the paper imagine you make paper and sell it your goal is to generate profit to make money the other paper companies in town sell bamboo paper for and normal paper for if you plan to make a lot of bamboo paper you should sell for to be the cheapest bamboo paper in town or perhaps to be the cheapest paper in town if you plan to make a little bit of paper maybe you should sell it for it will sell slowly but that is ok you only have a little bit to sell this is all the information you need in order to set the best price to make the most money notice that we have not discussed what it costs to make the paper because that does not matter to your price decision prices are set by supply and demand by competition end of story production casts are not in the equation the cost to make the paper affects how much profit you will make if the cost to make paper is then you are making lots of money and should make more paper if the cost to make paper is then you are losing money and should close your business in any case changing the sales price based on production costs is a bad decision the buyers don t care what your production costs are charging because your costs are just means you will sell zero paper charging because your production costs are means you are missing out on cents per sale people would still buy it at
if the product is green the makers of the product know they can charge double what the not green product costs
paulownia is worth looking at for rapid growth once harvested it can regrow a new tree to metres in years
trees take nothing but space in northern ontario logging companies will roll though an undeveloped area every or so years mayby to not sure exact time clear cut an area leaving a strip of trees so the operation isn t visible from the road leave the area ready to regrow it is consistent and renewable the more paper is needed the more valuable these operations are and the more trees are grown
bamboo toilet paper is buy get two free at my local cvs when ever it s in stock very strange it s the only item i ve seen like that
because you have to actually ship them from where the bamboo is farmed which is china instead we get tp from where trees are farmed which is considerably closer it s all cellulose at the end of the day
bamboo takes less water to process and regrowth is great much more efficient use of real estate and water available land and water are becoming a real concern no reason to use trees hard to wipe your ass every time and not think about clear cutting old growth forest used for toilet paper the switch to bamboo tp has let me lose some guilt i am a strong advocate for bamboo
this is oddly specific but just last week i bought a cutting board in my minutes twitter research i found that the wooden cutting board has natural antibacterial properties whereas the bamboo counterparts do not i went for the more expensive wooden counterparts because of that alone
to add to what others have already said lumber industry in north america also got ahead of the curve real quick a long time ago and re plant more than they cut down if i was informed correctly there s more forest coverage in north america now than there was even years ago
it s absolutely possible to make a pulp which is then processed to paper from bamboo or eucalyptus and they already use it quite a lot in china because there is shortage of wood https://bioresources.cnr.ncsu.edu/resources/bamboo-as-an-emerging-resource-for-worldwide-pulping-and-papermaking/](https://bioresources.cnr.ncsu.edu/resources/bamboo-as-an-emerging-resource-for-worldwide-pulping-and-papermaking/)
i d think you d need to do a land efficiency study say over years how much wood pulp can you produce with trees per acre versus bamboo probably one harvest if trees and multiple bamboo harvests i would expect your labor costs will be greater with bamboo due to multiple harvests
it is business why would they cut their competitors prices considerably they could put them out of business then more bamboo grower would enter the market but if you just keep your prices a bit lower then theirs you achieve maximum profit margins
because processing it is hella expensive and hyper toxic carbon disulfide ammonia sulfuric acid and acetones are used to break down a wood that s harder than oak to make it into tshirts and toilet paper it s not a good option over fibers that are naturally pliant
haven t seen this mentioned but transport of toilet paper is a higher proportional cost compared to other products it s a large but light product imagine shipping a gold bar overseas vs shipping toilet paper it s economically viable to sell the gold with shipping but less so the paper
not sure if it s the case with bamboo but for almost every pricing questing the answer invariably is the price reflects what consumers are willing to pay for it the production cost being the absolute minimum so if people are willing to pay more for bamboo than paper it will be more expensive
because why import from asia when you can just clear cut old growth forests in canada
yep if you don t live in a heavily wooded area it can be hard for people to understand that a lot of trees means that your road trip might be a five hour trip through the same forest transporting the wood out is the main problem not the availability it s not uncommon where i am to see places where a wood company just strip cleared a strip of woods a mile wide and several long and then just left the area alone for the next years to recover and regrow it leaves interesting differences in color and forest texture from a distance as different types of trees and plants dominate at certain times as the area regrows
i wonder if it s partially this but also partially why like why brown rice is more expensive than white rice even though white rice is more processed since white rice is more popular and ships and stores better the manufacturing capacity is such that the one that could be more expensive is cheaper and the one that could theoretically cost less is considered fancier and can fetch a higher price like if the major brands switched from tree pulp to bamboo pulp overnight i think bamboo paper could be cheaper than traditional toilet paper is now
also its much more efficient with large machines to do one large work a few times than to do many small tasks often
living on the east coast of australia let me tell you bamboo can and does grow uncontrollably it sounds like the appalachian s has a native and abundant species arundinaria https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/arundinaria#:~:text=arundinaria%20is%20the%20only%20bamboo,elevations%20in%20the%20appalachian%20mountains) what i haven t seen mentioned is the cost of processing bamboo bamboo is extremely hard and will blunt the tools you use to cut them i installed bamboo flooring in a 4x2 5m room and my table saw was blunt by the end if you need to cut and pulp the bamboo to make paper products the cost to your factory consumables like blades and grinders is going to be significantly more for bamboo than for pine
to simplify this explanation a bit at a large enough scale each square mile of farm land can produce about the same amount of bamboo or wood in about the same amount of time meaning prices are the same
in addition to this even if obtaining the raw material was a good bit cheaper with all aspects factored in the processing storage distribution costs would all be the same
have you seen cannabis grow cause in just one year and bam a ft tree grows plus weed big plants https://i.imgur.com/t8vltgm.jpg)
they absolutely use pesticides and herbicides when planting tree farms in clear cut areas to suppress other plant life mono crop tree farms are not only toxic when they re planted they also are ecological dead zones
i wonder if it would be feasible to cultivate your own bamboo farm and mass produce bamboo tp in the states in that way i m sure there would be a market for it
most toilet paper is actually made from old growth forests https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-toiletpaper-trfn/green-group-gives-u-s-toilet-paper-makers-failing-grade-over-forest-use-iduskbn23w01a). we cut down trees dozens or hundreds of years old to wipe our asses the companies single use tissue products including toilet paper are typically made from wood pulp mostly obtained by logging in canada s old growth northern or boreal forests the nrdc said in a report it s despicable
a bit off topic but it makes me wonder why paper products aren t made with cotton anymore it grows relatively fast you can recycle it from old clothes and last i checked cotton paper holds up pretty damned well plus it feels nice to write on
you left out the important part of bamboo it doesn t grow like a tree its in the same family as grasses a tree starts small and grows a little day by day getting taller and thicker at some point it can be harvested and that point varies depending on its use for timbers you want to let the tree grow a long time as it gets much taller and thicker leading to bigger longer straighter timbers and more of them bamboo grows from a rhizome the plants send out runners that connect like a net underground this is why it s so hard to get rid of when it s not wanted then once or twice a year depending on the species the bamboo shoots up at its end thickness it doesn t get thicker and thicker as years go on it s shoots pop out basically at it final thickness and shoot right up to the final height pretty fast its simply not a tree it s also very thirsty and only grows in certain areas farming trees for paper can be done in nearly every climate and doesn t take really any input it s just crappy softwood that grows naturally pretty much everywhere bamboo grows in only the southern us states and the varieties are pretty small
without evidence to back up my claim i would bet that because bamboo has the stigma and marketing of being greener the price goes up as well my experience is products that claim to be better for the environment are always more expensive than the less green counterparts
you just need more land to farm the amount of trees you want if trees required more land per unit of paper per time this would still be a significant drawback though it sounds like other comments are asserting trees and bamboo are relatively comparable on net product per time at least just needing more land is only as small an impediment as just needing more time or just needing more money
can confirm i live in canada and little maple saplings are like weeds sometimes they pop out of no where and start stealing all the nutrients we had to remove a decent size one after we discovered it popping out of the middle of a big beautiful lilac bush
you just need enough land to provide trees at the rate you want this is how you can actually birth a baby every month with pregnant women
all of the boons you listed for trees apply doubly so to bamboo so that doesn t make any sense it s so invasive aggressive and fast growing it s outright banned in many places
the effects are pretty awful though my family owns a camp on a large property leased from a paper company mead in maine the older areas where they didn t planned are desolate colorless patches of deaths they may regrow trees but it takes years and they destroy the forests and it s never the same again
my favorite fun facts about trees are these two there are more trees now than there were years ago this is due to forresters replanting more than they harvest there are more trees on earth than there are stars in the milky way galaxy
this feels like a chatgpt answer it repeats itself in parts
bamboo is the devil cutting down adult pine trees is definitely easier than harvesting bamboo
so basically bamboo products are bullshit
it s definitely true about how easy it is to grow trees in the us the claim from colonizing times in north carolina was that a squirrel could make it from the atlantic ocean to the mississippi river without having to touch the ground i believe that s well over miles as the crow flies at the closest points and quite a bit longer between most other points
plus you can pretty much take a bamboo stick jam it into the ground and it ll start to grow
now do hemp why aren t we using hemp for paper and pulp
how does it affect the soil random question i know but i m just really curious
i know a guy that basically lives of the money generated by the timber leases his family owns in south georgia gp plants maintains and harvests the trees on the land they rent from him
the olympic peninsula in washington state outside the wilderness anyway is basically one giant tree farm they have signs on the highway about when different lots were planted and when they ll be harvested they clearcut a plot then plant new trees then come back in like years and take half the trees then come back in more years clearcut again and plant new trees
the trees are also sorted the small and defective go to the paper mill the chips from the sawmill often go to the paper mill if there isn t a osb factory nearby in my area the small cypress trees are sent to the paper mill
we literally have hundreds of miles of pine tree farms in just my state alone the only thing that you need is land and patience nature will do everything else
i ll add that like crops there are bred varieties of trees that have very fast growth rates they are purpose grown to be turned into pulp
depends where you are there is a bamboo clump i know was planted years ago is over tall and diameter it is so dense you can not see thru it
you can add that a significant portion of toilet paper is made out of recycled paper
also we don t grow trees for the express purpose of processing them into pulp and paper goods we make lumber mostly that lumber produces sawdust and scrap then that lumber goes to a furniture shop which makes more sawdust and scrap then all that sawdust and scrap gets sold to whoever can use it including the pulp and paper industry so paper towels and such are really just a waste product of the lumber industry whereas bamboo is either used as is or processed into quality fibers for cloth not a lot of bamboo waste in that industry to turn into disposable things like paper towels
also tp is recycled waste paper and that is difficult and honestly senseless to source from a unique species
i ve seen bamboo grow a lot of places in the us too it s basically a weed you can t get rid of so why would it be so hard to grow
also trees are ridiculously easy to grow in places like the us that is true but bamboo grows well in more than half the us https://bambubatu.com/growing-bamboo-in-usda-zones-7-and-8/) you don t need pesticides or irrigation or much labor to make them grow i guess you re under the impression that bamboo is some kind of exotic plant it s not it s a weed and thus grows like one it takes little to no effort to grow bamboo and in fact i d wager it takes less effort to grow bamboo than it does trees
i d just like to add something to your comment at least where i am from in british columbia all the wood that goes to pulp mills to be turned into paper is wood from clearcut logging that can t really be used for anything else either because it is an odd shape starting to rot punky or most commonly is an undesirable species usually western hemlock there is a huge abundance of pulp wood so much so that it often costs more to haul the wood out of the bush than they are able to sell it for the only reason more of that kind of wood isn t simply left behind in the bush is because there are regulations against leaving too much waste behind and logging companies are legally obligated to sell it
bamboo is also ridiculously easy to grow in fact if you ever start growing it in an area then it is almost impossible to get rid of it it just regrows and spreads
i got tired of mowing acres and left uncut within years it looked like woodland maybe not ready to harvest but trees just grow
down in alabama the oil families setup trusts from the oil proceeds and now use that land in 10yr plots for pine trees to fund the family up to generations later
no this isnt the reason it s simply that they don t have a mass production line for it right now there is no way bamboo s wood production is the same as trees it takes years to grow a tree bamboo grows in a few months at best
also you use the good parts of the tree for lumber paper is made from the waste so the cost is minimal
i mean there are considerably more trees on earth than stars in the galaxy
i could be totally off here and someone please correct me if i m wrong but aren t the timber paper industries not really an issue when it comes to deforestation like i heard they often actually plant more trees than they cut down seeing as it s their actual raw material for product if i m not mistaken most of the issue with deforestation comes from livestock
so i imagine bamboo products are cheap in places it s native to e g china
yeah the reason for why isnt x cheaper than y is normally some variation of the old method is fine and already scaled well and the new method isn t that much better given the existing infrastructure
would you say that the difference strength between their materials also makes a difference in how easy it is to produce paper from each of them
nitpick bamboo is not a type wood it s a weed
yes and bamboo is a terrible invasive outside of its native range so it would be an ecological disaster to grow large areas of it native trees can be consistently regrown within the ecosystem they were first a part of which still support at least some of the other endemic species
what you forgot to ask the actual question describe the ask in more detail
it s an interesting combination of the input and output drives and the linkage my brother in law has such a vehicle but instead of utilizing the cvt there is an electrical setting that emulates or mimics a geared transmission see the image in the link below the input system forms a wedge the linkage is wedge shaped the output is similarly a wedge by controlling where the linkage rides on the input wedge and on the output wedge you have the balance between power vs speed the equivalent of 1st gear you want the output rpm to be greatly reduced from the input this might be a ratio of for every rotations of the engine the drive shaft rotates once this helps get all of the mass moving second gear might have a ratio of third gear maybe fourth gear might be fifth gear might be over drive at each increment you re trading power for speed a cvt car skips those increments and simply progresses smoothly between power and speed btw consider the m abrams tank it uses a jet engine to move i can only imagine that the initial gearing needed to get those tons moving lbs is something like i m sure an abrams technician can correct me https://repairpal.com/what-is-cvt-transmission
assuming you re talking about cvts and already understand the mechanical advantage that gears can provide there are sets of plates on each side of a belt but the plates are slightly conical like a very wide short party hat if you pinch the plates closer together it forces the belt out to a bigger diameter which acts like a big gear if you don t pinch the plates as much the belt slides between the plates even deeper at a smaller diameter which acts like a small gear using this you can have a continuously variable range of gearing simply by squeezing less or more on the belt to visualize more think of two party hats with the tips facing towards each other and a rod connecting them if you take a big enough piece of paper and wrap it around the big ends of the cones this is again representing your big gear by moving the party hats away from each other eventually the paper will be able to wrap around just the stick connecting them which is the small gear
depends on the water source and the later use but it is pre sanitized for one but i bet you re referring to the if you hate waiting for water to boil joke that s been around for years
removed
almost certainly referring to the joke otherwise just bottling would be fine adding in that if you want to fully sanitize questionable water just boiling probably isn t enough most portable camping solutions involve either bleach tablets to kill more microorganisms and or distillation of the evaporated water so that particulate matter is removed
dang it i got scammed didn t know it was a joke was a bit confused about the logic behind it hence why i asked
huh til about freezing boiled water i had never heard about that in all my years thanks for the info
boiling water doesn t remove impurities dissolved salts aren t going to disappear by boiling in fact you re just concentrating the impurities you re thinking of distillation which involves boiling water and allowing the steam to condense on a clean surface and run into a different clean container in addition depending on the impurity pure water may actually have a lower density than impure water since some impurities can occupy spaces between the lattice of water molecules regardless the density in most everyday cases isn t really going to alter the speed with which the ice melts that s going to depend most on surface area and temperature larger ice cubes are often used for cocktails because their lower surface area relative to their volume reduces how much they will dilute a drink taking ice on a camping trip is generally a waste of space ice takes up more room than liquid water better to just bring clean water in a bottle or a bladder
this sounds like chat gpt
buoyancy f vg force buoyancy density of the fluid displaced volume gravity for this example let s assume the density of the water and gravity are constant irl salt content and temperature can change density also fun fact gravity isn t constant everywhere on earth so that can change too that means the volume of displaced water is the variable that can be changed to determine the capacity of a ship by designing a ship to displace more volume it can carry more edit formatting added note about constants aren t actually constant based on reply
they calculate the volume of water that a ship displaces when it is empty and the volume of water that it displaces when at its maximum safe displacement the mass of the volume of water which makes up the difference is the maximum load the ship can carry
that s too much math they build the ship load it up until it sinks then build another identical ship and only load it until just before the other one sank
we don t assume the water density is constant which is why a ship has multiple plimsoll lines for different water types salinity and temperature
found the early roman shipwright
if you don t know the answer just tell calvin
that s the shipwright equivalent of tighten until you hear a crack then back off a quarter turn
also physics and buoyancy doesn t take into account the fact that the ship can simply snap in two under the weight of it s cargo in which case your buoyancy doesn t mean anything real answer is trial and error and then repetition at some point engineering becomes entirely empirical plus minus a little extra risk you take to push boundaries
neah they stop when ship is deep in water to the line painted on the side
very true poor phrasing indicated the assumption is being made for this example only and irl it is a factor
someone got the reference
better call saul
the idea of plimsoll lines is based on the forces from the water acting perpendicular to the shell of the boat inwards currents and storms will cause shear forces but the typical mode of failure is water entry from the top tipping from imbalance and capsizing wooden boats may have been more liable to leak catastrophically
but how do they know where to paint that line that s the job of the first ship
good point
first let s talk about mgh m stands for mass g stands for the acceleration due to gravity and h stands for the height above some reference point this equation represents the potential energy an object has due to its position relative to a reference point for example if you lift an object of mass m to a height h above the ground the potential energy it gains is given by mgh now let s talk about mmg r this equation represents the potential energy an object has due to its position relative to a central force such as the force of gravity m stands for the mass of the central object e g the planet g stands for the gravitational constant r stands for the distance between the two objects and the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive i e it pulls objects together this equation applies to situations where the object is in orbit around the central object and it represents the potential energy an object has due to its position relative to the central object so while both of these equations represent potential energy due to position they are different because they apply to different situations mgh applies to objects near the surface of the earth where the only significant force acting on them is gravity whereas mmg r applies to objects in orbit around a central object where there is a central force like gravity that is pulling the objects towards the center the negative sign in mmg r indicates that the force is attractive whereas there is no negative sign in mgh because gravity is always pulling objects towards the ground
lets use w and i for to separate them w mmg r u mgh u mgh is an approximation for elevation close to the surface of the earth for masses a lot smaller than then earth and describe the potential energy in a point relative to the surface g f m mg r with earth mass and earth radius and is the surface acceleration so mgh mhg mhf m hf that is force times distance and it works energy the real potential energy would be integral to the force from the top to bottom location because elevation changes are usually very small compared to earth s radius w is the energy that is required to go from an infinite distance from the earth to the surface you gain energy so the required energy is negative u is the energy release if the election change is h you get it by integrating gmm r from infinity to r which is earth s radius so it is not exactly the same thing one is an approximation close to the surface and one is from the surface to infinity because of the slight difference in definition the sign is the opposite
i appreciate the answer it really helped
can you explain the integrating from infinity to r part further please i m close to getting it thank you for your answer edit not the integration part why are the boundaries from infinity to r
it is from infinity because that is where the effect of gravity is zero gravity has infinite reach so only at infinity it will be zero it is to r because that is the surface and any object gravity accelerates to the object will likely stop there so the reasonable measure of potential energy is surface to infinity x200b https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravitational\_energy
there are obvious little things we pick up on that served an evolutionary purpose of keeping us safe from dangerous or untrustworthy people from this we recognize less dangerous but still socially relevant clues and then personal preferences it makes sense that we would instantly recognize something we find annoying so we can avoid this person lest we offend them which could lead to downstream consequences socially or who knows perhaps the person takes offence and goes postal it s all relevant
i m also going to chime in that we pick up on a lot of facial muscle movement as well can you tell the difference between a real smile and a fake smile in a fake smile there s just something about the cheek and eye muscles that don t get pulled all the way up facial traits and shape do not matter as much as that relative movement of their cheek muscles in a similar manner you can tell a bit from the facial posture of someone if their muscles are tense they might be feeling stressed if their muscles are more slack even the way that they are slack can give you friendly chill vibes or stone faced stubborn ones as the other comments say personal experience can also matter as well in recognizing patterns among faces
well watching how this person interacts with others is a very good indicator of how they will interact with you how they hold themselves their posture their movements can indicate their state of mind at any time someone scowling at the people around them might not be a good person to approach listening to their tone of voice and how they talk to people is another good indicator are they belittling someone are they treating them with courtesy etc their clothing can tell you a bit about a person as can any jewellery or scents a person wears do they wear fur are they scruffy do they have good personal hygiene all of these and more whether we re conscious of them at all reflect a persons personality even sociopaths and psychopaths what it all boils down to is if someone feels off to you before you even talk to them then perhaps you might want to use some caution
you actually make a judgement of the person in less than seconds of seeing them you just become consciously aware of it later and all of it is based on evolutionary hints physical size symmetry signaling quality of their genes and their access ability to acquire resources as a child the very same reason the halo effect exists where we subconsciously attribute good qualities to good looking people without any evidence
usually this comes from personal experiences with people similar to x that let s u create an impression that most likely will be erroneous
body language and subtle facial micro expressions that you are not consciously aware of may play a role although i like to give everyone a chance and the benefit of the doubt i find most of my first impressions tend to be accurate
acquired knowledge and past experiences i don t really think that personality reflects on people s physical physicial as in their body structure facial traits etc appearence but there s a lot of information that you get from the way that people choose to expose themselves to society facial expression in public style of clothing preferred clothing brands hairstyle etc you can make a lor of educated guesses about people based on these factors
your taste budses getted too much sugar and desensitized now less sugary soda tastes less sweet
it doesn t become unsweetened it seems less sweet in comparison to the sweet thing you re eating
low carb diet here i hardly ever eat anything overtly sweet so i can taste the sugar in things i used to think had none like broccoli onions cabbage etc a piece of fresh fruit tastes sweeter than what a candy bar used to
a music producer is closer to a film director although musicians often have more control over their product than actors but some music producers can be very heavily involved in the creative process film producers usually don t have as much direct involvement in the creative process but since a movie is a much bigger production than a song or even an album the primary film producer has a lot of responsibilities from bringing together the creative team and finding funding to setting and maintaining a budget and schedule to approving or demanding changes to the final product essentially the producer controls the money and can use that to exert leverage over the director and everyone else making the film there can be a team of producers though and in addition some people may be given producer credits for providing financing without having much direct involvement
music producers are the ones who make the music beat for a song they generally work with the artist to make their song to their vision as well as giving their own takes on it film producers handle the big picture part of making a movie they hire the script writers crew and directors they do casting often with the help of the director they also set the budgets and schedule for when everything must be done directors handle all the creative aspects of making the movie but the producer is the boss and can fire them if they don t like what they re doing directors are closer creatively to what music producers are
ok i suspected film producers were in some way less involved than music producers it sounds like there should be a different title for one or the other and neither is involved in the actual production of physical product this also seems weird since produce and product thanks for the reply i appreciate it
this also seems weird since produce and product both film and music producers have one job ensure that the product gets made so in essence yes they do produce the product but not always physically or so literally it isn t their job to sell the product advertising and it isn t their job to perform the talent
sure there can be different qualities besides the amount of light when we talk about quality of light we are usually talking about where the light is coming from and what color it is its not really about good or bad light but about whether a plant is getting the kind of light it evolved to live in generally light can come from a point source or a diffuse source the sun or a lightbulb would be a point source all light from one spot plants adapted for direct sunlight can deal with getting too much light without overheating and can deal with lots of red and infrared light plants sold as full shade evolved to get less light and from diffuse sources like an open blue sky or the underside of lots of other green leaves and you re right that sunlight changes through the day air steals blue light away from the suns rays and the stuff that s left is a little redder the more high in the sky the less air the light goes through the bluer the light
no but you may see this information in how to grow xxxx plant it s not that the quality of the light is any different it is due to temperatures plants that like cool temperatures do better if they get their light in the morning since the temperatures are cooler and during the hottest part of the day they re presumably in shade plants that like heat do better with an afternoon sun because it is warmer in the afternoon
leafy plants don t need a lot of sun to stay alive but it depends on the leaf size plant size temperature pressure and other nutrients plants will change the amount their pores are open which regulates how much oxygen leaves if the outside temp is too high or when their is no sun so if the plant is losing too much water through its pores it will slow down gas exchange which helps conserve water loss though the pores and so plants may not be as efficient in their processes at certain conditions it s similar to saying when would it ve best for an athlete to drink water throughout the day it depends on a lot of circumstances the suns light is more intense at certain times of the day different tines of day will change the intensity of the light based off the angle it is hitting the earth so when the sun is directly overhead it will be most intense it may be too intense for some plants at certain times of day and trigger the previous mentioned response
some plants evolved to grow on the forest floor where most of the direct light is captured by the trees and they grow using diffused light https://youtu.be/ukgqgzetuxe
the suns s intensity differs throughout the day because its distance and the thickness of the atmosphere differs relative to where you re standing at around noon when the sun is directly above you it s closest to you and the light has the thinnest amount of atmosphere to get through to get to you as the day goes on the sun is actually physically getting farther away and because the light is traveling at an angle to where you re standing it has to pass through more atmosphere to get to you that s why it s most important to have sun protection between when it comes to photosynthesis plants have a trade off they have to deal with the more sunlight light that comes in the more oxygen that leaves the plant and that oxygen takes some water with it as it leaves different plants have different strategies to deal with that for instance some have a waxy skin called a cuticle that helps prevent water from leaving some have a better root system to bring in more water they re basically adapted to the specific habitat they re native to so if the plant is adapted to a lot of sunlight it needs to get that intense sunlight between noon to and pm to thrive if it s not adapted to a lot of sunlight it will start to dry out unless it s shaded during that time of day
pretty much as you guessed our modern diets contain way more sugar and acid than any wild animal and it s catastrophically bad for our teeth if left alone and we plan to use those teeth for eighty years many times longer than the lifespan of most other animals with a single permanent set of teeth and animals do get teeth problems in the wild and it usually eventually kills them
you re on the right track here are a few reasons diet you re right about processed foods animals usually eat raw natural foods that don t contain added sugars or acids humans on the other hand eat a lot of processed and sugary foods which can cause tooth decay and gum disease brushing helps to remove these harmful substances from our teeth lifespan you re onto something here too humans generally live longer than most animals so we need to take care of our teeth for a longer period of time some animals might still face dental problems but they do not live long enough for these issues to become a major concern tooth structure human teeth are designed differently than many animals teeth some animals have teeth that continuously grow like rodents or that are replaced throughout their lives like sharks our teeth do not regenerate so we need to protect the ones we have food preparation animals typically chew their food more thoroughly than humans do which helps to clean their teeth naturally we often cook and soften our food which can make it stickier and more likely to get trapped between our teeth
you re pretty much on the money with your possible explanations it s a little bit of number one but mostly number two the modern human diet isn t really that good for our teeth we ve changed it rapidly too which means that evolution essentially hasn t had a chance to catch up it hasn t needed to either because we ve developed dental care like toothpaste and stuff to compensate for what our teeth can t do themselves the third thing to consider is that technically we don t need to brush our teeth we just choose to because it s a lot better than letting our teeth rot animals in the wild will still suffer from dental decay but they just live with it or don t often it kills them
humans live longer lifespans than wild animals relative to evolutionary maximum possible thanks to sanitation medical care understanding of nutrition wild animals don t eat refined sugar there are other ways animals clean their teeth such as chewing on sticks
our diets and lifestyle are the main cause but it is worth noting that animals still can have problems with their teeth that often prove fatal so house pets often receive some dental care on their vet visits however animals overall have a less diverse diet and encounter less problems with their teeth compared to humans who not only have problems with cavities but also with misalignment narrow palates and many other issues that stem from our lifestyles remote populations or people living in older times tended to have wider palates misalligned of crooked teeth were rarer and typically their teeth were generally worn down from use which on one hand could cause problems long term but on the other most people didn t live long enough to encounter those problems and this proves that they were using their teeth a lot more than us chewing a lot more and for tougher food
one additional aspect i don t see anyone else mentioning is that humans have a closed mouth and we don t pant both of those traits mean that we produce a lot less saliva and what we do produce just kind of sits there that gives the bacteria a lot more time to do their dirty work
you are evolutionarily successful if you reproduce and your offspring survive to reproduce teeth aren t really important for that at if you have kids at and they re independent already same goes for every other animal depending on how they raise offspring most animals have offspring earlier than we do in terms of life span some animals do have other sets of teeth or have behaviours that help their teeth like chewing certain things
different animals have different adaptations for maintaining dental health some have teeth that continue to grow and need to be worn down by gnawing others have teeth that are constantly replaced and lots of animals do need dental care pets or animals in captivity get dental care which allows them to survive issues they wouldn t survive in the wild
dogs and cats should get their teeth brushed though my cat had a lot of tartar build up expensive af to get it removed it s why dogs have those dental sticks it s not just a thing to make dog owners spend more money
it s a nice example of survivor bias most of the animals with serious teeth problems are dead so you think animals all have healthy teeth
yep they call it dental death
jesus imagine if our teeth just kept growing
i can add to this that even humans living in the wild generally can live longer than our teeth last and there isn t a strong evolutionary pressure that prevents that living in supportive groups cooking and mechanical food processing chopping grinding juicing change the game
lovely
followed by tooth decay
wouldn t be much of an issue you d just be going to the dentist like you go to the barber salon now i m sure there d be fashions in tooth grooming too like teenagers getting spikes and skulls carved into theirs then needing to take a gap year after school so they could grow their teeth out for interviews
then you re comment would say imagine if not because growing teeth would be normal for us
good point in addition to this point even if we do lose our teeth it generally tends to happen at an age after we have given birth so again there isn t an evolutionary pressure because any advantage we gain from having longer lasting teeth doesn t come into play until after we ve already had children and passed on our genes
preceded by more likely
definitely we re already obsessed with teeth as it and what it means for attractiveness and social status some examples teeth whitening teeth bling braces white fittings teeth veneers
yep exactly most other animals need their teeth more than people do because we have hands and technology
i think u tra91c was making a joke the entire animal decays due to tooth problems
i tried
blood flow increasing flow to the extremities like your hands and feet will cool it down a little sending less to the limbs and more to the core will keep the internal temperature higher
there are a bunch of other thermoregulation tools available to your body brown fat cells are a type of fat cell that store fat not for energy storage but so it can be burned when you get cold they turn on when your body temperature drops kind of like a bunch of tiny furnaces your body also regulates your level of movement and activity through feedback loops in your brain when you re overheated you won t want to move around much and when you re cold you ll twitch and rub your body vigorously and fidget and other small movements that burn extra energy heat loss can be regulated by causing blood vessels in your skin to dilate or contract more blood flow carries heat more efficiently to the surface of your body effectively reducing how much insulation your body has this is why you go pale if you re out in the cold for a long time and why you flush when you re overheated
not mentioned in other answers hair follicles your body hair traps air and provides a bit of insulation when you re slightly cold muscles in each body hair follicle contract making your body hair stand up trapping more insulating air near your body which keeps you warmer
your body has something called a thermostat just like your house does the thermostat in your body is called your hypothalamus and it helps to keep your body at the right temperature when your body gets too hot your hypothalamus tells your body to sweat sweat helps to cool your body down as it evaporates turns from a liquid into a gas this is why you feel cooler when you sweat on a hot day when your body gets too cold your hypothalamus tells your body to do things to keep you warm for example you might shiver to create heat or your body might start to make more heat by burning calories from food at mild temperatures your body is pretty good at regulating its own temperature so you probably don t need to worry too much about getting too hot or too cold but if you start to feel too hot or too cold you can always add or remove layers of clothing or go somewhere with a different temperature to help your body feel more comfortable
you can get it in the us it s called bacitracin but neosporin is more popular and wide spread since it has three antibiotics and brulidine only has one i grew up in the us and i ve never used anything except neosporin
the tires themselves don t look any different than any other cars tires i assume the op means wheels rims which are often aero wheels to help improve range
evs can and do use the same tires as gas cars the primary reason for any tweaks to the tires would be to provide less rolling resistance which provides greater efficiency you might be thinking if the bmw i3 which does have a goofy tire wheel setup for efficiency most evs have regular looking wheels and tires
electric vehicles are much heavier than gas cars because of the batteries so they are much rougher on tires as a result ev tires are heavier and made of stronger compounds to resist the wear and tear some ev tires even have acoustic foam inside of them to reduce road noise which is much more noticeable in an ev
i never noticed that the tires look weird but if there is a difference it s due to weight the smallest tesla is the model in the long range variant the weight is lbs the base ford f150 pickup weighs lbs the tiny mid size sedan weighs lbs more than a large pickup even the smallest f150 is huge thesedays so it really shows how heavy those electric cars really are it ll be scary for cars to get into collisions with electric cars a miata weighs lbs almost half the weight of the tesla model
i m kinda surprised aero wheels aren t starting to see use on gas cars to help with milage
also the other big thing is aerodynamics probably much more so than the things you mentioned evs are all about effeciency and weird wheels or aero wheels help to minimize drag and boost range by a significant amount also evs use the same tires as all other vehicles and do not require stronger rims than other vehicles
no ev tires aren t significantly different except that they usually come with low rolling resistance eco tires to improve range those tires kinda suck bc they don t have much grip
the cost structure is different half a kilo less on wheels might save you some gas but on the ev it allows to pack more battery
whom to believe now
you can tell there is no grip due to how quickly they accelerate s
a bajillion youtube videos explaining exactly why evs need different tyres should gently nudge you towards the commenter saying the same
it allways surprises me when i get downvotes for just regular question
thanks dude
we can t possibly know if my experience of seeing say red is the same as it is for you however one thing we do know is that everyone in the world with normal color vision says that red is similar to orange and that orange is similar to both red and yellow and that reddish oranges look more similar to red and yellowish oranges look more like yellow we also know that everyone can point to a reddish color that is not at all yellowish and not at all bluish it is unmixed this color is primary red everyone has these primaries and they are always red yellow and blue edit and green in contrast purple looks somewhat reddish and somewhat bluish to everyone and you won t find anyone who considers purple a primary color in that it is only purplish and not at all bluish reddish or any other color in short we know that everyone s color perception is structured the same way using the same color space with the same overall geometry we just don t know if the subjective experience associated with each point in the color space is the same
there are apparently a number of people who have their red green colour perceptions switched this happens because two forms of red green colours blindness occur in the same person swapping the red green sensors however they do not know they ve got this condition we only know how many people must have the condition no one appears to have reported symptoms of it https://youtu.be/uusv1ubncgs
well theirs two ways to look at this x200b the science answer coloured light as a specific wavelength so for someone to see green they would need to receive light with that wavelength x200b the philosophical answer does it matter as long as two people look at say a plant and can agree that plant has green leaves and a white flower then the percieved colours are almost irrelevant so long as they are consistent
i ve thought the same thing about taste as well does chocolate taste the same to me as it does to you we ll never know
this post got tagged biology but the question is almost more one of philosophy we don t know for sure that other people experience things the same way that we do
i don t know if tommy edison is still active on youtube but he had an old video where he talked about the different ways people have tried to describe color to him he s blind since birth so he has no experience seeing color whatsoever but he knows what all the different colors are and what they represent he knows that the sky is blue and so is the ocean even if water is clear he knows trees and grass are green unless they re dead then they re brown or yellow he knows fire trucks are red and school buses are yellow and so on but he s never been able to imagine color no one s ever been able to describe what green looks like they can only name objects that are green
oh yay this one again my favorite because guess what we know some people see different colors a very small percentage of women have types of cones most people only have we actually knew this was a possibility before it could be proven due to dissection of cadaver eyes but could not prove it due to the problem described in this philosophy question technology had to catch up enter led monitors they made a custom monitor with leds red green blue and yellow on half the screen they used normal rgb to make a solid color on the other half they mixed all to make the same color only the women with cones could tell the difference
your question is actually kind of fuzzy ignoring the how it ranges from easy yes to complex mostly maybe to easy no so i ll briefly introduce some concepts and then re ask and answer three different versions of your question in psychology neuroscience and cognitive sci they distinguish sensation and perception in the case of color vision sensation would the different wavelengths of light from the world stimulating different receptors in your eye for a non colorblind human light will stimulate red green and blue receptors with different intensity to make up the visual spectrum and then signalling the brain most types of colorblindness https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/color_blindness) would be due to a problem in these receptors a problem of sensation perception in vision is the processing of the signal in the brain into information that we then have both subconscious and conscious response to there are several types of blindness colorblindness and other vision disorders that can originate at any stage of processing https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-blindness-is-in-the-mind/) in the brain a problem of perception for science and medicine the definition of perception is bound by what an independent researcher can observe or measure in a subject measuring at one end again in color vision might involve examining both what you say you see and how your body reacts to viewing something like the bubbly circles in the ishihara colorblindness test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ishihara_test), while on another end it might involve an interview asking you to describe what the color green looks like and feels like what is interesting it that even though the latter is a subjective test there tends to be some interesting consistency within a culture and even worldwide take color theory in european art for example in particular the concept of warm vs cool colors https://artincontext.org/warm-colors/) which is completely subjective synthesizing emotional memories and the perceptions of two different senses color via vision and temperature via touch yet somehow for any age group in students first ever art class they agree remarkably well on what s warm reds vs cool blues examples like these and associated experiments all provide a general picture that as far as measurable perception is concerned healthy people in the same general culture have the same general perception of colors so a scientific understanding of someone s perception is limited to what s so far measurable by an outsider but all the words and emotions i can spill on paper won t describe what makes the color red look so brilliantly red what redness is these are called qualia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qualia) in philosophy there does not seem to be any way for one person to get any indication of the experience of qualia of another person and it s possible that the definition of qualia itself as it is now requires that it be unknowable to the outside observer which may preclude it from being a useful topic of conversation by any means mary s room https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knowledge_argument) is the thought experiment used to illustrate all this whether a neuro optical scientist whose entire life from birth has been in an environment without a single red colored or red reflecting object would upon suddenly seeing the color red for the first time ever gain new knowledge so the question for you op is which question were you actually asking do we as in generally healthy non colorblind humans have the same sensation of color yes do we have the same perception of color most stuff i ve seen i m not in this field indicates again yes but it s much harder to measure generally do we have the same experience of color qualia there is literally no way to know unless you have some ideas
we don t know and it doesn t matter anyway the only thing that matters is that we have the same spectrum of visible light it is the same as sounds whether or not we perceive sounds the same way as long as we perceive them nothing changes
short answer no you cannot detect anyone that perceive colours the same way as long as what he perceives is in bijection with what you perceive it s only when there is an injection at least two colours peirceived as the same that you can detect it same thing for knowing if other people really exist or if you re the only person that exist and all around you is simulated there is no way to know if people exist the same way you exist
we don t see the same colors i ve been through this enough women see more shades of purple than men colorblind see less than average people do in the end we all do our thing and get by
yeah its really interesting the problem for colorblind people is that they cant distinguish a lot of colors from each other but really as long as the person can distinguish all colors clearly regardless of whether they see them differenty you literally would have no idea that they in fact see colors differently even if their red appears as green to us neither would know that there is a discrepancy since both were conditioned to call that particular color as red from childhood and these people would have no idea what you re talking about if you tell that there is something wrong with them since the only way to describe the color is its name basically which you both call the same way
we don t we don t know if other people experience any qualia the same as anyone else we can t read their minds to check but it doesn t really matter we all learn to call each qualia the same thing even if our inner experiences differ
your answer rubs the right way
the primaries are red blue and green not yellow red blue yellow is a simplification of the cyan magenta yellow subtractive colour space which is why printers use cmy inks and not rby rgb are the primaries of additive colour space e g light because those are the three colours the three types of cone cells in our eyes are most sensitive to
it s trippy to think of this and your initial thought is wow what must it be like to walk around and see red when you should be seeing green and not knowing it and then realizing that if we don t know who has this then it s possible you have it
as a geneticist though i d just like to stress there isn t enough theoretical grounding for what physical phenomena give rise to qualia to actually guarantee that the sensors being swapped would change the subjective qualia experiences it s hard to speak a picture but imagine what it takes for us to perceive a color the light hits a red green sensor protein but then the sensor protein has to activate the neuron it s embedded in the neuron passes on its signal to other neurons and this triggers a whole cascade of post processing effects analyzing the channels and so on so the central question with qualia is where in this process does it go from a signal to a quality if it s already a qualia by the time it activates the first neuron or early in the post processing step then sure we could say that two people have their qualia swapped but if qualia are an emergent property of the post processing that occurs after the concrete parts we know about like receptors then we don t even have an objective basis on which to judge what physical circumstances it would take in order to show that two people s qualia are swapped just because one neuron at a particular position in the network has its own channels swapped that doesn t prevent any of the overall gestalt post processing steps from also being different possibly in compensatory ways possibly in epistatic ways etc
your spectrum answer didn t really answer the question though did it being able to see the spectrum is different than how we may perceive it sort of like i like really spicy food and my friend hates anything more hot than black pepper if we ate the same spicy food while we d both be tasting the same thing we would perceive it as a different experience just with food it s easy to articulate it because i can eat what he eats i can t see through his eyes to know he sees what i do
exactly and one of the ways you can tell if someone is colourbind in early childhood is if they frequently have trouble distinguishing certain colours that look similar when you have colourblindness ex a child says leaves are red or that their strawberries are green
as to that second part i m going to throw in the dress https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/heres-why-people-saw-the-dress-differently.html) that caused mass confusion over percieved colors i see blue and black my co workers wrongly insisted on white and gold
answer written by a king
the science answer coloured light as a specific wavelength so for someone to see green they would need to receive light with that wavelength there are some wave lengths of light that trigger your cones in identical ways even though the wave lengths are different i e there s not a one to one relationship between wavelength and what the eye sees even amongst the visible spectrum this also means there are certain wavelengths of color that the human eye physically cannot distinguish
it s both really although i find the philosophical argument much more interesting
not quite it is true that cyan magenta and yellow are the most commonly used subtractive color primaries it is also true that red green and blue are the most commonly used additive primaries but these aren t the colors the three cone types in our retinas are most sensitive to the l and m cone types actually have very similar sensitivity spectra with m peaking at yellowish greens and l peaking at more yellowish wavelengths none of the cones respond well to red it s just that l responds more to red than m does and in fact s doesn t exactly peak at primary blue either for mixing light or pigments you can really use any set of colors as your primaries and those primaries will then define a gamut of mixable colors with the primaries at the corner points of that gamut it s just that when using a limited palette some triplets of colors are more useful than others as they define a larger gamut what i was talking about though are the perceptual primary colors i e those colors that humans perceive as being unmixed being not at all similar to any other color orange for instance isn t primary because it is perceptually similar to red and yellow the perceptual or sometimes called the psychological primaries are red yellow green and blue i see now that i left out green before sorry about that not only are they pure but they come in opponent pairs red green and blue yellow it is impossible to have a color that is at once both of a pair of opponent colors you can t have a reddish green or a bluish yellow that is you can mix pigments or light of those colors together to get a new color but you cannot create a color that is perceptually both red and green or both blue and yellow the relationship between the perceptual primary colors and the cone types in your retina isn t precisely understood although the opponent process theory comes close i already told you that none of the cones responds well to red but l responds to it more than m well that s enough to distinguish red from other colors your visual cortex doesn t listen to the cone responses separately it looks at the pattern of relative activation of all three for instance if you subtract the m response from the l response you get a value that tells you where a color falls on the red green axis if you take the average l m response and subtract it from the s response you get a value that tells you where the color lands on the yellow blue axis if you look at the average response of all three cones you get the color s brightness i e where it lies on the black white axis these three axes together define a perceptual color space that seems to match quite neatly with the perceptual primaries which also include black and white and there is plenty of neural evidence for some form of color opponency in the visual system the only problem is that the numbers don t quite add up that is the wavelengths that people perceive as pure don t quite line up with what you would predict from this simple theory the true explanation obviously must still be some function of the cone cell sensitivities it s just likely not a simple as this and certainly not as simple as the primaries being the frequencies that the three cone types are most sensitive to
welcome to my first time getting stoned this question kept me fully occupied for an hour at least minutes or so real time
it s a real mind bender
grass and trees definitely look green for me
this is eli5 not explain it like i have a doctoral degree on the subject j k this is actually really interesting albeit mostly over my head
and judging from how the brain adapts when the qualia are changed like in the upside down glasses experiment it s seems likely that qualia is emergent to a degree in any case
you can eat the same thing but you are not guaranteed to precieve the same taste
thats the point where the questions steer into philosophy really how do i know for example that i m not the only actual person on earth that is experiencing reality and that everyone else isn t just empty machines on autopilot that act like they are experiencing something its pretty much the same question is my reality the same as your sense of it and vice versa
the base dress was blue and black the photo of the dress was white and gold
describe green then how is your green the green green
right which sub i forget that a lot basically the receptors being in the wrong place doesn t automatically mean the perceptions are switched there s a famous experiment type where people wear vision distorting https://gizmodo.com/does-your-brain-really-have-the-power-to-see-the-world-5905180) glasses of various kinds the brain eventually adapts to the visual distortion and crucially there s often a period after the glasses are removed where normal vision looks wrong and the subject is confused the same in a different area of perception is famously true of sailors when you spend enough time on a boat you get so used to the waves getting your sea legs that you have to get your land legs back https://maintenanceandcure.com/maritime-blog/how-to-get-your-sea-legs-and-land-legs-back-again/)" upon setting foot back on the unmoving ground so if the brain does all this post processing work to turn perception into a coherent picture and it does seem to then where do qualia fit into all of that we don t know but we can say that maybe even if you did change an adult s color receptors late in life the brain would just eventually adjust and have a perceptual swap same as a sailor getting their land and sea legs
that s what i was saying in the same way we can both see the visible light spectrum but we have no way to actually say whether or not we both perceive it the same or differently
i would say the photo was periwinkle and bronze myself but the point was the photo was overexposed if you saw blue and black your brain was correcting for the overexposure if you saw white and gold your brain was due to missing cues in the photo perceiving it as under exposed and correcting in the opposite direction to white and gold
i mean it s clearly not red it s the color green lol
they re saying separate from the fact that you may not both enjoy the same taste you may not in fact even be really tasting the same flavors our taste buds can vary just as easily as our eyes can people disagree on whether or not they like a photo all the time while still being able to agree on what the photo contains and the colors used your food analogy wasn t exactly
i would say the photo was periwinkle and bronze myself and you would be wrong
you got it totally wrong i bet your green is my red
seems bang on to me as a member of the color deficient we won t always agree on what a photo contains or the colors used just as different taste pallets may discern different ingredients within a dish in fact there s a decent argument to be made that we do know that different people do not perceive color the same just that we have agreed on names for specific frequency bands
while i ll give that the black i see is actually more of a murky brown on the photo than black i m assuming you re trolling about the white part here s an article that looked at the picture s pixel colors https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-the-white-and-gold-blue-and-black-dress-illusion-2015-2). and another one that used photoshop s eyedropper https://www.tumblr.com/nathanfairbairn/112246531934/about-that-dress?redirect_to=%2fnathanfairbairn%2f112246531934%2fabout-that-dress&source=blog_view_login_wall) to pick out the pixel colors the white you insist on is a light blue color which is not the vivid blue i see on the dress photo but it s still not white
identity theft here s the basics if someone has your name address and birthday they can use that to get a birth certificate since most people live in the same city they were born in this is why you don t use your real birth year online if they have a birth certificate they can get a couple of utility bills in your name then use all that to get a licence if you have licence they can open bank accounts in your name then they can get credit cards in your name and build up credit debt which you will be responsible for you could end up owning a fortune just because you let them access some of your most private information don t put real information online especially not your real birthday
no they can get a drivers licence in your name doesn t have to have your drivers licence number only your bank kniws that any other bank will happily accept their stolen licence as legit so yes you do have to be concerned and protect your private info because proving yoyr identity has been stolen is extremely difficult and getting out of the debt these people put you under is also extremely difficult scammers are after this as well as yoyr money
in most states the licence number doesn t change when a licence is renewed some states have only recently introduced a second number unique for the card that does change upon renewal i don t know if every state has that yet but there are still companies and services that only ask for licence number and not the card number also the licence contains your photo address and date of birth which alone can be enough information for identify theft any personal information a malicious actor can get their hands on is useful if not by itself then in aggregate with other pieces of information think of it like a puzzle your name address dob and photo are pieces the fact you have accounts with latitude is another piece maybe they get your phone number from the optus hack your medical details from the medibank hack then they use these details to trick another company into giving more information from there it doesn t take much to start taking advantage of the info for financial gain
yes but if they don t have the drivers license number then no need to worry
if they have a birth certificate they can get a couple of utility bills in your name then use all that to get a licence x200b well they can just get a new one
sound waves aren t individual notes they are a combination of different notes known as timbre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timbre). different singers as well as different instruments have different timbres
by that same logic every instrument of every type should sound the same and you shouldn t be able to tell a singer from a piano notes only have pitch and duration pitch is how high or low the sound is and as long as the sound is hitting that pitch then it s doing the right note but we don t produce perfect square sound waves every sound has to ramp up to the desired pitch stay there and then come down the irregularities small ups and downs on the sound as it does that are called timbre and are what allows us to distinguish different sounds even if they have the same pitch you obviously know every person is different so it follows that their throats will be different and so will their timbre
same reason a guitar and a banjo sound different the space in which the sound is developed is different and the hole it comes out of is different plus singers also change the shape of their instrument and their hole as they sing
well it s really not too different from the same singer singing a single note and changing what vowel they are singing when we think of the note that someone is singing or an instrument is playing we re really talking about the fundamental note when something produces a note it actually produces a series of notes getting higher and higher but because these notes are really closely related something called the harmonic series they blend together instead of hearing them as a bunch of notes we hear them as a single note with a particular tone colour or timbre changing the relative loudness of all these overtones changes the timbre this is what lets us hear the difference between different singers as well as between different instruments it s also what s responsible for vowels try this download a spectrum analyser app frequensee used to be a good free one don t know if it still is then sing the letter aaaaaah you ll see a big spike at the pitch you re singing and then a bunch of other spikes at higher frequencies if you change the note you re singing you ll see all the spikes moving one way or the other together now try again but this time sing aaaaaaaaaaeeeeeee changing sound part way through you ll see that the big spike stays the same but all the other spikes get bigger or smaller each person has a slightly different way of blending those overtones together so the extra spikes would be slightly different that s why it sounds different to us even though the fundamental note is the same
voices have different timbres or tone colors because the vocal chords that produce the sounds are different sizes and shapes in different people and also because we can use different vocal techniques to vary our timbre to some extent humans have evolved to perceive timbre very well we recognize voices we know even over the phone or in a recording this is probably because recognizing the source of an unseen sound is sometimes helpful for survival
leaving aside any potential enhancements that may be taking place behind the scenes some days you just have another match or two to burn and your riding companion doesn t cycling is nearly as much mental is physical say these two guys are in their own breakaway they re both hurting and both are pushing just as hard as they have to to hang with the other one it s also harder to bridge a gap than it is to stay with someone so rider a recognizes that rider b is hurting a lot but rider a knows they still have some in the tank they wait till an appropriate time a kick up in incline or when their opponent takes a drink of water and then they make their move putting a few bike lengths in rider b then has to get out of the saddle and sprint to catch up but if they really don t have anything left in the tank they re not going to make it and since they were already just hanging on with rider a now they re discouraged as well because they re spent all motivation disappears as rider a disappears into the distance
if you re the 2nd rider in even a group of the drafting effect of the rider in front reduces your workload by about if you re keeping up and resting and recovering great but the rider ahead thinks you re barely hanging on at that reduced effort then they sprint away enough to break the tow just or metres will do it and now your same amount of effort is not enough to keep going at the speed you were at as you ve lost the aerodynamic tow so you either have to put in the additional to maintain the speed you were doing and then add another to sprint on top of that to get back on their wheel or you get left behind as soon as the lead rider sees you catch them up again they ease off they ve tested you and see you have the capacity to spare right now but maybe not later but if they think you can t catch them immediately then they keep up that sustained speed for another seconds or so to ensure the gap is large enough that the you can t slipstream them
everyone is already on their limit when they are goign up a climb that late in a race if you spend too much time at your limit or if you cross your limit too much your body essentially shuts everything down no matter how hard you try your legs literally do not have the ability to push harder because they are too full of lactic acid
this is how they train you have sprinters climbers all rounders and time trialists and to a degree you have unofficially descenders who are really good at making up or gaining time downhill what you really need to understand is that professional cyclists train an insane amount for base fitness that puts them on a crazy level compared to recreational cyclists they then train for their specialties on top of that reaching their threshold for lactic acid buildup and max power output i m sure you know pros train with power meters so they aren t really looking at speed just their sustained output when you see someone take off from the front on a hill or on the flats in a breakaway they are putting in extra effort that they have trained for without entering their max effort threshold the difference in sustained wattage output is what separates all the disciplines sprinters max out in very short bursts whereas climbers can go for a long time uphill at a threshold that would destroy others cyclists train on the same mountain climbs in the off season that they ll encounter in grand tours and they ll ride the routes and come up with power plans with their teams for spring classics they are also very very good at controlling power output a watt change in pace can put you in an advantageous position or burn you out younger riders recover better when on the bike and tend to make exciting moves like breakaways and climbing attacks all pros have to train for mountains so most pros are actually good at it they may hate it and they may finish far behind the leaders but you and i would not be able to climb a grand tour mountain stage within the pro time limit even if we trained all year for it a lot of pros drop out in the mountains usually sprinters first timers and anyone with an injury or illness when you see two leaders dueling it out on a climb one of them inevitably has some advantage better output or endurance and will try to make the other break attacks on climbs are difficult and responding to them is a chore and often as not the rider with the advantage is the one with patience and experience who is waiting for the other to break there have been races where both climbers have slowed to a crawl because they didn t want to be the one to attack there are also instances of riders giving it everything and pulling out a miracle and there are instances of favorites just blowing up and limping to the top it s all a matter of power output and endurance and it makes for a hell of a show
breakaways at the top of a climb are a classic move you may now be going into a downhill where bike control takes precedence over top speed or where gravity somewhat compensates for air resistance so the fact that you are on you own is less of a burden than it would be on flat land also if you are in fact in better shape than them it s not ideal to make the extra effort to lose them on a climb as it doesn t buy much distance so waiting til you are at the top to show what you ve still got in the tank you is a better strategy
not to answer the question but the average speed of the race was km h mph try and ride your bike that fast for a couple of minutes then imagine riding that fast for just over hours because that s what these guys can do
as someone who has actually broken away from the pack during a crit race i feel uniquely qualified to answer this i didn t engineer the breakaway it just happened once it did however i struggled to maintain my lead i stood up and sprinted during the straightaways and took the corners at full speed while the pack would gain on me on the straightaways i managed to maintain my lead for about two laps just on cornering alone i didn t even touch the brakes on the corners so there s that sometimes the lead rider is just better on that day for one reason or another and sometimes the pack is just too lazy to chase the lead rider down most breakaways happen on the climbs where aerodynamics is less of a factor here the rider with the best power to weight ratio is always at a distinct advantage
well explained i m not a professional cyclist or even a hobby one much anymore but i think the mental aspect is a big part of any activity where you push yourself to limits it s something i recommend people explore from time to time because you often find what you thought were your limits weren t really a limit yet it s like your brain body holds you back but if you can tap into that you can surprise yourself with what you can do of course do it safely lifting weights over your limit can injure you and such but there s a sense of awe doing something like riding a long cycling route feeling yourself completely drained but stubbornly pushing on and finding eventually your body that s signaling that it s completely out of gas gives up complaining and opens the reserve tank and off you go
you left out the team aspect of professional cycling which is one of the most fascinating parts riders with great domestiques are better able to pace themselves and keep some reserve in the tank effectively making them something like a stage rocket so in the context of a drop if rider a goes and rider b is able to get paced on the break by rider c rider c may drop off early but now rider b potentially has something in reserve that rider a might not teams also set riders up for stages they will specialize in climb stages sprint stages very few riders in the peloton are actually competing for the overall win which means they don t necessarily have to worry about leaving it on the field during a climb stage when they can just chill in the peloton for the next stage or two
how does this contribute to the topic at hand in any way
i don t ride in groups or with other people any more but it was always fun to convince my legs to shut up so i could focus on breathing without letting my chest explode just so i could stay ahead of someone during a sprint
i m a hobby cyclist you re right beyond the muscle there is actually a large mental component it literally requires mental focus concentration to maintain higher power levels let s say normally you can do watts for an hour doing you can breathe easily and have a conversation doing requires breathing concentration and focusing on forcing your legs to maintain a certain rpm if you lose focus you lose power
interestingly there s a board game that tries to simulate this flamme rouge each player gets two riders a sprinter who is very fast when fast and very slow when slow and a rouleur who is more consistent you re always trying to be in but not at the head of the peloton which tires out your rider so you can break away as the finish approaches
you re totally correct but describing going kmph on flat and on incline for hrs as chilling is just very funny
for sure it s all relative i m sure riding at speed in the peloton feels pretty compared to climbing the alpe d huez as part of a three man break
yeah they just operate on a whole other level it s crazy to think about
yup my personal time up alpe d huez is about world record is something like i blame my team who were in costume and kept stopping to take photos
for sure they re also going that fast within inches of dozens of other cyclists watching the peloton move so fluidly to avoid obstacles or account for crosswinds is amazing i also love when the group decides they re not going to let a break go or groups of rivals decide to work together and go as a second break to chase down people is great i feel like drive to survive uci edition would be great
the reason the us government can just endlessly print money is because the money is not just backed by the wealth of the united states because oil can only be bought and sold in dollars in most cases it s also backed by the oil wealth in the world countries want the currency so that they can do trade if countries no longer need the dollar and view things like the yuan as a safer currency to do the deals with noone will want the dollar any more supply and demand the value of the dollar goes bye bye obviously this won t happen overnight and dollars will still be desired as a reserve currency but not in the same quantity it once was
the us dollar is the reserve currency because the us is stable strong and currency freely convertible the petrodollar thing the other posters are alluding to only applies to saudi arabia the us provides aid to ksa in exchange for them only accepting usd for their oil all other oil producers are free to accept whatever currency they please in exchange for their oil but they choose the usd because of the reasons i stated above also the agreement has already expired and ksa is free to accept payment in any currency brics is a new economic bloc similar to the eu consisting of brazil russia india china and south africa they re proposing establishing a new currency to backed by their members so they don t have to depend on the usd to try and weaken the us economic position if no one needs the usd then the us is in a weaker bargaining position when it comes to trade a weakening usd would be a boon for us industries depending on exports their products are now cheaper and more competitive but would be devastating for industries depending on imports their products are now more expensive to produce
the reserve currency means that a fledgling country s currency can have a stable backing to it it makes that country s currency more legitimate other countries have an incentive to make their currency the reserve to drive up the demand for that currency and increase its apparent legitimacy across the globe for the us if fewer people are using the us dollar means a lower value for the dollars in circulation
the best way to understand the problem is an example say you live in a fantasy kingdom that has the only supply of fairy dust in the whole world fairy dust is like oil or in our world the petro dollar every other kingdom uses fairy dust for their furnaces to make magical items also to trade as currency your kingdom doesn t really make anything except for fairy dust so everyone in your kingdom relies on the money the government makes from selling and trading it to survive suddenly another kingdom starts making the fairy dust and tells its neighbors they want to trade using goblin ears this new kingdom suddenly puts your kingdom in jeopardy of going bankrupt if the other nations all agree to buy the dust and trade in goblin ears effectively shutting down your entire kingdoms economy so you go to your neighbors and make a deal that they won t ever trade in goblin ears so you still control a majority of the trade
removed
thank you for the thoughtful response so brics could become an issue if it s stability becomes greater than that of the us dollar which would drive countries to choose it as their reserve currency is the route to it actually challenging the usd just a matter of countries like the ksa deciding to use it exclusively
if it s a boon for us exporters would that theoretically help bring back manufacturing jobs and such to the us
rebut instead of breaking rule
well i don t think your going to find a good eli5 because your question might be a flawed we can measure impaired nutrient absorption in alcoholics digestive damage endocrine damage liver damage all affect these things and you can build studies around measuring those impacts i don t know how you d even make a study to measure the effect of alcohols immediate effect on a given meal there probably is some detriment but we don t have any means of measuring what it is at least i m not aware of any perhaps someone will surprise me
it s not a direct relationship and it depends on a lot of factors the amount volume and concentration of alcohol the duration of exposure for short term and long term effects the type of food and the amount of food and the timing of food and drinking
i see what you re asking a combo of the first two while it s in your stomach small intestine and while it s being processed by your liver alcohol impairs fat absorption in the small intestine so this includes fat soluble vitamins adek during liver processing your liver prioritizes the alcohol and doesn t really metabolize process macro and micronutrients that you ve recently ingested as far as your question of how long i m not sure i would guess it s for as long as you feel the effects of being drunk because that a good proxy for what s happening with the alcohol in your body this isn t a big issue until it s chronic like if you drink every day then you will become genuinely nutrient deprived

alcohol hits your stomach and your body starts breaking it down into party juice aka poison woot woot as soon as you start breaking it down the toxins begin to build up in your blood causing headaches etc until all the toxins which will mostly be acetylcholine for the majority of the digestive disruption are removed the digestive system will not run as efficiently less nutrients will be able to be absorbed and less waste will be able to be broken down until the toxin returns to a normal level then the organs would need to heal for a bit how long that depends but for about as long as they were being damaged is a great eli5 rule of thumb for body heal times when we are talking long term biological structures they are built to help process the chemicals your body builds actual structures and those structures can stay up for a while so if you went out partying once in a while we are looking at hours to be about back to relatively normal biological functions but this time can wildly vary depending on genetic make up of the individual exercise and eating habits as well as amount and length of time spent drinking
that s actually a great point thank you
your liver prioritizes the alcohol and doesn t really metabolize process macro and micronutrients that you ve recently ingested what happens to the macro nutrients
digestion nutrient absorbsion
our cells work based on dna that tells them how to make more cells gene fusion is when chunks of that dna that got merged together somehow genes have weird names one specific type of gene fusion called fgfr2 causes cells to make more cells way too much that s what cancer is
a fusion gene is essentially what you get when a piece of one gene ends up fused to another following some manner of translocation the textbook example is bcr abl which is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia the result is a tyrosine kinase with very strong proliferative signaling with its usual regulatory bits swapped to something that s always on reading through this paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7555921) about fgfr fusion it s actually very similar the common factor to the described type i and ii fusions is fgfr s tyrosine kinase domain being disconnected from its normal regulation good luck
not wrong but fgfr2 is just the basic gene that we all have as we would name it before any sort of fusion event
