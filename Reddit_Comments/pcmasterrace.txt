i have an alienware m15 r3 laptop i recently had to send it in to get the fans replaced and now the sound driver keeps stopping first it was uninstalling the driver then it seems like it was getting disabled i reset the computer completely and it s still doing it i was watching youtube this morning hit the right arrow key to skip and the sound stopped working on the whole computer updating the drivers doesn t work rolling back drivers doesn t work i have to restart the computer several times a day to get the sound back on it seems like something is running in the background after the computer starts that is messing with the sound driver but task manager doesn t show anything weird and i have installed nothing after the factory reset any suggestions sometimes it also comes with video slowing down

newbie question is building a pc with gb ram as simple as buying gb ram and plugging it into your pc in other words all those builds on the market that limit themselves to or up to a pretty hefty sum of money just decided was unneccesary not that it was anything special to reach furthermore if partpicker charts tells me the difference between and is like can i just pay up and enjoy the with no apparant downsides other than getting more memory than needed

my laptop charger is giving me problems is it just shot or is there anything else i can do besides buy another basically it s only charging for a short amount of time before it stops i unplug it then plug it back in and it runs for a few seconds before stopping again it seems to run for maybe minutes or so if i keep it unplugged longer i doubt it s any exterior damage like bent prongs because i ve been playing a game for a few hours just fine before this started any help is greatly appreciated
anybody got a good recommendation for a good work music productive prebuilt pc that can run intense excel sheets and music production programs would also be doing light gaming running dolphin emulator etc looking to prioritize gb ram and tb ssd i was looking at dell xps but keep reading the about the issues with cooling but i love how elegant and simple it looks don t really want an rbg colorful thing also looking at lenovo ideacentre 5i gaming but unfortunately only comes in 16gb ram configuration otherwise would ve bought it anyone recommend a good desktop pc similar
newbie question here i ve tried googling but can t quite seem to get the right answer i have 8gb of ram but i m having high memory usuage when gaming and its causing some performance issues i think when looking into it i found that my computer was using 3bg and had 4gb cached so my question is does this mean that 7gb is being used im unsure if i should upgrade my ram or clear the cache
is 3070ti and r bottleneck
should i put the front speakers in a surround set up above or below the rear speakers
how do i pick my graphics card i was looking at the recommended builds with the recommended radeon card it s labeled as a budget card what does this really mean and what sort of things can t this card do i m considering building a computer for poker more than gaming which i believe means that graphics is less important than active memory and proccessing power

i ve been kind of worried about something on my build not working even though i basically just took the high refresh build from the pcmr website and changed out a few things could anyone give it a look to see if there s anything wrong pcpartpicker link https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xvgfxy) i feel like my worries are a little unfounded but it s my first build and i m kind of anxious also a mildly more silly question these parts will all come with their standards cables right

should i update my bios before installing windows jayztwocents recommended it but most videos i ve seen people just jump straight to installing windows i will be on a brand new system gigabyte b650i ultra motherboard
so i have a windows pc that i mainly use for video editing in premiere pro streaming and gaming i have a ryzen 5600x cpu gb of 3600mhz ram and a 750w psu which is better running rtx 3050s or rx xt i already have purchased the gpus so i just want to know which is better the rtx 3050s have gb of vram each cause they are oc while the rx xt has gb is the extra gb of vram make the 3050s overall better than the rx xt or no
i m putting together my first pc i m using a wifi card that connects to the pcie x1 slot in my motherboard because my router is in another room and i can t run an ethernet cable however the wifi card is not being detected by windows it only shows the ethernet port which is not connected i have looked through my manual and my bios and have not found any option for enabling or even just reconfiguring the pcie slots my motherboard is a gigabyte ab350m gaming and the wifi card is an archer txe75e axe5400 i did notice the wifi card came with a cd for updating drivers but my case does not have a cd drive how can i get the wifi card to work
upon googling your laptop it has 10th and 9th gen intel cpus meaning it should be using ddr4 sodimm memory the notch being in a different location enforces this idea also double check that the laptop supports that much memory
anything large enough to fit the bios update file will do
for the most part yes most ram and especially what you want for a gaming system comes overclocked out of the box making sure it can reach those speeds requires you to enable a setting in the motherboard which can be done quite quickly however once you go past sticks some platforms start having trouble staying stable at those high speeds but if you go 2x16gb and stick within what your motherboardsupports it s guaranteed t be easy
if you really want the lenovo ideacentre than buy it the ram isn t rly a issue djuced for example only uses about 900mb of ram while playing on both decks and if you really want 32gb it is really easy to upgrade there are dozens of tutorials on yt but it would be great if you d post the link to the exact model of the lenovo this way i could give some recommendations for ram
the 3gb is what your os and programs are actively using unused ram is wasted just sitting there doing nothing though so when you don t need it windows uses it as a cache that way you don t always have to go back to your hard drive for important and or frequently used data my computer has 16gb of ram and i m currently using 5gb and have 10gb as cache as far as i know that s not a setting it just happens that caching doesn t stop you from using the ram when you really need it though so if you re running out of memory while gaming it doesn t have anything to do with the cache that doesn t even include it your best way forward is to upgrade your capacity unfortunately 8gb tends not to be enough nowadays in new games even 16gb sometimes isn t enough
is 3070ti and r bottleneck according to this website on 1080p yes ryzen 5600x and geforce rtx ti build in general tasks bottleneck calculation pc builds pc builds com https://pc-builds.com/bottleneck-calculator/result/10f19b/1/general-tasks/#:~:text=amd%20ryzen%205%205600x%20is%20too%20weak%20for,tasks.%20this%20configuration%20has%2018.4%25%20of%20processor%20bottleneck.)
entirely depends on what you re using the pc for if games it depends on the resolution games and what kind of frame rate you re aiming for for most games you d likely be fine aiming for 1080p 144hz or higher resolutions
picking a graphics card comes down to answering a few questions what kinds of games or tasks am i going to use it for folks here mostly deal with games but gpus are also used for some workstation tasks as well what resolution am i going to be running what is my desired frame rate the build list https://pcmasterrace.org/builds) provides what use case each build is recommended for in both the title and about section
you can get a good amd card second hand it s what i did a similar nvidia card would have cost almost 2x as much even though you play poker you probably need a decent pc and ram cpu if you are running some of the 3rd party apps and such but don t really need a beast gpu depending
no they have to stay on c if you are concerned about storage space uninstall any software or games that are on your c drive and install them on your d drive instead
i haven t seen any tests to confirm this but this is what my intuition tells me would be the best aio cooler mounted to the side for intake another fan or at the bottom for intake and all the exhaust fans you can fit at the top fresh air for your graphics card fresh air for your cpu unobstructed airflow and you can keep all your fans at a low rpm while having massive airflow
it s hard to say for sure every setup is different can your chip actually do 2000mhz fclk
your list looks fine depending on one thing if you re intending to use the windows disc to install it won t work since you don t have a disc drive if you re just buying it for the activation key it s fine if you have an 8gb or larger flash drive you can create your own install media using microsoft s tool here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). as for cables and such everything you need will come with either the individual part your power supply your motherboard or your case with those parts you re mainly going to be dealing with power cables going from the psu to the mobo and gpu and case cables going to the motherboard e g power button and fans
there really isn t one you can use pc part picker to put together your part list and choose to narrow down to one website to order from if you want but you ll typically end up paying more than if you bought parts from a few different places
depends what gpu you d be upgrading to a lot would ask for a stronger power supply you re also likely to see cpu bottlenecking with just a gpu upgrade as well upgrading that would require at least a mobo upgrade as well you could hang onto your current ram if you stick with a ddr4 platform though
windows defender common sense
it will depend with how recent of a bios version is installed b650 has gotten some significant improvements in terms of bios so you ll want to check which version it s running
more vram does not equal better performance sli is long dead so gaming would be pretty useless with gpus even back when sli was a thing vram doesn t add up with multiple gpus pair gpus with 8gb vram you ll still end up using 8gb of vram multiple gpus doesn t really do anything in video editing either you ll just left with one gpu working and another sitting idle on your motherboard on both scenario return those gpus and get the a 6700xt
it definitely supports 64gb wait i just noticed that it says mhz would it support ddr4 3200mhz
check
brilliant thank you i thought it might be an upgrade job check
for your future awareness bottleneck calculators are completely untrustworthy i strongly advise against using them for anything
yeah i mean for games it would i guess be nice to run the hottest game of two years from now on a whatever graphics setting on a whatever frame rate my computer just needs to be able to handle my poker which i think comes down more to ram and cpu power but i can honestly not be sure about anything yet does that mean i can probably be ok with a card like the recommended budget build
thanks but i wouldn t even know where to begin getting secondhand stuff in sweden nor do i have a clue what is comparable to what or even how to rank the power of graphics cards you re absolutely right though that for poker ram and cpu are most likely priority
i think so here s what i have it at currently https://i.gyazo.com/4b80d0d91d6edcb55f17596f56204089.png](https://i.gyazo.com/4b80d0d91d6edcb55f17596f56204089.png)
thanks i was planning on going with the flash drive but thanks for making sure also good to know about the cables it s one of those things i d never though to ask about before
ohhh okay cool thanks yea that makes sense i was looking for an easy upgrade but i think i need to just go with a new system
the ram would work fine but likely only run at so you can save some money and get a ram kit basically whatever is available to you at a good price and is rated or higher

on a whatever graphics setting on a whatever frame rate i mean that s not terribly specific i would probably at least get the gpu in the 60fps build as it is a significant step up from what s in the starter build for not a crazy amount more money
this is what mine looks like https://preview.redd.it/d9v3ef7zvesa1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cd0df5d7fd3e9eca8799c7b9b3cc4d3ad98d3cd on ryzen systems uncore refers to the infinity fabric on intel it s the ring bus notice that the infinity fabric s clock matches the dram clock this is ideal for performance on am4 my r5 s fabric maxes out at 1900mhz so i run it and the dram both at that frequency 1900mhz on the memory of course translates to 3800mbps effective speed because of ddr double data rate for ddr4 you would ideally have a fabric clock of 2000mhz that s not impossible it s just pretty rare to find a chip that can actually do it that s why i asked to make sure in your case yours is actually running at 1000mhz a ratio you could try setting your fclk to in the bios but chances are it won t work you re actually better off going with a slower speed as long as you can run it
yeah it s one of those things that s easy to assume will be in one of the boxes but you just don t know which one and then you get your case and find a little cardboard box taped inside of it with a bunch of screws and stuff lol
dang it i just ordered the new ones and they say mhz i didn t know a motherboard limits the speed of the ram
yeah usually the ram speed is affected by what the ram is rated for the cpu and the motherboard itself
ugh ok thanks dude you re the best
no problem boss
amd lighting a fire under intel is good for all of us we all win edit comments below kindly point out it s deeper than this
which cpu is this i am ootl with amd current gen
a battle between hardware companies is a battle we the consumers always win
can t wait for userbenchmark to say it s worse than an i3
there s more pixels in a picture from nokia s first phone with a camera in than this image
serious question hardware in computers keeps getting more and more powerful and games require higher and higher specifications to run but how much of that power across all components is actually put to efficient use and how much is just wasted on sloppy code and os usage the point of my question is are programmers being wasteful with hardware resources or are we actually getting linear improvements in game quality to match hardware improvements
saving this just to bring popcorn to the comments
the real question is do i upgrade from my 8700k now or wait for an even better cpu next year repeat this train of thought every year and effectively never upgrade
some people here are too young to remember when the roles were reversed and the only thing that kept amd floating was consoles and assholes like me who bought bulldozers just to show it s really not that bad it was
finally proper competition im so fucking happy that maybe only maybe we will se actual price drops and large generational improvements bc of it
the i5 13600k is still the mid range king nothing beats it at gaming and productivity at
now if amd can do the same in the gpu department we d be golden
i mean i m not a fanboy but i m seeing the 13900k win in about half the gaming benchmarks using gamers nexus who is the most reputable youtuber imo csgo the 13900k is beating it ffix the 13900k is beating it interesting in cyberpunk the 7950x3d outperforms the 7950x and the 13900k so clearly benefits from 3d cache but the 13900k beats the 7800x3d in total war warhammer the 13900k wins out of games the 13900k beats it in i m not saying it s not a great chip and if you were building a system today for just games i d definitely recommend the 7800x3d over anything else and if amd had released the 7800x3d at the same time it released the 7950x3d instead of trying to trick gamers into buying the 7950x3d i would have probably bought it instead of getting the 13900k
i run a 13700k and i have no intention of swapping to any of the current amd cpus that said if amd dropped a cpu tomorrow that doubled my i7 s performance for bucks i would celebrate people get heated over this back and forth but i just want the best system for the dollar if it works and the price is right i want it idc what brand it is my last cpu was a 10850k and i adored that system my partners system is a 5600g and she loves it i want big tech companies at eachothers throats beating each other bloody for my dollar
im really excited of that i always had warm place in my heart for amd cpus not gpus they sucked hard back then but in poland suggested price will be probably similar to 13700k which beats the point of buying 7800x3d yeah its as fast or even faster that 13700k in some games but in productivity area is leagues behind if the price will be lower then it of course will be a king
i don t get fanboyism for pc components when in use there is basically no difference only when building do you get to actually see any difference like just buy what s best for the price or suits your needs best these companies couldn t give less of a shit about you
hm an incredible fps higher on average at 4k vs a 7600x think i ll just go with that
the competition is good it keeps both companies reaching for the bleeding edge
man i got my first amd athlon xp in when pentium was still king yeah great times for me
i m grateful for memes like this that speak in layman s terms because i can t wrap my head around the naming convention of all these models i barely remember which xbox series is the newer one x or s what happened to good old single digit numbers
we need more competition to drive down nvidia gpu intel cpus prices because i m not getting anything else
ah capitalism i love it
we don t want intel to fall too far behind tho either that would be bad then amd would become the incumbent
seeing these comment about finally and remember my athlon xp
amd watching people actually buy intel and nvidia products
amd has been ryzen to new heights since
it is a nuanced gaming cpu that s what it s supposed to do launch was horrible so amd needed a win that being said amd s roll out of x3d was manipulative and indicative of why competition is important 7900x3d and 7950x3d are a waste of money compared to the 7800x3d
now they should do the same with gpus we would all love it if amd can put nvidia in their place
so how do i put this i prefer intel i wouldn t call myself a fanboy tho and i m heavily considering the ryzen 7800x3d for my first desktop pc
userbenchmarks had entered the chat xd
competition is great for consumers fanboys are newbs lol
gif giphy 13cptiww9bgzk6uvyr downsized getting comfy to witness the amd intel fanboy wars
not every game though gn had the 7800x3d as behind even the 7700x in cs go for example because that s a game that does not benefit from the additional catch like the 5800x3d it s really a chip you need to look at results for the particular titles you re into for
i think intel can pull a win
pcmr sub or hub comments section oh wait theyre the same thing
history repeating itself
intel has been around for a while don t underestimate their staying power or the ability to evolve ummm i mean haha intel
almost like the p4 a64 days all over again
something something user benchmark shitting on it for arbitrary reasons like clockwork who needs a7800x3d get an i3 then in the very next article this overpriced i9 with its slower than an amd and way more expensive is actually the best thing since sliced bread
anyone that worked at intel in the early 2010s with two brain cells to rub together could have predicted this we had nothing good in the pipeline for and beyond but raising that concern would have gotten you thrown into the intel gulag intel inside
if only it was the same thing in the gpu side
just need gpus to follow
only thing i hate about ryzen is their clip design for mounting a heatsink give me plain screws any day
i m not a huge computer guy so can anyone tell me what cpus this guy is talking about
no one needs to be a fanboy to enjoy some cold hard facts edit still bummed that intel retired their hedt platform
i wonder what userbenchmark says about the 7800x3d as it beats intel s highest performer in every game
i would consider moving away from my 9900x but the reason i got it and still cant really move is i actually use enough pcie lane that consumer ryzen isnt enough and threadripper is
i m glad that intel is actually making competitive cpus again
the 3d cache is really a smart move by amd and i m impressed that it is so effective in gaming i wonder why though i guess game code is pretty large and fits in those extra caches much better really looking forward to more improvements to that besides plainly raising the core frequencies
the only intel cpu i owned was an i5 2500k then i went to ryzen 2700x 3700x and now a 7900x my last gpu was a 2080ti and now i ve got a 7900xtx but honestly it doesn t matter which company you choose now a days when it comes to gaming all of them will destroy the games out now
i hope in the next few years amd does the same with their gpus competition will drive prices down for everyone
i remember loving amd because of the support they had in linux try looking for similar stuff from intel and they show you fancy proprietary drivers with no support
the cpu market is an example of when capitalism has good competition good for the consumer but the gpu market capitalism when a duopoly realises they can just raise and raise prices
i think it s pretty funny how even though all these posts always swear they don t pick sides they never contain relevant concrete stats other than price it s almost like all of these posts are just people coping about how they tried to save a couple bucks building a 1k device no one else feels the need to justify their decision
its a meme i know but surely people need to literate themselves a bit more shit ton of people buying 13900k for gaming only shows that not saying 13900k es bad or anything its aimed at a different market problem is the people not undestanding that 7800x3d is the best cpu today a high endgamer can buy and need but wont fill all market segments
i have intel on my gaming laptop but i love my amd epyc based esxi server cores with lower power usage
to me it s good but still not enough to swtich to an am5 board and ddr5 ram
this meme was rendered on the intel it s missing so many pixels
we really need the same competition to happen in the gpu market ironically intel could be our saving grace
i m out of the loop what is being referenced
what do you thing how will these perform after 5y
yeah but can it run tlou
i hate that i upgraded right as the new platform came out
absolutely we can expect some real performance gains over the next few years thanks to the competition intel are going to have to be less stingy with the cache finally we get to see what was promised with broadwell thanks to amd
7nm gigaspeed edition incoming
if only amd could do the same to nvidia
intel lazy and greedy thats why they allow this happens with cpu for example
now if they could do something with their gpus because they re getting murdered in that area we need some competition in the gpu space as well
it still baffles my mind how amd has managed to pull themselves out of the shitter in and onwards their old cpus were dogshit and their cards way too hot and loud i can remember being so excited about the radeon fury x with the hbm memory and shit i still got the card for me this card marks the new era of amd as we know them today
oh amd s back last computer i built from scratch was a k7 t bird intel knows this game though the computer before that was a celeron that i m sure they fired someone over
i m a fanboy now last three builds ive saved hundreds of dollars and gotten better performance whats not to like
they reap what they sew cooking up stock prices since and not focusing on their product and customer support not us but oems thinking they are king dick and laying off key players or not retaining them is how they got into this mess they fairchilded fairchild now they fairchilded themselves
you are not amd cpus are top right now if you tried to say that amd gpus are thw same thing as nvidia then you would be a fan boy
by all accounts intel should be able to beat amd in this silicon arms race they just aren t because their business strategy was to get complacent for over a decade amd is really giving them a hard kick in the pants to get back to doing what built their empire in the first place
what cpu is op referring to
intel cared more about exploiting it s customers than having the best product they thought they were going to be king forever
i want a hi fidelity pic of that clown
good for gaming for sure i just made a ddr5 13600kf build i don t regret at all as it s a very good value cpu for its performance but yeah would ve love to give amd a shot with this cpu obviously it s not perfect yet but i love where they re going edit typo
source cause i m alsothinkingofjumpingshipmeself
classic example of why monopolies should not exist
i just recently got a i9 13900k did i fuck up
personally and this is a regional issue i still get a much better deal from the intel cpus considering i can opt for a ddr4 motherboard specifically since both the cheapest ddr5 mobo and ram sticks start at double the price of an above average ddr4 combo this adds up to a very big price difference in builds for a performance difference that is almost negligible with electricity costs here still it s good that amd is coming out on top if you re willing to futureproof as much as you want
can someone help a guy out what did i miss haven t paid attention to cpus since the 9700k
hard not to fanboy amd at this point if not for them my pc would have been so much more expensive even the series had price drops the rx xt is much cheaper than a and performs as good or slightly better in a lot of cases
as long as intel holds on to the integrated graphics market i don t see them creating stronger cpus than amd because they just don t have to just think about how many government or school prebuilt you ve seen over the years i don t think i ve ever seen a prebuilt widely used amd cpu before
deleted
shame amd can t do the same to nvidia its still a win they re doing it to intel though these are things that are a win for all gamers
i hope intel has some interesting design philosophy changes coming cause the status quo not going to work forever
it s a great cpu design they should be exceptionally proud rigorous competition is desperately needed to keep pushing performance upwards
intel is the iphone of cpus
of all you do is game then the x3d chips have been great but the intel chip still absolutely shreds the 7800x3d in none gaming work load at which point your spending the same as the intel and are now right around the same power load to get that performance back even the i5 13600k can beat out the new 7800x3d in workstation and production loads
intel sweating firing their entire architecture team when they were on top
what am i not getting here is this about 7800x3d i m a little behind but i bought this 13700k a couple months ago as far as i could tell from a quick look around it seems that amd is just more efficient now i don t really see a huge advantage in one or the other though something i m missing
was a lower resolution clown not available
brings me back to my nostalgic athlon days amd was beating the pants off of intel and intel could only answer with more watts and more ghz which only went so far it took them into the core duo to actually start swinging back what s interesting in today s battle is that there is more than just raw silicon design or process mode that makes for a win splitting into multiple dies 3d stacked dies new packaging technology lets designers be more flexible and gives higher yields on the manufacturing side just waiting for the gpu cartel to stop ripping us all off performance per dollar has stalled since
competition breeds progression fantastic steps forward love to see it
idk userbenchmark told me amd cpu bad and intel good and that all that matters is cpu clockspeed and efficiency cores
the only problem is it isn t a better general purpose pc cpu it s a better xbox cpu
in 1080p gotta add that who the hell buys a cpu if you game in 1080p

pretty sure raster is getting a little bit of unfair rep here but path tracing is too early to ever be implemented we can t even get reasonable ray tracing on affordable gpus gens in and year old mid range parts are starting to suffer from newer games
does the raster look extra shitty on purpose seriously rasterization doesn t have lighting or reflections now since when
i think rt and path tracing is really cool i think a good dev could make a very beautiful not just ultra realistic environment with the tech but unfortunately for us me in the present the maturity of rt pt is so far behind our little and big tricks used to make rasterized imagery look good so i shall wait a few gpu generations before upgrading from my rx xt which can do some ray tracing to its credit
this picture is shit and doesn t show the full difference between path tracing and traditional rast ray tracing
i ll take raster please
too shiny for me verging on looking wet for no reason at all ray tracing provides the best imo
gimme dat ptx5090
future tech good later
source was nvidia forgot to mention sorry
this is a terrible comparison all of these could look equivalent here with tweaked lighting i am a game developer
it s used for movie vfx and pre render game cinematics ray tracing s bigger brother and more technically intensive i personally haven t tried the implementations for quake and portal it s very niche right now imo we re closer to cinematics quality games in real time but also feels far off from being mainstream playable by most people at reasonable fps
it ll get caught in the cycle ray tracing is on right now most games are so unoptimized for it that the highest end cards put out mediocre fps which leads to consumers mostly not even considering it as an option which just leads to more games not caring about optimizing it since it s time money invested into something that most of your audience won t ever use repeat ad nauseum
another way to price their gpus even more expensive than now
if tech companies try and push path tracing really hard in a few years we might get graphics accelerator capable of rendering ray traced scene with almost no performance hit
what are the next gen nvidia gpus gonna be called ptx
this is a poor example as everyone now assumes path tracing is meant to make everything look reflective when it s the textures used that make it look this way path tracing is basically the closest replica you can have in gaming to real life lighting the object in this image is this shiney because of the texture applied not because path tracing makes everything glossy
nope i like frames per second not seconds per frame
great another cool graphic setting i m gonna make sure is disabled
i wish they d focus on a good story and gameplay rather than this crap
ray tracing is nice but devs need to stop making everything in the game a literal mirror when it s turned on
looks like raytracing with multiple bounces and global illumination added it ll be more computationally heavy but it s the kind of stuff that s been done in non real time cgi for going on two decades now it s inevitable that we ll see it in games
it s the future by future i mean at minimum years from now to have 60fps pathtraced 4k capable hardware without the aid of ai
i memed about this being too reflective https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/zgb66w/2025_portal_rtx_uses_real_tracing_thats_why_your/
games are not even optimized for neither tracing if its something as simple as a mod that works in all games even old ones now that would be interesting to a degree but its far from being mainstream or the default so give it more years
it s awesome tech but at the moment it s rarely practical i think rasterization and texture quality s need to catch up in games as well but graphics are only a small part of a great game
minecraft shaders next level up
if you think ray tracing is brutal on performance path tracing is so much worse lmao especially with complex scenes
you see we are looking at a picture for comparison because that s the literal framerate with it turned on
at the moment the most noticeable effect of ray tracing is the major reduction in frames per second
as a 3d artist path tracing as used in programs like maya s v ray blender s cycles or adobe s i ray are all extremely useful and very good for giving accurate lighting to a render practically though they can take hours to render even single frames with a decent amount of samples and at a decent resolution i highly doubt it will be practical for use in video games for at least the next years
gonna wait for the rtx ti before i ll think path tracing will be viable in most titles that said the current top end hardware can absolutely do rt if it s been implemented well metro exodus control comes to mind
if it s as bad a rt it really doesn t matter they need to figure out how to not have it impact performance basically they need to figure out how to make shadows not take up so much gpu then work on reflections
idgaf about any of them if they cause a low fps mfs on here be like yeah ill take a fps drop so i can see neon lights in a puddle
rasterization is good enough why should i invest more money and use most likely more power for diminishing returns
15fps fps 200fps
am i the only one who thinks rasterized looks the best
do these people think making shit ultra reflective and shiny is more realistic it looks fake
it will free up so much time for developers once it became the norm and once games are build with it in mind from the ground up and lot of smaller games will look insanely better instantly in a decade
too much for my mb graphics card to handle
it s neat and i ll fully embrace it when the performance hit is negligible i love high frame rates so yeah i do hope devs will calm down with the shiny surfaces though i know they want to show off the tech but use some restraint and make it look more natural not everything needs to be polished chrome
shiny
hehe my super fans go brrrrrr
annnnd predictably this thread has devolved into the so called master race of gamers spewing ignorant bullshit with near to no actual functional knowledge on rt pt or anything in between incredible truly
proof that most of pcmasterrace members never leave their dark rooms when videogames treat light rays in the way it works in real life they feel it s overly shiny and too bright seriously honestly it s not for the sake of humor anymore please touch some grass
ray tracing is path traced there s a whole bunch of nonsense going around how they re supposedly different but whenever you look into it the actual difference is just the specific implementation
better example for everyone https://preview.redd.it/7fp2lhg3hcsa1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25c56d615a26bb58f836f25280f145390f9710c1 source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndewvys0_k)
fps on 4k native with a but shiny this is the current state of path tracing it ll be several generations before it runs well on affordable hardware
games need to be designed differently knowing every light source and shadow with cast shadow and some reflection one day it will be used as we use ssr now
great tech but let s not pretend that it s the only area of pc visuals where improvement is possible character animations have improved but still there is room for improvement facial expressions are still robotic there is also improvements to be made in world physics which have regressed over the past decade there is also room for improvement with more geometric detail volumetric clouds smoke etc there is still so much to do
why do we want everything so goddamn shiny and reflective
pictures like this need a real world example for a better comparision
good bye frames
way too shiny looks like a joke
this is the difference between satin semigloss and high gloss paint
gif giphy kzoey2jylghac

as a 3d artist myself i will never understand this trend to make everything look wet af because you gotta show of this pbr raytraced tech i mean it s not because you can that you should put it everywhere plus player spectator will better appreciate something that is well placed than something that is everywhere inb4 its a tech demo i know but you can t tell me thats not the trend in most aaa games it just made me think about this
i mean it doesn t make a game more fun to play probably best for rendering and cgi in movies
more lights better graphics yippee ki yay mother russia we solved graphics evolution
so people really going out and spending more on nvidia because it uses a technology that barely works and will soon be obsolete
new nvidia ptx card coming for will be able to handle any path tracing title up to 1440p30 fps
damn path traced looks good what games can i find it in
gotta get my ptx ti
too shiny too busy too glossy
too much
i d rather use rasterization get the higher fps and pretend we are smart enough to use a non reflective coating on battle armor
too much shine
path doesn t look natural it s annoying
am i the only one who suspects that normal reflections before rtx was introduced looked better than they do now it feels like they tone it down to make their rtx work stand out more
the difference between nvidia far left and amd far right literally one is made for rt the other is made for raster you decide i know every single remastered title i ve seen focuses on rt implementation
i prefer going back to before ray tracing honestly things just looked cooler
i think my water cooled overclocked is like starting all over with a
oh cool a ptx for the price of a car can t wait
this probably isn t the best example of it it looks way too shiney
it s too unrealistic no armor in this world is this shiny
god damn someone turn the roughness up on the white armor
rasterization is intentionally being downplayed in this example either the scene has super flat lighting outside of self illuminated sources that are only affecting things in the traced versions or the rasterization model straight up forgot it s roughness map think about the new halo game and whether or not it ever looks like the right image without raytracing the answer is it doesn t
too shiny
it s the next step and incredibly immersive
introducing our ptx starting at
it s absolutely the future but even on my it s incredibly expensive won t be the norm yet especially with ue5 doing it s own form of rt in software with lumen and the relatively low power of current consoles
another useless feature that hard taxes your gpu so nvidia can bring the fps by drumroll dlss and they make newer versions of both features only available on new iteration of their cards just so they can justify the capital cost true bane of pcmr really
lol it s the brown and bloom of this generation
it s pretty but the most complex shaders i ve ever used are the rtx lookalike shaders for minecraft java edition because my laptop isn t powerful enough according to nvidia
i am not impressed with rt in current games so far so no real opinion
seems like potentially another gimmick to get people to overspend on gpus for games that they won t play and or will run atrociously with the technology implemented
i love it and think it s another step on the way to photorealism but i think realistically we re a probably a decade away from it becoming standard it s just amplified crysis a glimpse into the future long before the hardware is there to realise it
honestly things are good enough in my opinion i d be happier if they d stop trying so damned hard to push the boundaries of new graphics and reinvest some of that time money and manpower into making the games stable optimized and i dunno decent
i prefer ray traced path has to much going on
looks neat
by the next console generation or two it ll stop being special and just be a normal feature
raster is getting a bit of an overly fair rep here raster is dogshit and ancient technology raytracing is a bit of an odd duck but it s still in its infancy path tracing is super realistic
at least we see these frames you render per second in the outmost beauty
real life isn t this shiny and polished can we just stop please and work on texture details and reducing pop in and other obvious resource saving shortcuts
imho as a owner raytracing is cool pathtracing even more so but none of them are necessary for me to enjoy a game i wouldnt even care if both disappear soon x200b i just think the age of most beautiful graphics is over we are at a decent level already now lets use all the computing power that we have to expand on gameplay and mechanics instead of making that stop sign over there even more shiny
man i just want a nice optimized game with decent graphics i don t care about any of this ray enhancing 16k ultra super duper realistic fps in a dense population billion polygons per centimer graphics
3d artist here the reason why it looks more shiny is not because path tracing creates more fake lighting or inherently makes things shinier it s just that more of the already existing light sources are now able to be represented in your scene the reason why the dummy character is so shiny is because the material has a roughness value close to that was done on purpose to showcase reflections in raytracing does it look good hell no but that s not what it s about it s about showcasing a technology it s now up to 3d material and lighting artists to use this technology properly to make things look good or real
so shiny
path tracing is ray tracing just a different way of doing it it s already useable in minecraft using shaders like seuss ptgi and it is quite performant the downside however is it is just tracing the path of the light meaning you don t get details this is why it looks so significantly different here traditional rt is better because it is more accurate
time to turn on dlss
i never actually thought an fps over really mattered until i reinstalled fallout after switching from a 1080p medium settings laptop to a desktop that can play most things through at 1440p on max settings at fps now i m afraid to upgrade any further because if i get used to fps i feel like my eyes will probably melt out of my head if i ever have to fall back to anything less
i got myself a ti recently and have since realized that when the fps drops below i can instantly feel the stutter even while playing games like rdr2 i ve since been tweaking settings i don t like dlss in most games it feels blurry in game so that games run 100fps frame generation is awesome though i run at 165hz and 60fps is not the new standard anymore may be 90fps is once you see it you can t really unsee it
you guys are getting fps
man i m still playing with a i d be happy with 30fps
i ve always wanted to see someone actually use one of those i remember them in hs chem
wait you guys play at fps
i just like how that word niktek has an actual meaning in our accent
i wont forget where i came from
the change from fps is far better than the change from 160fps even though the latter has a lower percentage change
try playing ultimate admiral dreadnought no matter what u have u wont ever get above 20fps in a large fight ill put my life savings on it
lmfao
so i ll just lean over this thing and you guys will add the water special effects later
of course it dropped to fps he s spraying water in his eyes like a noob and not using thermal paste does this guy even pc
no what s painful is when i start up a game that usually runs fps just for me to learn my graphics drivers bugged again and it s getting between and fps then i either have to restart my pc or failing that reinstall my drivers
the human eye can only see 24fps
meanwhile games that play at 30fps don t really bother me too much and 60fps is great
is best for me
test
anything under 90fps tor me
me who plays on 30fps gif giphy e4wygvxuz0wnpps5iy downsized
meamwhile me a game dev is overjoyed when i can coax fps out of any of my wretched creations
ahh jokes on you my pc doesnt go above 59fps gif giphy zt1q7lreccti4n9ohb
i like the version of andy from the office screaming uncontrollably for this mene
what fps do you get playing arma
like a god amongst mortals especially if you play msfs
serious question should dlss put on auto or balanced or it depends
fr bro i remember when i made that switch to fps 1440p and now everytime i see anything under that it hurts my eyes and there is an adjustment period
i m away from home for an extended period of time and had to leave my pc which averages fps at high ultra i took an xbox with me for something to do and i m horrified with 60fps horrible
i just went to an oled ultra wide and because of the near instant response 60fps now looks like a stuttering mess
is where i start to care now anything lower looks stuttery my display maxes out at but as long as i m seeing i m good is hard to look at at this point thank bb jeezis for dlss and framegen
the jump from to is huge but the higher you go from there the smaller the noticeable benefits are
70fps is still very smooth standard fps on film that you see on cinema or movies are in 25fps there s no stutter for 25fps let alone 70fps at least it shouldn t be
i m getting seconds per frame
povogang
voodoo sli
or just boot up last of us part
the human eye can only see 16gb ram
the human eye also can see gpm
it s all about what you re used to i have a hz monitor and game near that quite a bit but i also play project cartographer which is a community maintained version of halo vista and the mode that i like to play runs at fps and it feels fine since i m used to it now
i had a for years and i just upgraded to a and i don t think i ll ever play anything at or even fps ever again
quality setting is the most consistent looking but auto or performance is good if you want higher fps if you re at native 1080p i would go quality or not even use it
dlss quality should be fine in most of scenario better image and performance than native other options depends upon your screen size
i ve always used quality and it s been a sweet spot for 1440p
sounds like a competitive gamer
oled gang i can t even game on a normal monitor anymore the dark colors on an oled screen are too good probably the best purchase i have done so far in is my oled screen
motion blur on films makes it look smoother though it s difficult for rasterisers to reproduce it accurately
and 32gb ssd
i ve been gaming since the early 90s to be specific so i ve experienced the whole gamut of framerates over the years that might be why i m not too particular
nah lol i m not that good i just enjoy playing with friends every now and then but i just really appreciate and love tech kinda like a kid on christmas
hardest part is forgetting to flip the switch on the power supply on or not seating the power cable deep enough gives me a heart attack every time
it hasn t always been easy though building a pc in was full of lots of pitfalls
building a pc has not always been this easy pcpartpicker and the like make it far easier to make sure you re buying compatible parts when i was parting out my first build at it was a whole bunch of double checking part compatibility on newegg and whatnot pata was giving off death throes but still existed in many machines manuals weren t nearly as good cases didn t have nearly the creature comforts they do today although i splurged and got an antec p180b which was years ahead of its time it s accurate to say that it has gotten much easier in the past few years thanks to tools like pcpartpicker and techtubers but it hasn t always been this easy
op never connected an a drive with non keyed cables nor had multiple pata drives with jumpers
this applies to almost anything it just feels so good to do something with your own hands and succeeding and i don t mean that you perverts
the s to s called they would like a word about that claim but yeah the last two decades it has been easy
building a pc back in the day was definitely more annoying mostly due to software bullshit it s not even close now
not in 1940s
installing the mobo and cpu cooler kind of annoying though
always easy i remember switching jumpers on the mobo to make sure it fits for the right cpu or you know old hdds with the master slave jumpers or format a hdd with a floppy disk computers before internet werr much more harder to set up
gif giphy 9zoe1sfibd8ppqz5cr the front io cables
yeah picking the parts is kind of easy i still don t know what s aproppriate but i have a ti blower with a ryzen 3600x a who cares what mobo idongibbafuk case ssd and 750psu with a shitton of fans blowing the right way because blower gpus run a bit hotter than the normal kind i mean not the hardest thing in the world until i tried to assemble it picking a budget case turned out to be a problem because it was really hard to work on it hat shit quality and screws made out of chinesium also since i am a noob i had to assemble and disassemble it like times and when i finnaly did it did not start pretty typical story afaik to this day i don t know where did i mess it up welp better luck next time years or so later
cries in late s early s there was nothing easy about figuring which din settings you needed to get your parts working on the mobo
someone has never had to configure jumpers and configure the os to look for where a component is located and it shows
its not as easy as everyone claims it to be im trying of people pretending it is
i had literally zero pc building experience when i decided just to dive right in weeks of research learning about components was about the only hard part i was surprised how plug and play everything was once it came to the actual build
yeah i was intimidated by it for years until i realised oh it s basically lego
the wording is ambiguous is building a pc easy or not according to this image
people who complain about the difficulty of assembling a computer i think you re stupid
ohio
saying building a pc is easy is like saying driving a car is easy which it certainly is true nowadays given automatic transmissions forgetting the fact manual transmissions were once the standard and required a degree of skill and finesse to operate
building my first pc took me minutes it s super easy
the gun should be driver updates
please please please read your motherboard booklet and quit saying that power button q panel stuff is hard
the cables are the hard part wish there was an easier way to plug it all together
i don t get the sense of accomplishment over putting the pieces together i get the sense of accomplishment from spending 3k and the thing doesn t explode when i turn it on
never have been
getting the money is the hard part i only have kidney
yet here i am filling mine with water and having to test if it leaks before being able to use it
it s disassembling that s hard i have created a rival against the eps connector and lost a chunk of my finger to a side panel
it s easy if it s just plugging in the components it takes more to know what can go where and what to do when it doesn t start up and it s time to find out why
i put my computer together drunk as fuck and it booted up just fine to be fair i had to go back the next day and cable manage a bit but if you can read you can build a pc
allways eeeh
everything except the fucking front panel io connectors
me and my brother describe it as adult legos there s only so many places the components can go feels good to build em too
it used to be much harder but even then it was still pretty easy
ram compatibility requires luck
it s all very easy until you have an issue making sure everything is installed correctly that should be no more than minutes to run through debugging a single piece of defective hardware in a new build debugging conflicting drivers that only bug out every few days that s the stuff that keeps me up late
what do you mean easy i almost cried figuring out my aio and how things went into the motherboard
complexity today is still vastly determined by the parts you build some cases make building a breeze some like my corsair 5000d airflow were a total nightmare
bad grammar
in the words of my high school computer science teacher they make them simple enough for children in thailand to assemble
kids these days don t know the joys of irq conflicts
until you have to update the bios of the brand new mobo to make it compatible with your cpu never doing that again
it took me hours after realizing that i shouldn t have remove the bolts of the case that elevates the motherboard trying to figure out the angle of the cpu cooler and lastly realizing that i had to install the most recent bios for the cpu to be compatible good thing that the motherboard has a boot in button tho oh and realizing that the outlet was not turned on the entire time as well needed help for to sort the cable management notes of those reaching to this comment do not just go with the manual that is on the boxes check online for the model s manual for more information on how and where to install the cable ram ssd and how to troubleshoot it
it used to be harder irqs and setting master slave on a drive was fun
except when you first get into pc gaming and buy an alienware and try to upgrade it dark times
until you missed out on the back i o shield
it s been a long time so please forgive my memory weren t there jumpers on the back of ide hard drives to tell them to be a primary or master drive when plugged into the same cable the last pc i built was a pentium so watching techtubers these days i always say that s it when they finish the assembly process but in a good way stuff looks so much cleaner these days
i was building my own pcs back before the turn of the century between greater standardization greater availability of parts greater variety of parts instantaneous internet advice and faster and more user friendly os setup building a pc is by and far way the christ easier now than it was in the past
i thought i did something wrong when i first built my pc because it just worked everyone says the first build never works on reddit
it s like legos but cheaper
man s didn t accidentally buy an agp card or an ide drive or the wrong ide cable
test
it in fact has not always been this easy plus years ago motherboard jumpers could give you some headache
is that fucking pangea
im going to do this first time using a small case am i going to be fine
this happened to me when i rewired my machine the mobo power connector had come off the psu and i thought i had killed it
or forgetting to remove the plastic protector from the cpu cooler lol
speak for yourself hardest part is those freaking front panel connectors like seriously why isn t just one connection it s
once you connect cpu ram ssd fans and psu to the mobo i always just plug it in and make sure the fans start spinning and the mobo lights up before i bother with the cooler or gpu or wire management and whatnot makes life easier
not me doing the later times in a year with the same pc
i almost shit myself when i built my last pc when it didn t post turns out the ram wasn t in all the way because asus boards don t have the retention clip on both sides
nope the hardest part is remembering to install the i o shield i m so glad new motherboards have them built in lmao
it still blows my mind to this day that you can use the mouse in the bios during installing the os and i started building in
especially if you wanted to add things like water cooling or lighting to your cases remember the fluro trend
i remember plug and pray quite well
the hardest part was troubleshooting why it wouldn t boot the first time you fired it up
people always forget how bad it was to get drivers installed too now windows has many built in but before you had to install in a certain order otherwise it all stopped working
but who blindly trusts the compatability checker though
i didn t think it was that hard before pc part picker there are like things you need to know
not really pcpartpicker won t show you if the aio will fit in this case or another similar component
the good ol days honestly don t miss needing a floppy drive installed just to setup raid
noobs back in the day we had to deal with irq and dma jumpers oh yes and chs hard drives were fun
i just clean my pc yesterday and put an old hdd not that old on pc the sata cable doesn t fully stick on the hdd make my pc stuck on bios intro lucky that that bug is well known so it easy search take a lot of time to make it stick into the hdd though
for me the biggest problem of the past was fitting everything properly in the case and cable management the inside of my pc in looked like a dumpster full of random components it s crazy how far we have come to have a clean build right out of the box
install the cpu cooler with the motherboard out of the case i suggest doing it with the mobo on it s own box it s perfectly sized for the mobo then you can hold on to the cpu cooler to help gently install the motherboard this makes it much easier than doing it in the case
back in my college days mid s spent a whole day helping my roomate get his sound card and modem to work at the same time that was the first computer i ever worked on with plug and play bios looking back i honestly don t remember if we ever got it to work
in my experience the main difficulty is getting parts that properly work together the actual building is pretty easy and installing os and making all the drivers work can be difficult
it s as hard as building a set of lego duplos getting it to work as well as it should is a different matter
it s also not nearly as hard as someone who doesn t know about computers perceives it to be other than knowing which cables go where and purchasing equipment that s compatible and won t cause bottlenecks both of which can easily be figured out with google what about building a pc is hard
it s so easy just study weeks
yeah i feel like if the wording on the first part was wait pc building is actually easy or something like that makes the meme flow better always has been is a weird response to the way it was worded in this meme
manual transmissions were once the standard of the cars in eu are manuals same as vast majority of the world required a degree of skill and finesse to operate nope just like riding a bicycle
happened to me when changing my cpu cooler accidentally pressed the switch but i had enough experience to not freak out of the time it s a small problem
i definitely did that some how that 5800x still didn t get above in game and stayed under in stress test after fixing it it stayed around in game and i didn t bother stressing it since even with plastic it was fine lol
oh other people have done this too
use the mouse in the bios during installing the os you don t install the os in the bios also you re thinking of uefi not bios anyway lol
yep normally cos we got the jumper settings wrong for the installed cpu
and they all came on cd completely outdated
i did i didn t realize there were issues with it just built my first late last year and relied entirely on pcpartpicker compatibility
probably people that don t know anything about computers
i did because it was a learning process pc part picker gave me a wrong estimated wattage and i learned the hard way but it s still a fantastic starting point for those who want to learm
blindly sure maybe not but pcpartpicker will automatically prune back listings based on general compatibility and that s pretty darn reliable it might make some mistakes here and there but it s got the this cpu fits in this motherboard and needs this ram and you ll need your own cpu cooler down pat which used to be a case of set your search filters correctly yourself bucko
finally my akchually moment ppp does check if it will fit it won t show you parts that won t fit for example my graphics card and also aio wouldn t show up with my old case had to take the case off add the parts then add the case that would fit said parts
yea i fried a floppy drive because i put the power connector degrees rotated that sucked i don t miss unkeyed connectors
yeah back then pcs were built like a tank and had millions of tiny screws for everything plus those ribbon cables were a royal bitch to route
for me its reverse drivers and os is easiest but when it comes to parts im lost like a child
having to figure out how the hell to copy a dual booted ssd my dad set up for me to a bigger one without breaking it while not fully understanding how the disk partitioning works also linux is funky that s just my unique problem tho
yeah i agree it s a good idea op should reupload with improved wording
it s just so easy to do this over a towel or bed or even just your hand
ah yes tiles again
tile floors always win when they go against tempered glass cases
how do you know of this subreddit and still achieve this
at this point tempered glass panels should come with a big red sticker warning not to open the pc when it is standing on a hard floor
tile is quite a bit harder than glass vs on the mohs scale the edge of glass panels are particularly susceptible to failure you d have better luck dropping the panel on hardwood glass etc vs grazing it on the average non polished tile
did your keyboard fall out of empathy for the tower
should have used the carpet
at this point you guys must be doing this on purpose
how does this happen seen so many tile floor shattering case panel posts just curious do people just drop the panel on the floor
it seems you ve learned absolutely nothing from reddit there are so many posts recently regarding tiled floor and tempered glass shattering guess you wanted to end up on reddit after all
another broken pc in the bathroom pic wtf are you guys doing with your pcs
bruh time
over posts about broken glass side panels hmm i wonder what happen if i put my pc here
why do people keep putting tempered glass cases on tiled floors
why the fuck do people still build pc s on hard platform build it on aything that is soft i always build on bed so nothing breaks and carry it to the desk more carefully than i carry my child i donr have a child
y all never learn to not taking off the glass cover on tiles will you
you know you only end up on reddit if you put yourself there right
after seeing all these posts years ago it made me decide to get one with a plastic window i feel i made a good choice it s definitely not as pretty but you can still see through it
imagine smashing your build for internet points
at this point the mods should just block the blatant karma farming not only is it the daily ceramic tile vs side panel post but you ve got a destroyed mouse barely out of its box and the keyboard s missing some key caps while the cable twist tie hasn t even been taken off these are clearly brand new but plastic doesn t shatter on tile unless you used force someone clearly wanted to pay for some karma the hard way so they slammed a new pc and peripherals on the floor to make a picture
i m scared to ask this kind of floors k d ratio
you put yourself on reddit if this ever happened to me i d be sure y all wouldn t ever know you also are over tile shocking dumbass
it s literally the easiest thing in the universe to not break your side panel glass
stop buying these dumb fucking cases

everything was leftover parts and i thought i can make a pc with them for the long night shifts after finishing everything this happened lmao
so many posts of this type lately that i start to believe you brake your windows for karma harvesting in reddit
free temps upgrade
tile floor
ahh the age old enemy to tempered glass tile floors truly the most one sided rivalry of all time
you are missing a keycap
why do you mfs keep putting your tempered glass over tile
you even rolled back the rug that would have prevented this from happening it boggles my mind
can someone explained what happened
always tiles lol
tiled floor strikes again
obligatory ceramic tile comment
i m just never buying anything with glass
man that just sucks sending some sympathy your way dude thankfully it s just a case and your components are ok least you have some comfort and support with your yeezys wyyg would be proud
this is like r wallstreetbets level of stupid op seeing people do dumb shit only to just go ahead and do it yourself
why on tile it s always on tile
at this point you have to be stupid to buy a case with tempered glass acrylic forever
one day i can only hope that people will understand the physics of glass and hard surfaces
gets new case breaks old one for reddit clicks
i am moving house this week and this almost seems inevitable
proof some people are unable of learning from others mistakes
have you tried turning it off and on again
at least you didn t end up in the newspaper
blame this on the tornado that passed
one word plexiglass
always tiles when will we learn
i love the looks of tempered glass but i got kids so plastic it is i wouldn t recommend anyone tempered glas sides because i i have seen this to many times
so you are familiar is this sub but you still put your tempered glass panel on tile
when will people learn that tile and tempered glass don t mix
i broke my front panel a while back as well i don t have the money to replace it so i wrapped some see through plastic with tap to make my new panel i tried saran wrap but it would sink in and out like it was breathing and the sound was rough
nice mouse i can t find a shroud edition anywhere in my country
you re wearing yeezy s so i m assuming you ll get over this financially
i think the more i see this the more it assures me that common sense is actually just gone from humanity now
they never learn
and you still put it on tiles
i always use my bed for my rig for this same fear the tempered glass panel on the nzxt h7 is massive and i fear for it i treat it like a dang newborn
i just bought a new case and i made a point to not buy a glass one it s breakable it s heavy and i see no significant advantage over acrylic
what s wrong pc not posting
kiss your tiles because apparently you love to work on them so much
actually it s not on the tile floor so i don t end up on reddit
mattress on the right carpet on the left and you picked the tile
not sure why you re getting so much flak for this shit happens mate it ll be alright
those yeezys are even more busted god damn boy you have straight up biscuits on your feet
ngl these cases seem super fragile my first case had it s glass shattered as i pulled the sticker off it
congratulations you now own an open air testbench
still don t understand how it s possible
laughs in mesh side panels
i still have my coolermaster haf guessing years old about now and i dont see a reason to use glass side panels if i buy another case it s just too risky imo like someone else might be handling my pc and i would neeed to hope they dont fuck up i also dont like looking inside my case all the time im actually one of those who keep their pc on the floor next to the table where the sun dont shine instead of it sitting on the table where i feel the light air cooling and noise would be closer to my face if i could put the case in a seperate room i would but i m a lazy lazy man
you kids need to learn the value of practicality metal is king got a shitty case for bucks a decade ago and it still works great
ceramic tiles and tempered glass don t go together that s why you can shatter a car window by throwing tiny pieces of ceramic at it instead of rolling that rug away you should have used your brain and set your pc on that rather than putting it on the tiles
i haven t used towel with mine and i still have two intact glass panels i guess having hardwood floors helps a lot
ayyy same case
tile floor check
who will win years of engineering advancements vs t i l e s
so was it a woman or other kind of misfortune
did you roll up the rug that was already there
that dude s unmedicated gf is on a rampage today tf

glass panel trend needs to permanently end all pc cases regardless of which size should all be fine mesh mesh that is so fine that you can almost see through it never thought about getting another pc case with glass panels ever again after going from my nzxt s340 build to my cm nr200 build
no glass panels in my next build noted
sheesh is that i icue 220t got the same one if it is and i was terrified of dropping that glass
master race they said
yeezys more busted than your pc
serious question how in the hell are you folks break this glass like how clumsy are you folks i have two towers with glass and neither of them have shattered
you put yourself here because you wanted attention don t blame reddit
and that s why i went with a windowless case
stop putting pcs on tiled floors why the fuck do you idiots keep doing this
aka let s stage this so i end up on reddit
why don t they make these plastic
mission failed get slap from reality
tragic e waste
take them dusty ass yeezys off lmaoo bro stuck in
i really don t see the appeal of tempered glass cases
why do you need tempered glass anyways it s dumb
meanwhile i m here with a carpet and bed gif giphy u3hnzvvfisae0
oh hey i m the top right guy i have now replaced the glass with plexiglass which can endure all the ceramic tiles you want
panels shattered with a million more well on the way
ground type should be super effective against ice type is all i take from this meme
they all lost their temper when you put them on ceramic
i clean my desk once in a while and its top layer is a sheet of glass whenever i take the glass out it goes directly to the bed adjacent to it even after seven years later that glass is still in one piece i m a bit paranoid if i have it standing on the floor it could slip and break with that said if you re going to take out that panel put it on a bed or sofa

acrylic window master race cries in scratches
break my glass into pieces this is my sub red dit
laughs in plexiglass
hugs solid metal side panels
this will keep happening until people learn to not tile those floors
they will continue to shatter until the upvotes stop flowing
any diy fix possible i don t know maybe trying gluing the millions of shards together
and to think at one point i bought a tile of ceramic just to put my pc on so it wasn t on carpet i had no idea ceramic was its weakness
so basically never put your pc tower on a floor with tiles or the tempered glass will break
and that s why you always put in on your bed
clumsy or lack of shits given i guess type of person fragile object hard surface accidents happen but with the volume these get posted shrug kinda sad i feel
https://youtu.be/ctwqa3qcwmw?t=142](https://youtu.be/ctwqa3qcwmw?t=142)
i still don t get how people have shattered glass side panels i ve basically sat on mine dropped them maybe fallen off my bed every now and then soldered on top of my old one used it to squared the corners on a 3d printer i built and even places heavy hot pots on top of it to eat to not ruin my desk mat and that thing is still alive
getting harder to find decent pc cases with metal panels instead of glass windows i m still using my old corsair 900d case because of this i had to actually buy two of them to get one with metal metal panels while a buddy got the window window panels not shattering is just one advantage metal has in this application i like to build pcs not display cases
my pc is on carpet i think i m safe
leaving performance on the table
how to fix it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzk8hoc_5xw)
too many people seeking validation online i m willing to believe many of those were shattered on purpose
alright guys control your temper no not you that other guy
people who shatter their side panels on tile should have their pc revoked at their expense change my view
randomly spontaneously right
all of them its a conspiracy being carried out by big tile big pc case and big tile have always had their shadowy battles going back s of years
the great shattering oooooh elden ring
me with my panel thats got chips rode in a car for months and survived a house fire
i don t get it simply putting your pc on tiles will cause spontaneous shattering
its the signatur posts and a big part of the soul of this subreddit tbh
i ll be taking my side panel off tomorrow wish me luck lol
how does this even happen
i spent years in a factory running the furnace tempering auto glass the glass side panel has never been an issue for me i do hate how you can see through it though i wish cases offered more solid panels
nah i enjoy watching idiots wasting their money
who the fuck bathroom tiles their bedroom
my issue is how many people don t have carpet or wood engineered wood in their office living spaces
i ve been using a tempered glass case for more than and a half years since i build my rig opened it a few times to clean it change thermal paste even moved it with my car a few times inside the trunk still not broken still afraid after seeing so many of them broken my next case definitely not gonna have tempered glass
why does the glass explode in the first place what s the reason
here s my masterpiece never got around to posting it before https://imgur.com/a/uzyps9j
that would be one of the many reasons why i only use solid metal side panels
for a sub that calls themselfs masterrace it sure is filled with a lot of decadent people
just use bullet proof glass jk
why does this happen
i m glad we don t have tile in my apt or my tg side panel would be at risk ngl
me without glass on my side panel
at this point people just trying to be in a click a shattered click
do they just not make acrylic side panels anymore i still can t tell the difference other than one apparently explodes if you touch it
why are they always glass why not some clear plastics or something
metal side panels i don t break and i can be perforated to allow the gpu to exhaust right out of the case increasing performance glass side panels hurrr i can shatter randomly but you can see all your cringe funko pops and rgb diarrhea
alright i m gonna say it glass panels are the biggest trap in buying a case for the sake of vanity and if you need more proof than this single image then you re lost
fuck it we making steel plates the new trend
yes
i m gonna start a gaming pc case company so i can make bank
i just want see trough side panels that can t break i never felt like acryl was that bad
that s why i love metal side panel
just bought a asus ap201 case for the simple reason it was the only matx case i could find without glass side panel
i was questioned on some subreddit for using plexiglass instead of tempered glass when i cut a side panel into my pc case i originally did it for cost and ease of cutting but this makes me feel even better about it
mine came with plexiglass so there s no risk in shattering it just a huge piece of plastic xd
so i bought a expensive case with tampered glass and now i see this
the pc has fallen millions must shatter
i am gonna get a fractal north with mesh design
the best thing to do is to never have a glass panel i would never do that just in case we are humans
shocking tile each time
if the wokeists knew how many co2 s went into producing their computer glass it would be different
everytime i see this post i look at my thermaltake view and i shudder at the thought
why does tempered glass shatter when you put the case on tile i m genuinely curious
hardwood floor gang represent
laughs in steel side panel
so i have a wood floor not like real wood what s gonna happen
i have a glass side panel it s on a hinge corsair 680x case and it s on my desk which is made of wood this also solves the problem
dear lord he has the same case as me in the bottom left guess it s a matter of time now
this is why i don t care about glass side panels
solid metal side panel gang
metal gif giphy 9ozkxhsqvbh3g
meanwhile me with a full metal case
fred mohs wants a word with you alleged nerds
hope this never happens to me
i moved home for a bit and broke so many screens on the new ceramic tile in my old room thank god i didn t have a tempered glass panel back then
ah i see thank you
let s just go back to the beige cases
which is why i like lian li lancool iii the glass has a metal edge glued on the inside strengthens the edge against shattering
meanwhile rubber mats at walmart be like where you at
does this occur when the glass cover is propped up against something then slides down onto the ceramic tile floor and poof shatters
the funny part is that they then go to microcenter and steal the glass panels off the demo cases
if we could get down to like a week i d be impressed
i heard somewhere that the chance of glass to lose its durability strength brittleness can degrade if it is subjected to varying temperatures in rapid succession let s say you live in cold regions the glass will get super cold when you use the computer during gaming the insides will get hot due to gpu blowing air into the glass constantly vertical mount gpus are exception when you call it a day and shuts pc down the temperature drops to the actual surrounding temperature of your room probably cold this rapid temperature changes everyday will cause the glass stress and might shatter if it goes beyond a threshold if simply touching the side panel with hand might shatter it in this case solutions that i could think of are try to maintain a constant temperature in the room using either thermostat or insulating around the cpu don t use pc during super cold times cold won t kill anything but what comes after the session might in the long run if you are living in a hot region i would say you are lucky and won t face this shattering issue unless you hit the glass on something solid lol
one more time
im actually getting annoyed at how many of these we see in a week my case has glass panels and theyre still fine smh
just install round edge reinforced plastic problems solved
i did not know that about it against ceramics til
if your tg shattered because you put it down on tile you should replace it with tile
it s always the floor builds
so beige tiles are the culprit let s try on some other colors
this thread is entirely incomplete and let me tell you why you can tap the glass side panel on a glass desk and it will shatter
when i got my first pre built this happened to me i kept my pc hooked up on a tile floor so that i could have more space on my desk needless to say i have never shattered my tempered glass from that day lesson learned it s a hassle to clean a hassle to get a replacement
if people understood how tempered glass works it doesn t take force to break it if you hit the sides
carpet gang
hell yeah me on my i7
in my opinion guys is very simple already have an am4 board do not upgrade to am5 buy a 5800x3d while waiting for newer cpus or directly skip am5 for am6 or newer intel have to buy a new system buy one of the best am5 board a 7800x3d will give you top tier performance great efficiency and surely will last to when you can upgrade to the last am5 cpu while staying with the same board
wanted to upgrade to the 7800x3d but benchmarks are saying it s not worth the jump to am5 when i already have a 5800x3d guess i ll be waiting till next gen
i mean what kind of idiot bought the 7900x3d they will try to justify it by using their rig for productivity work but inside they have remorse that a cheaper cpu is already better at gaming than their one after just a few months hahaha
went from i7 6700k rtx to r9 7950x3d i have no idea what to do with all this power now lol
i wonder if it s better than the fx
should i return my 7900x bundle to microcenter and get a 7800x3d instead for gaming mostly
not gonna lie i was looking at the 7900x3d part of me thought there would be a decent drop off for the the 7800x3d very happy that i ll be able to save myself a few hundred dollars
7950x3d has a place 7800x3d has a place but the 7900x3d can die a quick death for all anyone should care it s just not useful in comparison to it s siblings
i normally upgrade every gen but still on am4 5800x3d just no need to when i am playing at 4k w a rtx at the moment
2nd rule of tech never buy when they launch the high end products first 1st rule is of course never pre order
both 7900x3d and 7950x3d were bacically scams 7800x3d is really amazing through first proper am5 cpu
its sad they amd sandbagged the max frequency on the 7800x3d they clearly know this cpu will kill the higher end skus entirely if they didn t do so
they should just put these core x3d parts into a 7600x3d and call it a day
and i m still using my gtx ti
what does it mean im waiting for my build so not experienced it yet i do intend to do the overclock discussed by scatterbench to pull out that extra i m not overly concerned yet i just chucked money at it and if it s that bad i ll replace but what s the actual issue i saw ltt talk about the 7950x3d and the issues experienced is it not something that can be worked out through updates
seriously why did amd think that 3d v cache on one ccd is enough
should i upgrade from 3800x to 7800x3d with gigabyte 3080ti onboard
now seeing all the 7000x3d cpu s i don t regret the 7900x purchase at launch even though i bought it for the current price of the 7950x
also 79503d
https://preview.redd.it/0mmpxcf7kbsa1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d6ee2ac6b1ea20196fe2881f0a9daeefc76ecde0 i fixed it
according to jesus you can put the 78003d in the grave as well
5800x3d is so good its literally the best gaming cpu you can buy blindly and get performance near to i9 7800x3d is bit weird some game show a significant improvement while some not so much
the same goes for the 7950x3d
waste of money for 1440p 4k high settings gaming is faster in certain games but for repetitive old online shooters sure if you aren t getting enough frames now
deleted
lmao both those chips belong in that grave now thanks to the god tier i9 13900ks
wow got so lucky and got one on new egg that this sold out in less than secs i hope real people got a chance to get them and not scalppers
i wonder if it ll finally be time to uppy
meanswhile rows over i m sobbing and dropping rose petals one by one on the grave of my 5800x3d
what s a good upgrade from
why does it seem like everyone feels so compelled to upgrade to the newest parts right away i feel like my 3060ti will go a long way for me as i dont game at 4k only maybe im just an idiot
hell yeah doe 7900x3d me with ryzen
my e5 v4s meh
laughing in coreduo
is it worth buying over a 7700x that i already have all the benchmarks i see for 1440p gaming seem to show little to no difference
cant wait to get ahold of one
i ll happily snag one when it takes its pricing place below the 7800x3d
did they not announce them at the same time
this meme is about me and i don t like it
the title s semantics died way earlier tho
i ve seen a few videos on this but i find the benchmarks difficult to understand in simple terms why is the 7800x3d a bad cpu
7900x3d was doa
lol parked cores are so useful ipc was not a big jump like am4 to am5 hope your os doesn t get corrupt by amds cache parking software and the game actually takes advantage of the lower frequency high cache see gamer nexus review haaaaaaard pass from the 13600k gang value is not there even vs a 13700k from a year ago
when i built my pc last month i was originally gonna get the 7900x as it was cheaper but glad i changed my mind and went with the 7950x
i was going to switch to change a 5900x to a 5800x3d for gaming until i started astrophotography holy hell processing those images already take time so i ll stick to the 5900x
seen some reviews and still happy a f with my 7700x still a rocksolid gamer
the moment i learned that only half of the cores on the r9 s had the 3d v cache i knew the 7800x3d would be the new king
i just installed a 7900x3d this week lol
glad i was able to snag one up
i can t justify spending 700cnd on a cpu when my 5600x cost me
whatever you do just don t buy from scalpers
and
that is if you can even get your hands on a 7800x3d
5600x and 5800x just not even caring yet one more gpu gen i ll be all over that 7800x3d
literally just bought a 7900x3d saw the reviews come out for 7800x3d and immediately set up to return my 7900x3d if i got my hands on sure enough got one at launch on newegg hopefully it works well for me
intel an nvidia exist rest no
lower numbers in name bigger gains some amd engineer
i m making a new build and i still don t know if should just get the 7700x for euro or what this 7800x3d
me on my i3
2600k here
woah your rig is identical to mine however i upgraded the gpu to 1080ti few years back when the gtx690 died if you don t mind me asking what gpu are you upgrading to or holding off from upgrading the pc
where are my 6600k bros at
i got both my kids set up on setups and they play everything at 1080p medium high and love it btw the is perfectly capable of doing 1440p with a better gpu like a 2070super or etc though it will be the bottleneck
so you plan to upgrade now r right
i use the same cpu it s still solid for 1080p
word intel pentium core duo
i5 6600k mine comes in thursday
for a new build would a am5 7800x3d be better than whatever intel is offering
but what if i m on am4 and i want to be able to do more than just game say video editing or transcoding looking to upgrade from r5
skip am5 for am6 for am7 for am8 and end up never upgrading
yeah i m also planning to skip am5 for am6 with my 5800x3d if i can
i m going from a 5600x to a 7800x3d because i have a and i need every drop of cpu power i can get
i guess upgrading from the 5800x to a 5800x3d is pretty much money waste right probably should run it as long as possible and upgrade to am5 later when prices drop also is it known when am5 is eol
i keep thinking about swapping my 5800x with an 5800x3d but even with having a i don t think it will make much of a difference at 3440x1440 175hz
running a 5700x now and haven t even seen it above when gaming paired to a doesn t seem to be worth it for current gen games or the 5700x is just a beast
directly skip am5 for am6 amd tends to hold onto its sockets longer than intel so unless they ve decided to change that your am4 system may very well be obsolete well before am6 is released we saw generations of cpus get released on am4 between and a span of years so if am5 is supported for a similar amount of time we may not see am6 until and your am4 system likely will be obsolete by then furthermore if you have an am4 board it might be worth it to just go straight to am5 now rather than sink more money into a system that will not last as long early am4 boards don t have the same upgradeability as later ones and if you have a later one as is my case the performance boost from a 5800x3d may not be worth the money spent
just don t buy your 5800x3d from amazon see post history
i have been waiting for the right moment to do a finishing school new career celebration upgrade to my 4790k system and was hoping for a good memorial day sale at micro center this makes the cpu decision a lot easier as i was debating between between maybe a 7700x for the lower tdp 5800x3d or a 13600k more power efficient except for the and performant than any of those options for a compratively good price is an exciting prospect now to settle on a gpu
generation hops are rarely worth it for most consumers
consume consume consume
it seems like am5 is for people who want to jump on the next gen without being too othered about a significant upgrade from 5800x3d
so im with a 3800x i d be good with upping
i have a 5600x should i upgrade to the 5800x3d
fax
ive considered the 5800x3d is it worth from 5700x i m gaming mainly with 1440p 165hz monitor
i m in the same place but with how expensive the jump to am5 would be especially if i wanted to stay at the level of high end mobo it s just not worth it
yeah i d just wait until next gen 5800x3d is one of the best bang for your buck out there
i wish a 5900x3d was a thing i already have the am4 platform the 5800x3d sounds great but has too few cores for some of my non gaming tasks and it wouldn t be worth it to get an all new motherboard which are expensive now and ram to get to am5
11800x3d
at least a gain is my minimum for a cpu upgrade for me the 7800x3d is just a promising reference point for what the 9800x3d will likely be the 5800x3d is going to be solid until then or longer
i really liked the 6x2 core distribution and think within their generations the 3900x and 5900x were both beasts if it had the 3d cache on both chiplets i would have been sorely tempted i m hoping that with some sort of infinity mesh connecting the caches over multiple chiplets is the end destination of this design arc
yes thank you i am that idiot haven t upgraded since and was gathering money for an upgrade and i waited a lot for the x3d series didn t wanna wait another month on top of the months i was already waiting
what idiot purchased a 7900x3d you have it in your flair damn buyers remorse lmao
i had this remorse when i bought my 5950x and the 5800x3d got launched a couple weeks later for usd less
i bought it so i don t have pc without cpu i will return it in days just by the time my 7800x3d arrives
plenty of games will eat it all up i play most things at 1440p 240hz and there s some titles many br s rust tarkov hunt showdown red dead online ark conan exiles battlefield a ton of single player titles like cp2077 or horizon which will struggle to reach those numbers when on high settings or even on low settings if you just play valorant and say overwatch with some stardew valley and terraria on the side it s not going to get used
lol i ve got my from my first pc sitting on my desk i wanna take the die out and make a key ring thing
oh man i remember when i got one of those bad boys in like i was immensely disappointed and upgraded sidegraded to a i5 4690k shorty after couldn t play battlefield well when it launched and that was all i cared about
depends on if you value that extra performance in games imo i got the 7900x bundle and i am more than happy with it playing at 1440p
op she is not worth it leave now
so does she smash her own stuff up or just yours if its just yours then that isn t her mental health it s her personality and she s an abuser she destroys your stuff to hurt and upset you as an attempt to control you take it from someone that has had relationships with women that were bipolar was an abuser that destroyed my stuff to start with and because i put up with it she realised she could do even more then she started to hit me bite me and clawed chunks out of me with her nails the other were nothing like that i had everyone telling me to leave the abuser and deep down i knew they were right but part of me didn t want to be the guy that dumped someone with a mental health problem plus we were financial connected etc so i stuck by her and it just got worse and worse until eventually my own depression got so bad i was contemplating ending my life that s when i also found out she was cheating on me too and i took the step to walk away from her it was hard to do i felt guilty ashamed and heartbroken for a long time but it got better it will do for you too if you leave her but if you stay with her you are telling her that kind of behaviour is acceptable and it will get worse between you
dump her ass not acceptable behavior next step is her going stabby stabby
so she impulsively broke your shit and then took a nap got mad that you don t react immediately so she broke more shit now you re blaming yourself in the context i smell abuse
adjusting meds isn t an excuse for destroying your stuff especially expensive stuff that they know you love if they don t pay for the damage they caused dump them they re not worth it
man the sex must be out of this world because i don t know why else u would stay
so i just started running
it hurts to look at it
lol i had a divorce for less things than this
that s a nice very selective mental breakdown your girlfriend had there there wasn t anything more at home to break like glasses plates her own stuff ditch her bro
adjust your meds and leave her ass fuck that
jesus christ my woman brings me fruit smoothys while i grind g keys on diablo and she goes an reads or plays the sims on my gaming laptop seeing this shit just reminds me how good i got it
man all i can say is i hope things get better for you
she can blame the meds if she wants but this is domestic violence how badly do you want to put up with the next time she does this
man oh man just remember you are not responsible for fixing them even if you love them some things people need to work out inside themselves and no matter how close to them you are you ll never be able to reach inside their mind and make edits perhaps suggest therapy but dont convince yourself this is okay i know it can feel impossible to let go of something we work on with so many parts of ourselves but it isnt starting anew wont kill you i speak from experience my jump was a big one had to live in a car for a little while but there is another side to all this waiting for you can you give yourself a few days away from your life like a long weekend just get out of your norm and enjoy your own self for a minute will probably end up telling yourself all you need to know
she could talk to you about it you know like an adult
kick her out file a police report take her to small claims court and get money out of her im serious if you had done something like this to her stuff you would be in jail
ok but like the way its cracked in the first pic looks like a metroid prime boss not even gonna lie
i recommend you cook all the food for now on
where pcmasterrace meets relationship advice dump her buddy and don t look back i m sorry for your loss
i ve dealt with a lot of mental health disorders i ve worked inpatient psych in philadelphia this is not adjusting meds behavior even if it is you re blind about how dark this is you need to seriously evaluate if this relationship is worth it to stay in the patients required to tolerate this is something that might come for a family member someone like a girlfriend should like bring this into your life please zoom out and consider your options here i know the short term pain is terribly hard to face but believe me when i say it s worth it
she finna kill u bruh
op please listen to me i ve been in this exact same situation before an ex had literally destroyed my old rig what you need to do right now is file a police report with the evidence and get her away from you she will not stop doing this i made the mistake of letting it ride when i was younger and i have never recovered she kept breaking my most prized possessions until i was left with nothing but her it was on purpose i m begging you op you need to find someone who respects your personal possessions as much as you respect theirs period
yeah either my partner would be replacing the entire thing or i d be gone mental health doesn t give you an excuse to be a raging cunt you re your own person you can enjoy things without your partner imagine if you smashed her phone to pieces reddit would be flaming you to oblivion leave
lmao throw her our and sue for the damages
damn you better run
damn never thought i would see someone s life goes bad in this subreddit but im sorry that happen to you yes obviously you should leave her but as you said its not that easy for you and i get it every people have their own life and situation than we are and thus making it easy to tell people this and that i hope you will get through this quickly stay strong my guy
my brother i feel you here s my advice dump her ass and sue for the damage
mental health or not i m reading this as stockholm syndrome op i know it will be really difficult financially as i see you replied but you need to get out i ve been in this exact situation and it was damn difficult but also the best choice i ever made best wishes
i dont know your life and i understand the financial struggle nowadays but man dump her ass asap before some real bad shit happens next that s a big big red flag you have there
huge red flag if someone can destroy your hard earned setup then just guess what else can they do huge manipulation tactics one item like the monitor at first might be okay but then later on destroying your pc after you leaving home seeing the monitor that is two different situations in which she is trying to manipulate you with the mental health breakdown excuse i might be wrong but i really think this might be the case anyways please understand this as just my opinion only
are the meds her reason for destroying your shit or her excuse to escape the consequences
someone already said this i am seconding it i have lived with bipolar and multiple personality disorder before she smashed your screen and then went and took a nap woke up and realized you weren t home so she continued her warpath this wasn t just some emotional break where she couldn t control herself very clearly took a nap in between destroying your things this sounds like abuse domestic violence you need to reevaluate the reason for why you are still there don t excuse all of her shit behavior and chalk it all up to the fact she has mental health problems and can t help it
oh boyyyy she gonna pay for all that destroyed triple in there she dont know a thing about your mining rig
leave this is how you never wake up again
hey op i hope you see this any form of destroying somebody elses property regardless of the mental health situation is an incredibly abusive trait i was in a relationship for multiple years with a girl i thought i loved she would emotionally and physically abuse me which pushed all of my friends and family away and i felt completely trapped i know that everybody s situation is different but these are tell tale signs that the future would not get any better and could potentially excalate into physical violence at the end of the day the only person you should be looking out for is yourself and your own wellbeing people rarely change and everybody deserves to be in a caring and loving relationship
i lost everything including my mental health because i didnt leave in time run dude
hello op i hope this message finds you well i wanted to reach out and offer my asus 144hz monitor with a g sync board swap and my almost brand new asus rog rampage edition with 64gb of ram a gpu and other spare parts to you free of charge although i may have forgotten which processor it has it is the one before going xeon while it may seem outdated it is still capable of running most games at 144hz with ease additionally i would like to encourage you to listen to the advice that other users in this conversation have offered it sounds like your relationship with technology might be unhealthy or abusive and it s important to take care of your mental health and seek help if needed by the way i m just kidding about the last part but seriously it may be time for you to make some big boy moves regarding your partner if you are interested in the hardware that i have to offer or if you need anything else please do not hesitate to let me know take care
happened to me also but in my case i found out that she was fucking guys in weekend i didn t even confronted her but she got really angry and fucked my whole setup documents up d trust in your right hand brother never dissapoints
man i m no expert in relationships but from what you have told about your s o and your actions you gotta admit she or he but i m assuming she took it too far this can probably hopefully not develop to where she might vent out on other things such as well you vent out physically
i hope you ctrl alt deleted that person out of your life after this
just think about this how would they react if you destroyed their prized possession
mental health problems aren t a person s fault but they are a person s responsibility to deal with leave they weren t sleeping you came home didn t give them the reaction they wanted so they made a bigger incident to get it i was married to a cluster b woman for years this is the crap i dealt with constantly grab your shit and run
dude there s a good chance you ll end up like that pc if you stick around that s a genuinely unhinged thing to do and mental health issues are no excuse
broooo wtf dump her and sue her
it s kinda satisfying that the display still shows an image with that much damage but this person is being controlling and projecting their own issues on you a rule of thumb is to be with people that encourages your hobbies not tries to control them or even smashes them
we don t know your whole situation and no one forces you to share it here on reddit or somewhere else but please don t stay with this person staying with your so through tough times is basically what every man woman should do but this is beyond tough times this has nothing to do with a breakdown cause medical adjustment or such she s just psycho it seems that is angry of not getting the attention she wants you know that you cannot build another pc right this will probably escalate again and again until you finally leave her man i don t know what your life situation is right now etc and i understand that you probably are scared to do such thing but you have to value yourself more do you really want to live in tyranny for the rest of your life
she was just pissed that you spend time on the pc instead with her and that was her excuse for breaking your shit you should make her replace everything that she destroyed
i want to hug you
you need to run from this run far away because it s not going to magically improve if you leave you should have contacted the police too just not pressed charges that way situation of domestic violence is at least documented you are walking a fine line here it seems and it s probably not worth your life well being or hers f for your rig tho just heartbreaking
hey op you can most likely sue her and get the full retail price of the components back you said some parts could be salvaged so the money returned can be used to upgrade other parts if you can reuse the cpu and such surely sucks but definitely worth the shot
this is abuse report her to the authorities and run tf away from her
dumppp
yo here a guy from spain that suffered something similar about years ago long story short she smashed all tvs pcs and consoles in the house including work laptop when she was picking up her stuff a month after breaking up with her i honestly know how you may feel all my support and if you need to freely talk to someone that does not know you at all just write me time and patience those are the clues regards
op is so delusional they re gonna stay now when your on the news with your skull bashed in
take it from someone who put up with a severely disturbed partner for years life is too short to put up with stress inducing lunacy the next step from personal experience instead of her destroying your stuff is her reaching for a knife and stabbing you it nigh on always goes the same way and please for the love of sanity do not get her pregnant that will open a whole new nightmarish chapter of pure unfiltered hell dimension crazy break up move on build a new rig
i m on my 2nd marriage walk run away from this one immediately people don t change often and bad things tend to get worse as a relationship gets older
seems like you got gaslit
update i got sodomized with a trampoline rod while i was asleep i hope her mental health takes a turn for the better soon
first in any relationship with a person with mental health issues there needs to be clear expectations from both parties and their need to be set boundaries that should not be crossed you also need to practice personal self care remember you are not a bad person for needing to take time out from your partner and doing other things it s necessary for your own mental health your partner absolutely has to respect that if they can t then you have a right to step away second this is an exceeding of rational and emotionally safe boundaries by someone who doesn t appear to respect you or your property you almost certainly used your pc for self care and even in a distressed state your partner knew that even if they were suffering mentally at the time your partner was rational enough that they took a nap after smashing your monitor and then got back up while you were out and carried on by picking up your pc carrying it outside and throwing it into the driveway where they then deliberately dismantled and destroyed it then when questioned they directly blamed you for their own actions because you re spending too much time on your pc that s emotional abuse them having mental health problems isn t ever your fault they knew how much you cared about the pc how much it cost you and your emotional interaction with it but deliberately destroyed it smashing the monitor and the going to sleep i could understand it s the continuation and much more deliberate actions after that rings alarm bells what s next in the list of things your partner will destroy because you spend to much time with it your phone your car the television your home you a serious discussion is needed and you need to think on whether you can trust them to respect your personal boundaries
show these photos to the police i m sure destruction of property fits under some form of domestic violence research your options and don t put up with this shit
i just can t understand why you re still with her for so long if she did this was this your first time dealing with something like that man need you to be real here if it ain t the first time she s the genuine problem here and you re being too nice about it fam you re subjecting yourself to torture at this point this is abuse
i promise you the sex is not worth it dump this bitch and let her destroy her own stuff you neither need nor deserve this shit
being with someone that is like this for years i can say it gets less severe but the mental illness piece is a scapegoat crutch that you endure because of love but it s really just disrespect and founded or unfounded insecurities you can justify where you are wrong but if the writing is on the wall and everyone recognized it as abuse and not normal you have to decide how special your relationship and unique that person is vs your health sorry you had to go through that joking about it and reaching out the way you seem playful to build up your energy to deal with it only wears down and less effective over time and you obsess over it but nothing changes
so break up with her and take her to small claims court for the damages
everyone has mental health issues i was diagnosed with bipolar when i was but having anything regardless of severity doesn t make your self control go out the window this is straight up emotional abuse as many have said and it seems your partner already has quite the hold on you if you re justifying this behavior because they can t handle their own mind abusers and manipulators use mental health as their biggest weapon if you pay the bills kick them out and file a lawsuit maybe get a restraining order or mention that you re also concerned for personal safety because next time that monitor could be your face
drown her under the surface of the fluids just joking dont kill her but you should think of dumping her ass before she decides to drown you under the surface of the fluids instead
bro file a police report and press charges dump her ass
sorry man but you need to get out i really really understand how hard and horrible that might be but this is worse this should never happen and will happen in the future as well
f chain
maybe finding a new place to live what would have happened if you were home when this breakdown happened might be you laying in the drive way
that s super fucked up man there no excuse in the world that validates smashing up a man s rig make a police report make her pay for it and kick her to the curb asap
yea op enjoy your pc while it lasts my beautiful unstable partner smashed my setup and just went back to sleep and said sorry it s the meds and on top of all of that your rationalizing her behavior it s literally in your tone it does not sound good
this is so fucked i dont give af if your in a relationship with someone if they do this to my stuff im calling the cops period
fuck all that noise get out now
the bad she wrecked your pc with a metal rod and went to sleep like a baby the good there s a perfectly usable metal rod that s now readily available always look at the bright side of life
pretty sure this is a crime
yeah nah this not a mental health breakdown that s the excuse she uses to abuse you you should leave this relationship
this is more than her mental health get the fuck out before it s too late been there done that resist the urge to smash her face on the way out you will get the electric chair in the u s best of luck with everything
no you have it wrong they owe you replacements if you purchased the equipment and they destroyed it that s on them to replace the broken equipment mental health can certainly be a cause but that doesn t mean they shouldn t be held accountable for their actions
speaking as someone who has experience with loved ones that are mentally unwell if it was a legit mental breakdown i don t think it would have happened in two parts to me the fact that she did more after you left means she was expecting a reaction and decided to do whatever it takes to get it
you re right op mental health issues don t give them the right to do this probably doesn t give them the uncontrollable impulse to do it either i mean what mental health condition causes someone to very deliberately target a loved ones valuable possessions coincidently yeah right it s likely also one of the outlets you use to deal with your own stress idk to me the line between mental health and abuse is nowhere near thin enough for this to be misconstrued even if it was fuck that you don t deserve to be anchored down to this shit
before i even read the story im betting it was either a spousal fight or a crazy ex
leave her ass
there s very few meds that make someone more agressive i think she just cares more about herself than you
hey op i have schizoaffective disorder i understand what it s like to be psychotic and make choices that hurt others but this is beyond making illogical choices that inadvertently hurt others this is an intentional infliction of pain directed at you this is abuse and being psychotic doesn t make someone abusive i m not gonna tell you how to live your life but you gotta know that you don t deserve to be abused and your feelings are valid
i had a relationship with one of these boarderline personality types medication will fix nothing op do not get twisted up in any messiah complex nonsense with this person just get the hell out anyone who will do this is potentially capable of doing a lot worse and you simply cannot trust them just pack up leave change your number block them on social media and make damn sure nobody gives them your address then go find someone who is reasonably stable there are plenty out there and will treat you and your belongings with respect without requiring psychiatric medication i know it s harsh but you can t fix them and they will ruin your life if you let them
leave leave the relationship pack your shit your life will be hell with this person i ve been through it lasted years eventually it escalates you cannot help them in the end you do not owe it to them to try you are trapped in a people pleasing cycle please know there are stable people who will love you and you will find love again get out while you can
op my recent ex was just like this used her mental health as an excuse to terrorize me and destroy my shit this is not you fault if you ve been playing too much games don t you think a reasonable response would be to talk it out in what world would it be fine destroying several hundred maybe a thousand dollars worth of stuff that is very meaningful to you you really need to sit down and think if the relationship you re in allows you to have a reasonable discussion that you feel like actually goes somewhere instead of you just talking at her if not then you really need to rethink your next step she s obviously doing this to hurt you and was expecting you to get mad and yell at her for the monitor and when she didn t get the reaction she wanted she escalated when someone loudly proclaims what kind of person they are i really really really suggest listening to their actions and not words
fucking dump her that s fucking insane
run away now pc tomorrow your head while you sleep watch your back
dump and sue
bruh wtf dump her ass and take her to small claims court to pay for your stuff no excuse for acting like a badly behaved child and breaking peoples stuff in a tantrum
yikes i mean i am sorry she has mental issues but that s no excuse to have done what she did i would consider finding a better significant other but i don t know you guys and i don t know the kind of relationship you two have all i can say is best of luck to you brother and do not feel chained into a relationship just because she has issues yourself comes first than anybody else unless you have a kid
i believe youre in a dangerously toxic relationship meds are being used as an excuse to mentally abuse you destruction of your things is a power move please seek actual help and information about this
aw hell nah op theres a rule about girls like this
is it really a tragedy if your partner is smashing up your stuff you should really consider filing a police report and getting the fuck out of dodge
dump her get yourself a new baby pc of course financed by her money you don t have to pay for it she has
your screen looks like it got possessed by an eldritch horror
dump her
congrats

duuude yes free hardware hits different i m still living off the high of winning a 600gb ssd from evga it was worth about 1k at the time 2011ish and i traded it for a complete system that lasted me until lol
not as much as i hate this segue from our sponsor lttstore com lttstore com
fluff piece
are pillows fluffy
my head is heavy so no
has there been a aaa game that released as a finished product in the last couple years
don t forget about them releasing the same copy paste statement a day after we are being made aware that some pc players are having issues playing the game we are working hard to create a fix stay tuned for more
portal rtx randomly fucking crashes out of knowhere for an unknown reason and it s irritating because i keep on losing all of my fucking progress x200b x200b kinda teaches me a lesson for not saving manually
all for the bargain price of microtransactions of which might be the only thing working
cyberpunk still crashes for me it s just this one mission i m picking up some kind of bot from some gang they tell me to sit on the couch and my partner takes issue with it then i m offered to smoke something i can play just fine if i revert to previous missions but once i get to that spot it almost always crashes 9900k 3070ti very frustrating
developers when u cant afford to spend on new parts every years
don t forget the option to pay for the right of being beta tester aka early release and pre order
meanwhile games from are looking and running better than these pieces of garbage
also works in high end only isnt yeah after a high end video card is out for months it works well and new games work well but if you are one of the first to get that new hi yeah they are supporting the poor s who purchased their weak sauce computer machines with ebt first because you are likely to be of the hardware base
pc master race more like i have a pc i ll cry about everything race
fuck it we can fix it in production
the re4 remake is very well optimized
missed day one patch which is bigger then than the preload to play on day of release
the newest ligma game that just came out from naughtydog or it might have been whatdog was pretty good
re4r just came out
well pretty much anthem was if you had a hpc two 2080ti s m2 and gigs of ddr4
don t forget core mechanism features areas story lines and characters of game cutted off from main game like games now literally feel that they made full game and just cutted off content to sell it as dlc after year of teasing from marketing team on social media and locked behind eur dlc
revert to what previous missions that s literally like halfway through the street kid intro you ve basically never gotten past the middle of the tutorial my dude
that s weird i played that game on release with a 9900k and 1080ti i didn t finished it cause i can t beat adam smasher but i played for almost hours without crashing then i started over again last year when i got a no crashing too i stopped at the same spot lol
member times when company actually payed people to test their games and people actually tested it now it s like we re not going to fix that we created hyped unfinished bullshit and we know you will play it maybe after months of negative review we release hotfix when we realise our bullshitting around and blaming our customers don t work also we made a game what looks like from but have demands for hardware enjoy
who is joe
pathetic
no mercenaries separate ways or assignment ada on release mercenaries won t even have ada or wesker it might function but it isn t as feature complete as the original re4 was
i ran that game on a super and gigs of ram i don t see what you are getting at it ran at max graphics on a 1440p with no issues at all either way that wasn t what i was talking about that game wasn t finished at launch either
for real that s legit the start of the game
that intro mission is consistent to all the backgrounds i think i got it as corpo at least
joe mama is the ceo of ligma
the only reason mercs wasn t available at launch is because capcom wanted to get the core experience out as soon as they could if it launched with mercenaries we would ve had to wait until around arpril 7th anyway for everything and even later for separate ways but i m confident that all that stuff is coming
the before dont feel as claustrophobic to me
i personally like the before look the after look is a bit too aggressive like some have mentioned i have enjoyed playing your game so far appreciate the difficulty level
personally i prefer the before to the after it feels a little cleaner and less cluttered and linear
before looks more pleasant to me the after looks dry in hills etc feels more cluttered
if before is and after is in my opinion aim for a
second looks good but the hills need to be smaller
what organic shapes in nature who the fuck would want that
apparently i am the only person that likes the after s
i think the before looks better just because the after should have less agressive mountains to feel a bit more natural however this seems like a decision that really changes the blocky feel of the game so you should go with whatever achieves the feeling you are looking for i ve been watching the development a bit the game looks amazing keep it up
i not trying to be rude both versions are amazing but i like the before way more
impressive
i like the before personally it just felt like the whole thing fit the after just feels off to me they re both well done tho but the before just felt more natural
before does look better
i can t lie i like the before
before
the before looks too much minecrafty for my liking but the after needs some smoothing in the transition between grass and ground if it makes sense
it s graphically a good improvement but dirt doesn t like to form steep bare slopes like that it would look better if those slopes were covered in plants or less steep
my first impression was eww another minecraft clone but then i thought nice progress so keep the second version or it will be just one of many clones
do we have a release date ever since i came across the developments for this game on reddit i ve been wanting to play it i wish i could try out an alpha or something
iron pineapple approves
before looks more pleasing to the eye
it appears i am alone on this i like the after better
before looks way better
we have decided to extend the playtest on steam until april utc wishlist and follow us on steam if you want to be part of the community join us on discord steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804470/duel\_corp/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804470/duel_corp/) discord https://discord.com/invite/hjujdjgqty](https://discord.com/invite/hjujdjgqty)
am i the only one who like the after
i prefer the new one not a big fan of static blocky terrains
the before screams minecraft tbh too similar for my taste all the comments on the claustrophobic hills in the after are confusing to me just looks like a dude walking down a gully to me those things exist in nature
before
before
before looks better also just a personal opinion i feel like most of the colors are too dark if that makes sense maybe tune down the dark green on the trees a little bit to see how it looks
after makes the character feel way too big for me
before is a cleaner look after is a little cluttered honestly you can still get a less blocky curved look without cluttering up the walkway
laggy
another vote for before
looks like the one game from south park
is this minecraft but 3rd person
it looks ridiculous both before and after after looks like a high school project
lots of people talking about how things look but are glossing over the tech you re using to make world building easier this looks awesome as for the aesthetics perhaps a middle ground between before and after is worth checking out basically just a version of after with larger chunkier polygon shapes
add more variation to the texture map on the vertical surfaces the topographical rounding i think will look much better this way perhaps an easy way is to blend the textures from the surrounding tiles likewise if you carry the foliage like tall grass and flowers partially up the verticals it could help in most scenes
i don t know what s this game is but just by the looks i like before better looks more videogamey more stylish gives retro gaming zelda lttp like vibes i think all you need is less repetitive bigger overall wall side textures
before looked so clean
looks cool but wow that area has a lot of hills mountains i can t even imagine what would make a landscape like that i would probably tone it down maybe use some fences or something instead if you just don t want the player escaping
after has way too much dirty dirt type colors
i do think more deatik to the surrounding areas especially the mountains but other than that cool
i like after and can t wait to play this game
imho the old one looks much better and blends with the rest better creating an interesting style the new one just doesnt match and personally i find it ugly
i ve been following for so long and have it pulled up on google i just can t wait to try the game when it is ready
v nice
i think you used a lot of minecraft textures before
i like the retro x minecraft look also the walking sound really reminds me of minecraft great job honestly
personally like the before the cubic landscaping i feel fits better with the art style
my opinion at least i haaaate that kind of world generation the revamped one it can cause the terrain to become slippery wot soapy rocks search it
if you want to go with after you have to do something with the brown side textures like some disruptive rocks and vegetation otherwise it looks like a star wars game from
are these marging cubes in the after shot or just perlin simplex heights i like it before looks too sterile and flat imo works for a top down but i think the choice for more natural terrain for a third person was right throw in another noise layer for steeper cliffs now and then and some areas more flat to break up the samey ness give more room to breath and you re gucci
before takes the cake but i like how the forest blocks the far view in the after pros and cons to each
before
i like before a lot more but if you use the after terrain maybe turn down the heights
i can give you over forty thousand reasons as to why that forest isn t real
i can see that you ve made some changes to the terrain generation but i think the previous version looked better overall if you decide to stick with the current design my suggestion would be to consider using fewer or shorter hills especially the ones surrounding the player the distant hills look great but the closer ones don t seem to blend in as well with the environment
before ngl
what game is this
prefer the look of after but it needs to have the scenery opened up a bit
damm witcher looks fire
goes from minecraft to valheim
you lose a lot of vibrancy with all that hill taking up space but the textures on the old hills need more variation
before looks way better after looks like a dig site
y all should make the character smaller it s a bit claustrophobic in there
i really like after but maybe increase the size of hallways a bit to help with the claustrophobia people are experiencing
i like how the before is just straight up minecraft
i like the after better before looks like minecraft style graphics and the after has a smoother more detailed terrain
looks like lego without the bricks
literally just saw this game on iron pineapples channel hope the development is going well game looks cool
i actually liked both but i prefer the before is just that i m old for the new era xd
it could be a stylistic thing to me but i like the mix of organic looking environment with the straight cut environment in before reminds me of like how i imagined the world in older gen pokemon games
why are there just walls in the forest
there is a good middle ground somewhere the before has some simple charm to it
i m literally watching this on iron pineapple
oh wait so are you showing how you are creating levels placing blocks and using generation to smooth it nice man if it s your game definitely listen to others you will have to remake levels so the paths are wider so when the generation is applied it isn t cramped and more natural that s the only negative thing i personally like the smooth terrain the other folks speaking whatever it would just look like minecraft without it and you would be compared with it i was thinking about this the generation can be used it a lot of ways but you might just want to use a terrain style editor like what is built into blender to just create a grid and use a tool to raise and lower the terrain plane then import you can still apply textures for various heights or paint them on directly giving you total control without having to test it all you would see it in realtime there s many ways to skin a cat but personally i think this is neat and people in this thread dont get what wip means half of them don t understand what they are looking at and the applications for it of course you are going to tweak it they don t get that
before seemed like it had more character to me
i prefer the before i think if you re going to go for more natural realistic you ve gotta make it a lot more natural before it will be better than the minecraft style
honestly i think i prefer the before but purely because i think it has more charm it has the same feel as a top down rpg which is really cool
i actually like the before quite a bit better less cluttered the after is too hard to see and look around
i honestly like the before better it just harmonizes better with the art style just the textures for the dirt could be better
i prefer before as it looks less scuffed the after one reminds me of all the times i fell through terrain also if you go for the before i recommend you add a cliff texture for higher walls big dirt walls aren t pretty
i really prefer the before honestly it lets the space stay small but still feel bigger
thw after feels like you are taking too much space with minimal stripes of plane groumd to walk on
the before has a nice nostalgic feel to it i think i would enjoy it the after looks like you are trying too hard to make it look realistic which doesn t work for that as it is shown the clean lines and clear paths make for more enjoyable gameplay in my opinion
you guys seriously need to tune down the damn seeker boss that s the fucking first boss it doesn t need to kill me in hits am supposed to be just learning here the difficulty was not the essence of souls games don t get that wrong and i can t lock on it so many hits wasted the parry system i can t get used to sometimes it works sometimes not
after because otherwise it just looks like a minecraft derivative even if that is a ridiculous thing to say and it s nothing like it tips extend grass textures and scatter further to and on the slope in random patches and increase the crenulations on the slopes something like tessellation on the dirt rock texture would help so it s less uniform perhaps randomly steep in some spots and less so in others would also make it look more natural to the eye
what game is this
i think before is better honestly the game looks cool btw
after a maze before open space nice visibility unique look
i think a mix of before and after would be an improvement
a bit too much dirt for my taste if you turn down the hills and maybe make it more grass i think it d be more pleasant to look at
idk what this is but i immediately want to play it edit found it installed going to play now
the before looks like a third person view of the early top down pokemon games i m kinda loving it
don t listen to these nerds after looks way better you just need to increase the spacing around all of the elevation to make it seem more natural and include another layer of medium sized boulders around them to break up the artificial lines of the hills
to be honest before it has charm
after is nicer to look at and def more organic but unless those giant hills are rails for a specific path you might consider a reduction that s more comparable to before in size and screen real estate dedication just at a glance it feels a lot of the visual becomes a beige of disinterest for me the before had a more satisfying color palette distribution there are more greens and cool undertones in some of the foliage that makes the tone feel more like a forest and is much more interesting to the eye even if there s nothing to it gray stones and varying textures to diversify what is now dominating the visual space in this particular environment would help the character has smaller proportions than the human adult in design heads tall this design looks to be around heads or so and his world may need some adjustments too considering this detail and how the after appears to affect overall tone in size and standard camera depth angle that said i don t know game design i ve done other visual designs and base my feedback on that background hoping it will be useful in continued efforts great work overall love to see how the development process changes the end results thanks for sharing
no idea how anything in this entire page as a whole works but i can say for sure that it looks much better
fuck i did that for months because i was a broke teenager back in the day
it s perfect
this is funny
someone send this guy for a display port to vga cable
what are those first two red ports
that s the backside of homer j simpson right there
i work in industrial automation this is just a tuesday
wires aren t solder moved computer by an inch and signal lost
i remember building an adapter like this for a sega genesis controller ppjoy was such great software
your scientists were too preoccupied with whether or not they could that they never wondered whether they should
connectors are just organized wiring
gif giphy ovlnoqvn6j78kltoyb downsized
gif giphy llw6sw8rp7yso
improvise adapt overcome
at one point i must have had at least svga to dvi adapters in my house
if it works it s not stupid
that thing your pinout hand it over
do not question don t even ask be it twisted still does its task lord alfred tennyson disputed
meanwhile this guy ingame oh wait guys my red color channel just unplugged
i don t understand how this works i digital vga port wired to an analog vga cable what am i missing
the time it took my man to solder that
this needs to be on r cablegore
but but but nevermind good job
bro is that your pc my brother in christ i will literally mail you a vga to dvi adapter for free
bro gimme ur paypal imma give you the bucks to buy an adapter xd
seems a adapter would just be less trouble
it ll work might have interference in your signal though
this is brilliant and would required a high degree of skill and knowledge i would just pout and complain
right cuz a dp to vga converter definitely doesn t exist
used to play warcraft multiplayer through serial ports like this back in the day
how on earth would you not have a dvi to vga adaptor i know i have like a dozen of them in a box of random computer junk
you can afford wire but not a adapter
could have just bought a adapter for like
this is some proper tech gore
chaos theory
oh no your pc is wiring itself

i saw this in an anime once
i believe the saying goes if there s a will there s a way
this definitely gotta be random
what the actual fuck
just get an adapter
isn t dvi digital and vga analog how can this work without some sort of conversion
an adapter is literally less than a cup of coffee
cursed
this is almost as sketch as the crt display i had before my dad bought me lcd so i don t electrocute myself
the sound of a computer sleeping
this looks like what i do with my pc leds since i have no unified system apart from everything being ws2811 just don t plug it into the 12v led out on the mobo like i recently did except in my setup the cables don t fit and fall out constantly
why does this pc have headphone jacks of various colours
lol i guess all those extra pins don t do anything like when ikea gives you extra parts
perfect
holy shit is that firewire now that is something i haven t seen in a long long time
bro a vga to dvi dongle costs like bucks shipping
gotta do what you gotta do also wife finds a lay popped in my head
i feel assaulted
the thing vibes
we are seeing pro gamer move where
life before cheap cables
this is nsfw
i think it should stop finding a way
some r techsupportgore content right here
omnessia music start
looks like the borg are trying to interface with your old as shit
that woke some undeniable memories from back then let me tell ya
looks like a standard chemistry lab
this has similar vibes to the guy who charged his phone with a vga cable
the pc equivalent of body horror
i did not know that this was possible amazing work dr frankenstein
it looks like a scene from john carpenter s the thing
genuinely impressed you did this and didn t have internet i m good at a number of things but some things i look at and my brain just shuts off this is one of those cases well done boss
and so does death
you could have just gotten an adapter or better yet a new cable
this picture is a perfect example of how knowledge is power but power still means you re poor
all of a sudden my setup a syncmaster 932mw and an nvidia nvs looks almost professional when i found the nvs there wasn t the full size bracket so basically i removed the half size bracket and now it s held up by the displayport hdmi adapter which i then connected to an hdmi dvi cable to the monitor
perfect
vga gone parasitic super cell the thing mode
ffs im looking for that bastard adapter right now
i m generally not a fan of form over function but pictures like this make me realize maybe some form is necessary someone buy this person a adapter
op if this is you i have mad respect for this move in all the times of needing a cord or the right adapter style i ve never even thought of this and i ve been humbled by it i have cut the back off pcie slots to fit bigger drives but this is way more out there
they made an adapter
bro i have like vga cables send me your addy i ll ship a couple to you
angst
r hentai
u must be the most chill dude on the planet congrats
dvi to vga adapters aren t expensive
lol the adapters are like
r redneckengineering
bro let the intrusive thoughts win
wait wouldn t this not work because digital to analog honest question
what in the redneck engineering am i looking at
i think i just had a small heart attack
gif giphy mplpvjcswvrkk downsized
improvise adapt overcome
how poor are you
you had a computer but couldnt afford a adapter damn sorry man
i had a car like this when i was a teenager the right rear signal was a manual kill switch i installed terribly because the bulb would blow everytime i signalled and braked at the same time fuel pump on another switch because i tore the wires somewhere changing the original antenna removed by a deer and replaced with a coat hanger the list goes on
shit i d rather do it like this than damage my fingers trying to screw those little fuckers in
that s pretty damn resourceful
i mean to be fair it s a side of the pc that s normally out of field of view and power to you for figuring out a workaround
wait u can afford the pc but not connector what
obviously because you are still using vga
did you install g l a d o s
passive cooling isn t doing much for you you need a fan
well i m assuming it s because the hardware you re trying to play on is refusing and calling you fat
as an ex nortel guy i m gonna blame avaya
did you make sure to update the graphics drivers to the latest version
because you re trying to run it on reddits servers
no mouse
have you tried plugging it to the wall
ram is in wrong obviously
that s one seriously high end potato it comes with its own heatsink
nice pc
have you tried restarting your rig
did you replace your thermal potato
it still runs cs go
sata ssd is bit rotted
ahh an eveonline machine
i see the problem you put your ram on the left side instead of the right
your potatoboard has gone from being overclocked to over cooked
bro you forgot your graphics card
is this what the sff community means by a sandwich case
don t feed this troll people they have been trolling posts just looking for attention
glados it s you
because you re not good at them
bro games are so unoptimized these days how can i not play cyberpunk at 4k
when i visited the uk they take that potato smother it with baked beans and then melt cheese on it actually quite a pleasant meal wont run games though d
hold on one second that would just make them render at a lower resolution increasing his frame rate the real answer is no dedicated gpu
she s not fat you moron
i hate that our workplace uses avaya still
how do you put your specs under your name
airflow looks i respect it
not discrete gpu
this pc suffers a benign gpu growth
sadly this is one of the more affordably priced gaming pc s in my metro i5 tb ssd 16gb or ddr4 and this tumor gtx most are asking for an ivy bridge or haswell with no gpu
if it works it s not wrong
dremel go brrrrrrrr
modern problems require modern solutions
this is what i should have done instead of buying a new case

i recently slapped a onto an old dell workstation i had to drill out a chunk of metal that was spot welded to the side panel for it to be able to close
kidding the look is awesome
quite obvious gpu in fact
i mean you could always case swap later down the road
how are you surviving off of a 1gb ssd man
where d you get the because thats actually one of the few cards actually available in a short form factor for small pcie slots the radeon is similarly powered and actually cheaper and has a low profile option too
how do you put your specs under your username
i5 was my first cpu i used it at 5ghz all core with modded bios on my z170 board upgraded it with a laptop es 9th gen i7 later because it was a cheap upgrade but i got no fps gains since i5 was more than enough for my gtx1060 i am sure it would pair well with gtx1650 as well
i fit an rx xt into my lenovo ideacentre
why swap out this masterpiece
then he has to re wire the front panel connectors
where the hell are you getting 1gb ssd from

thank you man d
sony be like but microsoft may give us bad ports
slaps in cyberpunk
i just started playing it and while it s running okay because my hardware is brute forcing it s way through it it s super apparent that the game is just really poorly ported there s still slowdown when going to new areas and it needs to stream in new assets the occasional glitchy graphics and the frame times are shit super disappointing port i ll revisit it after the large patch on friday to see if it actually fixes anything the annoying thing is while it s a good looking game it s not any better looking than many other titles that run perfectly fine i d say the graphics are roughly on par with ac valhalla from and that was also open world and didn t have these types of issues
unironically there s not that much bugs if you have enough vram the only bugs i saw was the scene where people became dripping wet when meeting marlene and people won t see you rip someone s throat out when stealthing until it s over but that feels more like a balancing thing the only big issue is the movement with how jank it is
what are the bugs like am i missing them
just let the shaders compile and turn the graphics on low if you don t have the vram then there are no bugs
everytime in the last few years this sub is convinced of something it s unequivocally proven wrong or flawed the ammount of games ive played and enjoyed on a 9600k while people with far better hardware cry over bugs or performance is astounding stick to the rgb you guys are dumb when it comes to technology
slap on company of heros
what are you people playing games with a potato i don t get it i haven t ran into any bugs in cyberpunk or the last of us
i ve had pretty much issues besides absolutely garbage frame rates and optimization crashes only happened once every hours specifically at random whenever a cutscene transistion happened 2700x ti and 32gb ram
slaps on ark survival evolved
i ve encountered zero on my but so many on my
points to cyber punk but i like this one
looks around wait a minute this is not starship troopers sorry all the bugs confused me
i feel horrible for people that had bad experiences with this port and had to refund but the nonstop sweating bug glitch is probably the funniest shit ever look it up if you haven t seen it
great story horrible gameplay
they will fix it in the remake remaster dont worry
i finally had it running decent after the last patch no frame issues and then it crashed in the middle of the second gun fight i quit playing til shit gets fixed
slaps in diablo3 launch
mf you have a anything will run well on your fucking pc stupid ass mf
tbh yeah i m still debating getting it in hopes brute forcing it however i think even at 1440p i d expect fps to be higher that just 90fps
5800x3d there is your problem
bro you have it will obviously run well
probs your pc then runs completely fine for me not a single issue
same fr
fr everyone complaining about shit fps and stutters but wtf do you expect if you don t let the shaders compile
i didn t encounter any bugs so neither should ve everybody else
i also never encountered any bugs in cyberpunk even on my old hardware
what are you running it with
gif giphy amdzmmcjzabsk
not really at 4k that cpu is perfectly fine the game is just poorly ported
it s the end users version of works on my machine
more like i ve encountered bugs so so has everyone else my frames are shit so so is everyone s on this sub
i7 8700k with a 3070ti pretty basic
don t worry about that one they are just miserable and need to have a reason to complain or find a reason to troll
you understand that there s less than a dozen gpus out there that beat yours right you re not pretty basic you re in the top
i am not the one experiencing problems with the game and my cpu isn t brute forcing it
pretty basic as in price they re like now a days
incase ya haven t noticed no one cares about your damn opinion now i m going to go ahead and block you so i don t get suspended from all of reddit again
dollars is considered basic
is a lot of peoples weekly income it s not basic
when a is still yeah
classic people who think since they have a ton of money to toss around they re better than others
no on is making only a week that would be minimum wage and as we all know you can t even afford rent with minimum you d be homeless if that s all you re making
credit card save up buy used also you have a 3080ti so wtf are you even talking about
a week is twice what minimum wage is i can tell why you act the way you do you don t know basic math
there are other parts of the world ya know not just fuckin america some people barely make a week and are expected to live off that so get off your god damn high horse and consider those facts ffs also learn to math right shit
i have a 3080ti but i don t act like i m better than others or others might have worse experiences than me get real acting like a card being isn t a big deal is a plague that needs to stop i was able to get a ti for a good price when the card prices got better last year for a short period i m not gonna tell people isn t a lot of money and they should just go buy the card or act like that s feasible
and here i was trying to be nice on reddit today and then ass clown there can t even consider that some people barely make enough to live on and still have some enjoyment in life seems to think a week is minimum wage
please show me where i said i was better than others is standard price for a basic ass card basic because a frickin cost more do you see do you understand is this thing on
he kinda looks like a troll from his account
what kind of sketchy sites you going to mate also get ublock origin
you sail the high seas of media piracy long enough you learn to sniff out the real link no matter the website
indeed i do
no it s the text link
just use non internet based file sharing protocols
op is clearly using a bad torrent site
yes we know
hyperlinked download x game gb text ftw
you need to find some new trackers op i ll pm you the few i use when i get home
magnet links for the winn
soooo where are the high seas nowadays
i thought that was a noose and upvoted then realized it probably wasn t and so took took my vote back
man must be using the shittiest sketchiest torrent sites known to the web to have this shit happening
ive heard a ton about it will definitely give it a try
the bandwidth of a station wagon full of ssds cannot be underestimated
a guy on a bike with a backpack full of ssds is probably faster for stupidily large file sizes than highspeed networking i was a bike messenger around we would often transport hard drives around brighton because it was faster than file sharing and a lot cheaper than installing the infra for high speed networking across town but i was talking more about bbs and ftp
1gb s down isn t uncommon for fiber that s still well over 100mb s
congrats welcome to high fps gaming
it should be a crime to sell those rtx 10gb when it s a totally different product to the rtx 12gb they don t even have the same amount of cuda cores
looks great dude
nice
hell yeah i remember the day i upgraded have fun
just get a 1080p monitor and you ll never need an upgrade again
my exact gpu congrats dude make sure to use msi afterburner to make a custom gpu fan curve as the default one is trash
i saw a pre owned same brand a few weeks ago but for i almost bought it i have rog strix 10gb it s been great i feel like others as the amd might be my next gpu
how much did it cost and what country
sad to see that 10gb vram hope u dont use raytracing on 1440p
nice
yep the 12gb performs almost identical to the ti like 3fps give or take stock for stock depending on the game
that s why you get an rx for cheaper if you will be gaming amd s gpus are really good they aren t good for video editing because they don t have those cuda cores
why in the world does the have more vram than the
just turn it off
no lhr op is getting into crypto mining s
for real nvidia is insane greedy i got a 12gb but if this nonsense doesn t stop i might go amd when it s time to upgrade in a few years
what is lhr
well i know my next card is going to be amd since nvidia has turned me off their greed would not be surprised that if i want years the rolls might flip
i do use linux how could you tell you told me those were the very first words you uttered when we met
dual booting aka to have your cake and eat it too
linus linux challenge throwbacks
ahh linus favorite linux distro drop _os
i enjoy linux and always have always had a dual boot setup but this is so true haha it was even worse back in the day oh you want functioning wifi let me just spend hours installing and configuring madwifi drivers and writing a shell script to initiate dhcp on boot every time
linux windows
making your cake so windows can eat it after an update because it didn t know what it was
absolutely
your partition my partition now
howdy partner i see ya got an empty partition right there i say we put that to some use
i m debating a 7900xtx to pair with my 5800x3d i d be upgrading from a
i d say it s definitely worth it if it fits within your budget the xtx stays super cool even under load and i came from a tuf ti so it is definitely a big and worthy upgrade
thats pretty sick man great job
that looks fuckin cool
amazing
goods good but might kill the rest of its clan so be careful
i like it
you ever think about getting a backplate for the gpu from v1 tech
damn did you machine those mangekyo sharingan fan cutouts that s sick man did you purposefully use obito s sharingan
this is so clean
bro where did you get those fan covers i need them in my life
thanks
i was thinking about it do they have ones that work for graphics cards with a flow through design i haven t looked into it much
i didn t make them since i don t have a 3d printer but i bought them off etsy i used obito s because honestly they look cooler than itachi s lmao
they might honestly from what i remember you have to select your gpu make and model when you re making an order so they can cnc it to match the cards profile
i was thinking that too they do look really cool
my inability to wait always causes me to nab that i9 before amd launches whatever flagship they have i d probably be all amd all the way if they launched at the same time
real question what is so bad with intel chips i always thought intel produced good processors
if you re getting a then watt difference isn t a big deal tbh
i think you ve discovered the true purpose of userbenchmark they just want to buy a 7800x3d for anyone interested https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/speedtest/2052977/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-16-core-processor](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/speedtest/2052977/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-16-core-processor) and also the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/11mr0ce/userbenchmark\_isnt\_happy\_about\_the\_new\_7950/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/11mr0ce/userbenchmark_isnt_happy_about_the_new_7950/))
i won t do it i care too much about gamers getting what they deserve the best gaming performance
lol raptor lake 13900k is better
shouldn t really need to do it in the us newegg had the 7800x3d in stock for about hours today not too bad for day
tn note plan means keikaku
i ve seen the 13700k go as low as so that on top of being a productivity workhorse and great single thread performance i don t think you are missing out on a ton but you are saving
my dad insisted on getting me an intel cpu because amd bad and now it s just disappointing that i will have like no upgrade path and have overall worse performance
i9 is better anyway so you will get a piece of mind knowing you purchased a better cpu that will handle all games with the highest frames and handle cpu intensive one including emulators
they are not bad sometimes they just aren t the best choice but the same goes to amd processors and no one said that intel cheaps are bad
they are great and certainly have their place in the industry they simply aren t the best for gaming in most applications at this moment you can t go wrong with their newest cpus just like amd but someone has to be on top and right now they simply aren t i expect they will be on top again with the series and then be neck and neck with the series vs amds series and on and on it goes there are details to this power consumption heat cooling all kinda wrapped up together pricing cost other items like motherboards optimal ddr5 ram speed and their costs blah blah blah but as a simple answer amd is just barely on top from a pure gaming performance standpoint
oh in general but absolutely in the laptop market intel was extremely stagnant for quite a while they repeatedly produced chips on the same architecture that were slightly more powerful while using way more energy and making too much heat
they are good just as always there will be intel or amd fanboys saying the other option is bad right now if you can the 7800x3d is the best option for a gaming cpu aside from that intel is still a good option
you seem to be linking to or recommending the use of userbenchmark for benchmarking or comparing hardware please know that they have been at the center of drama due to accusations of being biased towards certain brands using outdated or nonsensical means to score products as well as several other things that you should know you can learn more about this by seeing what other members of the pcmr have been discussing lately https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/search/?q=userbenchmark&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=). please strongly consider taking their information with a grain of salt and certainly do not use it as a say all about component performance if you re looking for benchmark results and software we can recommend the use of tools such as cinebench r20 for cpu performance and 3dmark s timespy a free demo is available on steam click download demo in the right bar https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3dmark/)), for easy system performance comparison i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r pcmasterrace if you have any questions or concerns
w
no it isn t it only needs way more energy for similar performance
spoken like s true user benchmark user
lol nope
holy shit m8 you are retarded
damn your dads a fanboy
poor you i hate it when people get me free shit that isn t exactly what i want
what modern cpu is struggling with emulators not necessarily doubting you because i don t know enough just surprised and curious
how much time did you spend reading userbenchmark reviews
well the 7950x3d beats the 13900k in most titles the 7800x is supposed to beat the 7950x while also being
rofl
a lot of people hated on this guy but from the thread as far as i can see he was vindicated one guy telling him he didn t know how to argument didn t help either
it s just what i understand from this subreddit it s mostly intel hate and amd praise i guess it s probably some quality price stuff that makes people hate love one or the other as long as my cpu is good enough for what i need at a price i am willing to pay i don t care that much
oh crap just to be clear i am in no way recommending them links were to a reddit post discussing their propaganda and a post to their website showing something any sensible person would immediately identify as lies
intel chips require more energy and heat because intel chips are more powerful a 13900k hits around 6ghz on its own as well as faster avx and sse4 instructions energy and heat arnt a problem when you got a good liquid cooler and psu like me a 13900k is the best cpu on the market right now rpcs3 performs better on intel than amd which is ultra demanding on the cpu
bro s on pure copium after this thread lmao
lol yep
you salty that 13900k is outperforming 7800x3d seems you need education in hardware mate
he is lying amd is the best with emulators now because amd is the best with avx now intel s newest cpu don t even have avx enabled do not take intel guys seriously anymore they are pretty distraught and resort to lying and bullshit there is nothing in the win column for intel
amd cant handle rpcs3 its the most intensive emulator out there its only 13900k is handling it at its best right now amd dont come close
not alot only when a new cpu comes out and if i need to compare it with other cpu s
right now people are pulling for the underdog it wasn t that long ago that amd was the answer only if you were on really tight budget constraints now they re really competing and pushing intel and themselves to huge innovation and so people are excited for that
it just depends r5 is the best for the price and the 5800x3d was the fastest gaming cpu when it released intel also makes fast cpus but when a few months pass and amd releases their x3d chips now they perform better for gaming am5 is guaranteed to be supported most likely as well this means you can save when upgrading your cpu by not having to buy a new motherboard as well
i don t really understand the praise amd gets because every major tech fab has shown consumers already they are willing to bend them over whenever possible some people are just into that i guess
that is for a good reason intel was very anti customer in the past
i never really saw a lot of amd in the cpu segment other than 5800x3d being a beast of a cpu and r5 being a great budget option as it was on pair with typically more expensive and sometimes even reached the price point of 12100f
i think it s a lot to do with the history of the companies for a very long time intel and amd were barely even considered competitors amd had better price performance at mid low prices but at the high enthusiast end they never could compete with intel that all changed in the last few years and now both companies are basically trading blows i think it s fair to say most people think this is good because competition should benefit the consumer and seeing the underdog make a comeback is always a good story which is probably where a lot of the intel hate comes from
it s just a bot any time userbenchmark is mentioned it warns people against their heavily biased comparisons good bot
my man is seriously bringing up the clock speeds in a cpu comparison lmao
7950x3d beats the 13900k with less energy and heat
no copium just flat out facts i show benchmarks you dont like it you hate simple as that lmao

you were asking can you use hdmi and dp at same time and i need education thats fun
you sure about that just stop lying https://hothardware.com/news/this-is-the-best-cpu-for-emulating-ps3-games-according-to-rpcs3)
bruh what i run rpcs3 on a 12700k and its totally fine
well that explains it
explains everything lol
yep explained
the main result of intel s anti consumer monopolistic like practices is high cost but amd has approached and finally exceeded intel s high cost
he ll be linking userbenchmark comparisons next
i use amd but 13900k is better for pure fps whereas 7950x3d beats it in all other things
it dont it falls behind the 13900k especially in single thread performance cope more amd fanboy amd gpu s even fall behind nvidia amd s best graphics card cant match or exceed a either pay less get less lmao
nah benchmarks don t tell the whole story the 13900k typically comes out on top but that doesn t mean it s a more impressive cpu the 7800x3d almost matches the i9 and occasionally destroys it in games that take advantage of the extra cache and it s a shit ton cheaper and uses watts max the 13900k uses you can cool the 7800x3d with a freakin stock cooler while the i9 throttles with an nh d15 in other words on top of the already insane price you need to spend or more on a decent aio for the i9 not to mention the much higher psu requirement so no it s not as simple as that triple the power draw and over more for a gain of a few percent in some games and massive losses in others is a terrible proposition even if money doesn t matter to you the extra heat and power draw could affect other components and make it impossible to build in a sff case
yeah you do need some education it seems your also jealous of my monster rig
that article isnt correct in fact that cpu struggles with metal gear solid but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pjzho\_udvq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pjzho_udvq) x200b do i need to say more lmao
it wasn t just that it was a bit more to it
i was about to send a skull emoji that s how much emotion it got out of me
this really depends on the game far cry intel all the way esports generally amd from simulated benchmarks after doing all the annoying tweaking the x3d chips require to function optimally the 7800x3d will be the fastest gaming cpu just how the 5800x3d was the best even compared to the 12900k gaming strictly for multi core it depends on the application while the 13900k ks generally gets better cinebench scores some programs favor amd or favor intel best to look at the programs and games you use and decide which cpu wins most of the time
intel is cheaper as well
amd has better multi core performance and they re the better gaming chips you need a fucking lake to cool an intel cpu amd has way better value than intel cope more intel fanboy and amds gpus are better value than ngreedia
i mean we know a 7900xtx won t beat a nobody ever said it would but it s also less amd graphics cards aren t trying to be the best they are trying to be the best value for the money a 6800xt beats a any day even tho they are both rt is irrelevant since barely anyone uses it except people with gpus
just sounds like you enjoy cheap hardware with cheap coolers not my issue 13900k is on top no matter what you say 13900k smokes the 7800x3d easy
haha is a monster rig ok peasant
boy while you mind basics im building custom loops
yet again you make a claim but don t show a comparison so that video is meaningless
https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/compare/intel-core-i9-13900ks-vs-amd-ryzen-9-7900x3d/m2000819vsm2053257](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/compare/intel-core-i9-13900ks-vs-amd-ryzen-9-7900x3d/m2000819vsm2053257) x200b 13900ks vs 7900x3d as you can see the 13900k smokes it
if you enjoy low clock speeds buy amd clock speeds make a world of difference but i already mentioned that the 13900k has better avx and sse4 performance than amd got a 5900x once never going amd again lmao
that s also true you do need a 420mm arctic aio and a boat for a case to cool that cpu 7950x responds well to undervolting oc making it easier cheaper to cool
lmao no they dont have better multicore performance amd s clock speed arnt even as high as most intel chips a 13900k at 6ghz scores higher in multicore workload in cinebench than most ryzen cpu s amd cant squeeze speeds as high as intel it took amd years to reach 5ghz plus most games favour intel and nvidia combo hardware nvidia arnt greedy you get what you pay for amd has no card on par with a and the just completely eclipses any card right now on the market if you have a 13900k and rtx with 64gb ddr5 6000mhz nothing from amd will come close amd are best suited for console hardware
talking about cheap hardware when you have a 10900k and the 13900k doesn t smoke a 7800xed easy it s close but it shouldn t be since the 13900k costs so much more and uses a shit ton more power
lol my series x is more powerful than your alienware pipe down young man
your building lego blocks be quiet you aint got a knowledge to build a pc anothe alienware pleb
who still owns a in should be on the by now

holy shit this mf linked userbenchmark
no way you just linked user benchmark xd
nice troll lol
couldn t care less honestly but thanks for making my day fanboyinsm is funny
yes clock speeds are totally the only thing that matters that s also why everyone knows amd fx chips with their high flock and core count are still among the best cpus ever
well shit why can t we use that intel celeron d at 36ghz tho
clock speed isn t everything you know and the xtx is better than a
ive owned many intel processors and each generation they completely stomped ryzen i never exceed 65c on my aio under max load even during an avx prime95 workload for hours sounds like you need to upgrade your cooling situation cant imagine anyone who doesnt have water cooling or liquid cooling in
uses more power because its a better cpu unlike the low powered shitty amd 7800x3d
very powerful cpu actually better than your garbage 5800x3d least my cpu can actually go past 5ghz and handle emulators better
cheap hardware is amd amd is whats used inside consoles
what alienware
that s not the emulation that your argument was for though so what s your point all you ve proved is that you have no idea how to have an argument and to stay on topic
how does a csgo comparison prove that the i9 performs better in mgs4 on rpcs3
amazing getting 100fps on top of 600fps for and additional watts all this benchmark shows it is really doesn t matter which cpu you chose because both will fill out your monitor
so you pick basically one of few games that doesn t benefit from the 3d cache to compare for the 7950x outperforms the v cache chips too in those instances at no point did you offer any real comparison of amd series vs intel 13th gen for emulation just a video of some dude playing mgs on a 13900k
i have that same keyboard i like the monitor the first pc that i had that was all mine was a compaq good memories of jedi knight dark forces ii wasn t very good at it never beat it but it was exciting at the time crt are getting more difficult to come by these days
this setup is hype if and only if you got some old school blizzard games and sim city and some command conquer
aaaah so many hours in doom heretic slim work jim chips challenge claw and decent
looks nice and dandy but what are the specs points if it has 3dfx
burh the 1900s were a wild time mouse and keyboard on different planes haha
insane
yes
its calling they want to talk with you
i love it what processor is it running

bro the series graphics look bomb
ibm
this brings back some great world of warcraft memories remember dedicating full days off to raids raid nights with pizza were so fun
i d play ultima online so hard on that
member when sound cards were a thing
i guess you don t watch porn good for you
you can try again it s like bucks on steam brings back memories also makes me feel old
does fallout count
zomg a voodoo would be baller in this
my ibm has built in sound yep
only if you immediately claim fallout are trash games and go all nma on the franchise
hey fallout van buren isn t trash
how do y all function with keyboards like that in your face
real life rainbow cat
honestly my living room is quite dark so the lighting is a bit amplified but honestly i don t even notice it when i m gaming
just ignore it or better yet you just don t notice it after awhile my keyboard is bright as all hell but i don t notice it unless i m directly lookin at it
so you either force yourself to ignore it or don t notice it why have it
pretty color and me like key sound
i m a simple woman who like colours it s honestly a nice contrast to my very dull set up i think anyone who has chosen to keep the colourful rgb doesn t have a problem with it
why remove the ram sticks to let dust get in your slots
went from ashy to classy
is that before or after
pc was doing meth instead of math
well you will have a busy day
was that used in the movie scarface
do you deserve to own a pc though
i covered them before cleaning
yeah my first pass is usually everything still plugged in before i deep dive
yeah i figured i only needed to clean where the fan blades were
yeah i figured i only needed to clean where the fan blades were
i dropped my side panel on tiles and nothing happened steel side panel enjoyer
i have no idea how people manage to do this are they just casually throwing their side panels around
side panels are made of tile
like how ever post i have seen the computer is right next to the pile of glass suggesting they broke while on it but how your case has feet doesn t it it stands like half as inch off the floor
when will they learn to take them off without breaking them is my question y all just manhandle shit till it breaks or you break something else
it always makes it s rounds again
carpet gang rise up
it s a desktop not a floortop put it on your desk
this is why i made sure my side panal was acrylic
or it s close cousin picture of a monitor with several caliber bullet holes can i fix this or
got me on first half take an upvote
i dropped my side pannel and it dented the floor there s only one type of flooring that dents when objects are dropped on it
because of physics stuff glass panels apparently break very easily if placed on ceramic floor tiles like a light tap is enough to shatter them
i didn t know that that is strange
no tempered glass does not break from a light tap unless it has manufacturing defects tempered glass is brittle like any glass but it s still far stronger than regular glass if you took a window pane from your house out of the frame and dropped it on a hard surface it would break far more easily than a tempered glass window from a pc case i m sure in some instances people got some pc cases where there was already damage to the glass or a manufacturing defect but in most instances it s just carelessness the problem is that tile floors are very hard so they don t flex hardly at all if you drop or roughly set down the pc in a way that sends a shock into a very small portion of the case that energy transfers quickly into a small section of the glass which causes it to shatter because that s what tempered glass does it s very strong but once it reaches the breaking point at any point it shatters completely into small pieces which is actually a good thing because then you don t have glass blades lying all over the place pcs use tempered glass because it s stronger than regular glass and doesn t break into artery severing pieces when you drop it the alternative is laminated glass which i assume isn t used because nobody wants to have a pc viewing window full of chips and spider web cracks it s kind of the middle ground you drop it it shatters but it doesn t break into foot slicing shards and if you ding it here and there it doesn t collect damage over time like laminated glass can until it just deforms badly enough to fall out completely
tempered glass is weakest on the edges in exchange for being super strong on the face and ceramic tile doesn t flex in the slightest bit so the single tap is enough to shatter the tile
no tempered glass does not break from a light tap unless it has manufacturing defects completely wrong years ago i was moving a tempered glass section for a table which is significantly thicker and stronger than any pc panel and put it as gently as possible on the ground to adjust my slipping grip and guess what it evaporated as soon as it made contact with the ground the amount of force i used to set it down was like a gentle touch and it didn t make a difference if you set glass on a hard surface at the edge it ll shatter regardless of whether or not it s tempered because it s weakest at the edge and because the floor in these cases is harder than the glass itself it ll be put under stress as if to try flexing but because it s so brittle it can t and it just blows up
tempered glass is weak to a concentrated shock from any angle because you only have to break the exterior layer to cause the interior layer to explode but it s still far stronger than regular glass so it s disingenuous to say it s weak or breaks easily the interior portion of a tempered glass panel is always pushing out on the exterior layer and the exterior layer is always pushing in if you shock the exterior layer sufficiently to break it that equilibrium is broken and the stored energy in the internal layer causes an explosion across the entire internal panel that s sort of the trick here it s a dramatic explosion when it breaks because that interior bit is always pushing out anyway destroying that exterior container just lets it loose the reality is if you had a regular glass panel it would break under the same and far less stress it just wouldn t explode into small pieces it would crack into large sharp shards and fall onto the floor in finger slicing chunks tempered glass is far stronger than regular glass it just doesn t deform if you drop your steel cover on its corner a hard floor it dents and it s ugly and you can sort of hammer it back into shape so it still fits if you drop your tempered glass cover on its corner on a hard floor it explodes and is permanently destroyed that s just how different materials work you could absolutely have even tougher glass it s just that when you drop it on the corner you d get a huge bullet or spider web chunk in it and then we d have slightly different posts bitching about what happens when you aren t careful with your vanity covers
completely wrong https://i.redd.it/bmwc48o0resa1.gif i literally took my tempered panel off my prebuilt junk pc and tapped it on my garage floor not minutes ago i just wish i could easily post the mp4 so you could hear the sound
then this is just a case of physics being weird because the table surface in question was about a half an inch thick and was surprisingly heavy for its size i tapped it about as gently as you did and it exploded immediately with no warning so rather than either of us being wrong both of us are occasionally right depending on the exact glass panel in question i guess
no that s just how tempered glass works the thickness of the entire plate doesn t matter tempered glass has two layers an exterior layer that presses in and an interior layer that flexes out if the exterior layer is breached the entire plate explodes if you had a tempered glass anything that suddenly shattered for seemingly no reason when you set it down the exterior layer was almost certainly damaged when the exterior layer breaks the interior layer explodes outward because it s always exerting that outward pressure against the external layer that exerts a contracting force against it this doesn t make tempered glass weak the perception that tempered glass is weak is due to the explosive nature of its failure when it fails it explodes spectacularly when regular glass breaks though it just cracks into pieces in a boring way tempered glass is still much stronger than regular glass it just doesn t deform like steel the upshot for pc building is that if you drop a tempered glass panel it may explode in spectacular fashion while a steel panel just dents
just posted my build cause it uses a case which is rarely seen here thought you guys might like it
wow great how do you run a with just one power cable
what are those fans
nice oven
damn i love the look of this thing
tron case
hows the temps
can you link me the case please
i ve got the same case and no temp problems at all cpu and gpu are at degrees
how much it cost
it looks great probably has just enough airflow since the side is ventilated
rarely seen because the air doesn t go anywhere what a hit box
not op but it is the adapter cable it splits into power cables from the nvidia pin connector edit i stand corrected op has a psu that has the connector comment will remain to add to my wall of shame
my psu be quiet straight power comes with the right cable 12vhpwr
the front fans come with the h7 elite the case also comes with a rear fan but this is sadly a cheap one 3pin and quiet loud so i replaced it for a be quiet sw4 pwm and it is a major difference in a positive way
thanks much appreciated i m obviously a sucker for the tinted look they could have tinted the glass even more but having the rgb brightness at around does the trick as well
fine cpu around in gaming gpu max noise is mostly fine in gaming it is quiet or reasonable noise level but yeah in cinebench you can have that jet engines lol i d say the bad reputation for h7 elite is bit misleading because you got the flow in the same series temps are fine for me but yeah you can squeeze out a couple of degrees with a different case with better airflow no doubt
link https://nzxt.com/product/h7-elite)
yeah we both got the meme build lol
tbh it is not that bad it is a couple of degress worse than the h7 flow i liked the design more got a good price i can live with the fact that i sacrificed degrees for a case design i actually like to each their own case
go with a less aggressive fan curve to cut down on noise because it looks like you ve got 40c of wiggle room before you hit tjmax and start throttling ignore all the clowns in here trying to dunk on you about airflow and temps as it literally makes no difference so long as your performance isn t being constrained by thermals
idk the meme build d
maybe compared to the flow compared to a proper case we re talking about degrees celsius makes a lot of difference in terms of noise levels as well when you can run your fans half the speed
a proper case for gaming the temps and noise levels are fine also a bit of video editing also fine if i would push all the components all the time to the absolute limit then yes this case would be a subpar choice for my usage and aesthetic preferences it is perfect
i mean this and boy right here probably has better airflow take out the foam inserts infront of the external drive ebay and you ve got space for another fan grab a fan air filter and ya all set https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-m&q=antec+1100&tbm=isch&sa=x&ved=2ahukewiqs4a8h5b-ahvrkikehtwba38q0pqjegqibxab&biw=432&bih=835&dpr=2.5#imgrc=y74qfymsikt7-m though ascetic wise it looks like a black brick of a tank _  _
there s a small vent on the front on the standard nzxt cases which of course leads to intake limitation tests https://youtu.be/mt27lucbjmi) say otherwise https://youtu.be/nc9kzetj4rs) the flow would ve been a better option
judging by your house and setup it s worth it
days dude
every single hour
show me your pay stub and i ll quit my job right fucking now and work for you
haha that won t happen only thing i ll say learn a trade that will always be needed and get really good at it
i hate that a simple one piece connector hasn t been developed yet
these are fine but what pisses me off is usb plugs i ve bent two different boards pins was able to bend them back and broken another boards pins i hate that zero tolerance connector soooooo much
laughs in actually reading the manual
even as a fairly experienced builder i still hate those especially on smaller builds
they re literally fucking labelled
really had no difficulty with it the worst for me was puting the motherboard and the screw also the cable management that is horrible because if my choice of case
i ve been building pcs for years for the first time in nearly a decade i am building a new pc for my self i am honestly considering paying microcenter their fee to assemble the pc for me so i don t have to deal with this shit especially since my eyesight has been on the decline i now have to wear bifocals
connect power switch and leave the rest if you ever need to restart via the button or need the leds from power or hdd i will personally come to connect them but you won t nobody does on a regular pc
i used an o11 dynamic evo case for my newest build and it has all the front io connectors together in one block
nzxt ftw
these are easy just read the manual and put on a headlamp so you can see where things go
what scares me is that every time i build repair upgrade a pc and i press the button nothing happens which always costs me years of my life then i switch on the power supply every single time
read
oh no if only the parts would come with a manual
it s really not that hard
a pair of forceps makes putting those in a hell of alot easier for those who have meathooks and sausage fingers like me
i ve always put these on with the motherboard out and sitting on top of the case hook these up and a few other cables then screw down the board and connect with rest
weirdly i had no issues the power of proper mobo labels
most boards mark where they go now don t they y all need some glasses
read the manual read the manual read the manual read the manual read the manual
why is there so much hate towards this connector recently a lot of new builders in the sub as a veteran i too wish there was a unified connector but it s easy enough without it
i don t know how people have to much trouble with this it is as simple as reading the handbook and plugging them in it it tells you right tf there
just rtfm did that was patient front panel connectors correct first time
anyone who complains about this is from a weak bloodline and wont survive the coming winter
is this really pcmr subreddit
i don t like nzxt but they have made this a single connector
do all mobos not come with a block with labels that all these plug into and then you plug the block into the mobo theres one on my asus z97 a from and i just thought it was a standard thing
the power button
what is that thing and why is this sub suddenly so obsessed with it
the fact that front panel connectors on motherboards have been standardized for more than a decade and people still post these low effort memes is just funny
i feel like a lot of the things that connect to the mobo could be modernized i ve been building for years and nothing has really changed
you really only need to connect power sw my case doesn t even have a reset button and i never understood waht the led connectors are for
only of these matter
am i writing saying that if you screw this up you brick your pc
i ve built several and i still hate those things
i custom built probably computers for work in my lifetime and that thing still scares me that and led lighting configurations
i built my first computer last christmas can confirm
i have only power and reset connected others are useless
who s the menace who downvoted everyone in the replies lol
i am on this picture and i don t like it
as someone who built their pc for the first time this is relatable had my friend come in and do the wiring for me i was able to do the rest for the most part
just standardize the pin placements already
story time i have a year old b550 gaming plus and the front cables attached to the top right side of the mobo then i put my metal cased bluray player in the top slot of the front four months later my computer refused to start when i clicked the power button i had to click times for the comp to start and sometimes more if i removed and reinserted the power cable i could get away with five clicks finally i have had enough and i open the comp with flashlight and tweezers to look things over and wouldn t you know it the bluray reader s metal back corner is pushing against two of the front cables logically the power button cable and something more somehow there was an electric connection between the bluray player and the front power cable can t see how but it was either the bluray or it was that the bluray player pushed two of the front cables together so that those two short circuited regardless i immediately ripped the bluray player out because let s face it i never use it anyway and haven t had a problem since to all of you building a new comp make damned sure nothing you stick into the top slot of the computer pushes against something on the mobo
i have built around computers over the years and it still takes me an average of minutes to plug these bad boys in
i fear that you are trying to make fun of a valid point
i just plug the power switch
i just plug the power connector i don t need crap dangling from the top of my pc and the power led doesn t match the rgb lights
the only time i actually had to read that paper thing that came with the motherboard still confused and had to end up googling and hoping some youtube video had it
screams in big meaty claws it wouldn t have been so bad if i didn t forget to pin them after installing my old 5600xt brick that case was annoying in an endearing way
look at the evolution of all the interconnects in the case and outside and then look at this i understand why it hasn t changed but from an end user point of view it s a really shit thing to deal with
for me it was literally every wire
this and pin connector stuck to motherboard
1st time builder try with 57th time builder still hate those cables with a burning passion
i ve build like pcs the last have been same mobo and i still look at the manual the thought of shorting something out freaks me i still forget the i o shield
i hooked up the power switch and nothing else
i jumped out of my seat when i saw that thing i think i might get nightmares
my 2nd pc i ended up shorting my psu with those cables and had to buy a new one
i can t turn my pc off with the button but i can turn it on so that s all i need lol
it wasn t a problem for me i just looked at the labels on the motherboard and shorted the pins with a spoon i just never figured it out
this is the only reason why i m not yet upgrading yeah i m lazy but it s crazy that years already and this io has not be improved or standardized
this is he hardest part of pc building
he clearly hasn t tried to plug in the usb plug yet
i hate these what a pain to connect
i have build many pcs over the years and that still scares me
every single damn time
io shield
the pins for my power button came off and it sucks getting them back in it s just loose wire
on my last build from like years ago i plugged in the power switch wrong and just used the button on the mobo until like last month it s in a p7 thermaltake so it s open for me to reach my hand in and hit the button
gif giphy wze1ilapmonxi
yeah ngl i hate cpu cable tight placement more than this
they are fine except the led and led they are god awfull to plug in a true nightmare
i think i installed them wrong the power led flashes constantly this has been a problem for a few moths now
having big hands is a curse with these little shits
the thing i panicked with on first build was handling my gpu all i was thinking about is that it s an expensive part that i m somehow going to break
just built my first pc about a month ago and while i wasn t scared i wad thrown off because you just slip the shroud on the pin and boom done i expected a click or something letting me know it was on and secure but nope lol
phone light crouch down piece of piss
so happy to have a case that only has a power switch able
for me the scary part was the rgb cable management of the aio gosh
literally the first build i did years ago i did everything right except i missed the power switch and had to bring it to a friend to fix for me
i ve built more than one pc and still get them wrong the first time then i go check the manual for the umpteenth time
the funny part is that these are all optional and comes in this format while the power supply cables are ready to plug you can use a metal piece to start your pc
i forgot to wire up my fan rgb and i m too scared to go back and do it lmao
easy just plug the power sw one into some random two posts and press the power button on your tower if it doesn t boot up then try some other post until it does
putting that in with tweezers after the fact is infuriating lesson learned now i make sure it s done before adding gpu and other cables
hyte y40 has a single block connector it s quite lovely
if only they are all in one piece
my lian li lancool case had these as one block for any other 1st builders who want to simplify this part
the layout differs per mfr same cables different places to connect
i need them to be labeled from and that is it i dont want to know the name of each item just number them
well i have built or computers but never managed to put backshield successfully
literally me trying to convert a mac pro to an atx ryzen build
this isn t even i o that would be stuff like front usb and headphone mic jacks i o is input output and power reset buttons and leds are not that
there was a time pc cases had sockets like that for usb ports i installed a port incorrectly and it fried my ipod nano
i d agree it s probably the hardest part of building a pc unless you do liquid cooled or have bad luck like me but it s still easy and yet to have an issue
when i tell people i can build computers this is what i mean i can do when i say i can do this i mean i read the mobo manual
argb cables
front panel audio was bad but usb was evil when it was pins
some motherboards are poorly labeled imo
i put it wrong weeks ago almost had a heart attack
i hate mounting the cpu and cooling fan on top of it more than i hated this
so you re saying it s already time to build yourself another pc
our setup
hey babe im off to work gf grunts hours later hey babe im back gf grunts still on character creation still in pj s
speaker placement lol
those yamahas are actually supposed to be vertical i know it s a popular thing to leave them horizontal but even yamaha themselves put it in the packaging that they re not designed for horizontal dispersion
why did you take a picture of my girlfriend
well if she is anything like my wife she will play for days straight then not play sims for months
are you the guy who bought his wife a to play sims seems like the logical solution to the problem
as you ask her when she ll be done she gestures vaguely towards the nintendo switch in the corner without turning around
happy wife happy life
ok but it makes a big difference if the monitors are pointed at your ears a big difference
grounds for divorce
are thise yamaha ns10 s
this is why virtualization exists
what state do you live in
i like that case
that looks like a bugatti chiron going km h
many levels of irony here
is that the asus oled
aah shit time to get another
what light bars are those
is that a corsair obsidian 1000d case nice
i often walk into my office gaming space to see my yr old on that exact same screen doing that exact same thing
i like your posture very relatable
why is it always sims do girls only play sims
i built my first pc and immediately used my prebuilt i had for my gf to use since then its been upgraded in every aspect to the point where she has some newer better hardware than i do its been really fun to keep updating and reuse parts that i replace when i upgrade my pc she has my and 5600x which is just fine for sims and club penguin lol
i put my geforce gt to my high school girlfriend s family pc so she could play sims eventually sims every time i think about how happy we both were i wish i could go back to the time where i watched her play sims for hours while we sat in an arm chair together she would kill my character off in a pool as a joke cause i can t swim irl lol
i can understand this i can t understand why people lose their pcs to a housecat
this means you have a reason to build another one
that s why you have to make
yes
the sims too lol you ain t getting that back
is this what the sims game looks like
or build a second system in the current case i have but that s less fun

communism enters the chat
r suddenlycommunist
this is painfully true how do they spend hours making a single character i ll never understand don t get me started on decorating the house weeks
not sure i understand is there a problem here
hey buddy that s my wife you re talking about
not me but apparently i am now
pretty sure hs5s
mentally i wish i knew
not sure why i got down voted i was asking so i could give advice on what to do regarding the theft different states have different laws
i think that s a corsair 1000d it s gigantic
everybody hits rush hour eventually
it s the pg42uq
they are the govee glides
well it s her fault nothing you can do shrugs lol
go for a used budget build and challenge yourself
r pccommunism
communism and marriage are very similar actually
whenever a game has character creation i challenge myself to create the most fucked up creature imaginable
they should not be on their side
our wife
the woofers look to big for hs5s
ahhh op means stolen as in his girlfriend stole it from him by using it instead of him being able to use it
ah ok it looked a bit to big for but i wasn t sure anyways sick setup
youd have a field day with ark survival evolved the character creator is so fucked up also i noticed we have similar specs nice is yours a laptop
to give an actual explanation placing a speaker on its side creates an unequal distance between your ear and the components this means that the sound from the woofer and the sound from the tweeter arrive at your ear slightly out of phase this can cause small distortions in the sounds and make certain frequencies sound muddied
there s also hs7 and hs8 but seems small for anyways definitely not ns and these new yamahas are meant to be in upright position and not sideways like the ns s
ooooh shit well i feel dumb now lol here i was assuming someone broke into his house and took his setup
yeah mines a laptop there s actually a higher speced version which used amd crossfire between a dedicated gpu and apu but i just have the base version
they should just be slightly rotated towards the listener then it would be fine no slight delays then right
these are the hs7s i have an hsh8 sub but i don t want to disturb my neighbors in the units next to my apartment
what laptop model is it it would be funny if they were the same or similar
no the speakers here are not designed to be placed horizontally but vertically no matter which way you move them when they are on their sides you will have phasing you can get them to where there s only a little bit of cancellation but you are still hindering the full capability of the speaker because you would not be using it as it is designed yamaha actually puts the correct orientation and speaker placement in their manual for these speakers
my bad i ve got hs7s also your screen is bigger than mine i think so they look smaller by comparison
this one https://www.notebookcheck.net/lenovo-ideapad-z50-75-notebook-a10-7300-review-update.132461.0.html us the wierd dual gpu type i talked about the one i have is difficult to find as it seems every one of them is slightly different
also it would cause your sweet spot to be incredibly small and any movement of your head forward or back will put you outside of it
oh mines is an hp not a lenovo they were close enough specced that i though they d be similar
man all these posts about people finding great finds at the thrift shops turning me into macklemore
but does it work
damn what a steal
they finally opened a new bin store near me after the old one closed people don t quite know about it yet so i m hoping to score some stuff like this so far i ve only found a pcie graphics riser for and my wife got a heating pad
the bomb has been planted
exact unit i have in mine it s been great really quite and not a single power issue
bought one of these new just a few months ago jelly for sure
wow seems a pretty solid deal to me sign me up for one
not pc related but i found this fountain pen at a bin store looked it up and they sell for about https://preview.redd.it/tqwglj0ul9sa1.jpeg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4fc156b9dbfdb59495d2bed0db3b3014acef424
whats a bin store where do i find one
we stan evga psus
i went to the thrift store and found a 4gb ddr3 stick of ram for
psu is one of those things i wouldn t risk at least not for premium components maybe for a media center living room pc but who would need 850w for that lol
you have a little plastic tab next to your rug
i mean it s a nice box and all but
kaboom
got the same when i built my pc a year ago that s a steal
hey i have one of these sitting in my closet yes it works but i got a 1000w as part of troubleshooting
i have a b5 series bronze evga power supply i m returning it for an asus rog strix gold because of unbearable coil whine tried this gold too the fan is unbearably loud for me but no coil whine and the price point of is fucking amazing
what is a bin store and do they them in the uk
wtf i just bought this like a few weeks ago for significantly more
one near me posts pics a day in advance and after they restock on the first day of the week saw a damn rtx in the bins for after the restock
bro ain t know wayyyyyw
definitely a good deal my 750w supernova g2 is almost years old and working like a champ
i had this psu when the 3080s came out it tripped the ocp all the time evga replaced it with a different line
bin store being like big lots of a thrift store
what a steal
don t believe it for a second
kaboom yes rico kaboom
for those who don t know bin stores are basically resale stores for items that got returned to places like amazon walmart etc that are still brand new in the package and then get sold at a discounted rate to make a profit where i m at there s one that starts at dollars for every item in the bin and as the week progresses it drops down in price until wednesday they re closed on thursday in my area where it s cents per item remaining
damn nice box
that could blow up your pc
a perfectly normal seeming psu is not something i want to thrift it s like picking up a hitchhiker in the 70s everything seems normal then bam shits goin down
good give it to me now
i have the same one well i hope i still have it and my girlfriend didn t drop off my pc at goodwill
gif giphy z9ie1spaptylk
that s a shit ton of money for a psu box
tread carefully with that no one knows what its been through lol
yeah psu is one thing i would not buy second hand since it can fry the entire system
the power supply is literally the only thing i would never ever buy second hand lol
that s a very expensive box
overpriced for a cardboard box
but does it work
seems expensive for a box
didn t know you can buy bombs
kaboom
i wouldnt dare to install that to my pc if it goes wrong you can say goodbye to your pc
of all the things i wouldn t take a chance on power supply has to top it there just has to be something wrong with it to be that price used refurbished something
and how much did you pay for your renter s insurance
i d never plug this in
i wonder how it got there and ended up selling for dollars
is it empty
box only right
they had a in my store and i was like ehhh
they had a in my store and i was like ehhh
is that bucks just for the empty box lol if it came with the psu why didn t you buy the whole lot

two things you never buy used when building your own pc x200b power supply and motherboard both if have issues can damage multiple components and cause chaos
deleted
hope it s not just the box
i m going thrifting this weekend
fyi this series had a manufacturing defect in its early models that was only fixed a bit later after the series came out mine had that defect which caused it to shut down with any power consumption spikes evga customer support helped me out and replaced the part
what s a bin store
might as well have stolen it
amazing deal especially with psu prices for whatever reason remaining high for a new b tier psu is a steal
saw something similar at one by me but the box was new and the psu was similar but nongold 80plus older unit
is there a psu inside or is it just the box
its full of bees
awesome find
i got a decent monitor and an msi water cooler from a bin store and a ton of other stuff those places are actually half decent if you have the time to look
hot damn
just last week i found a triple monitor mount hidden in the corner of a hood will for 10usd and i had extra monitors laying around i now have a triple monitor setup
i d be iffy bout a psu test before plugging it in just in case
you should see how cheap you could make a pc from bin store finds
if the fan starts revving or being loud try turning off eco mode
what s a psu doing at a bin store did u get the bin u wanted
fuck dude score
i never see good deals at thrift stores anymore the ones near me know when they have good stuff and put them in a glass display case and mark them up
talk about a steal
oh nice i ll give you for it double your money
how much would you have bought it for
why can t i have stores like that where i live i hate where i live
hell yeah got lucky myself and got this from a friend who got it in a bundle but had no use for it
steal
nice find
tektronix in beaverton oregon made professional oscilloscopes one wire too short it was sent to the bargain shop damn did we get some cheap odd stuff
what a steal
what s a bin store
literally gold
lucky bastard i got the 550w version for they are pretty good but some older models don t work the best paired with the series gpus i would do anything to have that one for that price
i use this to power my rig
i got the same one for on amazon it s a great power supply
last week at a goodwill i found an empty 750w ps box for
hey been needing a new one i ll buy off ya lmao
some much for paying for a evga p6 850w on the back to school sale still love my psu tho
would be really nice if my country would have those thrift stores
nice
damn
hey that s my power supply it s served me well
oh neat a bomb
all of the tools to identify the drives and take them offline are located in the pre install environment to get to it when booting to the windows install usb you just select repair this computer then in the menu options you select open cmd prompt easy here cmd prompt remove quotations type diskpart hit enter type list disk hit enter see disks pick one type select disk hit enter or w e disk you want to see type detail disk to take a disk offline after you typed list disk type type select disk hit enter or whichever disk you want to take offline type offline detail disk and offline online is the cmd you are lacking knowledge of no more having to unplug everything lol
i always unplug all other physical drives when performing a fresh install anyway takes hardly any time and there can be no accidents of selecting the wrong drive to format install to even if i trust i m being careful i don t trust windows to copy a worthy quote from a former president it applies with windows as well never underestimate ms s ability to f things up
i have sata drives and when i ve upgraded my ssds i ve always done a clean install of windows i ve never had to unplug my two hdd or my two ssds
the windows installer to my knowledge hasn t changed all that much since windows vista in this nuisance is old enough to drive yet is this problematic
sorry should probably have clarified what i m talking about there s a windows installer bug where if you have multiple sata drives connected in some cases windows will fail to install it appears what s actually happening is that in some cases the windows installer will mix up the drives and install some parts onto a different drive resulting in the installation failing one of the quick and dirty ways of fixing and getting around this issue is by just unplugging all sata drives if you re installing onto a sata drive like i m doing in this case you only have that drive plugged in as far as i know this is only to do with sata drives and the installer has no issues with multiple nvme drives i appreciate the help with finding which drive is which but the piece of paper in the picture helped also i didn t notice that it was showing the names of the drives in the partition selection menu lol didn t need to make a note for process of elimination i m blind sometimes
yea basically what i do if i m building a new pc now but in some cases i m just reinstalling windows in this case i was trying to install windows on a specific sata ssd to test if an issue that i was previously having has been fixed
once again it s completely unnecessary to physically do this
yea the bug doesn t seem to affect everyone but it s common enough that if you google the issue you ll find others reporting it and suggesting to unplug the drives you re not installing windows on didn t know that it was only sata drives until i watched a jayztwocents video and he mentioned the issue
yup and taking the drive offline via cmd prompt is a quick and easy way to get around that if it happens
you re right it is unnecessary until windows has a glitch putting all your faith in software vs hardware selecting something in software shouldn t jump and accidentally select a different drive physically unplugging it it can t the difference between shouldn t and can t but to each their own quite appropriate given there was a user not long ago who was trying to get their lost data back after the wrong drive was formatted likely user error even so this step would ve prevented that entirely what was unnecessary was losing their data takes 2min tops to unplug other drives physically
one time i did encounter an issue it was the first time i upgraded to a ssd and i had two os s and the pc did have a brain fart trying to decided which one to boot off
ahhh i see now could try that next time thanks
seems like what the issue is described from jayz is that when windows starts installing it gets the drives confused and starts putting shit on a different drive and then you ll get the failed to install message
at first i was like that s a cool camo design then i was like ew damn if it s that dusty on the outside
that s some really nice copper oxide there
did he bring it in to show you tell me he isn t asking what s wrong with it what are those lifting struts going to
leadership gamer
that s a cool looking case doe
piss on it yourself it might improve
i can smell it through my phone
cat didn t approved it so pissed on it
aye fuck cats lol my cat likes to leave land mines in random places and more specifically in near the food pantry and on my goddamn car i love my cats but fuck em sometimes
it s what s on the inside that matters
throw it in to the mouth of an active volcano it is the only way
there s no way in hell that tiny ass cooler can keep a fx cpu cool at full load
dude saw that case and said sold i want it
cat piss you say
cat piss and dirt aside that case reminds of the killer robots from monsters of man for some reason
why it reminds me a total recall movie
dude wtf it looks like the motherboard is growing weed
one of us special addition
that case is dope
brazilian
he brought death to you
ewww
i love cases like this never liked glass i know what s in the pc i don t need anyone staring at it i d fill this up with new hardware and think it was awesome
this is exactly opposite of sleeper build looks tough but runs like shit
if it was only dusty
he bring it and said cat pissed on it save what you can its a dvd drive bay
i was wondering who was running this republic of gamers i keep seeing everywhere
you might say the cat was pissed off about it
this is the way
stock cooler master pre wraith cooler same as the one that came with my fx it prevents it from burning and is loud at least the is only 95watt tdp and clocked lower stock
ahh hell nah that shit is not worth breathing in cat piss fumes over
is cats pissing on computers the new shattered glass panels for the sub second one this week
cat piss and meth production smell similar
that boss is going to owe the it dept large if they can do any rescue
bro really just called me out i m saving up for one ok
hahaha i have my grandfather s desktop in that exact case he doesn t use it for gaming so it s fine
if you were to visualize the most common hardware on the steam survey
me watching wo long cutscenes in fps on medium settings hardly disagrees
i have a fairly beast of a setup and the last of us used a lot of the resources sorry but that s not optimized 19gb of ram and 11gb vram usage is a bit crazy edit didn t specify vram vs ram
as funny as this is it s kinda sad not too long ago the games were optimized well enough but i didn t have the hardware to run them and after all these years i ve finally managed to buy a decent pc but the games are now so poorly optimized that they re borderline unplayable a complete back to square one i am sadge
wait what s wrong with viewsonic monitors
should just be 8gb stick
bro those are basically my specs
and the cherry on top the hdd
if my rig can get better performance running cyberpunk with ray tracing then yeah your shits just not fucking optimized goddamn copium all over the place stop giving money to companies that make shit pc ports instead of bitching at people who don t want to buy an i9 combo just to play a texture updated decade old title
i would agree if the game also didn t run and look like peepeepoopoo on medium because corpos don t care enough about the pc market to make a playable experience on launch
i5 don t you mean i3
r titlegore
to be fair if you have midtier hardware like i do you can see a difference in optimization between games more easily for my 11800h cyberpunk handles ray tracing better than hogwarts legacy does to the point where i had to turn it off in hl
back in the day devs used tiled textures to make everything in game nintendo still use it and had somewhere around polygons on screen now we re at in new games now there s also scanned assets which requires more geometry and textures aren t tiled so rocks buildings etc don t look like a bunch of copies of each other tech is just moving on unfortunately that s going to leave some behind
here with a good setup most games nowadays are optimized like complete shit and all this does is shame people who can t afford a new setup and enable more shit practices from studios to not properly optimize their garbage games if you can t enjoy games with the majority of people playing games then all you have is single player games which have been mediocre at best even the godly ones are copy pasted rehashes er ragnarok and sp games are not the reason i game on pc
by my estimation and comparing my specs with the steam hardware survey i have a pc somewhere above the 90th percentile i ve had problems with rushed and unoptimized games it s a documented issue that crunch and corner cutting are endemic in the video game industry but beyond that this is a shitty post the reason i like this subreddit is that people are equally willing to clap for a new build with a 13th gen i9 and a as they are for a new build with ryzen and a gtx the point of this sub is celebrate computer nerds of all locations and budgets not to look down our noses at the poors who have committed sins like being born in a country where the series wasn t made available or enjoying pc gaming but having other hobbies they care more about elitism sucks
when wu long runs at fps on low on my ancient pc i can say it s optimised like shit because i get fps on high in elden ring on this same machine
nah when cards like are struggling i m pretty sure its the games that are unoptimized
i think t is true though that games are unoptimized to an extent i have noticed open source games for example comparing minecraft to minetest mineclone2 run much better minecraft oh no you turned the leaves to fancy on your mid tier gaming pc i can t possibly run over 40fps now minetest 4k screen oh you wanna set the render distance to blocks sure just go into advanced settings why are you surprised about getting solid vsynced fps and not a single drop under 59fps in over an hour
making fun of what someone can afford is always gross
op is just wrong on this one have you played a shitty port before doesn t matter if you have a 3k pc
why is this being upvoted why was this even made who are you attacking people complaining about lack of optimization today have better pcs than today s consoles but getting a worse experience i don t think anyone with a is complaining about any modern game running poorly this is disingenuous and really detracts from our efforts to be treated better as consumers
look man if i have a 3070ti with a 12700f and gigs of ram i should be able to expect a game to run nicely on good settings when i m here dropping last of us to medium which btw turns most of the textures into ps2 era jpegs and getting crashes every minutes then i m pretty sure it s not purely my hardware at fault not to mention the minutes it took the game to load the shaders the issue isn t that i cannot play every game on ultra at 4k no one who doesn t have the most expensive parts expects that but if i have to turn the settings down so much it looks worse than games from years ago its because of bad optimization
ha you fool i have a 750ti
tell me my pc is to low end for the last of us lol
2gb is the worst thing here but you could probably still play cs go and rl that s 16gb of ddr3 1080p monitor thermaltake case i5 or 2500k those are the only i5s sold in that box and a 1tb hdd the real problem though is that psu it will be difficult finding an lga board that has 20pin power instead of 4pin
should have been an i3
except you know games are poorly optimised these days
oh yeah it s totally always the user s hardware fault all the software is after all so well optimised nowadays
you work for cdpr or ps studios
very bad meme unfortunately game dev studios are publishing unfinished untested and unoptimized products for years now and having a high end pc shouldn t be the only solution to this industry bulling
just one note replace the monitor with a 4k ultrawide that will degrade the performance pretty nicely the reverse goes for the overkill pc meme give em a to pair with the
i have that monitor and its perfectly fine lol what the fuck
idk man the starship enterprise couldn t run some of the garbage they ve been releasing lately ksp last of us pc etc
for a sub called pcmasterrace there sure are a great many corporate apologists here trying to misrepresent anyone that complains about the glut of poorly optimised aaa games like this is as silly as colouring the entire but it works on my pc crowd as owning oligarchs
i5 is perfect for gaming
what is wrong with that tower it is the one i have thought it was super functional
they are definitely unoptimized though you can t deny
you got the gpu wrong i have a 1050ti not a
okay seriously there s nothing wrong with an i5 8th gen or higher ram ssd and video card matters more you classist sons of bitches
one of the worst attempts of a meme that i ve ever seen holy shit yeah we are all poor there are no unoptimized games that s for sure
the title is worse than the setup
ah yes having games run at an enjoyable frame rate should only be possible if you bought recent high end hardware that s an amazing take op gj s
i actually found that it s people with worse hardware that care less about optimisation i ve had people lie to me about how good their pcs perform just to make out that a game they re into runs well it s absurd
yeah yeah only poor people have problem with games it seems
look at this rich snob with two sticks of ram total elitist
sad when you re saying this with a
well when you play some games with good quality and medium framerates and you play another game with worse quality lower frame rates and random problems with the same hardware i say it s not well optimized it s not about the specs
assuming everyone with issues is some basement dwelling tendie aficionado on mom s hp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh1ekuvsyze&t=26s) is dumb as hell
i went from a gt to an rtx 3060ti but i still have that case
literally me before i upgraded
is there really a gtx1030 card
hey man years ago a viewsonic crt was the shit
you did kind of prove your point it used to be a game would come out and be playable although it may not be well on everything from top tier to bottom tier now you either have the best or you don t play it at all
this meme is funny the fact a regular pc cannot play recent releases correctly exactly shows they aren t optimized lol if you need a 2k setup to appreciate a game it sucks
bro what did i ever do to you
what s wrong with the case
not everyone has money
glad this was maked
a gpu mid tier gpu should at least let you play games with with medium settings at 60fps for years
not sure which are worse vegans or people that insist on telling everyone how they still running gpu s from s either way those comments are pretty much of any tech related topic or video validation feels good eh
bro wtf this is literally my setup i feel called out
at first glance i thought the intel box was a tampax https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcth8veog4_a3h6ajznpuywx6s5gvscisnhez6guejxkm9ae5jo&usqp=cac) tampon box
for just i can firmly say the gt is one of the best budget gpus out there not everyone can afford highend rig
i feel personally attacked
yet doom eternal will run 4k on ultra with this rig
if a pc above recommended hardware can barely run a game it s poorly optimized
but isnt this the very definition of a game being well optimized not requiring the most expensive parts money can buy just to run a game is what optimized means if you require a 13900k and to play 1080p fps by definition is unoptimized look at doom doom eternal you can play that on a toaster that s what all games should strive for you should be able to play the game well on last gens lowest end hardware you should be able to buy the best buy or walmart pc and play any game at low 1080p thats what optimized means like literally
a well made game could run on this also the crackhead craigslist seller is probably trying to sell this at era specific retail price because that s what i paid for it
if your game is unplayable on a pc you need to optimize your shit there s no excuse for four figures worth of minimum system requirements
eh i ve got a and a 5800x3d the people i see bitching about unoptimized games do have a point though they also crank their settings up to the max thinking my pc cost over it should be able to handle anything and wonder why it doesn t work well at 4k with full path tracing
more like lazy devs
bruh some games actually are unoptimized
that s an i5 and the ram is 1333mhz 5000rpm drive
yeah lets defend the big corporations that make shitty games yey
i bet doom eternal will run just fine on this
lol it s always nice to see people who complaint about people complaining asking them to stop complaining by complaining also games are unoptimized u showing a gt won t somehow make it optimised proof wo long forspoken wild hearts hogwarts legacy basically any game with denuvo in it
when you try to exaggerate your point and fail miserably
terrible take
people still using ddr3 say this
that s the cyberpunk is so broken starter pack
i still have a 1st gen i5 in my pc civ6 and frostpunk run quite well on it
so what i m sorry that people are not rich get the fuck out asshole
the random generic explosive psu did it for me
there s like one dude in this comment section downvoting everyone lmfao i guess we know who the poor dude is edit this comment keeps going into negative karma then back into positive karma high end vs low end who will win
this is a fresh take on a classic
you know what s the sad part that is my exact setup part for part
hey the new i5 is pretty good
ok but pretty much all of them are nowadays
8gb vram was a huge mistake and i wish i went with an amd card two years ago the ti literally shows what my s raw power can really do and that it s held back by the shitty vram capacity i still haven t bought re4 or lou because of these issues and at this point i might as well get them on my playstation instead even if they end up being more expensive
all these new pc games run like ass a
what s wrong with a viewsonic monitor i have a 144hz viewsonic and i have no complaints
the last of us pc launch has driven me crazy i ve had no issues whatsoever and theres even a guy on youtube i forget the name who s proved it runs at fps on integrated graphics turn ur damn settings down ffs
hahahahaha true af though
my friend played tlou on pc and besides some stutters he had no issues i played hogwarts legacy on launch and had zero issues i have a 5800x3d and 6800xt and he has some threadripper cpu and a the way people talked about these issues made it seems like it was complete universal issues but we were both fine
nailed it
yeah for real get a better pc and stop cherry picking tlou
why are you sucking off mega corporations when they dont give a shit about you
lian li lmao that s the best shit i ve seen in a while
u savevideo
but does it run minecraft
this was one of the best april fools jokes this year
now you are the funko pop
i think it s a hyte y40
dope
serious hardware looks nice
thanks big upgrade from my i7 1050ti and 16gb of ram it was very good but starting to show its age
amd ryzen 5800x gig corsair vengence rtx 1tb ssd 2tb hdd asus prime b550 plus corsair h100i liquid cooling corsair 4000d airflow case
i used went from my gtx970 to a rtx3070 so fun to game again
good on you side note i just pooped my pants not realising reddit was open and that this was a notification on my own phone
the order is kind of backwards for the joke but this is really funny
nvidia rolling around in gold and scewing low income households
pc gaming s obsession with high end hardware is only going to get worse according to analysts this is and will be true as long as the high end hardware continues to get better it will no longer be true when the extra cost stops buying extra performance gamers tend to prefer tactical black predatory rgb gaming gear but few will spend extra on it if it offers no measurable performance increase over plain ugly green pcb stuff
as for today i wouldn t go past rx 6800xt and ryzen 5800x both used
can t wait to play games that not even the most expensive cards years into the future can run
cmon gamers why do you need so much ram and gpu in every pc
i m going from a gtx1080 before you guys kill me don t worry it s still in perfect condition and runs everything smooth i m upgrading because my gf is in need of a graphic card as her 1050ti died so the gtx1080 lives on yes i do know the is overpriced and i m a dumb dumb for getting it
they re not a charity low income houses shouldn t be building high end gaming pcs to begin with plus the actual article predicts there s going to be an uptick in both low end and high end segments relative to the mid tier
gif giphy f3g8ymqkokbii
no need to justify the purchase your gf needed a new graphics card and you could go for an upgrade easy as that kill two birds with one stone no clue why some ppl here get bent on others spending their own money enjoy your you won t have to upgrade for a while
i was shopping around for a used for my first build but saw the rx6600 for new so i got that i wish i had the cash for a
buddy i don t think the or the is going to be well priced at all i live in a very poor rural area and my pc is the most expensive thing i have and i struggled so hard to get it i probably can t afford a new gpu anymore and so is many other pc enthusiasts who are in a bad situation but nvidia just keeps increasing prices for profit
i respect my money you know what i don t respect greedy corporations selling hugely overpriced products because mob is gonna buy them anyways
thanks my thoughts exactly had my since so i m hoping the lasts about the same or more d
even among high end gamers people usually don t buy a gpu every generation so why are you a low income gamer with a ti so concerned about the and you shouldn t be in the market for an upgrade until the rtx series and rx
did you downvote me lol gif giphy u1an4htfj2smgb2bbk
just retiring my 1070ti to my media server for some 3000s this year love those older gpus but yea not quite on par these days is a nice card and you will enjoy it for a long time to come
so do you think nvidia series is going to be cheaper doesn t seem so
even if i told you what was going to happen in the gpu market over the next couple years it wouldn t matter because you wouldn t believe me anyway
you are right i m going to need evidence
looks incredible are you only exhausting out the rear i think you might have a better temp differential if you exhausted out the top i know that the 1000d doesn t have the best airflow design but i think it would be best to try flipping those top fans
some of the bends could be better but overall very nice build i m really liking the rgb
are the fittings rgb or am i having a stroke
looks like the club in cyberpunk
i ll never understand the custom loop thing so much extra work for something like looks slightly cooler does it drastically reduce temps compared to air or aio so many more points of failure and work idk
yeah just the rear for now so far temps have been solid stress test on cpu z brought the core temperatures up to about degrees celcius gpu runs around in uningine 4k as ai cooling throttles the fans nvme s ars steady at and ddr5 is running around i will keep testing if it gets out if hand i ll consider swapping it around lets hope that doesnt end up being the case nothing is simple in this thing lol
thanks my first try on hard tubing i plan to swap out the petg for acrylic the first time i have to flush it take a bit more time on it and order a lot more supplies so i dont get to a point where i go uh oh better just let that one ride and make sure i have enough to finish it that and i forgot to put a temp sensor in loop its sitting here i just gotta add it in somewhere lol
they are thermaltake rgb fittings
i did it partly for aesthetics partly for the challenge and partly for experience that and i love modularity its a preference thing i reckon but yes i do believe having the ability to run 480mm rads and multiple rads in sequence probably yields some minor benefits over aio s i had run thermoelectric cooling on my last build with good results and air on all the ones before that didnt want anything about this rig to be too cookie cutter so i bit the bullet threw my wallet at it and nutted up to learn some new skills lol
aye that i know for sure i ve done a few customer builds in the 1000d and every time it s a cable nightmare on the backside lmao thankfully the fan tray at the top is one of the easier things to access and shouldn t take much work around to flipping
coolant temps will be best if all rads are intake
you re way below tjmax don t bother changing anything and just keep it the way you like aesthetically even intel themselves says that their chips are rated to run all day right on up to tjmax without impacting product lifespan countless old laptops out there with cpus made of the same materials as desktop cpus and those things are idling hotter than your load temps and under load they re thermal throttling themselves on and off when those laptops do die it s never the cpu that failed it s a bad solder joint or dead storage device a broken hinge worn out ribbon cable etc
wow that s marvelous for a first try also to clarify your loop is very nice but some bends like the one from the gpu to radiator the last bend that s going into the rad look pinched though not as severe as the photo below it does slightly look so in your pic this is not optimal as the straight tubing has a larger diameter and has a lower pressure compared to the pinched section which forces fluid to increasing pressure you can get by with it since yours is only minimally pinched by the looks of it some tips try to keep the heat gun at a lower setting and slowly rotate the tubing as if it was a rotisserie chicken over a hot fire soon enough you will be able to gently bend the tubing or using assisted tube benders to help you get your correct angle keep in mind that you should gently try to bend the tubing to see if its soft enough to bend or if it needs a tad more heat https://preview.redd.it/pyxndrnpdcsa1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9350ed0cf9adbc4f32a4e9c907de5cd08d95c6cb
i suspected that overheating the tubing may have been the culprit i used a wagner heat gun and kept it on low and rotated it but i think i kept it on the heat for too long in several spots either that or i needed to calm down and let the tubing cool before i took it out of the mandrel and started installing it there is a coming from the top rear radiator down into the cpu that isnt visible in the pic that looks similar i appreciate all the advice and will definitely give it a shot on the replumb i honestly didnt know what i was getting myself into when i decided to do all this a lot of firsts in there first time removing the air cooler from a gpu and installing a waterblock first time doing a delid first time doing a water cooled system first time working with liquid metal tim honestly i was relieved when it took its first breath we wont even go into the nightmare of usb bandwidth and running that many controllers for all the rgb lol definitely not for the faint of heart
ddr4 my grandma runs faster and shes dead
i hear it crying for linux
gorgeous love it
you can buy games at gog and use their drm free offline installers
i can not confirm the ease of acquiring cracked games however coming from someone with an 80tb server of linux distro s you might find what you re looking for if you search how to use usenet program s i additionally don t recommend are sabnzbd sonarr radarr and lidarr
i buy my games and then pirate them to actually play because well the obvious reasons doubters behold https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/980902980394041425/1093610525247672380/untitled.jpg)
there are other subs that are better equipped to help you it s easy to find them check their megathreads this one will just turn this post into a flamewar some people faint over the idea of pirating a year old game that it s not even sold anymore
gog good old games is a store like ea origin or steam the difference is that the games are drm free you even get the offline installer files if you want
piracy is necessary to avoid microtransactions anticonsumer practices always online demands having access to games no longer sold fighting against exclusivity and things like spore having a lock on being installed times ever
yes you should start pirating games and stop supporting crappy game company s like ea and ubisoft
for legal reasons don t pirate anything but if you re really gonna do it pirate everything except indie games
if available buy from gog all games work offline without need to use internet
just play factorio no other game is required or worthy of your attention
pirating games is very very easy cracking them is something thats best left to professionals that have lots of time on their hands x200b go to r piratedgames and read their megathread
i once was stationed in england and on orders to separate and return to america the local british companies refused to accept american orders as a valid reason to terminate contracts cable phone so i spoke to the on base lawyer who laughed and said screw em different country different credit bureau different police what are they going to do extradite you years later and not a peep about it just sayin
when i was deployed steam was pretty solid for its offline games as long as you launched them once before going offline with that being said i did pirate a lot of games i owned just so i wouldn t have the problem of drms stopping me from playing things i m not proud of it but it had to happen
stop playing aaa games they are literally bottom of the barrel entertainment compared to the sea of single player indie games
do you need to no you can just not buy games that don t work and instead buy games that do work you don t have to play any specific video games you can choose to support developers and publishers that don t abuse their customers and tell companies like ubisoft and ea who view their customers as brainless cattle to just fuck off into the sunset by not giving them your money are you asking a moral question personally i ve just stopped buying ea ubisoft and blizzard activision altogether because i think they re just awful companies and i don t want my money to support them i just don t play any of their games at all pirated or otherwise but that s a personal decision for everyone to make on their own i really don t feel like i m missing out on anything significant are you asking for help in fixing problems with always online games that support an offline mode this isn t the best sub for that probably better to ask on the game specific or store specific steam origin etc subs or are you asking how to pirate games really not a good sub for that at all there s a whole sub on reddit dedicated to piracy if you just want to go that route
steam has worked great for offline for me because my wifi is also trash cuts out sometimes but mostly just way to slow to log in to anything on weekend specifically early weekdays ok end of weekday slow again however if ur offline and click sign out or change user there is not a guarantee you can sign back in even into the account you had just left im not sure why but the sign in offline just doesnt work after you log out from an account
it is really unfortunate this is almost completely about tracking us
steam has offline mode but a lot of them require connections now only legal company that offers offline drm free games is gog for the high seas i like fit girl if you use torrents make sure to look into vpns although i m not sure if the military would care at all nor am i aware of if the ip can be traced back to you
yes
pirate it if you want just don t go around pirating communities there and talk crap about people who bought games but yeah pirating can be a hassle and irritating to many people i would just suggest buying games on sale and for a cheap price on other platforms
gog games are drm free which means you can buy them and play them anywhere if you still want to pirate goto gogfreegames and just download the gog games for free
i was gonna make a snarky comment but i fucking wish i had 80tb
sound plausible if you have paid actual money but then pirate you have still paid
not enough people say this gog is my go to store for these exact reasons
ubisoft connect is the bane of my existence
i would do that if steam didn t offer a better overall experience plus i already have a very expensive library on there
not all aaa games are created equally there are aaa games where you can t experience anything like it elsewhere my favorites games list mostly consists of aaa with some indie sprinkled in probably a ratio
hit them with the jack sparrow
well shit i have been with steam ea and ubisoft forever now xbox pass can the gog launcher work with already purchased games in offline mode
i buy games on gog first over time you will be happy
steam is a better user experience plus gog doesn t have some of the best games ever made they re missing most of the games from my favorite games list even indie ones gog isn t worth it
you didn t install it in the cpu
is it a desktop if it s not on top of my desk it s just a pc
side question given the size of modern gpus why are they installed in the motherboard instead of having the motherboard and the chasis being installed on the gpu edit this post doubled my reddit karma lol
i work in a clinical lab has an administrator call down and want to know which instruments had cpus all of them what about the little ones every electronic instrument in the lab has a cpu you know what i mean i literally don t turns out he thought that anything that runs windows is a cpu and anything else was not a cpu this guy is responsible for corporate wide decisions
some time ago people called the computer cpu with that knowledge it makes sense
fuck i installed mine in my keyboard
in the early days of computers the box that contained the computing hardware was called the cpu usually a flat bed desktop and the monitor sat atop of it the cpu was called micro processor or just the processor or sometimes pentium regardless of the actual model it s been like years since i have heard anyone referring to the whole system as cpu though
sounds like they are trying to talk about integrated graphics unfortunately the writer couldn t have presented the idea with a worse title
i just downloaded a graphics card
everyone knows destroying the monitor destroys all the data tv and movies taught me good
someone could build a monitor with an attached egpu and just connect it over usb c all the tech exists off the shelf there s just no real reason to do it
am i the weird one for installing mine up my ass
i always install mine in the usb so i can download more ram when i need to
these ai generated articles are getting out of hand

ahh science abc most trusted news source of the modern age why are s installed in the cpu insanity
do they mean an all in one aio
people who refer to the entire pc as the cpu should be jailed for war crimes
i remember there was a time when a lot of people called the whole tower the cpu
cpu is another name for the desktop less used than in the early days of desktops but still valid
this has the same energy as pee is stored in the balls
this is the pcmr version of pee is stored in the balls
everyone in this thread is years old cpu has never referred to anything but a processor people call entire computers cpus or hard drives because they have no concept of what a computer is beyond a magic box that has the internet inside
because it s supposed to be installed in storage
remember this question was asked for people who probably don t know a lot about pcs let them learn
with as much power as they are requiring they might have to be installed in the house breaker panel soon
science abc
because your monitor would be 10x more expensive also the build in the picture doesn t even have integrated graphics
the answer is yes
in the cpu instead of the monitor
well he s on the right track one knowledge level above the ppl who point at the display when asked to point at the computer
for the same reason that pee is stored in the balls
here s the link to the goofy article if anyone for whatever reason wants to read it it reads like that essay you wrote where you were given a minimum of pages on a completely brain dead and impossible to write about subject so just made your sentences extra and pointlessly long and added a ton of filler sentences in to desperately get to pages long https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/why-are-graphic-cards-installed-in-the-cpu-instead-of-the-monitor.html
sigh it isn t installed in the cpu it s installed in the hard drive
some refer to the whole desktop as cpu that s especially common in office desktops which consist of cpu monitor keyboard and mouse
what are you retarded it goes on the ram
its still a dumb question without that title
gif giphy fqibamwi7m7o8
what an idea that is putting a gpu in the cpu
title wrote by the pee is stored in the balls guy
pee is stored in the balls
same reason pee isn t stored in the balls
i lost some brain cells reading the title
graphics cards are sometimes installed inside the cpu
why blowing smoke back in my computer won t make it work again
i ve worked with people that refer to the tower case as the cpu rather then correcting them i just keep in mind that they probably aren t computer savvy edit so i learned a new word today the people who do this are using the word synecdochically synecdoche is to refer all parts of a system as a whole look up the cpu stand by fellows
cpu is a common term for the whole tower drives me nuts but i see it a lot
gif giphy 1x7lcrp8ie0yrdzvwd
very common for old folk to say cpu referring to the case and it s inhabitants although they should clarify it better
should be installed in the keyboard instead
science abc because to the reporters the other letters are unknown to science gif giphy qe3fmo40wmu9w
don t question the science
gif giphy kc0kqknfu7v35gpkwb
in south east asia they call a pc a cpu for some reason i have few colleagues who always say cpu instead of pc and i m like dudes say pc because cpu means you fried your motherboard when you say cpu crashed
i know y all are hating on them for calling it a cpu but it s acceptable and here is why if you come from shitty parts of the us like myself kansas the textbooks in computer class use the term cpu as representative of the entire machine where as they would simply call the cpu a processor i still have my memories of correcting my teacher and getting my ass chewed out for being disrespectful
using the term cpu to refer to the whole tower i saw it in an ltt video lol
context people used to call the whole computer a cpu idk why but i think that s what they meant
cpu computer translation why is the gpu installed in the computer instead of the monitor
afaik the actual tower is just called the cpu in some parts of asia science abc did immediately give off southeast asia flags
what could this mean like igpus in cpus actually that s a good point
lmao
are it tho
in some places the case with all the parts in it is called the cpu
wait you have to install it mine is still inside the box
totally what normies would ask as a lame nerd and a computers gaming lover it surprises me how often normal people get basic things wrong
i assume they mean installed in the pc not the monitor which is still dumb because monitor s are normally sold as single units whole pcs are customisable and would have the gpu closest to the rest of the components
and when are we going to be able to start plugging gpus into the electric socket on the wall
no jokes but some people still call pc cases cpu where i m from
what it s clearly installed in the keyboard
that s cpu abuse
graphics cards are installed in the balls
the only thing i can possible think of is onboard graphics apu s
the writer actually meant cputer
this makes me wonder if a monitor or line of monitors could have an integrated egpu enclosure
i am so confused
yup you need to install your gpu in the monitor for lower latency this is basic knowledge
doesn t that only apply to laptops
i thought the gpu was in the memory what are they talking about
i prefer installing my gpu in my fans
i put the ram in my keyboard
i thought you installed them in your eyes
why the monitor is not installed in the cpu
yes
no no he has a point
i installed a wire from the gpu straight to the wall no wonder it started burning will screw it on top of the cpu
what mine s connected to my keyboard
in some countries they call the pc as in the case and everything in it cpu i have been told to plug in the monitor to the cpu at one point like source travelling and working in south america
why is my pc not installed in my monitor you have to look at apple to figure where that question comes from
you did what in the what now
lol
i ve also heard someone calling the pc case for the motherboard d
i plug my ram into my pcie slots wedge the cpu into the case fan and duct tape my aio to my gpu that has been superglued to the case for future proofing
boomer alert
oh no guys i did mine wrong
i don t think they have ever seen or touched a computer before
cue squinting fry
gif giphy l3q2k5jinalchocls
cus gpu s need love too
talk about poor wording i m sure they mean pc case
this thing is going to smash anything and everything congratulations
that thing is going to be a beast just a psa make sure you update the firmware on your ssd
thanks guys it was the most money i spent at once on a build
very nice
the more i see people getting nice gpus the closer i get to buying one
looks pretty good don t you just love that your graphics card cost almost the same as the rest of the computer
looks good i m unfamiliar with the psu brand i d probably get a brand name psu like corsair etc if i m wrong about the psu then disregard my comment edit others have indicated super flower is a reputable brand i d say you re good to go op
looks pretty good to me
gigabyte b650 might be a better buy https://www.techspot.com/review/2633-amd-b650-motherboards/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2633-amd-b650-motherboards/) otherwise awesome build
very similar to my build i did i d really consider an aio i went 420mm h170i for mine then put the two large fans on the bottom blowing up at my nitro temps are very good i have the 7900x and if you are benchmarking it even with a 420mm aio it will hit around 86c just run hot though im pretty sure the 7800x3d will be lighter heres the link to mine with a writeup and lessons learned if you need https://pcpartpicker.com/b/myxbt6#cx4203903](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/myxbt6#cx4203903)
looks perfect hope you have a proper monitor for this rig though some high refresh rate 1440p or 4k monitor
what rez you gonna game at i ve been waiting on all the reviews and have come to the conclusion that at 4k x3d processors aren t much of a benefit not pullled the trigger on my new build yet thinking about the 7950x someone talk me down or point me to better advice to be clear don t need the performance but i do a lot of virtualisation as well as being an avid gamer i can afford it just can t settle on a cpu choice just realised i was gonna hijack op s post sorry
looks good to me wish it was mine haha don t forget the thermal paste
the destination address after you order it pm me for the correct address
change the shipping address to mine other than that it looks pretty good
cpu cooler there a lot better cpu cooler out there
rgb ram and a rtx
good to go if you have fixed electric bill consider getting instead of 7800x3d
i m a big advocate for the thermal right peerless assassin but not for this caliber of a build
cpu cooler to 360mm liquid
if you ever wanna play 4k blu rays on your computer you ll want a tower with some drive bays
deleted
i m sensing a mix of budget but high end build what i d do if i had disposable income for it altho i d save up more and get a tbh
your build is basically as good as it will get
it s a sexy ass gpu though honestly the sexiest amd board partner design imo
at the cost mark that s gonna happen lol
super flower is a very reputable psu brand
if i remember right i think super flower actually makes the psus for a lot of other brands
corsair is bad quality
out of curiosity is there a big difference between his mother boards
i have a 1440p 280hz display
but you re totally correct at 4k cpu becomes a bit of a moot point the 5800x3d is in margin of error territory with the 7800x3d and 13900k and even something less exciting like a 12600k or 5700x isn t much further behind
pearless is one of the best out there especially in terms of it s price i would definitely go for an air cooler instead of an aio
3d is an efficent chip that cooler might have been better but its still more than enough
its enough and affordable
the 7800x3d is by far the most energy efficient zen4 cpu it actually has the same tdp in practice as the and only peaks at around 88w
the 7800x3d is a pussycat and sips power i don t think this is a huge concern here
360mm aio is overkill for cooling the ryzen 7800x3d
how were the dinosaurs
yes but whose actually touched a disc with their hands in the past years
internet explorer eh
the thermalright peerless assassin is basically the best air cooler you can buy superflower is actually the company than manufactures virtually all of evga s power supplies they just don t have a presence in the us due to contractual agreements with evga asrock is a well known manufacturer and the motherboard has all of the features i need for my use case no reason to spend more money based on brand names
not really i d just go for one with decent io and a decent heatsink
am5 runs hot and you dont buy 7800x3d without performance in mind get a better cooler no reason to thermal throttle ur cpu when you buy high end parts
ah yes c underload very cool chip even if it sips on power
it runs hot on purpose you can easily do a pbo2 tune in the bios to shift the v f curve down then set a temperature limit optimum tech has a video on it fixing ryzen
question i have a new build and i just ordered my 7800x3d my final part today but i m cooling with a deepcool ak620 i have no idea if it s enough but i also saw that amd recommends a liquid cooler for that chip
if you can t keep an 88w cpu cool even with vcache in the way you re doing something wrong the reviews i ve seen all explicitly mention it as simple to cool and have even listed it peaking at 79c even in avx workloads so your information has unfortunately come from someone who has done a piss poor job testing it
keyboards also seems like madness
ayeee let s go i got mine on newegg any ideas for a good mobo to pair this with ddr5
meanwhile here i am on hopium that the 5800x3d will drop in prices where i live
got one to congrats
i managed to snag one off amazon i didn t think i would be able to but after a few refreshes i got one
can u give a link i cant find it with the normal search
same here easiest launch day buy i ve had in a while
time to save money for 5800x3d before it s gone
deleted
hey soon to be little bros enjoy it i hope you have good cooling solutions hahaha
same my best buy is in bumfuck nowhere idaho so we rarely or never get anything on release day i was the only one at the door for open today had to do a pickup order set for the 15th but the guy i talked to said he thinks some are on tonight s truck so fingers crossed newegg on the other hand decided to fuck my mobo ram order and say no we re not gonna overnight that we re just gonna do the standard free shipping so you can have that sometime next week instead at least they refunded the shipping costs fuck me i swear
i went with the asrock x670e pg lightning
ummm not sure going to have to dig around and see what i can find have some time tho
they should
good to see people got some still have some deep trauma from the gpu knife fighting days
let s go
they are gone atm but this was on bestbuy
https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-ryzen-7-7000-series/p/n82e16819113793?item=n82e16819113793~~. it s sold out now
that makes me really happy people are able to get some
price should drop even more now this is out
nothing wrong if your rig performers at the level you want
going in a loop but most of the testing shows it s power draw super low should help thermals
sweet thanks man had that one on the list
and your mistake thinking you re in america you re a long way from home this is brazil sadly around here prices just don t go down because of a new release only when they need to buy new stock with the new prices or when they are trying to get rid of the last unites which should take a while with the current economy
yeah man actually was in the middle of a grand canyon sunrise tour bought it right as the sun came up what a morning lol so glad i had reception
i hope so because i m planning on running that thing to the ground for like the next years or something lol
yeah maybe vcache sure does get hot though
move the plant on the right side in an inch
the only thing you could do to improve this photo is to give us the wallpaper link
maybe a smaller keyboard your mouse position seems quite far over
i m assuming you use a headset but some speakers might be nice
i know you moved the left monitor for the photo but dam is that overlap annoying me fix it
put the vertical monitor on top back to horizontal you will see how barely useful the bottom of the vertical screen is fairly quickly
you should buy the ridge wallet with the same topography grading then causally leave it on the desk
those expensive high resolution metal posters
underslung headset cradle underneath desk and a usb hub also underneath desk
get a noname mouse from the thrift store no really and lose any of the other mood lighting stuff
revert to windows
nano leaves shelves with funko pops fake vines around the desk backlights that s what i would do
x200b lmao
it s on wallpaper engine name is topography by gabadoo
not a speaker person
nah i use it for scripting and prefer it to be vertical
why would you get a noname mouse
this is win
i m not either but i like to have a set so i can play audio for others if you ever do add speakers i can recommend the creative labs pebble https://www.amazon.com/dp/b0791h74nt) speakers the basic set are the best speakers i ve ever heard
only fans
what s even the point of this
aren t half these fans just blowing the air in the opposite directions
clearly you need more they re all lit up red and red hot keep adding more until they turn blue
onlyfans
get an air cooler then you can have another two fans
u need more fans the fans are turning red due to hear due to the friction caused increase number of fan so that you can cool them and stop from melting
i hate how much i love this
replace the glass panel with more fans
i don t think so https://preview.redd.it/u91q8sdefdsa1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52077b83d8d8384325000c38e38ea37fef06ad79
hahahah this guys sucking out his air coming in before it even gets anywhere no wonder hes got this many fans and degrees the fans exhausting on your side panels you could put a temp sensor panel or just background monitor if you wanted to waste money turn them around edit now i see it if you were gonna go aio exhaust in the first place would ve been better to roof mount it not hating just trying to educate now in order for you to get any postive air pressure youd have to run your intakes at max rpm and throttle down exhuast you ve got a dust vacuum atm
a fool and his money are easily parted thats not how airflow works brother why do i even bother
obviously not it should be at max

if you angle it right and get creative you can fit more in there
no you are missing fans on the motherboard
no you re still above c
that is ridiculous lol
why not more on outside of case as well
i d personally i d make a custom bracket to have atleast more floating fans
no you looser pathetic
why not build something that makes sense
i know the blue on that aio makes you angry
get a sweet pair of noise cancelling headphones
just more and you re clear for takeoff
i think you re lacking some airflow you may need to add some more fans to keep those temps down
guy like me would have double the amount of fans
same case but i left the mirror stock
there is never enough
heat is not possible in a vacuum
time to blow in some glitter to check to see if you have the correct airflow
unnecessary prob doing worse for cooling than a normal setup
so with the rgb speed buff about how high off the desk and what kinds of speeds is your pc hovering around the room at
nope
you must be a rockstar
make a cube around the gpu and done
what case is that
this looks fantastic
now you just need the classic front and sides covered with glass panels xd
looks a bit warm in there
your poor poor electricity bill
apparently not my cpu is cooler
just put it infront of the ac and you ll never have cooling problems
more exhaust fans than intake mean more dust but whatever floats your boat
i think you might actually have too many fans
i see you ve put your pc in the metal gear solid microwave hallway
what will happen if you where to place it on a bathroom scale
you can fit some 10mm fans between the gpu and the lower set of fans on that mesh area right there
this is comically ugly for such a nice build
no remove that water cooler and install an air cooler so you can add more
i m a fan keep it up
i thought this was some rave dance floor and the gpu was a dj table
flip the side panel fans so they re intake not exhaust
what is the point of a liquid cooler when you have this many fans tho
no i think you need atleast another more fans and an external radiator
buddy s gonna fly across the pacific why else
it sucks up all the dust in the room it keeps the room air cleaner
what s even the point of this decoration lights and noise fashion brag and swag is all about form not about function
bro should have put his aio exhaust at the top
why did i expect anything less than these specs
bad build your ssd doesn t have enough fans
yeah but which fans
he must have a specific cable just to keep it from flying away like a kid and his balloon
also it s a hovercraft so if he sits on it he gets that 0g gaming experience
true ideally you want both though rtgi is a beautiful thing with accurate color
plants
how much did the screen with the temp and load monitoring cost
remove the rgb
you mean add more or remove it altogether
about usd on amazon
more a lot more make the entire place a jungle
absolutely love the design of that rx xt gpu it reminds me of cyberpunk smart weapons
banger price used price performance sweet spot well done just a reminder to use spererate power cables from the psu if possible in rare cases it introduces some instability
same i love the ability to see straight into the heat sink too
you could gift him some sleeves down the line
that s awesome man you have some nice coworkers happy birthday
well if that isn t the icing on the cake
what a fucking nerd i m jealous d
cake processing unit
happy birthday you got a beautiful cake
how do i get a job where you work
very nice just make sure it complies with rohs to avoid lead poisoning
first off happy birthday secondly please do pass my regards to your friend for being full on awesome and his sister for being such an artist nice one
wow i hope she does this for a living
i m seeing a lotta cold solder joints heat gun and some flux should fix that right up for ya
very nice happy birthday btw
hopefully wasn t overcooked
happy birthday also i bet your going to give that cake a mega bite
bad ass
sweet well you know what i mean
happy birthday awesome cake
nerd
nice cpu op now you just need to find a socket big enough to fit it
happy birthday dude hope it s a good one
use it
how festive
what an awesome coworker
god i love spinach horseradish cakes
ah those little silver cake decorating balls i always used to secretly crunch on when my mom wasn t in the kitchen and then like years ago somebody posted about the fact that they re not actually edible
scrolled really fast past this at first and thought that s a really dirty cpu imma take a closer look anyways happy birthday mate
good lord i used to do basic cakes and this shit blows my mind i could never come up with this
how mandy cores does that thing have
but can it run crysis
publix looks like the boxes they use and their most common edge border gold cardboard under the cake coloring the inside of the box source years in a bakery at a publix

you still get birthday cakes
can it run crysis
wazabi cake lika a real g m3rz
happy birthday you cheeky bastard and damm that cake though
i bet your central core s processed that unit haste fully
now go to delid that to get better taste
that s really cool
merry birfmas ocifersmalldong
i would die for a cake like that
were there any traces of the cake left when you were done
nice die lid looks jagged af good luck cooling it s
put a clock above it so you can say you overclocked it happy birthday
happy birthday how you gonna cool that chip
any bent pins
that s amazing i always liked seeing pcbs and i wish clear plastic electronics were popular again
can it run crysis
happy birthday
they forgot the thermal paste
i m imagining next time you ll get one of those large rectangle cakes with an intel 13th gen on it
this cake is a lie
you have a great coworker and he has a talented sister that s awesome
imagine your poop color if it was that black icing
i want to make a portal reference but it doesn t seem right
put some thermal paste on it
happy cake day
ic what you did there
thats so sweet
makes me remember the motherboard inspired cake i got a couple year ago
oi be careful the pins touching each other
china s new 10000nm die
where did the rest of the graphics card go s
thanks we really do everyone here is like that
first one to make a pun you deserve this award
good one xd
thank you thank you
umm that applies to cakes in general i hope
thank you it was just a surprise tbh he normally just buys a cake at walmart but he said i make his mornings so he wanted to do somthing special also yea she needs to open a bakery fr
i don t think she does but she needs to do it
thank you thank you
hahah
happy cake day to you
thank you thank you
that s what i m saying no more itx build for me xd
thank you thank you i hope you have a marvelous day yourself
ah yes this person s cake is rohs certified
tell her that there are about reddit users who agree
likewise happy cake day
your mother and i smelled smoke the other day so we opened it up and one of the cables was wrapped on the fan so we moved it out of the way the message started showing up after that waiting to order a new psu since this one isn t modular to see if the hdd is toast or not
more like f d drive
dropbox just did not want you to find out that it killed your drive i mean what drive
i don t get it
looks like you need a bigger itx case thank nvidia
in the next decade we will need to rent a full appartement to put our gpu in
with how big gpus are getting i wonder if we ll start seeing external gpus eventually only big issue would be getting a fast enough connection
computer on the right new box for the gpu on the left
the meshlicious actually accomodates large gpus well due to the fact the plate holding the motherboard can be offset it easily accepts slot gpus if you use water cooling for the cpu
computers will have come full circle from room sized to pocket sized right back to room sized
asus already has an xg mobile connector which i believe is just a modified pcie connector with usb much like esata maybe epcie if thunderbolt turns out to not be fast enough
now i get it
yeah i have one and a sapphire nitro 6900xt that s as long of a gpu that will fit
disconnect the external monitor and force a restart if you haven t already
thank you reddit nation you have saved my friend
looks epic i m gonna check it out love a good platformer how do i become a play tester
may be a long shot but youtuber videogamedunkey has set up his company bigmode and are due to publish animal well on steam i have watched him for some time and he s incredibly passionate for good quality games so may well be worth an ask reach out you can apply through the website bigmode games and reckon it s worth a go this game looks great and i m sure anyone would be proud to publish it wish you the best of success and look forward to the release
thanks a lot you also can add us to wishlist https://store.steampowered.com/app/1767350/water_fall/

depending on games like example if you like mmorpg easy go in game quest get in guild talk make friends easiest way to make friends its in mmorpgs lol or try discord if you play x game try finding a discord chanel for x game easy have a great day
really depends on the games you play some of my best gaming mates are people i met using open mic in a session just taking to people but i understand that can be hard i hope you are able to find some lads to hop on with
first congrats on the switch over from ps4 finding people to play with consistently is tough i think discord communities are the fastest way to meet people i was in a similar boat when i switched to pc years ago now i ve got a good group of people i play with most days all meet on discord
if you play csgo or apex hit me up on reddit and i ll send you an add
gday shagger what games ya playing
i did try discord and it turned out the same way as reddit and my problem with making friends in game is that i get really shy and anxious so then i usually mute myself
aha thanks yeah its been really tough as most my friends are ps4 and dont really play many other games i do hope either through discord or games i can find some good people
but you don t have to voice talk just play along write when you get use to it then maybe you voice talk i usually don t talk to not cause shy and stuf but even in raid in mmorpg i just listen very rare i talk to old friends with voice but again depending on games you play
yeah i guess so thanks for the reply too i ll try do something like that and hopefully i ll get some friends
just be yourself xd and remeber they are all stranger s and don t know you even if you talk talk freely if you have thing in common it s enough start from there rest will come along cheers and welcome to pc xd

win in
please get your ads off my frakking desktop i wanted a local search not your bing results to purchase something everyone
microsoft have started rolling back some of the pointless and dumb changes made between win and win i m still waiting for small taskbar icons to come back until then i hide the taskbar but we can once again right click on the taskbar and open task manager just like the win days
only reason i don t like windows is because i dislike how much it pushes ms services on you that i don t want or need windows is already bad in this regard but makes it worse by not having an easy way of setting your pc up without logging into a ms account
i just don t understand why they removed the customization options that were always available for the task bar and implemented that awful start menu why do i have to pay for startallback to fix usability issues created by microsoft for no reason even the context menus are bad ffs if i wanted a pretty looking ios ui i would buy an ios device stop copying the apple design or at least stop stripping us of the ability to customize the ui
my first windows was i have yet to live through a time people are not complaining about the new version without even trying it
i did go from win to and will probably go from straight to not because i hated win or that much but because there is no benefit in switching and potential problems without a clean installation and a clean installation takes time but i am lazy so bottom line i am lazy
the reason i haven t installed windows on my gaming pc is quite stupid but i really really want small taskbar buttons and it simply doesn t exist outside of some hacky work around from github
i hate that windows still has different settings menu s the new right click menu although easily solvable but most of all that they want to reinvent the ui for every release for no clear reason outside of marketing at all
microsoft keeps trying to get me to update but they haven t managed to explain what makes w11 better or different than what i already have in w10 i don t use the baseline w10 taskbar for example and substitute it for classic shell s classic look i don t have an android phone i absolutely detest the macbook interface look i don t use virtual desktops my laptop is a back up computer that is completely incompatible with anything beyond w7 so swapping to it from my desktop sounds impossible i don t use widgets different for the sake of different is a good way of describing it for me
i recently switched back to w10 after using w11 for over a year been using it since public beta the only problem i had with w11 was the start menu would occasionally not register clicks and i would have to restart explorer or restart the pc and random performance niggles and occasional slowdown w10 feels snappier and more stable also it locked down my bios and i couldn t boot from usb and had to reset my bios and take the battery out
maybe it is just me i like w11
windows just seems like a weird release to me there are a ton of useful computers that aren t officially supported it is a very apple esque move by microsoft to try and force a hardware upgrade of this magnitude especially since apple s sunsetting has more to do with a continued transition to arm based cpu s while microsoft offers tabbed file explorer if i had to predict windows will be remembered as an underrated os that not many people will adopt windows looks to be the real os most people will migrate to
isn t this the skip every other os os
i m not getting it because of the taskbar and the start menu for decades we have been using the same taskbar industries are used to it workers have been using this same layout for ages and some dickhead product manager to justify his salary decided to say no we now have to fuck this shit up completely because it s different and i said so get outta here man and you can t change back to how it used to look they first fucked it up with the tiles then they fucked it up by making it look like an apple computer if i wanted an apple computer i d go get apple i ain t upgrading and if they don t bring the menu back shame on microsoft for their awful decisions
i like it i can t go back to file explorer has tabs tabs
i m convinced these posts are a microsoft psyopp to get people to talk nice about windows when most of us don t care all that much
i would just like a modern version of windows xp without the adware
you know what i liked vista more than
windows entirely cloud based monthly rate os only ssn and copy of id required for an account internet connection required for os access at all times windows defender permanently enabled and prevents installation of all non edge browsers for security purposes new anti hate speech cortana security to auto correct or mute as a fail safe all data of any kind that is potentially offensive repeat offender accounts banned from the cloud os cortana sorry peter dickinson your name has been flagged in the system as potentially harmful do you have an alternate name ok not sure confirmed your name cannot be updated for months for security purposes sorry your name does not match your id please wait hours to try again goodbye
same story every release happened with windows too eventually you will change to when comes out and complain about
if gaming on linux was at least viable i d be using it instead of windows viable no glitches or impossible to solve issues getting a game to work
don t worry ms gets it this one is forever tainted that is why they will rebadge it as windows and try again
i still miss xp to me it was good looking ran well at its time didn t have apps forced onto my ass and was pretty much working like it was intended to after that yeah vista didn t like that one was alright was disgusting it seems to be every other release that fucks everything up beta full release beta full release thats what it feels like
it really is that bad the random ads are the worst
windows is cool but it just needs some mods for functionality like nilesoft shell startallback
gif giphy 4n5ddoojj7gtktgnac
can t install it because my cpu isn t supported cool i m still playing the latest games with this rig all good
several steam games started having frequent crashes after i updated to windows civ and all have several crashes per play session when previously there were none outer worlds is unplayable with a ctd within minutes of booting up the game my older star wars games can t run
ain t that bad and has some nice little features w10 is already lacking for gaming it doesn t make much difference performance wise
i don t see why it s basically identical to its a massive nothing burger i ve had no issues with it
i like windows
i have literally zero issues with windows
windows is good and plenty stable will also benefit more from newer tech features like directstorage making better use of nvme ssds and reducing cpu overhead while loading games for example stop this nonsense
call me names but i kinda like windows
windows not only forces you to use onedrive by default but it also makes it extremely hard to fully disable it even after deactivating and unnistalling it most programs will still create files in user onedrive documents instead of user documents
can t trust the comments it s like everything is a fucking ad
literally just found out why my desktop shares aren t showing under my laptop s network it was because my desktop wasn t logged into a ms account cunts my damn vlc on mobile was able to access that shared storage but not my win laptop edit and now even logged into my ms account on each system i can no longer use the local password for the system i m trying to access and can t anymore fuck the pin and fuck the ms account bullshit i can t even select an option to log in via my damn password from the login menu it is correct but my other networked pc seems to disagree ms sure likes to inspire rage
the main thing i hate about win11 is the taskbar i want it to be on the top of my screen not even thrid party plugins allow this also when you for example want to unzip something with winrar you have to right click than go on this stupid view other options button to get to the old context menu it just feels unfinished in many ways same that they still run two different option menus something that is still a leftover from win10
win11 jumped the shark for me when i heard the home version of disk management doesn t allow you to extend and combine partitions you can slice off a new partition but cannot put them back together without third party software complete anti user nickel and dining garbage
atleast it s not windows
the last version of windows i had was windows xp and it was on a single core amd processor it s all ubuntu all the time now kids not a single regret
idk about you but as soon as windows gives me any advantage running games that doesn t require new hardware i m switching
so are we just crying about windows again or is something going on serious question
i finaly installed win it s better
i haven t had any issues the few times i ve used
i love it no issues on any of my units
if you like linux and got that arch wine setup i understand but if you hate windows otherwise it s just bandwagoning at this point
everyone hatin on win and i m here like yeah i use it
i like windows
windows is not that bad
im going to say something controversial i prefer windows to windows
i already know loads of people are gonna unfairly downvote me to hell but i actually quite like win like don t get me wrong i don t think it s perfect but for what i do on it mostly gaming it doesn t make anything more difficult and actually has more helpful stuff for me than win whilst for like working and doing important stuff on i do prefer win because it s just less simple clean if that makes sense
every windows that doesn t give me back my slightly modded to be fair win ui is a disappointment but i ll switch to one of those fewer ms services versions whenever i get around to do a cpu upgrade
i mean if you have a genuine hdr display it s no contest windows wins hands down
i have no issue with it been using it since day one
itt i hate windows because of insert thing you know you can change that easily i shouldn t have to windows should know
windows is fine i don t get the hate personally
it s better than except for the removal of taskbar labels in my opinion i the removal of several taskbar features was dumb really also itt people claiming windows is filled with ads everywhere when it isn t
when windows gets discontinued or whatever i should call it i ll probably just switch to linux unless windows has actually improved
i thought it was unnecessary too until i try it but it s not bad like vista or it is decent also it s still new so it can and will get better btw i just loved window controlling thingies you drag the window to the top and shows you shapes you can use also categories that windows base on that is so good
what is driver support what is games what is productivity what is virtualisation
as an it tech guy there are two lame parts of windows no local accounts in setup on win home this can be gotten around with some command line tricks limited options on standard right click apart from that win11 is fucking tight the file explorer and window management tools are excellent
the comments here are wild sure there are some things about the os that are strange but seeing all the comments about needing an online or ms account are hilarious how dare ms want me to use an online account they should respect muh privacy proceeds to login to a social media platform to complain about online accounts tracking ads and privacy wtf
i tried once there s a reason why i m on still
windows more like skip
aside from the loops you have to jump through to use local accounts it s not all that bad the only real issues are with some of the asinine ui changes like moving the volume mixer to the settings app when it should really be part of the toolbar the only two other problems imo is microsoft trying to shoe horn in even more ads analytics bullshit the bottom left of my taskbar on every screen has a bit taken up by the weather news tab which i often accidentally open because it pops out when the mouse cursor hovers over it which is annoying and the occasional sign up for xbox gamepass notification and the other is the slightly annoying inconsistency with notifications which i ve mainly noticed with discord where sometimes they stay in the notifications tray on the right and other times they don t which makes it annoying when you re trying to find a specific one and don t want to scroll through every discord server you ve joined with that said i wonder what windows would be like and if it could be to win what was to vista
i have a dedicated pc connected to a triple 4k monitor setup for sim racing i rebuilt last fall when i added trip 4k and it wants to update to but is stable only reason i am contemplating is auto hdr does anyone have any knowledge on and hdr did fix hdr issues
i had to buy a refurbished laptop for work to get windows pro instead of windows i already hate windows i can t imagine how much worse windows is i actually liked windows once i put powershell on it a lot i had mine behave like my beloved xp
when i can run all my games in linux i ll switch until then i m not running oses btw i do a yearly test to see how close linux is to achieving that goal it was very close this year
my wife accidentally updated her laptop to windows and now i just tell her that i m sorry i can t help you anymore
can someone tell me what the problems are i ve had since launch and i notice zero differences after about minutes of getting rid of the fluff i ve never seen an ad and all of my games run optimally even ones based in xp days
been using it probably over a year now at home haven t had any issues with it just another windows but looks a bit nicer last thing i m waiting on is the option for a traditional right click menu instead of the one that hides half the options besides that i just turn off the features you don t want which is most of them same as when i used w10
i ve essentially taken every windows upgrade when offered been using since release it has its quirks but it s not horrible
actually can t update to win with my current setup but why is it so bad
i ve had windows installed on my computer for a few months now and genuinely don t see what the problem is other than having to enable tpm in the bios which apparently is too difficult for people to do without having a meltdown as for the os itself i ve had no problems only weird thing i ve notice is windows explorer sometimes randomly opens on it s own but i d hardly consider that a massive bug stuff works as intended and i haven t a single blod
can i just say though that all operating systems kind of suck right now windows is not perfect and creates it s own problems i ve had registry and driver problems and experienced issues several times that have necessitated a full reinstall in the past year and a half windows has had a lot of growing pains and at least in my experience has had real performance issues linux is cool and customizable but once again has in my experience caused performance issues and makes using your device more complicated for those of us who are not linux masters and doesn t support many things natively which is helped by the advancements made in translation layers but is not fixed and still has limitations which is to be expected not saying it s wrong but yeah it sucks maybe this is not a sentiment shared by others but the last few years among multiple systems i have seen had and battled numerous random and frustrating issues caused by these os s and i have no experience with mac os but that is locked behind apple hardware which i do not use and cannot use for the games i play they all just kinda suck right now
they said windows was going to be the last version ever i don t like liars
i actually don t mind windows i think the settings ui is actually much more usable win s so minimal it hurts look still use cpl all the time since forever i also really like the graphical snap window to options that appear for specific view
full time arch and debian user here i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked about s ui i still had to use explorerpatcher and openshell to get it how i want but all in all it s a huge improvement from what i remember about s metro nonsense
linux never has this issue
i m still using wibdows when the support stop i m going to linux i already have dual boot to learn the os quirks and kde plasma like in steam deck and already play native linux games
new spyware just dropped
windows is better in almost every single way then windows and i use bother everyday windows has dark mode for notepad and task manager tabbed file browser better window management remembers where your apps were on each screen were before you unplug your monitors android app support and many more
do we think win will allow local accounts and non combined taskbar things
hopefully and hopefully it follow the trend microsoft seems to have created of good then trash then good then trash
yes
there s a quick registry edit that can fix that https://www.howtogeek.com/826967/how-to-disable-bing-in-the-windows-11-start-menu/
i dont have ads on my desktop and i use win11 what kind of iso did you all download
please get your ads off my frakking desktop win11 pro here what ads on my desktop never seen one of these ads people keep insisting ms has shoehorned into the os
what ads i don t see these ads i m being serious i have windows and dont have these ads everyone talks about
just like the win days lmao for some reason that statement is hilarious
just do ctrl shift esc it s a game changer
they rushed the windows release for some reason that s why it didn t have all the features of windows
i have recently started to get used to win x or right click the start button and it s a great help for these things example i hated that the tiled start menu has bad keyboard focus so you can t shut down the system with win up enter enter this had worked from win all the way to win now i just do win x u u
shit right click task manager is back i ended up pinning it to the taskbar
people have no need to complain about things when they go right https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negativity_bias).
opposite got a bad motherboard with bent pins sent it for an rma just days later newegg sent the same one back and told me to ask the board manufacturer for an rma instead after wasting weeks on the whole process no refund or rma offered stopped ordering from newegg afterwards
i had a bad motherboard bent cpu pins and gpu lock was broken did rma newegg accepted the motherboard i had was backordered for weeks asked for a refund to buy from someone else they accepted without hesitation sending bad board out saturday not a bad experience at all
lol
i also was sent a dead motherboard a new one arrived at my doorstep in less than days
yea i think i was just unlucky unfortunate for me but it s w e
faaar better than intel coolers https://i.imgur.com/tviif7p.png), that s for sure
need better no i agree it is enough need better yes noise normalized comparison https://i.imgur.com/wqimvfw.jpg) fan speed comparison https://i.imgur.com/qkh4xns.jpg) from gamers nexus https://youtu.be/ire8zvcjcnw)) aftermarket coolers are so much more silent
the non x variants of the series include coolers do make sure to modify the cpu cooler fan curve in bios tho otherwise the constant ramping in speed whenever you put any load on the system will have it attempt to fly to space xd
quite good is relative i used the cooler that came with my ryzen 3700x and it was wayy to loud for me
i ve had one cooling my 2700x for about years now can confirm it keeps everything cool and its not noisy
the difference between this and my aio is c
note that this cooler has a physical speed toggle switch i only found out months into ownership
i use the one that came with my ryzen 5600x and it s honestly pretty good permanently under 70c and it s quiet enough that i never notice it
have this cooler and its pretty good and beatiful imo on its top speed its very loud as in ps4 jet engine loud altho mine never gets to that
they keep even the 3900x resonably cool the problem is that they sound like a constant air raid siren
been using the one that came with my ryzen it s doing a fantastic job still to this day
finally somebody said it every time i ve seen somebody with a pcpartpicker list and they ve chosen a bloody 360mm aio to go with their or their 12600f i ve always told them to ditch the cooler repeat after me folks games aren t usually an all core workload and even when they use all the cores high usage is often only very brief you do not need any more than the stock cooler for gaming on most cpus and even if you do get a very powerful core processor a aircooler will work just fine for anything short of a 13900k if you really want your pc to be silent that badly then sure go liquid cooling but in almost any other scenario you don t need it and the money spent on that cooler is money that could go to something meaningful like a better graphics card more ram or a nicer case
deleted
the only gets the non rgb version
my 3900x came with one of those and it shit the bed like a month after the warranty ran out i d been eyeing a noctua dh so i just went and bought one
wraith prism is a beast
mine kept winding up and down obnoxiously so i bought a 240mm aio whisper quiet
note taken for later amd pc build
pffft i m gonna get a liquid freezer 420mm for a s being real will likely be getting one when i can afford to rebuild 7800x3d looks amazing for gaming
all the stock fans are just perfect for any last gen cpu in cooling terms also i made a test on the fans itself for a paper in the sound engineering career no it s not audio because is all about sound not just music and the ryzen fan only reached 19db in the anechoic chamber while the intel ones got 24db what makes the noise is not the fan or fans because multiple sources of the same noise doesn t add a significant amount of db is the case depending of the case the sound of the fans can reach up to 60db and the cooling properties can deteriorate more than in some cases so yeah the engineers won t make a bad cooler just to f ck up what took years of developing for a cpu want great temps and low resonance of the fans buy a thick metal case without any lose part or a full glass one
okay
my r5 3600x stock cooler is doodoo though
we do a little trolling here you should only use this on and lower anything hotter than that deserves a cooler minimum
i will second this i run mine with a slight overclock and no temp issues at all
i wouldn t say quite good perhaps adequate at least until you can purchase a better one it s ironic that each of the cpus comes with a cooler that is barely adequate for that cpu if you got the cooler for the next tier cpu instead it would make more sense
the amd wraith stealth cooler on the other hand is a piece of shit
i used the one that came with my ryzen 3800x and upgraded it because it got loud my noctua nhu12s is nearly silent and my temps are about 8c better
imagine using a stock cooler that just blows hot air back onto the motherboard
not for or core cpus
cpu get 70c all the time with aio guess what that little shit could actually do
i may have made a mistake of killing the one that came with my 3900x by blowing canned air onto the fan blades without securing the blades
not if you get that most simple cooler that doesn t work
supported by signalrgb
my lian li galahad took a dump on me with my 7700x i had to use the stock wraith cooler that came with my r5 and it keeps my cpu at around while gaming and being relatively noiseless
these were very loud fans
love my ryujin ii
i like it quiet thats why i went with a dark rock it literally does not even make a real sound at full load my gpu and case fans are louder
good cooler till the clips start breaking off after a few cleans
i prefer to buy cpu fan for example i have a tempest headpipe fan with only one fan and inter xeon v3 and anytime up to 65oc in gaming or stresstest benchmarks thats cool and fress
the wraith cooler that came with my 5600gs is pretty good last time i used stock cooler was fx8350 and it sounded like a jet engine
lol orly
quite good i need your definition for good because from the reviews those amd coolers are barely keeping up with their designed cpus even a cheap hyper is doing a way better job
they are loud tho remember they also don t like to play well with gigabyte fan curves so have fun if you re a ga user lol
i used a wrath stealth for my dad s 4600g build he s just doing web browsing and stuff on it plus he is deaf in one ear so just put that baby on the premade silent fan curve and it s not too bad i think i tried that one before and it was way too loud for me even on a custom silent fan curve
i got that cooler with my 3900x and it s still going strong with my 7900x absolutely great cooler
am i in the minority that doesn t mind my rig sounding like a leaf blower fighting a wind tunnel i don t hear shit with good headsets on and couldn t care less if it s loud when just farting around with my headset off
i had to slap one of those onto a 5950x and it held ip surprisingly well until i got a proper aio
i use the default wraith stealth that comes with my cpu and it does the job just fine
i feel like a smoker coughing on your cpu is better than an intel stock cooler
damn i did not know they would even go that hot i have the same chip but mine is watercooled i know overkill but it came that way i don t think it ever went above 70c
it s not necessarily that it s better than the intel cooler while it is better the main issue is the intel cpus are power hungry monsters that should only use liquid cooling to maximize performance the intel coolers are something but should never be used in a gaming rig
til there is an amazon basics am4 cooler
i use headphones i never hear my pc tbh
he says quite good when looking at the performance loudness is not in that category not invalidating your opinion tho
same case here i kept my 2700x which is the wraith for my new 5600x and i think is very loud which one do you use
you can always adjust the fan curve
x well there s your problem
wraith prism is very quiet if you set the hardware switch to hi more reactive rather than low then set smooth fan curve in bios limited to rpm until 82c it s not loud it s just counterintuitive to get it to be quiet
amd only bundles this cooler in the series for the 65w processors if i m correct for that tdp it s really good if the budget is tight then it s far better choice than wasting money for a better cooler
do you have pbo on because it was quite noisy when i used mine for my 2700x not too bad though and it cooled so well i kept it until my 5900x it now cools my brothers 5600x and even with pbo it s much quiter as the 5600x draws much less power
my pc startup time is getting slower and slower about sec now with the 2700x in it
this is my situation and why i went with an aio after years of using the wraith cooler i went with a 240mm aio that dropped my temps by c it s also just above silent with my
i d be hesitant to put an intel stock cooler on anything but the i3s at this point in time unless you re disabling the boosting features that being said yeah most of the time an inexpensive air cooler is probably fine but performance isn t the only reason people buy aios a lot of people prefer the look of an aio over a tower cooler
i have a 240mm aio on my server box with two 120x15 noctua fans for silence it s the cpu runs the same temp as the included cooler but it makes virtually zero noise only reason to go with an aio is sound and build style both my regular pc and server box are in formd t1 s so it s a size style thing for me
mate i know i could use a tower cooler or the stock cooler but i think they re ugly i rather build in s aio so it looks better
i plan to upgrade to a 2nd gen ryzen but for that i ll need to upgrade my cooling
huh i had no idea but you re right no cooler in box for 7000x cpus the non x variants appear to have a cooler included tho https://preview.redd.it/mgneowqke7sa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c45ab79dab2b0101f7a03e05b32ddc157258520d
that seems more like a fan curve problem
i have one and never seemed to have problems for years now highest temps i ever reach is about 60c might be kind of loud but doesn t bother me much
that sounds like you have poor circulation in your case for a pack of fans should sort that right out
and core ryzen cpu s don t come with a cooler hence the title of the post
that s intended behaviour for the 7000x cpus though they re all supposed to just clock as high as they possibly can without exceeding a c maximum temperature and then they just stay there for the duration of whatever workload you gave it whether they re being cooled by a 420mm aio or the stock cooler the non x models are all limited to watt tdps and hand in performance very close to their x series counterparts while also keeping temperatures way down so they would be perfectly fine to run with just a stock cooler
my first pc would overheat because of intels stock cooler
intel stock heater
intel says their chips are fine up to 100c https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/134587/intel-core-i512400f-processor-18m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz/specifications.html). i added a tower cooler and contact frame and i rarely see temps above 55c
should only use liquid cooling after this i installed a cheap 120mm tower cooler and the contact frame i rarely see temps above 55c so where i live a good air cooler was plenty
it is a debranded coolermaster h410r h412r
it s only recently come out and it s meh
noise level is actually very relevant and measured discussed when reviewing fans all the time
but then the cooler is no longer quite good in terms of cooling performance
it s a 60w tdp
i believe you re thinking about the wraith stealth spire
that sounds like an issue with your storage or the amount of bloat your os has acquired overtime it s not really fair to blame the cpu for it
bro i have and my monitor cant keep up when i press the chassy button i open monitor as soon as i open pc the window pin screen comes before my monitor is open
see i ve never really understood the aesthetics argument if you ve got a set budget wouldn t you want as much performance as possible for that budget looks be damned i ve always maintained that any money that goes to aesthetics is money not spent on performance so i can never truly get it that said though if you re that bothered by the look of an aircooler then feel free to go with the aio if it makes you happy
mentions the prism https://preview.redd.it/885k1nngf7sa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97dc09cc0dbe0ce8159b4adc8df75f337bcc605b
it is a fan curve problem haha guy gambled on a new fan curve by spending more money when you can just change it through software or bios or brute force through the old fan curve by lowering temp i guess no less dumb
i guess something s better than nothing
well actually i have fans and an aio on my cpu
i know but 70c all the time is better than running 9c all the time
air coolers are still fine for most of the intel cpus people are buying at least until this latest generation some of the wattages there are insane there are some solid air coolers out there i have an air cooled 10700k that works great
what cpu do you have on my 10400f the stock cooler was totally fine on my 13700k i have a dark rock accidentally didnt buy the pro whoops and it can hit exactly watts before it throttles hooray for accuracy but my temps are always insanely high it doesnt actually make a difference except when i start up hogwarts or something and it throttles but its unfortunate
it s meh i agree but it s still better than the wraith prism and by a notable margin
the post is aimed at new peeps and noise is way less important for a newbie usually
it is good enough for 88w parts if your case is not a hotbox ofc for 144w parts it will scream unless you want to cap the power
oh right it s the only still ran a bit hotter than the though or maybe the prism is just that more aggressive compared to the wraith
i actually cool my 3700x passively the 65w tdp is a lie but it still works good up to watts for me
i guarantee that cpu with a decent drive and an unbloated os will run circles around most use case scenarios for it including heavy gaming
how can i find my bottleneck then
where could be my issue
sounds like a hard drive
is everything still operational could be a loose case or a wire hitting a fan
if you had hdd i would guess it could be a in the process of failure drive usually when they start to get issues with the reading arm and it clicks like that as it s moving across the disk this probably isn t it but are your fans all flowing properly as in proper push pull airflow sometimes that makes noises kinda similar as well but i would guess it s a hdd
yeah everything s working normally at the moment
i would suggest opening it up and running it and seeing if you can see anything or identify which area the sound is coming from
i ll give it a check later ty
no problem
assuming you re the seller agreed buyer ain t having my old drives maybe offer to put one it for them obviously the price goes up by the cost of the new drive
this is like asking if the sellers old sheets come with the bed lmfao
to add more details this is an old build i have been using this pc for a while it was running all good until a few months ago when the pc would turn on but none of the peripherals would connect i changed the cmos battery and things went fine for a while then this happened now the pc just turns on and off continuously
was it running smoothly and then this started happening have you made any changes to it
yeah it was running smoothly until a few months ago the pc would turn on but the peripherals won t connect i changed the cmos battery and things were fine for a few months then this started happening
interesting definitely sounds like it could be power supply related i would try re seating the ram basically reseating everything and then if it s still not working then the cheapest thing to replace would be the psu do the fans on the gpu come on not a professional btw just what i would try
another thing you can do is put all your components into the pc partpicker website and see how much of your wattage you re using
what s your budget are you willing to take on the task of building it yourself i ll start with those questions
i m thinking around 5k aud honestly though i m not sure if that s a suitable budget for what i want i m definitely willing to build myself if that is more cost effective
did it work before do you know it is compatible can you plug the pc into a different monitor and check the display resolution settings 1366x768 is an unusual monitor resolution it is common on laptop displays
try to get into advanced boot options spam f8 as i recall some bios has enable low resolution video to boot up maybe that would help i dunno
it was working fine before but my friend changed the refresh rate on the monitor and it messed up the monitor works fine as we can access the bios section but not the windows
you ll have to change to monitor refresh rate back it must have an autodetect or user setting option somewhere in the menus not far away from the setting your friend changed last time
if something appears too good to be true
i would give it a shot maybe just a fellow gamer not needing it anymore i ve sold similiar things to similiar prices ratios x200b p s guck sie dir doch mal persnlich an wenn du kannst
it s germany many kinda rich people who don t care and just got something better ask if it works and get it if you need it
tbh i would risk it
it has only been used for months no mining it s like of used rtx sellers saying that
refurbs go for 170usd so seems pretty low
local pickup or are there extra costs for shipping i mean personally not a card i would consider but it depends on your budget and what you currently have if your picking it up i d want to see it installed in a pc and see it work
sounds like a fair price to me
any more pictures it looks a tad bit dusty for 3months of use but i can t tell cus of the resolution
how much money is victoria bitters
i personally sold mine for but i wasn t trying to be greedy
seems strange don t think it s a good idea buying one that cheap
ist not like i need it necessarily but i ve wanted to upgrade for quite a while now
yeah i git a super ventus ov for in germany i dont say its legit but it can be mine works already for around a year without problems if lossible test it
i got a used for half a year ago and then a for two months back prices are falling so if it fits your wants and needs why not
those cards were no joke i still have an 8600gts kicking around in an office pc
careful you might bend it and not be able to get on i am joking the latch on one of my side panels on my torrent bent a little bit so i have to push it down to attach it
my back hurts
sir your laptop will collect dust from the bed and start to overheat also i don t even mention that the soft spot will obstruct the air ventilation you need some platform to put your laptop on such as laptop cooling pads or something like that
toilet paper is missing
i think it s great a laptop computer can be hooked up to an external monitor if more screen real estate is needed whatever you find works for you and that s all there is to it happy to hear when someone is getting a desktop pc though because it s great but equally great is having a laptop on the desk and just using that as a workstation
this is my old setup but i bought a ikea desk my pc can sit comfortably
cable management
very clean and powerful
how are the temps with that cooler on the 5800x3d
very very clean might i say good work
lucky friend
that exhaust will be working overtime
nice selection of components gets me in the mood to build another system as well but none of my friends needs a new machine damn it
thanks the case helped a lot haha
unfortunately i didn t had the time to check the temperatures it was very late so i told my friend to monitor for me the temperatures so i can compare with mines same cpu
i have the peerless assassin se which is about the same to the non se my 5800x3d has the curve optimizer on for a constant stress test like cinebench the 5800x3d goes up to c and stabilises at 4350mhz instead of with minimal load so the loss is pretty much nothing on gaming there is no issues never above c even under that with an extremely quiet curve low speed on fans until then a bit more and max i don t remember the exact temps however i also changed to fans to p12 pwm pst there was no improvement on cooling but huge improvement on noise
it ll be fine fans are designed to spin
had this case for builds now makes cable management effortless
i have nearly the same between to on idle depending on the outdoor temperature average gaming on cinebench
strangely enough i don t remember it going to c the first time i tested it on cinebench months ago so either i m misremembering or i have no idea why the temps have increased from to
the only time i have reached was when i used cinebench on stock settings without pbo maybe pbo had been reset you might check it
the strange thing is that it still was in the asus bios so either something doesn t work with the pbo curve optimizer maybe something to check or a bios reset i have to do either cursed
on my side i did nothing bios side only pbo
how did you change the pbo curve optimizer then or did you mean you only changed the curve optimizer setting if not ryzen master
using pbo2 tuner it s a mini utility tool where you can adapt the curve and using a tutorial the only one available you can create a rule that auto launch the tool each startup so it trigger the custom curve

i would go with build
is amd really the way to go i ve heard good things i m just so torn
amd has been doing pretty well but they are still behind in the rt department the rx xtx destroys both the ti and in rasterization performance the and xtx has about the same rt performance the main reason i d choose the xtx is because of the vram on both the nvidia cards 12gb gpu for is not cutting it and there is no way in hell 10gb of vram will be enough in the future now that 8gb of vram is starting to struggle
i don t know what the cause of the sound is but you should rotate your rear fan to exhaust it s currently set to intake and pulling air in you can theoretically make a rear intake front exhaust build and it should work but your cpu fan is set to blow air to the back so the hot air is just being trapped and recycled over there i wouldn t be surprised if the higher temps are causing the fans to hit higher rpn which could be what s making the noise
that is the sound of too many fans spinning fast something is overheating or misconfigured possibly the fan orientations or fan power curves
sounds like it could a shot bearing in one of the fans pop the side panel off and see if you can isolate where the noise is coming from
thank you i will try that
thank you
ssd better cpu more ram

i think ram is the issue
more ram won t help much without the other two
wonder where on reddit we ll see apost with juat got this ryzen thing when i ordered a lens for my iphone
happened to me too contact amazon they will give you a refund it is annoying tho sorry it happened
i learned from my amazon attempt last summer when i got shipped a hair tie instead of my aorus m drive its even funnier when i got sent a replacement and it was another hair tie then i had to argue with amazon they were sending me hair ties and when i shipped them back they thought i was stealing product gee i wonder why the label on my package read it weighed a few grams at best sorry about your issue but i try to buy my tech from a store now especially when its expensive shit
i noticed some pattern with amazon in the uk bought quite a lot of different stuff past year and the only damaged parcels were ones that require digit code at delivery one time ok can happen times suspicious but makes a pattern it s quite obvious that these orders are of highest value days ago i had new nvme delivered cardboard envelope clearly punctured with finger so someone can take a peak inside not big enough to take it out drive was inside delivery guy was a bit shady trying to hide damage under his armpit as he asked for the code god damn should i record every delivery
some other dude who ordered that got like s and he s like darn what do i do with this
on the upside the power draw will be much lower
i ve ordered ram month ago got some screen protectors then amazon gave me a refund after the refund i ordered the same ram again and got the same screen protectors im pissed with amazon had to buy from local store for more since i couldnt wait anymore
noo why do i have to see this right now im going to pick my 5800x3d package up later hopefully i have more luck than you
i had the exact same item delivered for me when i bought a 4070ti
there are times when one orders one thing and gets a whole dozen pack of em others get even a much better deal than they asked for and sometimes we have these the perfect balance
why people keep doing business with scamazon is beyond my comprehension
lucky son of a bitch
i have no idea why everyone buying from amazon they have the highest prices they don t give a shit about the package are u some kind of brainwashed or what only the amazon exist brainwashed society we are doomed
well totally of topic but i ordered a carpet shampoo machine and received some ear plugs
employees must be taught to go by the barcode sticker not the actual package is what i assume
what the
at least amazon will sometimes refund exchange the item while newegg will charge you a restocking fee to make the item your order and your money disappear forever
it s organized theft there are whole organized crews that exchange expensive things with cheap shit and amazon knows they just calculated that it s overall cheaper to just send another one after the customer claimed the false delivery instead of investing time to find the thieves had the same happen to me with apple products bought on amazon and the helpline literally told me this
this happened to me too literally the same item for a 13900k the best part is that i bought from the amazon choice vendor i will never buy any electronics from amazon anymore
haha right another redditor posted the same thing as me same cpu and same lense protector
that thing would be posted on a iphone sub so keep an eye out
i was literally thinking this as i opened comments and this is the first thing i see lol
hahah my next post is gonna be melted plastic on my mobo asking for support
yeah i had to do some digging but i found the seller ameiseye review page on amazon and there s like pages of people getting this exact screen protector instead of cpus and gpus amazon did a strikethrough on all those reviews and provided a response saying how it s amazon s fault and not this seller that they screwed up because i was trying to think oh the screen protector is about the size of a cpu chip maybe an automated picking sorting machine at the warehouse made a mistake but then the cpu comes in a bigger box so that didn t make sense also the fact that people were getting the same screen protectors but ordering gpus which are for the most part much bigger packaging than cpus also didn t corroborate my suspicions i m thinking it s some it or website listing issue or the warehouse workers are stealing
guess they have these stocked up in the pc parts storage racks

hey lesson learned i m new to the pc scene and the part picker website seems to find the cheapest parts first which after many different build configurations most of the parts were suggesting amazon best buy target walmart we re all more expensive i m taking a trip to micro center today or tomorrow which have the 58003dx at but it s about mins away
my guy getting downvoted here for speaking straight up fax
yeah i thought that too the problem is they refused to send me a replacement and said sorry third party seller nothing we can do we can offer you a free ups return i told them i want a replacement at the price i paid for because the next 5800x3d on your site is with tax they said sorry we can give a full refund that s it
always find it crazy when people get like i7s from amazon and then people like you get someone else s order which is of lesser amount
i didn t want to offensive just is see almost everyday here and other platforms that the amazon how fucking up the packages and i never unemderstood why people buying from there and of course i m not livinn in usa here in europe a lot of things different about the online purchases i mean we have other options not just amazon we have a lot more options here
there s gotta be shenanigans either at the third party seller level or amazon warehouse worker level it s too coincidental that another redditor mins before my post posts the same exact cpu they ordered and the same exact bogus screen protector thinking the 3rd party seller is somehow getting past amazons purchasing screening
no worries wasn t offended yeah in the us and from what i was finding amazon is typically the cheapest and it s easier than driving to the city where micro center is newegg seems to be a good online alternative but it s a bit more expensive i think i ll be taking that min drive for any future high end parts
you try switching dimm slots do that reset cmos double check your psu cables if its modular could be missing something simple you are missing just by being annoyed

super awesome game i gave the kill challenges my all early game and end game was awesome with the buffs and stuff
chatgpt being nice with a bit outdated lol it s pretty much right though that 2500k is going to hold you back big time even with just a there will probably be games where it s fine but an upgrade would serve you well i m just guessing here but if you bought a i m guessing you don t want to spend too much i d try to get a older ryzen cpu motherboard ram combo on the cheap like or so try to pick one with a half decent motherboard that has pin cpu power so that you have more room to upgrade later also what s the wattage on your power supply
so what should i aim for first the motherboard i ll probably look up some youtube videos in a bit but i m hoping the process isn t too difficult
also what s the wattage on your power supply i m not sure
a motherboard by itself won t do you any good you need all you re buying a new motherboard so that it can take the new cpu and the ddr4 ram that you ll need as well
oof okay out of curiosity i looked at canada computers and they do offer installations and stuff but they charge quite a bit for the service for a mb installation for a component installation for additional components after the first so i d save by doing it myself either that or i enlist my brother for help who does this stuff for fun
try running stress tests on the main components ram cpu video etc individually to see where the weak spot is lots of different software to do this make sure your power supply is large enough power supplies do go bad from time to time
were you able to refund the r15 to your comment of paying less for more yeah that s commonly known around here with prebuilts also pics of your build
yes took a month but i am in germany were you have two weeks to return an item if you cut as many corners as they do then i would expect you to be cheaper the case was pure plastic link to my build post in this sub https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/127du9i/first_notprebuild_i_might_have_overdone_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
glad they refunded and the pc looks great
thanks
so it has no gpu no storage and probably worthless components why would you pay for it then just because you like the case if i m not mistaken alienware pcs use proprietary motherboards which means you will have trouble even using the case take a pass
it is interesting but yeah the case is the only selling factor and you will end up paying for the gunk inside i am curious about that 25inch display though

that s why i decided to ask i meant it does have a not that it changes much i was curious about its value and it looked cool of course aesthetics isn t necessarily a reason to buy it unless i m actually getting my moneys worth it s unfortunate if it does use a proprietary motherboard though it renders it pretty much worthless unless you re a collector
that s why i decided to post i didn t know any of the specs and i haven t found this specific model yet really sucks about the old parts though if they were more modern it would probably be a steal i did notice that display too
i m definitely not in the financial situation to pay for only a case i was hoping for at least decent internals so i could sell them and keep the case and maybe have paid a reasonable price i think it has something like an i7 if it s the same model as the ones i ve looked at if that s it s true means definitely it s not worth it
its a dell its proprietary other than the graphics card its not really a upgrade from what you have currently the i7 hyper threads and the i5 does not but both have cores and both run at relatively the same speed not sure what memory is in the dell alienware
if the i7 was an american child it would be entering it s first year of high school this september
i forgot about my flair it s my secondary build lol should probably change that i was really hoping it wasn t proprietary if it s near the same as my build than it can still run quite a few games but i play others like sea of thieves and mw2 not to mention it would be a huge downgrade i m going to be honest i assumed the i7 was worse but for that price i could find a whole other system on fb or ebay

every game will act differently when you launch back to home screen for a moment some are smother than others if the game genuinely crashes or the artifacts persist once youve returned to gameplay then i would look to your clock settings and dal them back a step it s not a worry if it doesnt cause genuine issues
its normal alt tabbing seems to be the work around
that s good to hear i ve only noticed these alt tab games in these games and these artifacts do not persist when i return to gameplay or return to the desktop some games do crash when i alt tab doom crashes when i alt tab too but it seems that s a common issue with this game do you think that s more of a gpu issue or a game issue in that case
some games have beautiful slick elegant clean code they happily desktop without any mess or fuss other games have ugly clunky dirty buggy code and some games are simply hostile to the idea of users daring to tab or minimize them at all they weren t written to tolerate it they don t like it they arrogantly try to prevent it blizzard has a long tradition of being heavyhanded about this they ve argued many times for many games that it s an anti cheat mechanism which as usual does nothing to stop the cheaters while it frustrates and aggravates the legit players
it s good to hear that s normal then and what do you mean by alt tabbing being the work around
alt tabbing seems to have no issues

scam pc
well you already bought it no point in asking if it s a good deal or not
it s not horrible is it also where the hell is it at
how is there no point i was just curious to know and it seems it wasn t
yes super is horrible you should return it and buy a used rig off craigslist with a series card for the same price or less lowball anybody with a nice computer on craigslist and see what you can stir up super is good enough for like fortnite but wouldnt work for any cod or real games
no its not horrible if you are gaming 1080p you should be able to run most games released in the past few years at least on minimum settings it s not great for the long run but it will definitely suffice you
it s just that ppl do this a lot on this sub users that spend a goods amount of time here get tired with it i already spent my money without doing any research online what do you experienced gamers and pc enthusiasts think and then it s an obviously bad deal like you got and about an hour on youtube could have prevented it not trying to be harsh but it s so common as to be comical
yeah i don t quite want to buy used
it works well on a lot of games warzones fps isnt great unless u play on low but that was months ago idk bout now and there trash isnt very optimized anyway or wasnt at least i can play cyberpunk on medium fps
well i did do some research and i thought it was decent for what i needed but i do understand where you are coming from
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/skytech-gaming-blaze-3-0-gaming-desktop-pc-intel-core-i5-10400f-16g-memory-amd-radeon-rx6600xt-500g-ssd-white/6499428.p?skuid=6499428 this has a better gpu in it for the same money but it s not a fantastic deal either and supers go for around used
update shop saw that and said yeah that s warranty let me order a replacement
a glorious death
oh god i have one of these i don t think i got a warranty
the ssd checks
its a design flaw on all motherboards look at the screw hole you can see the grinded solder and guess where those grinded solder goes it will lodge somewhere and cause shorts if you dont understand anything about electronics or repair you will find this comment nonsense
it has been tomahawk d
good old msi
kaputt
your lucky guy in a unlucky way
oh no i got the x570s i ve heard about this board from linus and a few others stating it had some problems so i chose not to get it
well i m about to pull a fast one on msi will get my replacement board throw in my msi aio which is super loud and sell those and get myself something asus or gigabyte
i had a gigabyte motherboard i think it s called a b450 it s a mini itx mobo super tiny had a mini itx build a while ago when i was otr i put it in my gfs pc and dude the thing runs like a champ still to this day amazing mobo i keep it on only the best of psus and never ran it with a shit one and it s always worked just like the day i got it
yeah i m hearing horror stories about msi boards from my friends now known deaths in years by people is rather alarming
hmm i haven t had any issues with mine but when i bought mine i did a lot of extensive research and googling and videos to see which was the most reliable i made sure before a big purchase like that cause after all the motherboard is just as important as your gpu and cpu
why we need launcher if buy game on steam i am fed up with this launcher mess
right it did this to me to play nfs heat on steam about two weeks ago or so yes it s already frozen once failed to sign me in a couple of times and crashed several times the old app never did this improvement
most of the time i wish all launchers except for steam would die off
went from ea installer to origin app back to ea app i had to check box compatibility run every exe as administrator and fix a couple of missing firewall admittances in windows to get it to work
ea should make a banking app
ever since they switched to the ea app none of my ea games work now
fucking garbage piece of shit app i just tried to play mass effect and my system crashed because of this trash ea sucks at everything
rip origin
the ea app is one of the worst pieces of software i ve perso ally used
origin app was better they re just abusing the ea app as an advertising platform
this isnt new ya know lol origin still works for games that work with origin but origins launcher shutdown months ago
to install
u can still go back to orgin lol
oh i missed this news what has ea done now
was against ea app as well since it bugged out on me during a round of all games was removed and i was forced to install origin to get em back however started getting the same prompt and switched back to ea app again and it has worked fine since that
every single time i am tempted to play those cool star wars games i remember this very thing and then i play something else i haven t played bf2 in forever because it never ran right so just more reasons to not do it ever
congratulations you can now no longer play any of the games offline yay for the upgrade
oh you got a choice to download it mine just appeared one day after an update on steam to bf2042 and now half the time when i launch from steam the game doesn t load so i have to use the ea launcher for a game i bought on steam
i swear while origin was an incovenience because it was just another launcher with no added benefits it gave me the least amount of problems after steam
ahh yes the superior app that tries to tell me that i now don t own alice madness returns after something years
ea app doesnt acknowledge battlefield dlcs so you can only play the base game
and the ea app is 10x more broken than origin ever was
for those who don t whant to switch from origins to the worse ea app do this uninstal ea app if installed download origin open origin do not update log in and select stay sign in quit origin completely go to programdata origin and find local xml open local xml with notepad now copy this setting value true key migrationdisabled type setting key updateurl value ea sucks type setting key autopatchglobal value false type setting key autoupdate value false type put it just above the last line settings save then close final note some games have the ea app installer in their files to force the switch but you just have to delete it watch out because update and checking for integrity will redowmload the file
same thing happened when they moved from ea downloader to origin same shit different app
ea s launchers are such a mess was forced to create a new username in order to connect to my xbox account to play ea gamepass games so now i have two separate accounts one for that and whatever my old origin one was so bad
ea app also doesn t allow you to located already installed games
thousand launchers for every single game tired of this
beyond it just being the oldest i think steam excels by feeling more like a windows explorer type application instead of these other ones that feel like advertising hubs by seperating your library from the store and being able to start steam directly to your library instead of the store page you don t feel like you are bombarded with attempts at getting you to spend money at least those are my personal feelings on it
can t wait for my game launchers to just turn into a fucking cable service with all this shit bundled into one
i wonder if ea app lets you report cheaters now a year or so ago i had to launch bfv through origin in order to report cheaters since ea app didn t allow for it
this new app crashes daily and never remembers log in credentials even though i click stay logged in damn ea
i hate ea s new launcher why did they replace origin with a pos sad excuse of software when the last one was working fine
to clarify when it says home it s more like the half tipped over outhouse with a broken door and a rattle snake that locks eyes with you
can you still log in with origin account i haven t used it in ages
thing i dont want to do learn more the amount of irrational fury this causes me
yup they re finally forcing everyone onto the ea app x200b recently got the itch to play sims one of the addons wouldnt install ea app just said try again later one method i found was to force an app check through origin well luckily it went through the check anyways but i couldnt actually get into origin
the ea app isn t bad but i wouldn t call it superior to origin either lol
on top of having to use ea launcher you have to create an ea account as well an instant refund for me
and it makes the game take like twice as long to start too
ea s back at it again
sometimes the ea app will refuse to sign me in telling me to try again later waited a couple hours maybe their servers were down or something still won t let me in restart my computer it lets me in first try happens probably in times i open the launcher
it s stupid if i buy game i want it to play without hassle i don t want to spent hour setting it up
i ll keep gog around
launchers yeah storefronts no gog good
i wish all launchers would die off why would i need to have drm launch alongside my single player game
for real as much as i don t like companies having a monopole on a market i d probably make an exception for this time steam is not flawless but goddamn are the others dogshit i guess i would also keep battle net because it s actually quite good too
steam is still pretty meh as a game launcher it s just that every single other launcher sucks such ridiculous amounts of crap that it s good by comparison
steam is trasher than all of them and actually started the fucking trend of digital only games on launchers
you gave ea administrative rights on your computer that sounds like a pot of gold waiting to happen
ever since they did i can t open my games because the launcher always crashes
origin was a giant advertisement app too or at least since they changed it from ea downloader to origin what ea app is meant to do is replicate xbox game pass allowing subscription service
not true i have sims best sims and all expansions on origin but now that ea is involved origin literally does not run anymore i know this because i still had the old origin installer and did a fresh install without ea files on my pc and the first thing that it did was prompt me to download ea installer only way for this to work is uninstall everything ea and origin but keep the game files separate outside of program files then you can literally go into steam and add a non steam game then run it from steam easy peasy works like a charm for those but not sure about other titles
only using some janky files edit to prevent updating origin and installing the origin launcher from a full installer coming from some website with a janky way to do it
killed origin for ea app
i created mine when i was forced to have one to play online in mass effect on xbox
this is worse than the launcher issues for me all the fucking accounts tied to launchers lost my rainbow siege account due to this always played it on steam one day they tie the ubisoft launcher to it i don t remember ever making a ubisoft account all my progress all my operators lost i could get it back with some hassle but i m not taking up an hour of my time to do that after work i get a hour or two for games i don t have time for that bs with every single ubisoft or ea game
an instant pirate for me
i never understood why people get so annoyed by the other launcher running in the background like with this or uplay sure i d rather and would prefer it all be native to steam especially because everytime ubisoft updates uplay it breaks my steam deck but it s not that big of a deal imo most of the time it loads in the background and i never actually see the other launcher i m only annoyed that my achievements are tied to uplay and they don t put them on steam
we ve gone too long without an ea fuckup so they had to come back and deliver
agreed i wasn t really including gog when i posted my original comment
steam and epic are really the only two needed battle net isn t really like them and so far no other launcher is they re the only that have games outside of their publisher that i know of
i know right wouldn t work without it
you can say not true but it is true if you saw your email ea sent an email half a year ago stating they are shutting down origin and it s services on jan and ever since that date past all there games were updated and no longer has the origin launcher is gone even if you go to their origin website it s gone however you maybe right for the workaround
there a simple file that u can edit in orgin to provent forcing you to swich i did just that and am still playing apex legends whit orgin
i created mine when most were toddlers jk needed an account for command and conquer renegade
that s normal it will spin when it feels is getting hot that it s call rpm mode
i d see how other similar models react but imo this isn t any cause for concern as long as the fan spins as necessary under load no damage could be getting done here as i see
is the fan pin or pin if it is pin you should disable pwm mode smart mode for that header
that s how i personally have my computer set up it s way more quiet
that would be the case but i set it to performance mode in the bios
it s a pin fan usually it wouldn t bother me but the fact it tries to spin at the start is the thing worrying me
it should be fine tho maybe fans take a little to start sometime as long as your temps are good i don t see the issue
you should check the bios setting for that header make sure it s in pwm mode if it is then i would look for video reviews of this particular cooler and see if the reviewer has footage of startup i wouldn t worry too much
it s so fast you can t see it moving
it s running at zero fps tho
surprise it s doesn t flicker
ah yes the danger indicator to remind people they re about to step overtop of something that could potentially eat them
rtescalator
human feet can only move at 24fpm
op doesn t have fast pc
totally overclocked
99ms latency
it is in sleep mode
