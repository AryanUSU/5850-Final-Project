vanguard positive outlook void precision auto rifle tl dr a void auto is finally arriving
well look at that a new void auto in years also i m definitely in need of that strand linear so to gambit i go next season and it looks like iron banner is finally getting new weapons again
i m begging for randy s to get kinetic tremors sounds like the perfect archetype for that perk
randy s throwing knife kinetic rapid fire scout rifle ooo i love this weapon really happy it s coming back
i guess destiny lore vault is gonna get murdered
bungie just told us that we can t upload cutscenes anymore
loaded question returning
i do like that they re hosting their own archives of old cutscenes though it looks like it s just the full proper cutscenes instead of any of the conversations you get in between like helm convos i m also not a fan of this little line we ask that you leave the cutscenes up to us we totally understand and allow clips to be used during your video creation for motw or other content creations needs but full cutscenes will need to remain on our channel so like if someone makes a full seasonal story compilation that includes both the cutscenes and the conversations in between so it s not just a bunch of disconnected conversations is bungie going to strike their videos or something
leaks keep proving to be right
im glad solo nez got motw
strand fusion rifle heavy breathing give it to me
time to get the perfect messenger to go with my season of the chosen messenger and also my witch queen messenger
with braytech and randy s being mentioned the leaks are pretty much confirmed at this rate
can i share my recordings on youtube too we ask that you leave the cutscenes up to us we totally understand and allow clips to be used during your video creation for motw or other content creations needs but full cutscenes will need to remain on our channel can t think of any other game that doesn t let people upload their cutscenes this is some archaic nintendo shit lol also just glanced at one of the videos no subtitles no other languages i guess people who wanted those can just go screw themselves
any other veterans tired of guns constantly being cycled in and out can t say i m excited at all for the 4th reissue of messenger
there s one burn that will cause you to receive more damage from a certain element threat aren t these called threats now cutscenes are here sweet but can we get this functionality in game too so we can see our guardian in those cutscenes again
new vanguard weapons would be nice getting old seeing reissued content be updated
i am very excited for loaded question to return it is by far my favorite weapon in the game i just really hope some sort of buff for high impact fusions happen because the charge time does not feel very good in pve
can we please get some new weapons for the nightfall loot pool also cannot believe that they removed messenger only to bring it back yet again presumably with a new perk pool it s growing exhausting grinding for the same weapons again just because they ve been revamped rather than giving us new interesting options
braytech osprey void high impact rocket launcher loaded question arc high impact fusion rifle seriously is it illegal for nightfalls to get a new weapon or something was this outlawed by the geneva convention i m willing to admit i m going to get memed on r dcj for that one but still we haven t gotten a bonafide new weapon yet just one please edit don t get me wrong there have been some bangers like hung jury and randy s coming back is big but still can nightfalls get one single new weapon please
when the fuck are we getting the igneous hammer back
anyone else have a mixed relationship with the braytech osprey it was the last thing i needed for wayfarer and it took so many runs of nokris
the avalon exotic mission and the vex incursion public event on neomuna still have a good chance of crashing before the activity is completed please look into this bungie i still don t have a single vexcalibur catalyst because my game has crashed during the mission every single time i ve attempted it
strand fusion from ib is absolutely something i ll farm out regardless of perk pool been loving voops lately and need one for strand gambit strand lfr should be cool though i wonder what it s perk pool will be i havnt farmed gambit for several seasons in a row so i might hop in both for this gun and the others i haven t cared enough for in the recent past
randy s throwing knife is back lets goooooooo
it s raining loot ironic
with a trials glaive coming next season i will once again ask the bungie team to acknowledge the truly terrible state glaives are in currently they are by far the worst pvp weapon in the game currently with the last two trials weekends both of which were on good maps for glaives had glaives coming with barely a burnout weekend and barely a 3rd jav weekend of the number of kills as trace rifles the previous weapon widely regarded as the worst special weapon type in pvp they simply cannot do anything fast enough to keep pace with the direction the crucible is being pushed the glaive guard cannot be raise in time to be relevant against almost any relevant smg and slide shotgun melees can close the gap on a glaive well before their second shot can get off even when the guard is raised you can still be easily blown up by shotgun melees and fusion rifle bursts in addition to all of this the glaive projectiles still feel absolutely terrible to use in pvp in particular against people with a modicum of skill in varying their strafe please as someone that loves glaives and desperately wants to be able to use them effectively at the skill level i have been placed at at least acknowledge their poor performance
it s raining loot me who just spent hours grinding bounties and gold patrols to try and get red border pneumonia weapons and got red border huh also me who spent hours grinding legend master lost sectors and got zero exotics huh
gambit not dead confirmed strand linear fusion rifle where my reckoners at reckoner naysh
now we just hezen vengeance with an origin trait and the trifecta of dps rockets is complete the hothead adept braytech osprey adept hezen vengeance timelost
man when is palindrome coming back
glad messenger is returning hope they don t mess up the perk pool
bungie actually said the word gambit in a twab they do know it exists
bungie asking that we leave uploading cutscenes to them when it s basically been up to other people doing it for years because of how much story stuff gets tossed in the content vault feels weird
removed
so do we even know what day the mid season patch is
braytech osprey strange terrain wayfarer farm ptsd flashbacks
ahhh another arc glaive really all we want is a kinetic stasis strand glaive primary ammo is that too much to ask please bungie my wish would be for it to be stasis with chill clip or cold steel being able to stun overload unstoppable champions would be amazing i love my karnstein armlets and necrotic grip builds with glavies winterbite s projectile does too much self damage in close proximity which isn t ideal and i just prefer the projectile shield combo better on the other glaives they leave your heavy slot open too for better safer damage options
praise the traveler we re finally getting a new void auto rifle
i m really hoping loaded question comes with auto loading reservoir burst there s tons of different rolls out right now for fusions that offer higher uptime for reservoir burst but that roll meant a lot to me on the original weapon
y all weird af for asking people to not upload cutscenes lmao
positive outlook returning is pretty cool will i use it probably not but it was always my preferred option over uriel s gift and the others when 450s were good in year
if loaded question comes back with alh and rb and i have to refarm for that roll instead of being able to use my 37k kill tracker old version to me that will prove that sunsetting was a scam not that i feel like waiting an hour for my high impact fusion to charge anyways
i will still be uploading my playthroughs of seasonal content cutscenes and all i archive it because they can t keep it in the game because some people might want to catch up on vaulted story because some people can t be at their systems for extended periods of time and would like to keep up and because some people myself included just want to be nostalgic it ll be hilarious if they try to take action against channels like my own we are literally keeping the story of this game held together for them also what s the point of fashion endgame if you can t share clips of your guardian in cutscenes that was just a silly bit in the twab everything else seems awesome
an energy sniper from comp to pair with the hand cannon you got from comp daring today aren t you bungie inb4 the sniper is just an energy version of revoker but you have to grind for snapshot reversal of fortune this time we ve come full circle the more things change the more they stay the same
a glaive in trials na bro ima pass on that
really appreciate bungie posting past seasonal and expansion cutscenes however will they also be including some of the additional patrol activity voicelines that come with each season or leave that for channels like destiny lore vault also there s the fact they should probably archive these for different languages idk i guess i appreciate the effort but if they re not gonna upload the whole seasonal experience i d rather them not bother with telling people not to upload their own videos preserving these storylines literally if anything just hire them or smthn if you re not committed to going all in idk
ok the incoming weapons confirms all the leaks are true
shoot to loot collecting orbs changing artifact perks without having to full reset love it it says you ll be able to refund and apply them individually so hopefully that means they ll be tied to loadouts too
my xbox still crashes when i go to the commendation page can t seem to find that on any of the known issues lists supposedly they fixed it but its not fixed
where is the raid adept enhancing update it was supposed to go live the week after master ron released edit never mind the crafting blogpost said a few weeks after
bungie sure is dangling strand weapons to get people into gambit not that i mind though they can string me along all they want
don t know if this is the place to be posting this but the preservation mission from the bounty board for the throne world doesn t spawn in the director or world itself unfortunately if players want to complete the quests from this board this seems to be a hard block to progression
lol at all of these new guns thanks bungie so glad that sony money has been put to good use and not just the eververse store
hey that weapon i paid for before and they inexplicably took away for no reason is coming back hooray set the bar so low that you can t disappoint
u destiny2team can we please get an answer on if there s any plans at all of s3 ib ornaments returning really don t wanna hold my breath for it if there s no chance of it coming back thanks
i currently cannot play destiny due to too much life stuff going on ive been keeping up with the story by watching story recaps featuring dialog cutscenes ect by telling people that they cannot do this anymore means i will potentially be missing out on the story please dont forbid people from uploading story content to their channels a lot of us guardians that are tdy cannot currently play the game and its the only way to keep up with everything
man i hope randy s still has its original roll available i still ruin peoples days with it in non power enabled activities
so the changes to resetting your artifact are ok but can we have it so they save and change with our load outs instead of having to physically go in the artifact and change them that s the qol change i think most of us wanted with the artifact
we ask that you leave the cutscenes up to us we totally understand and allow clips to be used during your video creation for motw or other content creations needs but full cutscenes will need to remain on our channel the fuck is this bullshit x200b too far bungie x200b too far
damn i was really hoping for igneous hammer to return to the trials loot pool with some new perks maybe even with some good pve perks this time not looking forward to seeing the return of yet another 340rpm pulse rifle to dominate crucible
oh thank god a void rl that s not a precision frame hoping it has good perks tired of red herring
i wanna guess that the comp sniper is going to be longbow pretty sure it was arc too in d1
the sniper is longbow synthesis
does this mean i don t need to do legendary lost sector anymore to get exotics that i don t have on my knockout list and what is a knockout list
this week at bungie we re ignoring your pleas about gambit again
ok i need to know what do i need to do to get clever dragon back in the game
so why are non conquerors only able to do one nightfall a week seems silly
so many reissued weapons pretty embarrassing that bungie has become so creatively and morally bankrupt they can t help but we ll us the same crap over again
gotta be honest i was getting pumped on the thought of each season bungie returning a few of the old gambit weapons bummer but let s see if this new strand fusion have a good perk combination
bungie threating content creators to not upload archival content anymore when those content creators have been the only reason destiny is even understandable to any new player is insane these devs geniunely do not deserve anything they get out of this job
randy s is back baby
jesus effing christ another ar another for damn sake
they don t want people uploading cutscenes to youtube anymore and their solution is they ll upload cutscenes themselves every few months tf is wrong with bungie
fuck the thing about the cutscenes i want my cutscenes with my guardian in it not some random character i want the possibility of watching these cutscenes years from now and remember the good times with my guardian in it this is stupid
ironic how they call the prime stuff it s raining loot when drops are so incredibly scarce this season
why is it that gambit iron banner and trials are getting interesting new weapons and once again gm s are getting boring adept weapons when are we going to see some new and or interesting weapons instead of another rehashed fusion that ultimately will be used in pvp anyways i just want some adpet pve weapons for pve
to anyone getting over hyped for some returning weapons there are lots of alternative in the game with same archetype right now if you aren t using them right now reprisals of these weapons probably won t change anything either
let us change our bungie names again plz mine has my deadname in it and i d love to change it to something more comfortable if possible
looks like the leaks were correct about the returning new playlist weapons
conqueror gilding node is still planned for week come on man conqueror s have had such a short end of the stick such as the years of an arbitrary power requirement for a contest mode activity a requirement not shared with other end game activities the recent changes are welcomed but regardless why can dredgen show off a gilded seal as soon as they physically can but conqueror s get time gated why are gm s so taboo to bungie
when is the mid season weapon update nbsp also i know it s because it s a reissue but why is the braytech rocket an inferior frame for that matter why is high impact less damage than aggressive adaptive i ll go along with lower damage for the built in homing of precisions but high impact doesn t offer anything much different from the other in order for it to be less damage why would i use this over red herring aside from getting big ones spec
the expectation from expansions forsaken onward was that we d get new weapon models lightfall neomuna is the first time since forsaken that we got reskinned weapons moon sod is the first season since dawn where we got reused weapon models bungie had set the expectation that we d be getting new models etc with paid content i e destination weapons raid weapons seasonal weapons and now they are seeing how little they can do to get away with it ex new raid sidearm is literally the seraph sidearm with growth on the front bungie you want variety make new weapon models like you ve done every season up until the past month make new weapons for nf and strikes or bring back some weapon models from d1
it s raining loot barely
there it is as predicted the main body reiterates things in articles posted on days not thursdays rendering the twab near useless
yea leaks are true i m already getting flashbacks from farming spare rations can t wait to do it again
hey bungie please fix severance enclosure for berserker
updates to more than exotic armor pieces are coming next season unwritten inference is that of those updates will be bad and will be neutral
for the love of god bungie please stop with the glaives i promise you won t convince me to use them by continually adding more each season
iron banner this week is so lame
say something about the armor rolls please it is not even acknowledged all exotics artifice armor are still bugged and drops with bad stats
once rose leaves exalted truth will be the only endgame hand cannon available
thanks but no thanks there s no joy in this game any more but i wish bungie well in fixing it peace
bungie is unbeleviable as it forget ignore don t see things like the lack of void scout rifles seasonal ritual ones not raid dungeon osiris ones like it did forget solar bows past seasons https://www.light.gg/db/category/8?page=1&f=8%281%29%2c9%288%29%2c4%285%29%2c%2c-56%2c%2c%2c%2c%2c%2c23%284%29
can i just say that it s a joke that gambit gets no support but bungie are forcing us the play it by putting such a unique weapon into it adding great loot to a dead game mode that hasn t had even a lick of paint in years is trash
randy s throwing knife is returning and randy s scout rifle is getting a buff with its paired exotic
randys lets goooo hopefully it s got some spicy new rolls leaks are proving to be true so far love we re getting bray tech osprey back and void auto with the auto rifle buff coming
i got that stupid bird error trying to do master warpriest challenge
guardian ranks are paywalled i can t go up to because i ve not payed you so is it worth it nah il just carry friends through old content and stay at
given how many leaks have been confirmed by today and yesterday s posts does anyone think the leviathan stuff might be true i m not sure what all was leaked together and what s separate i would love for all of that stuff to come back but it sounds like it s at the expense of the thing everyone has been expecting to return which i ma be honest would be a huge bummer
what on xbox do you have to buy to get every single piece of content if i buy the light fall annual pass do i get beyond light and witch queen and if not and i just buy beyond light do i get access to the exotics in the archive or do i have to buy the seasons that are no longer here too
so i m playing on a new account and have ascendant shards to use which of the pinnacle weapons should i get from the kiosk
is it still possible to get the calus mini tool
so the twab mentions weapons leaving the loot pool for various activities in s21 but um how do you then focus the ones you haven t unlocked yet in order to focus at all you need to get weapons to drop at least once
what is a defiant battleground
why no bad luck protection on pinnacle drops
on console is there any way to prioritize my melee ability over my regular melee attack my hunter will use my regular melee attack when i try to throw a nade close to an enemy
can vex strike force spawn if the terminal overload node is on the same place
for people who don t own deluxe witch queen the only way to access duality and spire is by buying two dungeon keys in eververse for silver right
am i basically locked out of guardian rank i have just returned after not playing since the beginning of shadowkeep i need to collect exotic weapons to reach rank and i m currently sitting at all the remaining weapons are raids doable but requires luck dungeon i guess that gives me like more or buy them from the kiosk per week and never reach it i guess they don t expect new or returning players to reach rank but i think this quantity is too high
there isn t a package that includes everything as far as i know lightfall annual pass will only includes the new season annual pass none of the older content though there is a legacy collection on sale for that includes shadowkeep beyond light and witch queen if you buy the legacy collection 30th anniversary forsaken and lightfall you will have all the content and dungeons there are also seperate silver packs available edit added forsaken note that there is an armory collection but currently it is less expensive to buy the pieces of that pack seperately
each of these are separate with no content overlap lightfall y6 annual pass version includes this year s four seasons the regular version includes this current season if you don t already own it legacy collection shadowkeep y3 beyond light y4 witch queen y5 armory collection forsaken y2 30th anniversary pack the other reply neglected to mention forsaken as that is no longer part of the legacy collection and includes a raid dungeon updated content leak later this year the last wish raid weapons will be refreshed and become craftable owning the expansion that a past season was a part of will give you access to everything from that season still in the game does not apply to the current content year
fantastic salvager s salvo null composure chain of command solid ascendancy veles x fine but you gotta like the weapon type adored cry mutiny nah reckless endangerment point of the stag unless bows are have a champion mod in which case vorpal might be relevant
only if xr happens to sell one and i m pretty sure he has not yet done so this content year ever i can t recall ever seeing it at him otherwise no
they should enter legacy focusing
for legacy weapons you can focus ones you don t have in collections it s just more expensive
the current seasonal activity you can find launch it from the helm you will need to start the quest from the vendor in the helm if you havent done so yet
it s the seasonal activity for the current season the playlist can be launched from the helm
idk but they ve made it better than previous seasons as all pinnacles are drops
because they want us to grind for longer
changing your melee activation bind in settings for me in order to do an uncharged melee i double tap r1 and for a charged melee i hold r1 hope this helps
my hunter will use my regular melee attack when i try to throw a nade close to an enemy aren t those buttons different l1 for grenade r1 for melee
no
right
thx
thank you
i edited my post to add forsaken which i originally missed sorry about that note that although there is an armory collection that includes forsaken 30th it is actually less expensive to buy the pieces of that pack seperately as they are on sale individually
nah you good thx
all hawthorne does day in day out is stare at the horizon while arguing with a bird best not to disturb her in this fragile state
you just never quit do you took out ghaul woke up the traveler and now half of what i hear is how you and your clan are making a difference people are always waiting for the vanguard to step in and protect them but it s guardians like you who really make a difference that s why i started this whole clan thing in the first place suraya it s been like years
lol you think bungie is gonna touch clans
why does hawthorne even exist lmao new players don t know her
i feel like she probably should have been moved to the farm anyway
hawthorne should just be retired and her bounties moved next door to ikora
had a laugh at doesnt even know who s alive anymore
every npc forgot about her too because no one told her amanda had died that s why shes still talking about her
she said she wanted to express herself so i gave her a thumbs up please give tess some new ones too im tired of hearing the same things for years while picking up and looking through stuff at the postmaster
ever evolving world lol
that would break telesto
ngl i wish they offed hawthorne instead amanda was at least involved in the story past few seasons and an interesting character too hawthorne is nothing more than a relic that hands out bounties that most players don t bother with
nah add an npc near her that makes the comment does she not know maybe we should tell her
feels like a lot of characters will be killed off by the time bungie reboots destiny after the final shape and hawthorne is at the top of the list
downvote me into the ground but amanda s story arch since crow showed would ve made a lot more sense of it were hawthorne instead
lol we had cayde in a strike for like three years after his death bungie doesn t give a shit
you can t even take out ghaul and the traveler has been put back to sleep they need to re do all her lines
like who tf is ghaul even xd
she needs to check her vanguard email once in a while
or better yet remove her entirely the only purpose she had after the vanilla campaign was the raid engrams that would drop gear even if you never did the raid and ever since they removed that she has literally no purpose beyond having bounties nobody does she could just not be there at all and the only change would be one less annoying background character
she serves zero purpose it would be nice for her to die off and use the bird as the vendor or literally anyone else
it s like when i go to nessus and the ghost remarks about showing the fancy gold vex next to xur to cayde
it ll be fine once holiday comes back as a guardian as long as she keeps the same name all we will be good
not like cayde or holidays strike commentary are edited or removed we re just on some paracausal shit out here
they should have killed her off and moved her vendor stuff to holliday
literally the first moment they have a season where hawthorne has any part to play you know she s dead lol
half of the scannable items in the tower have dialog that s outdated in one way or another i wouldn t be surprised if this never gets touched
the body s not even cold yet and you re already asking for all mentions of her to be deleted
they should record it with a sad tone like she just caught herself
she doesn t know don t tell her
yep i m definitely judging her for leaving the farm to come to the tower to ask about tech support from holiday
hawthorne should have died
small indie company bro they can t kill off a character and remember to cut relevant dialogue
have hawthorne disappear leave bird add bird petting animation done
is bungie gonna ever do anything with hawthorne like seriously what was the last thing she s done participate in a crucible match in lore during guardian games they gotta do something with her
after years of hearing cayde during arms dealer post forsaken i m not surprised
i thought it was kind of weird especially since this season is about normal humans fighting back too which was a plot point we sort of had during the red war campaign already and where is she at in the story and cutscenes
d2 launch tried to pad itself with celebrity voice actors that likely got too busy with other projects to support future content which is probably why cayde ikora and ana all got recast in future expansions looking at the imdb for sumalee montano the voice behind hawthorne in alone they had roles in different non destiny projects it would make sense if she s too busy to reprise the role and clans haven t had much support post launch save for one banner and one raid dungeon triumph per season if she ever became an important part of the story again i d imagine they would recast the role
nah this is par for the course when i first started playing destiny petra was standing next to spider telling me how critical it was that we found uldren and then spider told me to go talk to his pet crow the next season he was in the helm while still being in the tangled shore and still being searched for by petra if there isn t a complete lack of continuity in the in game playable universe then it isn t destiny
oof yep they should fix that
to be honest i thought she should ve have a role to play in communication with the people of neomuna a regular human they could trust over the evil warlords of earth
nah take the bungie approach and have her get exploded to high heaven after having impact storywise for the last years
she is my crush they made her useless when they do they ll probably kill her like amanda for no reason coz bungie is not capable of writing a decent story it has become a soap opera
maybe they didn t update it because it s a hint of things to come
i haven t played in a long ass time what
yeah she vasiy saved our asses during the red war and now she hasn t had any real part in the story since
hawthorne hey i haven t seen cayde in a while
hello yeeeaaas
you leave my autistic no drip baddie alone
i d be fine if she just disappeared one day
the red war was really tragic for her
i was on nessus seeing xur and noticed a corpse on the tree and when i interacted with it my ghost said don t tell cayde about this like wtf ghost
the red war was weird they introduced all these new characters who aren t even that cool and then well known characters like ikora and cayde were empty vendors
it s funny how we have a season with the farm and she still isn t relevant
heeeyyyyyyyy
damn bird ate my homework
y all need to leave hawthorne alone
nah hawthorne didn t buy this season yet she was waiting for a sale
i was just saying that to my clan lol there s a memorial in the tower for her it s not like it s a secret
did they try unplugging amanda and plugging her back in
we all know holiday is back by the end of the season as an immortal blueberry why even bother with new voice lines lol
the lack of attention to details like this is one of the reasons i still haven t jumped back in over a year
another symptom of the majority of the game being on cruise control to keep the cash flowing for the other ips bungie is working on
twitch viewer trials bounties still visit amanda holliday
holy crap i forgot hawthorne was a character now that i think about it she definitely could have played a role in this season even if it was minor
she can die next
this is my application to voice whoever to get hawthorne replaced so we can have actual voice lines
i mute my game when i m near her or simply don t go over there
what about ikora member of vanguard completely missing in any of the story beats this season does she even know holliday is dead
good point lol maybe it is best she stay out of the loop i wonder if she s noticed the traveler isn t there anymore yet
and constantly talking about being judged i can t even stand to be in my inventory near her
that would be an amazing story beat finding out hawthorne has had a break from reality when cayde died and she s now living through some sort of groundhog day scenario but just in her head
just made me think of garfield without garfield
news flash the bird didn t even survive getting sucked into a turbine it s been animatronically stuffed ever since probably why hawthorne is so wacky now
she s too afraid of bears to do anything else can you blame her
when i became part of a clan i wanted a certain name so i took my old xbox live accounts and joined myself making my own clan my clan consists of me myself and i and now half of what i hear is how you and your clan are making a difference _me wearing separate hats _ 
it s funny too because we didn t even take out ghaul the traveler did and it s not even like top feats for the guardian
that line has mutated and degraded so much in my brain from hearing it way too much you just never quit do you fucked my mom cucked my father and now half of what i hear on the street is what you and your clan did to my sister people are always waiting for the vanguard to step in and get them off but it s guardians like you who really make a difference that s why i started this whole onlyfans thing in the first place
she was my most disliked character until nimbus came along
i dont know theyre pretty good about removing content and replacing it with nothing in return its right in their wheelhouse
to hand out bounties for xp and a free powerful tier
i have no idea who she is i just know that i can get engrams from her every week when the guild i haven t interacted with even once for over a year does stuff
why did holiday exist she didn t do anything since i started playing in season of the splicer i just know her as the person who sells crappy ships
send her to the farm with that old content just like those pets
or even better just add them to the clan screen as a weekly challenge instead of being bouties you have to remember to pick up
i d really like if petra was moved to the tower and became the new clan vendor she s so cool
next thing you know she s gonna start making comments about rasputin or sagira
fair enough lol as long as there s a canon reason
the old tower has been evolving for like years now surely it ll be done any day now
fair point
it would have been the first time i thought of her in forever i forget my clan engrams every week because a i have no reason to go near her unless ikora has new stuff to pick up at the start of a season and b my clan is like other people these days and none of us play more than hours a week anymore
okay that would be even better if they did do that it d never happen but all would be forgiven if they did
becasue they both like birds or what i don t get it
the strike takes place chronologically before cayde dies not everything is real time
didn t they remove her big speech back in beyond light or witch queen iirc she doesn t say anything anymore when you pick up the challenge rewards
well see kids there used to be this big white mole rat that for some reason was able to fuck us harder than the darkness ever did and then it got powers and then well it kinda exploded into a wierd goo yeah those were odd times indeed
her purpose is to stand there whilst we give cookies to louis once a year
oh you re right i forgot about that one jeez everyone s turning into banshee now
it probably won t but a scannable dialogue from the past is a lot less out of place to hear than current idle dialogue
i think the op is more asking that in a progressive world when removing vendors that the rest of the progressive world know that this has happened and respond accordingly like filter the text for all mentions of hawthorne and either replace the voice line or remove it at minimum especially if it s in the same instance zone where it occurs otherwise it removes from immersion
wow that explains why i haven t gotten platinum thanks for the heads up
this is detailed in the known issues thread on bungie net https://www.bungie.net/en/forums/post/262690050 in the lake of shadows nightfall wiping in the final boss room will cause some enemies and champions in a previous room to respawn
that explains why i wasn t getting platinum i also did see those spawn in when we died
skill issue
i was wondering why we got gold
yeah that s what happens when your main focus is to cram in as much enemy spam as possible and not actually test the dang things plus when they actually play the game they need to play it under power to get the best possible experience lol
but at least this won t matter for gms it s like the opposite of the warden of nothing bug lol
we died so much at the tormentor part if everyone just shot those circle things then force on the tormentor we would ve past it nahhh everyone just quit and back out took me about hours to find a team that doesn t back out after things don t go their way
won t be an issue in gms at least
so that s it
known bug
headsets matter at this point one guy runs past the open door now we have to load in dead torrents dead also damn the boss locks on to my blk az so fast i bearly actually fight my job now is to distract
looks like bungie really adopted elitists mindset and now skill issue is their response to everything
not an issue with gm kekw
got silver on my last run noticed that the feed said two champions appeared when we restarted
this has also been a thing forever if it only hurts the player bungie is gonna wait to fix it
we are the testers it is currently in beta and we re lucky enough to pay full price for the privilege
you don t even really need too just continuously suspend the tormentor or blind them with a gl and you have all day
people i match with don t shoot the taken turrets
don t the taken turrets just respawn they did for me the first time i tried clearing them
well ya missed more than those champions then if you got silver
bungie this is the way
i mean no one ever cleared the ads in the room before this season to be fair
nope my ft killed every champ wiped intentionally in boss room finished with silver tested it twice
not sure why you re getting downvoted when you re correct if you only missed those champs you ll end up with a gold rating getting silver implies that you missed other ones elsewhere
there s never been a reason to either you utterly destroy the boss or you don t and a possible wipe happens phases make wipes more common making this a more common problem that should have been fixed when it was found an issue literally years ago
there was overloads you used to have to kill on gm i m pretty sure there was at least one on master i only did gm
because it s wrong you can test it out for yourself very easily in game
i never head of this before today and never saw anyone complain about it so bungie wasn t probably even aware it was happening lmao
i did wiped in the boss room finished the run and ended up with gold
that s weird because it s definitely been a thing since champs were introduced i don t fault you for not knowing but it s been a thing since then
what difficulty were you playing cuz that probably explains it
but are we talking about in general or in this strike because i know of previous issues that existed just not here i feel like instances of champs spawning incorrectly have been all fixed like in the corrupted and i don t doubt this will be fixed soon either
this strike has been an issue just like corrupted champs spawn outside the door if you wipe
the same thing happens in corrupted
ok yeah but it s a new issue bungie will fix it like they did with other instances that s my point
yeah a wipe would spawn champions you couldn t kill
some of you who are out there doing this you need to get a life seriously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ian2jorz-f4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ian2jorz-f4) cheese forever actually posted about this a while back
you ever notice that some of these pvp youtubers are always showing off bomb streaks when doing build gun reviews but when you pay attention to the opponents they are usually oblivious and often don t even put up a fight like you re sporting a kd average and play the game for a living yet somehow your sbmm opponents are standing still hard scoping a lane or walking out into the open without firing come on buddy
this isn t just a destiny thing it s actually quite common lately in cod mwii due to how asininely strong sbmm in it
imagine doing this just so you can pretend you are better at a videogame than you actually are
never ever underestimate the elite and their desire to seal club they will literally jump through burning hoops of fire if it allows them to just stomp on people when they argue against sbmm etc this is why they dont want fair matches they dont want skilled matches they want seal clubbing nothing more and will do anything to get it
this happens in every pvp game that has a ranked mode
cod players be like are you new here
i understand wanting a relaxing quick play match but geez man just put on a shitty load out and lose a couple games sbmm in quickplay today isn t the oppressive version that made every lobby an unbroken meta sweatfest that it used to be
thus freelance is best
i noticed this i m a mediocre player at best but my wife is epileptic and enjoys crucible it evaluates us a one object for teams she gets kills and i get
every time the sbmm thing comes up i have no opinion i get both sides i personally would rather not have it and have wild variety in games but i was good enough in cod to hold my own against sweats i also had a well known youtuber leave a match in which i was going on a tear a lot of them just want to stomp and post kill games against potatoes going to these lengths to avoid skilled players is sad though
while this is shitty it feels like such an outlier that to deal w it would end up feeling heavyhanded like are scrubby teammates just gonna have to play in sweaty lobbies
i ve been providing this service to my clanmates for years
it s much more effective my way play badly on your main account every match
these same people are the ones wondering why some don t like pvp
this has been a thing at bungie since halo maybe even halo
it s called smurfing bungie knows but there is not much they can do without punishing groups of friends with widely different skills that play together at least is somewhat useless on competitive as you would get almost no points for winning against worst players
this is boilerplate stuff of what carry and recovery services do to game the system and something you d see all the time if you d be playing late season comp in an era when people were in the dying embers to get unbroken it s why so many pvp heads knew how there could be potential for disastrous consequences of cramming sbmm into every single playlist i ve sent out so many forms about this kind of shit even with dudes who s steam profile was literally an ad for the services and discords and the automated email bot who is head of the crucible department couldn t give a rat s ass
this is called 2boxing it s been a thing in the cod community for a decade you use a really shitty account matchmake with it and when the match starts dashboard the shitter account except in the cod community it was so you could hit better sniper clips so you could make montages with practically impossible clips in them in d2 the only benefit is seeing the number on destinytracker go up
but sbmm is to sweaty they say as they crush new lights creating the exact sweaty games that they obliviously complain about
i would ve thought bungie would ve anticipated this and set it so it always defaults to the higher skilled player s lobbies sure it would suck if some low skilled player wants to play with their absolutely cracked friend but it would make more sense for the exact reason you re talking about at the very least they could take an average of the players skill and do it that way
gernaderjake does this whenever he plays anything 6v6 will play with community but only if they are 0kd
well this explains some stuff i may have actually done this on accident a couple nights ago im a pretty average pvp player but i was teaching a completely new player the basics and they wanted to see what was up with pvp we got wrecked as i expected then when the next match was loading they said they had to go to bed and left i ended up destroying the next lobby ended up getting the medal for a streak and taking no damage for the first time i thought i had just hit one of those lucky matches but i guess we played enough that it had info on how to rank them finally and then they left i d be lieing if i said it didn t feel good to just stomp a whole lobby but it would be boring if it was like that every time
good do everything to break the shitty sbmm with these dogshit servers lol we make bank but we re not upgrading our server infrastructure bungo have no business running anything but the most rigorous of cbmm
a good way to look at people who do this is that they re not nearly as close to the top of the skill ceiling as they might think they are and smurfing as this is typically called usually results in diminishing skill over time due to adapting to lower skilled lobbies forming bad habits and not playing to their fullest abilities because well they don t have to this was a huge problem in the overwatch comp community but funny enough was only really ever done by people in gold plat which is low mid level for that game and hardly ever done by anyone with actual skill so while it did suck for some of the really low skilled players young kids people who play while high or just people who don t put in effort to play or learn it was hardly an issue for anyone who did have that skill and simply existed in the low sbmm lobbies either due to a previous game loss or maybe they re just not on their best today it s kind of a weird paradox people who smurf generally aren t that good to begin with if they have to smurf to achieve whatever it is they want to achieve and thus it doesn t affect nearly as many people as you d think and they generally end up staying in that low skill lobby parameter at the end of it anyway
thanks for the tip i ll start downloading d2 on my potato pc right now no more sweat lobbies guardian disobedience until cbmm is back
in my competitive rank up game to plat in my last prome my team has me and a duo with 16xx light lvl and the other at cap the cap guy basically win the game by himself lol there s also a duo in my 2nd plat game just go suicide or dont return fire at my team
not only is this a sad thing to do but it s also just simply not worth the effort anyway lmao
playing against people like me when i was trying to learn mouse and keyboard couldn t even sprint
bro how can that even be fun there are so many cheaters like in iron banner the guy has losses and over wins my god lol why that has to be the most ridiculously lame and boring shit ever why would you even want a fucking kdr in this game against low lights and look at his ratings at the top this game is just pure cheese vs low lights lol pathetic a lot of the best games are the close ones and that s the whole point of gaming for me
this is some serious loser no life behavior come on guys insanity
fanbois be like git good then half of them be doing that and other exploits bungie needs to just separate pvp into levels that do not reset with each season you either a blueberry or casual or a sweat you wanna talk sht and spam git good then put your money where your mouf is and match up against other sweats and not blueberries and one casual
no normal person even the worst of players in cbmm lobbies with zero fps skills will not have a k d of in any game mode
is that why i ve been getting absolutely crushed in iron banner by nothing but immortal adept s
if you re doing this you are seriously sad as fuck this is actual fiend behavior imagine taking the time to do something like this just for pub stomping sad little people out there
i mean if you are going that far to avoid sbmm i don t know what to tell ya sbmm is doo doo imo but damn
this is what happens with sbmm sbmm should never be in quickplay only competitive
i m sure they know of it it is pretty much common knowledge among pvp players a fun side effect is that i pretty much had fbmm before it came out since the stacks would never have a fireteam leader on my sbmm level it didn t make sbmm quickplay any less miserable
i ve been trying something like this to improve my stats i always make my wife fireteam leader when we matchmake crucible i feel like i missed something in the instructions though because she s been above me on the leaderboards there s still some kinks to work out
i mean if good at video game is your whole ass personality and you don t get the dopamine unless you re dunking on scrubs congrats you may have joined the cluster b club putting your entire sense of self into your kda or guardian rank or whatever isn t healthy find a therapist seriously https://youtu.be/9deg7vrphbm)
the way other games handle this is to match based on whoever has the highest skill rating that way if high skilled people want to bring their potato friends they will suffer greatly i was wondering about this because one of my friends just started playing the game a few weeks ago and he was telling me that he repeatedly kept getting annihilated i looked at his match history and i saw this lopsided skill level between players i wondered how i told him that it was probably because they couldn t find similarly skilled opponents but it turns out that people are manipulating
this just seems like more work than it s actually worth lol
they are aware apparently but the solution is that the sbmm just figures it out faster when they actually start trying again it isn t good but it s better than nothing i guess
what s funny is i don t even have to reverse boost i am the highest kd player in my clan by a long shot so when i just play with them i absolutely run over the lobby now that being said it doesn t help me in comp to have even matches if i am constantly slaying in quickplay which is where i like to play mostly so i try and go solo this is just sbmm being a thing not much you can do about it bungie does absolutely ban accounts that are boosting though
i couldn t imagine being deranged enough to do something like this for destiny pvp of all things
it s such big loser energy
this explains why i m always destroying in games when i play with my son he s not great
they do not care most likely minimal time if any goes into pvp that s why it has turned into such a tragedy
it s hilarious to me that people care so so much about a video game ranking system that they have to figure out ways to cheat the system to impress complete strangers
doing this in a game that doesn t even have competitive pvp or a scene is insane
good on those who do it
the amount of backward gymnastic just because they can t handle being defeated i can garantee you none of them have a happy life and they are most likely never getting laid you cannot be a good person and do stuff like this it s just so telling of someone personality
the type of behaviour has been in fps gaming since mw2 the solution is for these developers to literally take all personal stats out of the game no more kd win loss etc if there s no stat to keep track of and show off these kids will mostly stop i m an overall kd player in destiny and i believe these stats should be ripped out of the the api so no third party sites or first party site displays it it ll stop people from being gremlins some of you out there care too much about stats because they seem to add to your own personal worth because you aren t shit outside the game no high paying job no assets no relationships no education etc
i ve said that the lobbies felt wrong over the last two days so i m glad to have confirmation that something was up but man idk how little you have to have going on in your real life to do something so sad like this
few days ago me and my friend who both have a kd of and have been playing for years got paired into a quickplay game with literal new lights most of them had blue gear almost dropped a bomb aswell first and only timed it s ever happened to us
the problem is that outside of the egregiously obvious thrower accounts stuff like this is hard to fix like i m pretty fucking bad at pvp and my best friend is good enough to match up with players from top pvp clans but we still like to play pvp together so what does a fair match with both of us in the same team look like how does bungie design a system that gives fair matches while still allowing us to queue together
theyre prolly just farming the ai bots
idk man i consider myself pretty good at the game considering ive gone flawless a ton and had high ranks in other games but the second i get thrown in 6v6 i feel like a new light xd
this is so sad like these players are probably already decent without needing to exploit but in the world of win rates and 5kds instead of 0s people will crave that feeling of superiority tragic
they know they just don t care
if i recall didnt bungie mention they are going to start perma banning people who do this
i appreciate it i ve been at 10k since day of lightfall time to get my buddy s alt named god into the most shit lobbies imaginable
sounds like fun actually
sbmm destroyed pvp so it s only fair that people would do this i can t play a single match for fun anymore and run around with silly weapons because ally my lobbies are meta pick tryhards that play like its a scrim
does this work on trials
i can t imagine too many people do this all that effort just to farm lower skilled players in destiny pvp lol unless someone is using this to easily create youtube content to monetize i can t imagine this is particularly fun or engaging agree it should be fixed though for sure
and here i thought i was going crazy or i was just omega bad at pvp
usually hate to suggest banning people but this feels like something that would fall under network manipulation and if it s this obvious should really net a neat perma ban till appealed with a nice groveling apology
i blame nobody for doing this sbmm should not exist
if someone actually bothers with all of this just wow
it s cringe yeah but it s on bungie for making sbmm based on the fireteam leader only
seems like a lot of work i just wanna queue up and play i couldn t be bothered to spend hours tanking just to crush some noobs but i guess this is for a different breed of gamer
imagine not being able to naturally be good at gambit smh
ofc there s a backdoor smh anyone that does do this is a douche that is obviously compensating for something
i m sorry but i just don t get it these numbers just scream not normal in every way this is an old way of flexing that just seems weird now in today s gaming world no matter what if the community members are paying attention they know you are sus lol
it s called smurfing and it s been a thing since fps pvp has had any sort of sbmm
lol some people will do anything to pub stomp
the only remotely simillar thing to this i did was to use my soul level ng character on dark souls to invade people in the first area of the game the game then matched you by level ranges so by the book i wasn t doing anything wrong but i had improved my gear and skill enough to beat the whole game as a level and so obviously could absolutely destroy even a group of other players who were just on their way to the first boss i did it like twice and it was sort of funny but i realised it was a total dumb thing as there was no skill involved and i was just hurting the other players in a way that wasn t really fair never touched that character again so i could see doing this once just to experience it but people doing this over and over need to get outside more
i m more impressed by the k d to be honest
u destiny2team
it doesn t seem difficult or even that tedious still anyone who actually does this must live a sad life if they need to go through this much effort to ensure they re always at an advantage i don t care if you re a pvp god if you do this you still need to get gud
sbmm moment
i ve ran into a couple of these guardians i m jus trying to have a good time and then these sweat lords just ruin the little time i have in the evenings to chill and play with friends
and this is why we can t have nice things pvp in general
people who do this are so sad and pathetic
can t say i really understand this i m by no means an especially good player but all my matches have been balanced or maybe a little easy also who wants to tell content creators that them stomping noobs hasn t been entertaining since
i love getting slaughtered by light guardians with adept god rolled immortal smg in iron banner don t you
who the fuck has the time to do this at this point just quit
will we never be rid of twinks
i have too consoles this is too much work i ll just play normal
annmmmd bungie talked about it already when they did their big crucible post they ve talked about using bans for this
is bungie aware they have pvp
don t ban these guys banning is too good don t tell them anything just start putting them in lobbies full of beta testing ai bots make the bots a mix of afks unkillable laggers and aimbot snipers with maybe one sheep bot that s no skill easy kills just to give them that glimmer of hope to keep queuing up for more punishment
imagine having such tiny pp energy you do this
shit like this is why i stopped playing apex
i did not know it was that serious crazy was fighting for my life in pvp yesterday too
i m just thinking how about power lock lobbies not for team average power but for individual
removed
this is so much work to play a game
spectral blades got a damage buff back during season when they made a lot of changes and it s usage did not change whatsoever nobody would use spectral blades regardless considering both tether options outclass blades in every way imaginable
spectral blades in crucible fuck if you use it right
it is perfectly fine in pvp which is why it bugs the crap out of me that they don t just buff the damage in pve it can barely kill a yellow bar for how long its cooldown is it needs to do way more damage
spectral scares me in crucible
void didnt save this super buffs didnt save this super bungo didnt save this super rip spectral
spectral blades is that a vaulted sword or something
a certain lead developer it s okay for some supers to only have use in some content the same dev literally moments later also we re buffing the shit out of well in pvp so it s not just great in pve also the same dev why do players think we have a class bias
used it in the data fragment section of legend avalon since you can just stay invisible for the whole duration and you got super resist it was worth it since i got super back easily with orbs and i didn t have to time my invis perfectly for the wyverns damage still sucks though
hmm let s see a roaming super that gives you almost no resist melee based super that often miss can t even lock on a boss properly you go pass through him damage is really weak compared to literally every other melee based super no survivability nor movement potential invis is the weakest part of this super because invis got heavely nerfed short duration can t reliably add clear no subclass verb what strand titans have very similar super has melee speed boost on hit better target acquisition woven mail for survivability suspend anything with the heavy attack last longer way more damage can even use synthos to buff even more to the point where it can be the best dps super better movement as well
it s the cooldown that s unbearable
didn t they buff the dr in that super i m pretty sure because i put an entire immortal clip in a guy and it left him hp before he killed me
needs the type of love nova warp got in pve but if you re a sneaky little shit in pvp it s a nightmare
i like it in 6s however in 3s or pve it is beyond useless
give it volatile on hits and revert the damage resist nerfs and it ll become a monster
isn t a half of the super about making you think they died no but seriously absolutely destroys in pvp pve however it s completely ss
it s the classic pvp pve gap b c of its potential in pvp devs will be hard pressed to give it any love in pve would be cool if they did though
as a exclusively titan main i feel ya tbh with how good zerker super can feel when it works i wish they d touch up the old supers game feel wise clunky and less effective in comparison
still see it all the time in pvp
bro you re giving up tether and mobius quiver no shit noone s gonna use it you can make it deal million damage by itself but it won t compare to more damage for your whole team
it s alright if you use it right what isn t good is the arc behemoth titan super
spectral is still very strong in pvp idk what you re on about imo the best roaming super for assassinating other supers
i keep getting annihilated by it in crucible
stormcaller and behemoth are the whole subclass hunter has two other good options in pve and sb is fine in pvp
i use it in gambit sometimes lol
i try to use it in pvp occasionally every time as soon as i try and kill someone with it the hits dont register and i end up using half my super trying to actually land a hit on someone before they blow my head off with a shotgun hit registration and tracking seriously if shoulder charges can track you vertically then spectral should be able to hit someone on the ground reliably
spectral is my favorite super in the game and i have not had fun with it in a while it just feels like it has not kept up with other buffs i can t place what exactly it needs but personally it doesn t feel great
it wouldn t even be that hard to make spectral at least usable in pve have light attacks apply volatile have volatile kills give overshields done that keeps the identity as an ad clear super but makes it at least usable
spectral blades will always be useless in pve as long as shadowshot exists
spectral blades only use case is in pvp and that s very very rare it s just not a super i can ever see being useful in endgame when tether exists
honestly the super tiers in pvp were a mistake most roaming supers will never be seen in stuff like trials making the single use supers better pretty much all around not only are they oppressive in trials as if the other team is running roaming supers and you have a well you re basically guaranteed a free round win but several of the single use supers such as blade barrage thundercrash and nova bomb completely counter roaming supers while also charging faster so as soon as you get your roaming super you ll get shut down anyway
i tried using it and i couldn t achieve anything meaningful with it in legend content damage is still ass
i see one every two or three matches and there is no middle ground between god tier ones and the ones that are patrick nailing a 2x4 to his forehead
ah a fellow spectral blades enthusiast i see
yeah it s kind of underwhelming in pve but if anyone thinks it s lacking in pvp you re not using it right it s still very powerful hell i got my first ever seventh column with it a couple years ago and that was after all the nerfs
depends if the hits actually decide to register or not
buff the damage across the board a slash is a one hit in pvp already more damage wouldn t make you more dead
i know they always use the excuse of it s ok for some things to be just for pvp and my answer to that or more of hunters kit is already designed for pvp and also why then did you give well very much a meant for pve super multiple pvp buffs a while back
it floors me the treatment warlock gets over the other classes at least titans get to be close range specialists hunter is literally that s too strong were taking it away dodge is only used to regenerate other abilities now because back when it actually dropped targeting bungie decided we don t like how dodge dodges things thats too strong mobility can t actually give you a ton of move speed or anything that would be too strong grapple was going to be hunter only but that would ve been too strong amazing
lmao
i don t wish being fired on him but he has no place as a lead developer representing bungie he was a point of contention for the community because every time he opened his mouth it ran along the lines of how can i piss people off today
don t forget heavy attack is also ranged
they actually reduced it but it has the second highest damage reduction of any super they reduced it from damage reduction to it was the strongest damage reduction when it was at
i landed my thundercrash next to one and he survived with a bit of life and killed me while i was in my recovery animation
the thing is though we ve already seen that they can make changes independently so they could change something like the damage without effecting it in pvp
to me i don t feel like the damage is so atrocious as much as it feels impossible to consistently hit the same target over and over with light attacks the damage is still bad but it s the tracking i have a hard time with
can confirm i m the second one
my wife and i watched a guy get stuck in a little pocket of a wall and swing straight into it or times be for we put him down out of pity
but i cant see my forehead
the tracking can be really bad on them and you don t get much leeway with hitboxes the way you do with other roaming supers even the arc staff isn t the best hitbox wise compared to the ridiculous titan supers that hit you even if they swing on another planet or even the warlock ones but the staff is still better than spectral blades even to be better usable in crucible they need the dodge to be infinite during the super and have double the movement distance during the dodge or something sometimes they work really well and i ll get kills in a row with them but i ve just switched to blade barrage for crucible and gambit tripmines are more useful anyways and blade barrage rarely ever fails and is just great at shutting down roamers
mayhem this week i wreck in that place vs other roaming supers hit box is garbage but learn to work with the cripple not against it
the only reason i am not sure on that is because of supers versus supers and how they want spectral to compete in that realm but i don t think it d ruin anything major
it s super easy to paint a narrative if you word things like that dodge dropping targeting hunter was by far the most dominant and common pvp class at the time the change made sense they never said grapple would have been too strong to have on just hunters that s literally just a flat lie they said grapple was too fun to lock to just one class which is very different from being too strong a warlock would say that the light subclasses were basically just ways to distribute the warlock kit to the other two subclasses and they would be half right when they said it a titan would say i don t bring anything to endgame pve anymore and they would also be half right this whole wahh whoa is me bungie hates my class narrative is cringe and we d all be better off if that shit stopped
you re preaching to the choir i very much agree i don t think adding volatile effects would hurt either
it s really the only thing you can do for the poor little feller
that might ve been me tbh
wahh whoa is me bungie hates my class woe is me only because you seem to like to speak intelligently and i want you to keep succeeding i agree with everything you said but i also assume you understand the futility of trying to use reason in this community
the hunter dodge dropping targeting only made it top dog on console between season of dawn and beyond light top tree dawnblade was by far the best pvp subclass on pc and it wasn t even close
and top tree dawn got nerfed because of that recently hunters and titans were fighting for the top spot metas change
it s for a reason i guess since acquiring all the sword patterns for each class at the helm involves focusing a shit ton of them
i m trying to craft the class swords but when focusing defiant engrams i get shotguns for every swords i already crafted the shotgun but only have throne cleaver and am still for the other swords i m starting to wonder if i will even get enough sword patterns to craft them before the season ends
yeah the core playlists trials and iron banner could use something similar i d personally love it if engrams had a chance to drop after a completion of that activity i would love to have a possibility to get a trials engram after i get curb stomped by a man team of immortal adept spammers same goes for iron banner
i agree i mean when i was doing nightfall on weekly bonus rank it was nice when at rank or cuz one master run would give you engrams always but once the rank gets higher the harder it is to rank up and requires to play a lot more just for engram i m at my third reset and still didn t get the roll i wanted
mine are stacking up because i don t want to use that much glimmer tired of public events to farm glimmer
i think at least per relevant activity is harmless i get seasonal should be more because it s temporary but also doing a ritual activity and getting nothing doesn t feel good
real tawk look here pimp
this is by far the most of ive ever engaged with a seasonal activity their length is still a tad too long but the rewards are very worth it engrams on top of engrams like op said if other playlists were even half as much the vendors would be in a great spot
it s high but the cost to get all the new patterns this season is astronomical
yeah
it s because of the woes some players had getting all the patterns last year i think it feels kinda overkill to me but i m not complaining
vanguard engram rates are so bad as per the vanguard playlist is hardly worth it
yes or let us convert them to buy from other vendors
i have like defiant engrams saved up i have no interest in those weapons i just hope i remember to turn them all in for materials before the season ends
i agree and disagree it s great they drop often but they drop so often i have everything crafted and don t have to touch a single defiant bg ever again and they are pretty fun to do atleast give us something useful to spend them on or give defiant engrams the ability to get world drops or something don t say focus them into armor the rolls are absolute garbage
the duality of r dtg just commented on a post about not liking having to sink engrams for red borders i mean you get the engrams for doing next to nothing
every activity should guarantee one their respective engrams per completion regardless of win or loss for a win more if you have the prosperity ghost perk
real talk hahahah wtf is reddit wish i never fired this back up
i think defiant engrams should be toned down now i m not one to advocate for less loot but i have way too many of these engrams i only play the minimum amount of games per week to get my pinnacle and i m sitting at over engrams
i haven t really played much in the last weeks but when i last checked i have over defiant engrams at the helm all other vendors have maybe but those are from rank ups i m already dreading having to cash those in please don t do this for all activities
oh i got trials engrams from like games last weekend so i don t think it s that bad i actually think the rates are way better for trials than normal crucible engrams
i ll say that since they re now stored at the vendor i m so much happier with the drop rate i no longer have to deal with the annoyance of deleting umbrals bc i can t pick anything up
swimming in shards
i actually think decree and the swords were a last minute addition given that can only be found at the helm despite bungies earlier statement they d only bring back gear when it fit narratively
oh the other hand i get shotgun for every swords and none of the are red borders lmfao
u can use the first deepsight focusing of the week on swords
should be a regardless of win or lose some extra factors based on performance and maybe a random chance i e if we get stomped but i m best on team i ve got like chance to get an engram
run the sorrow s harbor event on the moon and get phantasmal material after defeating the boss then just use those to exchange for glimmer at rahool i think the exchange rate is phantasmal fragments for 10k glimmer i finally have way to get rid of these things piling up in my consumables page
you can just pop them for the shards and the costs are excellent compared to most other vendors
or one engram per activities just anything faster than ranking up for an engram would be nice
for some reason while reading this my first thought went to an old looney tunes western with the spittoon clang after the twak it unfortunately did not continue going that way
agreed weapons are all shitty
ok but how often have you gotten a godroll playlist drop before multiple resets and or focusing them
personally i don t mind too much because focusing trials and ib engrams is super shard hungry this season plus module costs all those spares are just being fed to my gs rank and dwindling shard pile
better than season of the lost where i farmed it and dumped every engram i could into it every week and never got better than a fractethyst
i ve found that when using keys defiant bgs always drop high stat armor
each engram is worth legendary shards if you instant shard everything pretty sure doing battlegrounds is the best legendary shard farm in the game
talking about other vendor engrams having abysmal rates not defiant
do you have the patterns that come from focusing those engrams
eh i rarely have more than but i just cash them in for shards
or let us use the engrams elsewhere
ok but it s not like their an inconvenience in any way like just ignore them then this is such a bad take
so don t cash them in if you find it to inconvenient to get free shards then
should probably note last week was double rep
i mean calus was a big part of the expansion and those are weapons we originally acquired from him and they ve been in the api since season of the haunted when the other opulent weapons were available so they probably thought it would work
possibly the class swords and imperial decree were datamined back in plunder
i think considering they are recovered leviathan weapons i m presuming we found them on the leviathan when whatever we done to it was done
i always love a story about a shotgun
really i just double checked in the app and the vendor only has seasonal weapons and armor i don t see an option for the leviathan weapons
deleted
less efficient than public events but i might do this just for more variety in glimmer farming
man i ve been grinding the fuck out of trials for the legacy stuff resets and i ve got all the armour unlocked for my hunter didn t even care about the rolls just wanted it for future transmogs did the same in iron banner
they re okay i just have other weapons from previous seasons that do the job
i d wager the imperial decree and the 600rpm strand ar are the only decent options tbh
well the only thing i ve focused is hothead since i never farmed when it was in rotation but i did get lucky and got a very good roll in resets i m waiting for 2x crucible before going for a riptide bc i already have crafted deliverance won t be farming for ib weapons either until 2x rep bc i already have weapons that are better or on par non of the other playlist weapons seem that interesting fit a niche i need for any builds playlist engram drops should be a per game activity along side the per rank engram drops as it is now it takes too long to farm for during non 2x weeks
it s for sure better than crazy low drop rates that shit is painful
yea but are the stat rolls spiked like the pit boss armor if not the odds to get a good roll are extremely low
yes and they all came from the battlegrounds completion i think i bought from the vendor
same if i get a red border cool if i don t oh no another legendary shards in the bank for absolutely no extra work on my part
that s an idea being able to use them at other vendors would be awesome
i mean i have about 7k and don t do much with them either lol
heres the thing if they didn t bring those weapons back because it didn t feel right when would be the next right time with calus gone i don t see another time when those weapons would be better to bring back from a narrative standpoint might as well tack them on now and sell it as more content to grind
either way just a little weird given they were adamant about not bringing equipment back unless it was directly a part of that season for a while when dawn stuff was brought up if it s to be this way going forward i think i m okay with it personally as that means some of my favorite gear might return also
it could very well be they were intended to be patched into the dungeon as well and just never went through with it after the backlash towards focusing that season
no worries not sure if it s true bc is just hearsay on the d2 subreddit but you can def try it out next week hope it helps man
you can t
also changing up your ghost mods to have bountiful harvest so that collecting planetary mats gives you the most amount of glimmer it gives something like instead of at least grabbing mats while doing other stuff will give better glimmer gains than the usual
oh wow yeah then they re definitely just clutter for you unless you re trying to focus a specific seasonal weapon
when they use a leviathan raid raid lair returning as a way to hype a season
again calus was a big part of the expansion and the season is cabal themed the weapons are from a calus cabal themed activity and they came back during an activity with that it fits not perfectly but there s no other moment where we will get calus back as he s dead
you all may see clutter in that pile of engrams but i see hundreds of legendary shards in the bank
if i had to guess that wouldn t be until next year maybe assuming they keep the trend of reprising old d1 raids wrath of the machine should be next
i just need one more red border calus mini tool i hope bungie answers my prayers and gives us some place it will drop somewhat reliably
i think you meant to say baby enhancement modules upgrading three toons to pin gets pricy
you ain t wrong about that
i have over 40k of those too so not needed atm lol
everyone wants wrath which would mean be a poor choice if they didn t bring it back but you watch them just bring back the leviathan raids instead
i ll go ahead and add in a bunch of enhancements cores but if you re already loaded on lego shards then you re probably loaded up on those as well lol
i think the recovered leviathan weapons are intended to be a sink for defiant engrams in other words it s working as intended but the intent kinda sucks
i m thinking it s balanced around us continuing to get a steady stream of defiant engrams in the following seasons this year so likely most regular players will have tons stored up as they focus on later seasonal content and can circle back to just jam out all those engrams
i had been saving all my engrams since the start of the season i had about i believe i was able to get the pattern for the shotgun and two of the swords i m going to save up at least and then go for the last sword
cost me ish defiant engrams to unlock the sword in one class seems like a lot but after you ve all seasonal weapons patterns unlocked there s nothing worth using them so they pile up really fast
you have all year to craft them i don t think they ll touch drop rates until a month before final shape if at all
it s terrible i ve gone turn ins without a red border sword once you get the shotgun crafted it s miserable trying to get the swords
just a heads up whenever you have the upgrade to get a guaranteed red border on first focused weapon of the week you can use that on the recovered leviathan engrams as well make sure you swap to the right class you need it on though as the swords are per class edit i have completed all of my seasonal weapons and have nothing left but leviathan engrams maybe that s why it has given red borders i ve done it for weeks in a row and it s given me red borders upon first purchase of each week
i have all of the swords shotty i d say it took me engrams
i don t see it as a huge problem simply due to how many engrams you get after fully upgrading the table i pulled red borders for the shotgun which was what i wanted didn t really care for the sword with like pulls rng is either your best friend or literally worse than the witness
i had engrams once and i was going for the titan sword since i only had one deepsight left the first one was the sword with no deepsight and the rest were the shotguns which i had already crafted i m usually not one to complain about rng but that did kind of set me off a bit
you re going to have a year of passive engram acquisition you ll be fine
i think it s balanced around how plentiful defiant engrams are this season and with the other defiant weapons dropping as red bars at insanely good rates from normal and legend battlegrounds there s no real need to spend those on defiant weapon focusing so you can sink all of your engrams into the swords and shotgun
here s reasons why i don t have an issue after you get the swords you re still turning them in anyways also next season we will be able to apply patterns so just save and consider it done
i m sure this was stealth nerfed at the same time as neomuna heroic patrol red border drop rate in week or i got red border swords one after the other i should ve made a clip of it finished the sword soon after now i m on the shotgun after maybe engrams spent
can u get calus mini tool from leviathan weapon
it s gonna be around for a year just sink engrams into whenever you have a big pile of them dtg but i want it nooooooooooow
you have all year they only cost glimmer and engrams and we get so many defiant engrams its a great source of legendary shards and gunsmith reputation its fine
i have every single seasonal weapon crafted but it took untold hundreds of defiant engrams to do so the swords are rarer than the shotgun by a wide margin i barely focused any of the seasonal weapons as the drop rate from simply doing the requisite battlegrounds a week coupled with the guaranteed focus once a week was good enough at this point i have no reason to focus anything else and am just racking up defiant engrams i have at the vendor as we speak might try to focus some armor but armor focusing has been booty lately my recommendation for people looking to get these finished optimally focus nothing else except the leviathan engram but still grab your guaranteed seasonal deepsight once a week obviously give yourself as many chances to pull a red border as possible since the other weapons have far more drop sources do the weekly challenges associated with defiant battlegrounds for weapon drops from the event and the completion itself there were multiple instances where i would get a double deepsight drop of seasonal weapons upon completion of a battleground
i spent over engrams for my swords it ll come guardian
i spend defiant engrams on a red border for a seasonal weapon mistake don t focus specific weapons just use the generic engram that s what i did it got most of them pretty reliably spending less engrams than specific focuses i haven t seen a red border drop from the recovered leviathan weapon focusing in over engrams now doubt mistake are you burning defiant keys in the playlist because it rewards red borders on a knockout list at a very high rate to the point where there s not much reason to burn engrams on defiant weapons i only did because i had over engrams
i am total for both weapons i have spent less than engrams you have bad rng bro
those engrams drop everywhere in a week i had about burned them all and got swords and shotguns that were red borders i m not sure what the rate is but considering it s a season long thing and they engrams are so common that seems reasonable i understand that ymmv but i would be curious as to what a good rate would be
best i can do is give you the whole year to get lucky with what you want
if you ve been playing even casually since the season started then you should have them by now you get so many engrams that s it literally not an issue at all this is just another please gimme loot without having to play the game post
i don t think you re actually intended to focus seasonal weapons using a defiant key on the chest guarantees a weapon drop will be deep sight if you don t have all the patterns legendary bgs drop deep sight weapons when using a key leviathan weapons are supposed to be a chase item so you have something to use the engrams on
for real aside from the once a week seasonal deepsight every engram has been used to get the swords i must be at around total pulls engrams and i have the shotgun warlock sword hunter sword titan sword i get rarity but just feels bad
best bet is to stock pile then and then go thru i got of the weapons left just need the titan sword literally won t focus till i have engrams
its shitty to say this but its still the first month of a new season i know most people are almost if not done with all the red borders for the season plus you gain them passively throughout the season wouldn t be surprised if they buff the rate at the end of the year so don t burn yourself out to early
i honestly haven t had too much of a problem i ve already got on the shotgun and on the sword
wait are they that bad i wanted the sword and sg and managed to get the full patterns for both in like a week
i spent defiant engrams om getting the imperial decree i am now clinically insane
finally somebody said it its taking longer to grt these than the raid weapona
i have the warlock sword and the shotgun unlocked at this point i also have one pattern towards the hunter sword i don t really play titan much so i haven t gotten any patterns for it yet definitely agree that the drop rates are really stingy though
i keep getting the sword even after not wanting the patterns i got sword lol
i get so many defiant engrams and honestly don t use them what even are y all doing with them you get for damn near everything
i ve had one red border in my last odd engrams so yeah it s getting to the point where i ve basically stopped even attempting to cradt them
don t waste any engrams on focusing even the gaurenteeed red border each week since keys if they drop a gun it s gaurenteeed red border better to just use them on the leviathan engrams
i m thinking of just saving them until they inevitably up the drop rate near the end of the season
i m saving my engrams for next season when we can apply deepsight to weapons
same with neomuna
focuses engrams for my titan sword
each week posts asking for increased red border drop rates i m just curious how many out there are like me living for that just right random roll crafting is fine for those who like it but personally i prefer not to stand at a table and make a gun with the exact perk set i want it kills the looting aspect in my opinion i do like enhanced perks though i kinda wish they could drop on random rolls for anyone like me who doesn t like crafting
took me to get the titan class sword i know this cause i did pulls one day and did another when i got back up to now i m recovering to try to get the hunter one next
i got pretty good luck on it i just need more for gold tusk and i m already out here with my fully crafted imperial decree
i m still on all three swords but i ve got the shotgun craftable already by i actually mean i have one red border across all three toons
good idea they should implement a new upgrade that does just that and it would allow us to spend the one erroneous war table upgrade we get from the seasonal challenges
bank your swords for next season where you can turn then into a red border
i think you should just hoard the engrams for like a week you ll reach around or so and just spend it all
i have gotten maybe red borders since lightfall dropped this seems absurd
i waited till i had defiant engrams saved up and just burned through them got of the sword and shotgun each
wish i could dump them on previous season weapons that i didn t play during tbh
you re going to have this engram sink for a year
i must be insanely lucky because i already have red swords and i haven t even bought that many of them
i still dont have shotty or sword crafted over engrams
have all the seasonal guns already crafted i ll gladly take a few spins of the wheel with the engrams i get passively from other activities for the rest of the year
i feel super lucky to have already got my main s sword death s razor crafted now i ll sink the engrams into my titan for crown splitter and finishing the shotgun once this warlock sword is leveled i ll have a modern replacement for my beloved falling guillotine with one of the better origin perks
i m still needing that unrelenting incandescent
i just finished the titan sword and it took about engrams to do so honestly not as bad as other have experienced so far warlock and hunter are with only like attempts
crafted imperial decree and titan sword after that i spent more than engrams and only got a red border hunter sword
i d be fine with it if the shotgun just stopped dropping once you craft it tbh
i used about to get the titan sword shaped
add the neomuna weapons while we re at it been stuck at for the pulse rifle for forever now
they definitely do feel stingy but i agree they do seem like a sink for engrams since the regular red border rates are so good especially from legend battlegrounds i ve completed the sword on my warlock out of decrees and i m moving onto my titan now
i m about deep myself still red border swords off haven t even been able to start on the other class swords
that s odd i spent maybe and already have the full patterns for the shotgun and half for the sword i actually thought it was weird how often i was getting red borders
yesterday i spent defiant engrams to try and get my final deep sight throne cleaver didn t get it only got throne cleavers none were deep sight
i mean maybe i m just super lucky but with like 50ish engrams i need one more shotgun and two more for the titan sword
i find that they at least give you something to spend engrams on in the long run it s fairly easy to get deepsight weapons thanks to defiant keys and weekly focusing
it is a engram sink and it is working as intended after dumping engrams out of nowhere i got shotguns and swords red border in a row and got right back at not getting a single one and to be honest with the focusing cost being that low and defiant engrams dropping from everywhere i can understand it feels kinda bad sinking that much engram into the void yes but while the seasonal weapons are easy to get the pattern and armor focusing is absolute garbage now the engrams gotta go somewhere
i decrypted engrams yesterday and got deep sight sword
i don t know man i have all the seasonal weapons crafted and the swords and shotgun crafted those engrams have no use now for me you got some shitty rng friend and likely i have some awesome rng lately
for the shotgun engrams now feels bad man
i do wish previous years red borders weren t locked any red border should be farmable someone who missed last season s retrofit and definitely isn t me
they aren t too bad i ve been dumping my defiant engrams in there whenever i have a bunch which is often and already have the shotgun pattern and am close to the sword pattern i don t think it s that bad
rng do be like that
bungie is so afraid that if they made getting the loot you want easier you would stop playing the game that they don t realize people are stopping because of the loot system anyway just without the loot
you guys are getting different weapons let alone red borders
completely agree on the drop rates but only a week fuck i ve spent at a time and only got red border drops this is after i ve gotten my titan s sword and the shotgun definitely spent way more before that
im engrams in ive seen redborder shotgun and red border sword i stopped wasting my time
its too low of a chance i have for sword and that it your lucky that you have that much unlocked
i got shotty before a single red sword at least theres a whole year to stack engrams going to be annoying to get all the swords
i mean if you ve ran defiant battlegrounds consistently you should have all the red borders by now from the battlegrounds meaning there isn t really any other place to dump you defiant engrams into other than the levi weapons i think it s intended to be a grind for after you ve gotten all of the seasonal red borders
i ve spent about good engrams on this week alone just to get sword borders and no imperial decree like i seriously don t get it like it doesn t want me to have my beloved imperial decree again i have the sword pattern on two of my characters now just missing the hunters and then i ll have that pattern too how many decree s do i have pattern unlocked i normally farm quite a bit each week minus the i use as well for seasonal red boarders
you ve got all year it ll be okay a buff would be sick but if you re actively seeking them hard enough to be annoyed by drop rates you ll get em before they re gone i d imagine
it s been weeks man
for me it has seemed super generous you get so many defiant engrams i had all seasonal weapons done by week and i have one sword pattern partial on another and away on the shotgun it s seemed like the easiest seasonal grind yet
idk i got the shotgun hunter and titan sword finished i think i m or for warlock it s not terrible i usually tried to have at least before decoding tho i was probably just insanely lucky also this is purely just my imagination but weeks when i didn t buy a red border of the defiant weapons my first recovered leviathan came red border
you could just keep different swords in your vault and deep sight them next season when they add manual deep sight at least this is what i ll do
r dtg when the random drops are random
was a whole lot worse a couple weeks ago spent engrams and only got red borders spent another or so this past weekend and i got imperial decree red borders and of the sword red borders they ve definitely upped the rates already but yeah they do feel a bit stingy then again you get at least one defiant engram after every single activity completion so it really isn t that bad
i think i dropped or so and got the pattern felt like maybe chance for a red border which seemed alright to me
wait those are craftable ain t even seen a red border sword or shotgun from it only being slightly facetious i seriously don t have any progress and i ve pumped quite a few engrams into it
you get engrams constantly and it only costs
after getting all of the other weapons through the super generous chests and focusing options i ve been dumping whatever i have into that pool and completed both weapons in about days it didn t feel bad in any way for me so maybe completing the others ups your red boarder chance or something not sure but i hope you get your deepsights soon
i spent well over a hundred engrams to get the imperial decree border and throughout those hundred and a bunch more on top of that afterwards i still have yet to get one single red border sword on any class lmao
i mean i think it s fine you can get engrams for doing next to nothing i think they wanna reward people who put time into it
yeah it feels like we re missing a way of focusing them directly once a week like everything else as it is i pretty much plan on stopping once i can craft the shotgun and don t plan on bothering with all the swords
i just got my imperial decree last night im with titan sword and for the other two
i have burned engrams at least into that stupid focuser and im stuck on for the fucking shotgun
i m an over the top excessive player and banked every single engram into those swords so far i have the titan sword and warlock any player that s not insanely hardcore will never see these things
i like how glimmer now feels more useful but yea the grinding phase capping at 250k is so dumb especially because most of the times you want to save for stuff like trials iron banner i always get tons of glimmer when i have no way to spend it and have none when i have limited time to spend it
exotic focusing will he expensive but not because of the glimmer the real limitation will be the ciphers
destiny glimmer cap x200b with destiny we are increasing the glimmer cap to we are also turning up costs to then what was the point x200b look at warframe no cap on literally anything and there is a single currency that just decays argon crystals i have like million salvage orokin cells by todays standards in destiny orokin cells are the equivalent of enhancement prisms maybe since they require from you to build most prime weapons no cap bungie is it hard we are increasing exotic cipher cap from to why not we are removing the cap from x200b like i m already pulling useless exotics from collections to store my ascendant shards in those yes i lose in the process but i can only do so much or when i reset vendors i outright just dismantle ascendant shard because i have literally nothing i can masterwork and i do not want to waste shards on an exotic armor at the moment just that one moment if it will ever happen at all when they remove the cap from literally everything the community will be pleased for a while literally the cap on most things is a bane of existence for some of us
i do recall a time when bungie stated it was to keep the servers stable but i dont have confirmation on this
bungie has said before they put hard limits on materials because they want to balance prices between hardcore players and casuals bungie is worried if they allow players to grind materials endlessly with no limit then hardcore players can stock up and never have to worry about the price of anything ever its prolly tough to balance between some players who can afford anything and some players who have limited time to farm thus limited resources for example i have 20k legendary shards and despite doing lots of weapon focusing and banner purchasing my total only keeps going up instead of down the most i lost was during the shard focus cost for trials and iron banner and even then ive made all the shards i lost back by now but that shards to focus cost was brutal for newer more casual players so they changed it that said even if i understand bungies fear of players grinding beyond their economy i dont agree with it let people be rewarded for playing the game its silly we have to load prisms into blues just to dismantle them for more cores
i have plenty of rainmakers to counter the sink lol
yeah they ll remove glimmer cap and then in a year people like you will post things like wtf bungo why does it cost million glimmer to focus a single engram now
they probably keep it so lazy people like me just spend all their legendary shards every time they need to top up
looks at defiant engrams with dread
na removing the need for glimmer in everything is what needs to be done how can one single resource which is capped be needed for anything and everything a player wants to invest into on their character master work weapons masterwork armor buy bounties craft and re craft your weapons and ofc the main one focusing engrams it is silly and clearly designed to limit time gate how quickly a player can power up focusing for example could get you really good gear in a relatively short span of time if you have engrams ready to be focused glimmer costs are built around a f2p type system i really wish the game was not f2p to avoid such nonsense tbh
or let us buy legen shards with glimmer
me with 39k glimmer legendary and destination materials how the fuck y all get some many upgrade mats man i do not get it
glimmer cap should be
you will be poor and you will be happy
bring the cap back down to 25k
1million or a billion or somewhere in between glimmer is a better goal than get commendation score
better suggestion remove glimmer entirely
remove all currency caps
remove caps on everything
its completely stupid with all the talk about respecting players time the fact that a currency is capped is the biggest load of hoopla
lol do ppl even think before they post if glitter cap is removed than the price for everything will literally increase
but you can just trade your planetary mats and refresh your glimmer in seconds more glimmer would be nice but i ve honestly never been bothered by the cap at all
if you remove the glimmer cap or make it higher you just make things more expensive or essentially remove it as a currency it wouldn t take long to get millions and at that point glimmer just stops being relevant just look at legendary shards some people like me have thousands and new players will struggle to get even digits
some people just want bungie to excuse the inordinate amount of time they spend in game by letting them hoard materials in easily repeatable activities so they don t have to collect them in a slightly possibly harder activity later if you don t have anything to focus and you hit the cap stop playing for a few minutes it only takes a few hours to hit the cap again from zero play when you actually need resources
can we remove the cap on engagement materials while we re at it shards and we can only hold ouch
it would be nice to see the cap increased by a bit maybe to 400k or so much more than that and you ll start to see economy issues that ll drive bungo to raise glimmer costs which will hurt newer players
i believe you can store transmats to dismantle as a workaround bungie is small indie dev and can t change glimmer cap cuz small indie dev
why do we have such low caps on anything it s a looters game fucking stupid always has been
they won t touch it it s a cute little time grind sink to keep people coming back and having to tick random boxes to acquire or store yet another currency
glimmer cap sucks having to farm pubs is even worse all sources need to be 10x and the same with legendary shards they moved the whole economy to shards a glimmer the spend rate far exceeds the drop rates tell me you don t know how to create a decent economy without telling you don t know how to create a decent economy
deleted
i haven t played in a few expansions glimmer is still capped that s actually hilarious i genuinely don t know how yall put up with this game
for now it s not a big deal since we can still turn in a ton of old materials from glimmer but that will end
me after spending 125k on the exotic kiosk and another 120k for xur hawkmoon and dmt rolls
the focusing costs are expensive but the way i see it i m going to focus a handful of exotics when i get the ciphers engrams and then never touch focusing again at least for the handful of exotics i ll be chasing and as exotic engrams will only drop in the wild the rate at which people hoard engrams isn t going to be that big lost sectors nightfalls and the vex incursions will still drop exotics directly i can count on one hand the number of exotic engrams i ve had drop in the wild over the last few weeks the fact is i ll be sitting on my ciphers than engrams at any point ultimately increasing the glimmer cap just allows bungie to increase costs further this game is a command economy where bungie controls everything from income acquisition rate to costs of goods we don t have a marketplace like other mmos so we want a million glimmer cap great focusing now costs glimmer
glimmer just needs to go to the postmaster and life is good
if i m short on glimmer and running heroic public events is ultimate glimmer booster or public defender better as a ghost mod
cries in 40k glimmer
there likely needs to be a cap for technical reasons but raising it to 500k should be enough for most people
the problem is which they created is that if you uncap it you can store as much of it as you want and it becomes less valuable but if you cap it then people hoard because currencies aren t really easy fast to grind the whole economy needs a pass and reworked
let s not forget you can only get one set of light subclass fragments and aspects within the cap
not a fan of any of the resource caps honestly anti player game design
remember when the glimmer cap was 25k pepperidge farm remembers
the probably can t because of technical limitations
honestly a lot of the caps are beginning to feel really bad i get they don t want players to have large fat stacks of the resource but so many of the caps feel incredibly arbitrary and way too low especially with how the cap makes the vendor rank up experience annoying and feel terrible
i ll take it a step further than you upgrade modules just need to die already everything should be upgradeable with glimmer alone enhancement cores and prisms should be all you need to mw legendary armor ascendant shards should be used only on exotics period exotic ciphers are too rare and even with a cap of it s dumb to need them for armor focusing they want people to have exotics unlocked for guardian ranks and that s just dumb asf i have every exotic from the kiosk and that took years to grind between the single cipher weekly and raid spoils i ve literally ignored them for two years now because i no longer need them we have enough currency sinks in the game and most of their original purposes have changed over the years raid banners should phase out and just be free rally banners another unnecessary gatekeeping step i want to engage with the content not the micro systems constantly in the background
yes for the love of god please remove the damn cap already
we ve heard you and we re reducing all glimmer gains by thus doubling the time it takes to reach the cap enjoy fuckbags
atleast double it fr
the thing that really drove the problem home for me was starting a new character and realizing that to unlock all the aspects and fragments for just a single subclass costs way more glimmer than you can even carry makes absolutely no sense
especially since we don t have other resources that we can bank our excess glimmer into i can remember using spider as a resource exchange to bank my excess glimmer now the only thing for that is ships sparrows which have their own limits
i agree and i also feel legendary shards are super hard to get when i need like for a single upgrade module
i feel they gotta remove caps in general i don t want to have to spend of the max amount i can have of something on one item hell i want to swim in my vaults of glimmer and materials and spend them gloriously all this does is just timegate your spending
if we re talking about raising caps how about golf balls if we re expected to spend as much as on a potentially useless distribution of stats on a single exotic
the glimmer cap would be way less of an issue if bounties were all still apiece i came back to d2 with like 220k and blew threw it going from to because i was just loading up a full suite of bounties every day and letting of them expire if i didn t get them through normal play
i can blow all 250k in seconds buying banners not that glimmer is hard to get but it s tedious to have to go get more after with all the focus changes i think there should be at least a cap or one million if it s feasible
new glimmer cap bungie
that s why i still have 25k dusklight
they re not going to do that because anything over 250k is not fdic insured
all that will be heard is grinding glimmer itself is easy cap lowered to 150k and gains cut in half
it will never happen because bungie wants you to waste time and not have glimmer when you needed so it forces you to farm public event and such player retention blah bablah
with the tease of exotic focusing and increase of exotic cipher cap to at a time you would only be able to foxus exotics before the 60k glimmer cost ruins your bank account
i never like resource caps on anything remove em all
i mean let s be real if there s a cap at all on glimmer million would be a reasonable number anything below that is just a joke it should be more or as op said there should be no cap at all
look somebody has to pay for the tower rebuild after the red war so guardians pay the vanguard tax on their glimmer up to bluecube earned and tax on glimmer earnings above that when the tower rebuild is finished you ll see your tax glimmer at work guardian
having a larger number would surely break the game sorry kiddo
destiny has a mobile game economy if they increase the glimmer cap the game will break will be the excuse
double it atleast
it s bungie s intended incentive for extended player retention they don t want good players farming too much stuff and then fucking off to do something they d rather like to do they want them to sink in hours and only pay attention to d2
when i hit glimmer cap and dont know what else to spend it on i just put them into exotic ships or sparrows and vault them and keep playing but i agree it could absolutely be raised id be happy with 500k
bungie wants you spending all your time in game playing so you can t play other games so you ll spend more money on destiny even if this isn t really true
remove or dramatically increase basically all caps
it s a cycle people constantly sit at glimmer cap and ask for more sinks bungie introduces sinks people ask to increase cap then sit at the new cap currencies are supposed to have inflow and outflow you shouldn t be able to get to cap passively then have on hand enough to spend it whenever that spending opportunity comes around
one thing ill never understand is the capping in this game i hate that i have over infused exotics in my vault because when i do golfball farming its the only way i can store them just let us have as many as we collect bungo
it would be awesome if they would but knowing the game engine and their limitations i can t see it glimmer cap might be tied to the arc subclass and removing the cap might break the arc super or something stupid like that remember they still have dmg values tied to frame rate and they break the game every season trying to do a qol change
all caps should be extended or eliminated specially with how much they ask for focusing you focus a couple of exotics and you are out of golf balls pretty quick enhancing perks the same thing
and remove power level to boot so i can save mats for things that matter like upgrading my gear weapons that will be newly farmed for instead of giving them all to banshee so he can pay off his 67th sparrow mortgage
they might bump it up but they ll never uncap it it s part of the grind and they like it that way
community material caps are ridiculous in many cases just let us play the game bungie caps are necessary if we didn t have them the players would get bored new content weapons would get upgraded too quickly community huh
keeps us logging in and grinding gotta keep the wheelhouse turning somehow and in this case we re the water
agreed glimmer cap at this point is useless we need more at times i am at max and don t need it but when i need it it s gone and i am glimmer poor for a few days
i hate caps soooooo much this game a filled with them
it s super annoying even having capped glimmer you can t purchase all the light subclasses aspects fragments supers jumps grenades class abilities of one element you can get close sure but this is capped glimmer gains and you can t even purchase all of the subclass you want you gotta go back out and grind just to get the rest and god forbid you want more than one
what should the glimmer cap be
i haven t been at glimmer call since the new season started
things will have to cost more to account for the not being able to track it
remember when we were here in coo at what was it glimmer
no reason for it to not be
they need to remove all these caps 250k glimmer golf balls shards etc its all arbitrary and annoying
agreed get rid of the friggin cap period the grind is real work cut the bullshit it s like bungie wants us to work for tips
i wouldn t be opposed to this change but i think bungie would they have been putting caps on a lot of materials for a while now presumably to keep people constantly playing rather than stockpiling materials one sort of workaround is to buy legendary ships for glimmer shards and stockpile them in your vault then you can sell them for glimmer shards when you need glimmer you do lose some glimmer but it can be helpful to store glimmer if you are constantly at the 250k cap
agreed make it 1m at least
please
i rarely ever touch 250k i m always low and hard to find glimmer out there
i had to dismantle a lot of stuff on my vault to even get glimmer i m low on glimmer
you may have noticed that you get a lot more glimmer from chests and activity rewards now plus you can configure a glimmer booster ghost
its almost like they intentionally cap it low so you have to play more for engagement instead of hoarding like a dragon
i either never have enough or have the max definitely agree that the cap is way too low honestly i think the cap on prisms and shards should increase as well just double them
and when a new expansion drops you go through the story capped on glimmer earn gear not worth using for upgrading and owning earning lots of upgrade modules you re showered with glimmer but you don t get or need any of what they give you because you re already capped then when you get to the point where upgrading is relevant you blow through that small cap in nothing flat
hot take remove glimmer it is an arbitrary currency that is extremely available but limited by a cap on how much we can hold at a time bungie could just remove it all together and it would only change us turning in the thousands of materials long time players have held onto it is a currency that for long time players has little to no value but to new players who have no way to build a reserve on it is extremely limiting because of the cap
this might be too powerful they should get added to certain fragments like fire spites and breaches not just all the time on still require building into them with the update announced that they will start to grab charges of light on pickup not always but a chance having an aspect that makes them constantly is great but having fragments that can make some sometimes would be good too
how about each aspect creating shards based on what the aspect does with an internal cooldown
next season will probably be arc stasis and strand where stasis will receive a decent rework
shards should be a fragment thing
harvest aspects should be intrinsic
as others have stated shards should be intrinsic it should also start recharging all your abilities on pickup not just melee similar to ionic traces grim harvest should now provide an overshield thus removing the whisper of rime fragment bungie can create a new fragment to replace it for balance bungie can reduce the aspect from to and return it to shatterdive no aspect should provide only one fragment that is absolutely ridiculous
for revenants in particular it should give themselves and nearby allies a stasis overshield so hunters have decent support that was lost with renewal graso s nerf
as long as shard generation is locked to an entirely separate aspect with no other use stasis will always feel weaker than the other classes that can use aspects and still generate subclass bits
i would love it if arc traces and stasis shards switched function back to how the mods used to be with stasis doing a little of everything and traces doing melee
the shard should give damage reduction for a few seconds
given elemental shards coming back no but i do think a fragment to generate them with a cooldown is fine
arc titans make ionic traces solar titans can make firesprites why the he ll can t void titans make void breaches am i blind or missing something
don t think stasis needs a buff
i agree and stasis shards should be intrinsic to stasis as a whole edit i m glad to see more posts of stasis buffs on this subreddit bungie seriously needs to fix a lot of these issues with stasis
is you are having trouble running stasis rn you could try running double or even triple reaper while using font mods i like double reaper and time dilation i think reaper stacking makes up for how hard it can be to get stasis grenade or melee kills
would be nice for some stuff like if bonds generated shards on super kills and conduction generated a shard on stasis multikills or something like that
i d just incorporate the aspects into like fragments and rebalance the remaining aspects especially on hunter to compensate grim harvest and echo of refraction are already extremely similar so are tectonic harvest and echo of fissures then create a new fragment for glacial harvest alongside a new fragment to help generate orbs and it s in much better shape
i was about to buy lightfall until i played it and realized they absolutely gutted my builds i dont have enough time to re grind new builds im done with this game for awhile
this is probably true and would be lovely if they were fragment related on the other hand i d lose the aspect with fragment slots on hunter which would definitely make things difficult to build around for me lol
i d love to see some fragments like making shards on a finisher or super cast although i m not sure what else you could do without stepping on the toes of each class aspect
when i said generate them intrisincally i didnt mean like they appear passively i do think they should be tied to fragments like the respective light counterparts obviously
i hate the idea of a chance on pickup gives players too much false sense of security in dire situations that could cost them if i pick up a consumable i expect it to give me the same result each time
adding fragments will always be a sidegrade since it competes with current frags builds it wouldn t fix any inherent issues
this might be too powerful it absolutely would be lol
yeah but stasis really hasnt got much going for it rn strand really just does most things better and more lethally
god i hope so it needs one bad
no offence but that s a pipe dream ability team is preoccupied with strand aspects we might get some stasis vibes although most likely it ll be via artifact perks major rework is extremely unlikely a temporary buff is possible
deleted
thats what i meant when i said intrinsically
yeah thats what my suggestion aims to solve leave shard generation to fragments i e make it intrinsic to the subclass itself and change the harvest aspects to buff the shards in some capacity
traces doing melee what did arc titans ever do to you
how about no arc warlock already kind of sucks
this is what whisper of rime effectively does by adding effective hp with an overshield
we already have a damage reduction fragment near crystals and frozen targets
elemental shards is coming back for everyone including the ones who don t need an aspect or even fragments to generate their elemental collectible
elemental shards wont suddenly fix the major issues plauging stasis neither does my suggestion but both are steps in the right direction
you re blind and missing something echo of domineering works intrinsically with shield bash and suppression grenade and controlled demolition makes echo of cessation work with all abilities
yea no definitely not it s not like every other subclass in the game is just straight up better and stasis no longer has a niche anymore
what a shit take
stasis is the worst option out all right now and has been seriously power crept
you can even use a fragment that refunds class ability when killing stasis debuffed enemies
that s touch of winter which enhances your grenades grim harvest is the one that generates stasis shards and gives slots
maybe kills with shatter damage not too uncommon but still leaves the aspects as a more convenient source
most times it usually means it s after x number of pickups like with kills for heavy and such
i fail to see how all the other light classes get to generate their respective variations of shards without aspects stasis will just have the choice of using an aspect to further enhance that in some minor capacity they can also reduce the fragment slots the aspect gives to balance it accordingly stasis is really in a tough spot i doubt a change like this would suddenly turn it into a must run for everything
if you added them without having to make a choice yeah maybe at least as far as whisper of rime is concerned that would never happen though because all subclass collectibles except tangles are optional in the sense that they need you to pick a fragment or aspect to actually spawn op said elsewhere that ideally they mean to move shard spawning to fragments which is doable and would mainly equalize the stasis mechanics with the light subclasses though you might need to give them cds at that point
perhaps at a minimum there should be a stasis related artifact mod and stasis should go into the surge rotation since we have solar and void now
yeh i was talking about like surges and artifact mods
so how do i generate void breaches
stasis is one of the best options for gm nightfall and having at least for a raid is very useful
because of the trade off and because of how strong the stasis fragments are just like with solar i like having five fragment slots hell i love it
op said elsewhere what i said was said without this insight but yea does this by default no choice or tradeoffrequired is absolutely broken take this fragment to get this effect is almost universally not
put on the void breach fragments cessation domineering or harvest and do what they say for example equip echo of domineering suppress an enemy with a suppression grenade then kill it
berserker any stasis class for cc
used to be yes but after the lightfall changes its complete shit the fragments even include shards in their descriptions still for perks lol bungies so lazy they don t even fix the fragment descriptions to match their nerfs
yeah you re right on all counts just wanted to add the context i think the interesting thing is that all three harvest aspects translate neatly into fragments tectonic into shards glacial into hedrons and grim into refraction all those fragments have the exact same activation criteria i think it d be fair and wouldn t unbalance the subclass to do this matching i wouldn t be okay with this without thorough aspect balancing and reworking though tbh given what they ve made for all subclasses strand included so far i can t really fathom that cryoclasm exists a single arc keyword that is automatically available to everyone is literally superior to a whole ass aspect that s absurd
seems like a lot of work make it easier and tie to volatile multi kills and we ll be happy crayon eaters
yea i don t think we were ever in disagreement lol also i mean developmentally re it lagging it makes sense right stasis was being designed during shadowkeep and afaik there was some kind of gap between the launch of beyond light and the light reworks starting dev maybe a part of a season my best guess is they just realized the scope of what would be allowable in the sandbox changed really significantly in whatever dev gap on subclasses might exist in that month period and so stasis is technically in line with the new subclass design philosophy but it s so early in there that things are folded into it in a less refined way i feel like they have to come back to it in the next year ish maybe even before s23 but i also don t think it actually has that far to be tweaked to be up to date my stasis builds are mostly still about as good as they were last season from what i ve played of them since strand dropped obviously i would love to see some upgrades like the ones you suggest but i m fine with it as it is now while we wait for them to do it i just think it s kind of a given that it ll happen and some community ideas for how it should happen are a little misguided not consistent with the way the aspect mod fragment system is actually organized for the other subclasses or the way it s balanced
congrations there s one for volatile too all you have to do is read descriptions
yes echo of cessation
you will play it 6x and you will like it
it s even funnier considering how easy the rewards are to get for this season we ve all year and all of the reds are dropping like candy from the missions and we have focusing and we get engrams per activity
this is a solid opinion and will stand by you sir
a very good question indeed
yeah it s dumb you d think bungie would have some kind of consistency with things
if you re thinking of doing defiant battlegrounds how are you not at pinnacle cap by now
all i need is a warlock bond to hit rank ran the regular ones can t bring myself to run more
money s paw finger curls thank you for highlighting this imbalance to us we will look into vanguard opps and crucible during iron banner trials to ensure that players can no longer earn pinnacles at the same time bungie probably
the way bungie has loot vs time invested balanced for every activity in the game is so inconsistent
i laughed so hard at this cuz that s exactly how it is
because rng because not everyone plays every single available activity every single week because of a myriad other reasons
so tedious and boring
for real haha we do it tho
reminds me when i started playing a couple years ago and would get one of the defeat combatants using finishers bounties while having no clue wtf even was a finisher this game seriously teaches fuck all to new players
lots of the mechanisms that have been added to strikes and battlegrounds had various campaign introductions to teach players as those campaigns have been removed shunted to outdated dlc or whatever that knowledge isn t transmitted to new players in theory the new light missions should have all of this but that would require someone to really write a good bunch of intro missions to teach players about all the various mechanics and such as well as the lore to date
but the ghosts have the little finisher icon above them
i m not sure if this already exists but adding some of these lesser known things as things as requirements would be useful for example crush ghosts belonging to hive guardians in nightfall the corrupted charge the orb by passing it to another other player to be completed times
it s because any returning players got bumped to rank automatically as i had never played witchqueen i too had no idea how to kill hive ghosts until someone told me
im a veteran because i played when it 1st came out then took a break for a few years now im back i dont have a fudging clue what to do half the time but im rank i feel bad for anyone who gets stuck with me
truly two of the veterans of all time
so either levels don t tell you about finishers or they gloss over it so quickly that it s easily forgotten can bungie ever get new player onboarding right the only way to get new people and keep them is hope they like the experience enough to research everything themselves or have an experienced player to help them along and act as an encyclopaedia what i do for my lot
this is why the system let s down its new or returning players and whomever designed it has never actually taught anyone the game
honestly i think destiny needs some kind of training gauntlet game mode where bungie implements a bunch of the mechanics that new players don t understand and have a character do audio explaining what they need to do crushing hive guardian ghosts standing on plates throwing balls to teammates to charge them up etc
me a returning new player coming in for lightfall cause strand looked cool classified by the game as a veteran game loot region chests in neomuna me what the fuck is a region chest
i didn t play wq at all so i had no idea until i realized it s the same as a finisher thank fuck other people were right there usually zero instructions
ngl the whole crushing the ghosts thing had me stumped when i first dove into the witch queen eventually figured it out but was probably more due to accidentally clicking and having an aaaahhh now i get it moment
i m skeptical that there isn t a quest baked into guardian ranks or new light that doesn t tutorialize finishers
people still don t know to pass to ball in the elevator of that one strike
i see s all the time that never deal with champions and have exotics on that don t match their subclass or weapons and have shit ability stats that cute wittle number next to a person s name means nothing when clueless people can just get carried to them and exploit commendations
honestly i played very little destiny back during season and came back days ago to try it out again and i m beyond frustrated it took me a whooping days to drop the game again because of how new player unfriendly the game is i found myself spending half the time i m supposed to be playing just googling and youtubing things like what is the icon above low health mobs is or why am i getting one shot by everything when the recommended level is lower than mine etc to add extra salt strikes or any matchmade content i end up trying just puts me into the mission alone or people just enter and instantly leave i really want to play the game very casually just come in shot stuff get some casual player loot and go sleep but it s doing everything it possibly can to simply make me quit as soon as i logged in and let s not even start with the fact i had to google videos that are explaining the ui in general and of course bottom line is game gave me rank and branded me a veteran when in truth i m absolutely clueless
i am kind of glad to hear that i am not the only one having such experiences and it made chuckle hard to be honest i am a solo pve player and i do not consider myself a veteran although i have been playing since a few weeks before the release of beyond light i ran a few strikes yesterday and what you described happened to me in the lightblade strike i was the only with the other players at it kind of felt like the blind leading the blind lol
and also dont forget no matter how high skilled you are youre locked and staying at unless you fork over money for lightfall my skill doesnt determine my guardian rank my wallet does the whole system was just not thought out well
i fucking hate that this battleground bullshit is part of the strike playlist it takes so much longer than a regular strike and it s just not the same thing
why did you not do anything and let it revive twice instead of just killing the ghost
been playing destiny since alpha d1 and i cannot stand new lights i m sorry but i m to the point now where i want to run in knock out sem pinnacles and bounce not spend to mins doing activity plus it s a little late to come into the game with the conclusion of light and dark saga ending next year just my opinion i m sure i ll get some hate for this
guardian rank is a joke right now cross made a great video about it tbh guardian ranks should be hard the highest level should be the pinnacle of destiny difficulty like solo flawless contest mode raids etc
realistically it s that should be initiate
in any match making mode i just assume that nobody else knows what to do crush hive ghosts they ll shoot at it control points just a random flag inside a random circle hero nightfall champions better hope you kill them before they speedrun to the next encounter something something orbs forget it
i cannot stand the guardian rank system it literally means nothing rank system should be based off how many triumphs you ve done 21k is the highest
i still can t figure out how i can get the void volitity bounty done inside gambits i get like to max
the only reason i knew what finishers were at all when i jumped back into d2 was because i had been playing doom eternal in that time so the reflex s were fresh they need to come up with a proper tutorial for new lights that teaches all of the buttons
i m not angry at new playera but when i see rank or even and don t know what to do in forsaken strikes shadowkeep strikes bl strikes season battleground and this same at wq just wtf i stay at rank because strand and season i don t buy and i don t want to do what weteran but can level up and get team with rano above my and see they don t know what to do i feel bungie wants make something like warframe master rank but you want next level buy dlc another level buy season rank buy dungeon key i know im next season we all start at rank but to lvl up still need to buy season or just play domek strikes gambit shaxx and do other f2p things i don t know for me this ranks are it madness madness
i was recently in one yesterday but the blueberries i was with were higher ranks than i neither of them knew what to do with the ghosts but luckily i got to them in time to crush them at the end i died both were just shooting at the ghost it came back before i got to it we had to do it all over again
new player here the tutorial in new light does teach you finishers but it teaches you and then it never makes sense to use them and it never teaches you how to weave them into your actions and are you even supposed to have finishers as part of your routine
u did too much i would ve crushed the ghost and kept it pushing you working to hard to get them to learn they ll learn eventually
you should rank one until you pass a ball in corrupted
they should add the first mission of the witch queen to rank or something
also what is a defiant battleground and how do i play it
veteran basically means returning player should say noob in all honesty because the majority of 6s i ve run into this season seem more incompetent than the 3s i ve been matched up with in some activities
lol for real my buddy just started playing again after like years we both vets tho i don t play hardcore anymore like i did with d1 but i ve been playing steady since beyond light came out again tho
they must have left very early not to have to deal with finishers i can t even remember if they existed at launch or not
this happens to me whenever i get this activity the damn ghost has the finisher icon above it it isn t hard to figure out unless you re a brand new player and have never done a finisher before
part of the problem is the tutorial when you first start is extremely basic and doesn t cover any of the new mechanics like finishing there s soo many interactions like matching element to pop a shield stunning and causing damage that aren t explained at all idc if you need to add extremely jarring heres how champions work hand holding guide do whatever it s just a shame soo many people struggle with champions purely because their mechanics aren t explained to them unless the watch a youtube video how many people know you don t have to pop a barrier to stop the regen only do damage to it how many people know as the difficulties increase the stagger duraition recover duration health regen also gets quicker sure you may eventually pick up on it
if your rank you should know how to make all the public events heroic and how to finish bare minimum
kinda makes sense a person who has lived in a home for years decides to leaves home for years and before they come back a new device is introduced into the home with no prior experience with the device they dont understand how it functions or even what the symbols mean that person would be considered a veteran because they ve done a lot for the home prior to leaving and probably know some tricks and tips people who moved in during that year period don t know it s all about perspective maybe they didn t even know what finishers are but they might have gotten the redix s claymore before they quit because the pvp sandbox wasnt getting updates
i ve been playing destiny since house of wolves and i m the same rank as some new light who just started playing this year really rubs me the wrong way i don t know why bungie felt the need to create guardian ranks when we already had a good gauge of player skill triumph score
this game seriously teaches fuck all to new players worst of all is how blind some players are to this they think all players know what they know and then they get angry when someone doesn t know something like finishers and be all aggravated when someone asks a question about it but yes this game needs better tutorials for sure
this game is the absolute worst when it comes to new lights seriously without use of 3rd party means like reddit or discord youtube etc destiny would have a fucking miniscule amount of people who ever hit end game or could do raids
had to google it yesterday doing vanguard challenges lol
yah the new player experience is honestly horrible they ve added soo many things which just isn t explained at all one of my friends went about years not knowing that finishers was a thing at all
i came back in plunder and had to do light blade from the map node i had no idea what a finisher was myself and other blewbs sat there for minutes before i googled it
i wondered why i would keep exploding doing iron banner today had to look up eruption and how it works
not that the new player experience isn t terrible but there s a whole node on your character sheet just for finishers did you just not explore very much
if i remember correctly i think finishers were useable in crucible at one point and it was some of the most frustrating fun i ve ever had at the same time it s all so hazy it could ve been a day dream while playing actual crucible
do y all not go straight into the control menu to find out how to control your characters it s right there lol
it s actually something i hate about this game and the devs no other game that i have ever played has a worse new player experience
been playing for two weeks have no idea what this is there s too many other things i have no idea about to try figure out first
hive guardian have been introduced in the witch queen campaign the first mission contain a tutorial on how to kill them and f2p player can do the first mission btw
is that what the dot is
i dont like the dot i wish they would just flash or something
while on one hand i would love for them too add these i can see it also not working for example i was helping a relatively new light during season of the seraph run the exotic mission even though the game specifically explains the mechanics each time you acquire them he never could figure them out i asked him about it and he said oh yeah i ignore those too much text it was very frustrating i am all for bungie adding explanations for mechanics on the game just know that you can t completely idiot proof the game
nah giving commendation is more useful
yeah the game has changed a lot since release it s almost an entirely different game
yeah this is me played d1 played year of d2 now i m back as a veteran and have no idea what a finisher is not sure what stasis is but at least i can still punch things in the face with my titan i feel bad for others on my fireteam as i watch them run around with orbs and zap things with orb lasers why does the helm even exist
this
to be fair region chests have been around since d1 same icon in patrol and everything
its a good teaching moment you dont wanna hand them the answer but i would have hinted about finishers awesome aha moment and its cool to discover something like that on your own
if you have the class item mods on that make use of finishers then yes they would become part of your routine
i would only get annoyed at that if they joined a raid dungeon or other high level content thing only because it means i m going to be there an extra hour explaining things they should know at the point that they are doing high level content and if i didn t sign up to teach i don t want to spend that extra time that really only applies to basic stuff like finishers too i don t care that much if your mods aren t perfect as long as you will listen to advice
with the amount of specialized mechanics and guardian actions in the game there should be a mandatory training ground that must be completed something like what tf2 or halo infinite have but you must complete the basic required actions x times in order to proceed to the first campaign missions
when i first started playing i remember not even knowing how to customise my guardian and beset quitting destiny from his complex the modding system looked
people can be annoying little bitches man but hey i guess why not feel smuggly superior about their gaming knowledge if thats the only thing they got going in their lives
i m mad
i had to google yellow orb over enemies to learn what it was
i just came back recently after not playing since the first month or two the game was out and i ve had to consume an ungodly amount of resources to know what s up i m like gear overall and i m still to timid to try and find a group for dungeons and raids worried i ll just mess them up lol
yeah but that requires new players to actually go a do that mission which isnt part of the new light quest line so how would new player know they need to do those missions so they know what to do in the event htey run into the strikes that have light hive in them
you have to also consider that many players just dismiss i dare to say most players any new message that appears on screen so they do not read them thus missing on the tutorials
yeah little yellow white dot
they do both flash and have the dot
and the people that do know how to read get extremely fed up with the prompt as well
bungie could do this if they put in a very short training tutorial mode that required you to complete mini objectives like doing finishers or whatever and require new players to beat the tutorial in order to join matchmade content
deleted
yeah it s just a goddam pointless trip they could just shove the wartable right next to zavalas office and it would be much better
which is fine if you played destiny i came in during forsaken having never had the ability to play either of the games before that because that s when i got a computer that could run d2 and i don t own any consoles d1 was on and game doesn t tell you what a region chest is had to go and look that up i d found a bunch of them before that point but didn t know it was any different from the other chests around patrol zones i feel like it would at least be beneficial to put a little these are marked with a symbol on your map but are likely to be hidden on the objective
yeah but a new player isn t given that information without googling what a region chest is
today google told me what those cross with dot symbols on the map indicate
that just prolongs the strike and makes it more annoying no one has time for teaching moments in the playlist people just wanna get their pinnacle and get out just kill the thing they ll figure it out on their own eventually
indeed that would be for the best
yeah it s daunting
as others have said watch tutorials to get an idea and then look for groups offering teaching feel free to send me a message if you want help i m always happy to teach people
watch tutorial videos to learn mechanics and find a teaching sherpa lfg post now get out there and have fun good luck
it s pretty rough way to learn but just hop into a dungeon solo you ll be at it awhile learning but it s definitely doable at the very least you ll learn a bit before doing it in a pug that s how i learned them anyways
you will mess up and that s fine just find groups who are cool with a few wipes while teaching
it d odd they don t even have an enemy codex once you discover them could go a long way hey i just died to this new wyvern enemy lets look at it s codex entry to see how it works oh it can be suspended cool as an example
there should be a training mode that all new players have to complete before doing matchmade stuff it wouldn t have to be anything long or difficult just something that spells out stuff like plates charging orbs finishing hive guardians banking motes using relics etc it would only need to be like a minute tutorial and could reward a legendary version of kvostov the functions exactly like the exotic version from d1
that s what i never understood everyone says destiny doesn t teach anyone anything but then what are all those tooltips at the bottom of the screen that pop up there for then seriously i ve played with new lights who told me straight up oh i just dismiss those because they get annoying when they don t go away like dude if you actually do what the tip is telling you to do it would go away and you might learn something about how to play the game some people really do just need to be handheld by someone telling them what to do because they can t read a tooltip that pops up explaining what to do
there is definitely a portion of responsibility on the player for not actually reading tips or descriptions granted it s small but boy people who skip over everything shouldn t be complaining
those players should be ranked clickchimp instead of veteran
it is definitely a no win situation
i dont think this is gen z exclusive there are far more interesting ways to introduce information than a wall of text
funny thing about that you don t need to be in the strike playlist anymore for pinnacle do it in the nightfall like a sane person
it is easier and faster to complain rather than looking into what you could have done better or you missed i have been guilty of that myself several times when i don t understand what a text is trying to say
lmao yup
still weird that vouchsafe and doom of chelchis were neck and neck doom is simply a better weapon even when accounting for how much better i like lightweight scouts than precision ones frenzy doubling up on both being a reload perk and a damage perk on top of explosive payload being a damage perk and a range perk is hard to beat
anyone else prefer gridskipper over veles for void pulse rifle rapid fire archetype feels better to me
i like seeing it all organized one minor nitpick the veles x pulse rifle in the screenshot is not craftable
thank you for this i am always thankful for content creators and their efforts but i really don t like going back to long videos for segments on refreshers so this is sweet thanks
bonus question which of these weapons can drop from legendary engrams ikelos _smg _v1 gnawing hunger falling guillotine judgment of kelgorath chroma rush night watch fioritura brass attacks i m pretty sure ikelos _smg _v1 can for example
what is gs stand for
yeah i agree with most but this one threw me doom is way above vouchsafe across the board

nice catch updating
no worries
fioritura can drop from legendary engram banshee sometimes sells falling guillotine and judgment of kelgorath chroma rush brass attacks gnawing hunger and night watch are most likely in dares loot pool or dont drop at all
gunsmith xur there s a legend in the imgur album and under the google sheet
accessibility matters more people got vouch from engrams these days than the doing the raid i actually have not done the kings fall raid at all but did vow ron
oh ok i m sitting here trying to think of gs what a dumbass lol
i would anticipate a response if any that boils down to a technical limitation to which i say at least make it autoswap and then melee
worst part is when glaives can roll pugilist like lemme unequip my dumbass weapon just to see if it charged my melee yet
that s actually one of the reasons i only enjoy using a glaive on a warlock i don t use my melee much anyway and don t build around it if anything i use a glaive because it s actually a decent alternative melee on a hunter or titan glaives just feel too bothersome because i constantly need to put it away to use my melee that being said i can see a few reasons why we can t use both at the same time could be a technical limitation like using a powered melee while holding a glaive could trigger weird behavior on either one could be a controller limitation two different melee actions two different mappings it s fine on m k but on a controller a lot of people have a hard time figuring out how to map powered and unpowered melees comfortably could be a balance issue maybe they actually don t want us to use both a glaive and our powered melee glaive allow us to deal decent melee damage without any ability or ammo cost after all
definitely agree here not being able to use your melee ability especially if it s a big part of your build feels suppressive
or at the very least make perks like hands on or heavy handed have some sort of interaction with them if i m going to have to be hugging my enemy in order to get any greater use out of a glaive then i better be able to actually get something out of it especially when i have to give up a powerful tool of my subclasses kit to do so as an example arc hunter can basically only access the capabilities of one of the three available aspects when using a glaive and also gives up their melee ability and the ability to proc tempest strike you re basically hard nerfing yourself if you pick the melee weapon while using the melee class the shield is awesome and i love the damage resist it provides but you are basically limited to using these things as weird close ranged projectile weapons in anything not hero content because the second you drop the shield to melee you die instantly vexcalibur is basically the only glaive that actually feels good to use because shocker it has a built in way to get really good damage reduction through the use of subclass verbs winterbite is good and has broad utility because it prevents enemies from attacking you back with the projectile while continuing to cc them with the melee
you guys aren t thinking big enough we don t need access to our conventional hand powered melee we need a glaive specific powered melee imagine shoulder charge with with a glaive that s the medicine we need
we might as well since most glaives aren t even good enough to be anything but polearm blasters
i m surprised they haven t completely taken the glaive melee away since they seem to not want people using it see the synthoceps nerf s kinda by seriously the keybinds are already there just have the sword block keybind use the glaive shield shoot keybind stay the same the aim keybind use the glaive melee then you can use your regular melee keybind for charged uncharged melees they have mentioned the monte carlo bayonet as something they want to add a glaive melee function to but if you can t use your regular melee when it s out then what is the point of it i imagine it s some sort of technical difficulties but that would be so much better imo
it would be way too busted
glaives are fine as is imo they do have their own melee that replaces your normal melee unpowered or not and that s kind of the point it s easier to just swap weapons and use your powered melee but if you re leaning into glaives to begin with you re probably already not using melee abilities much anyway i don t see the point and there are probably technical limitations involved
i ve mastered the loop of switching to first slot powered melee back to energy slot far from ideal yes but i did it
i think it s fine the way it is it s part of the trade off of having the longer lunge and quick hits of the glaive s melee i wish it were a little more powerful that i didn t need to hit guardians but i think it s still fun _  _
wait until op finds out about swords
switch weapons
i am okay with the trade off of not being able to use my charged melee but i gain a shield that blocks almost all damage there should be trade offs otherwise they would be too good to not always have one slotted
then what s the point in using a glaive just use a fusion rifle or shotgun the whole point of the glaive is having the pointy bit at the end to stab enemies with and if you happen to use the shot you get some shield energy if having it override your melee is too much of a sacrifice in your build or playstyle then it seems like it s not for you which is fine
my solution is rebind glaive guard to crouch have secondary fire be glaive melee keep class melee the same
the glaive should just use your charged melee skill if its a thrown weapon or grapple it comes out of the glaives tip make glaives feel like the magical melee beasts they promised to be
it s annoying but only because i forget to change weapons i wouldn t mind some kind of alt fire setting where the glaive becomes gun only to allow for melee
wouldn t surprise me if they didn t want people doing a charged melee then swapping to a glaive to melee again before the enemy can react would be similar to bow hand cannon action
it s weird that we can use it when we have the grasp canon but not with a glaive
the biggest thing that has put me off using glaives is the constant nerfs despite them being average to begin with unless i am using karnsteins on a warlock i will never equip a glaive due to their decimation update after update directly and indirectly
i love glaives and it pains me have gotten used to it but using things like shoulder charge grapple melee are more annoying to manage than others it s normally a premeditated melee ability usage rather than a panic one
as a certified shuriken slut this is why i used the tutorial glaive for ten seconds and then put it away forever
i just want to use the grapple melee with a glaive i like strand and i like glaives but using both together is annoying
technically there s bindings for powered and unpowered melee s so if glaive s melee s were programmed by dev s as unpowered melee s
i wanna use throwing hammer while wielding a glaive so bad
hijacking the thread for clarification aside from winter bite when you still have ammo for it all glaive damage is kinetic and not their element also it would be cool if the glaives could use your melee energy or even your super energy like certain artefact weapons like hive swords to power a unique ability on the glaive it s a shame that a glaive like lubrae s ruin is functionally no different than the enigma for all intents and purposes considering rhulk used it to destroy the blue sun and destroy his homeworld entirely
literally the reason my glaive sits in the vault
yes we have the ability to make our powere melee button seperate from our unpowered why cant the game reapond to these different inputs also a seperate gripe i really hate the glaive melee its default damage source is bound to the melee key maybe on controller it s not an issue but on m k it is a royal pain in the ass
best you can hope for is an exotic or maybe a weapon frame that takes away the shield but adds the glaive melee to that button instead thats how i personally would ve designed glaives
i just wish it charged
i really feel this for ranged melees especially i think it would be cool if we could use glaives as a type of catalyst to our charged melees shout out to dark souls obviously this would be a ton of work and it will never happen but im just picturing an arc titan charging his whatever damage type of glaive with arc damage and then doing a charging sweep with it instead of a shoulder charge or a solar warlock lighting their glaive on fire to shoot out their celestial fire from it obviously we will never see something like this but it would be a cool way to circumvent the lack of melee abilities while using glaives with swords it never bothered me but with glaives it feels bad to not be able to use your charged melee
idk i feel like it would be a lot more interesting to give your glaive the ability to use your charged melee to do something unique
bungie hates the glaive melee apparently so don t expect it to happen
glaive melee synergy is just aggravating i was using vexcalibur last night on sentinel and realized you can t generate orbs off of melee kills and that really just kills the flow of using glaives and my subclass for me glaives need to be able to proc melee abilities if you are using one that corresponds to your subclass at the very least
big reason i don t use glaives on my hunter i need my throwing knives to function
i feel like glaives just need to deal more damage with their projectile and had larger base magazine sizes in order to make up for the shortcomings
we should be able to charged melee can be bound to a different key but i m assuming it has to do with animation
alternatively i would like to see glaives get their own powered melee based on archtype and all the stuff that doesn t work with glaive melee would work with the powered one
another reason why glaives will always remain niche
if only there was way to bind separate melee actions one day
bungie note to self stop making melee weapons
having a charged melee should just give a damage buff to melee weapons swords glaives i mean the stat is called strength
just out of curiosity can you use your charged melee with a sword because i can see the idea behind blade on a stick is melee
say it louder for the peeps in the back
i have a glaive with close to melee perk paired with wormgod caress destroys in pve been having fun in pvp too but not ranked
my biggest issue since the introduction of void for hunters is that you actually can use their melee with the dive but the glaive replaces the melee on your hud so i m not always aware of when i can use my smoke bomb dive b c i have useless hud information telling me the glaive melee is there
i have a feeling you re right on the technical limitation bit i d imagine they used similar design concepts to their sword implementation but they ve overcome those many times in the past before so here s hoping
an auto swap setting would be the best also it does work if you swap off the split second before hitting the melee button but its a tight window
can t you throw nades etc mid swap anyways so it could literally just do that swap play animation then swap back
auto swap is quite slow though if you manually switch weapons and then try to use your melee it takes a second or two this would make aiming with any kind of charged melee that throws something i e a ton of them extremely difficult
it does not we have separate binds already just let the bind work the animations are unrelated
to me this is the biggest screw up i understand the technical limitations of having a weapon with an overwriting melee i even understand the lore practical reason that this would be the way it works it s a little clunky from a user gameplay perspective which is what this whole post is about but the fact that they can roll pugilist is such a wtf for me
does pugilist not proc with glaive melee
agreed on your guess for the first two points balance wise i d be surprised if this was an intentional decision considering how lackluster glaives feel compared to other special options in the current sandbox in my opinion i d be really interested to hear bungie s reasoning on the way it currently is
i m a hunter glaive user and having the shatterdive for all three sub classes work while holding a glaive is super nice the only one i really use a lot i have to switch for is strands needle as that s a great pvp clean up
and now that we have a melee that s worth a damn with brooderavee and i ve been making some melee focused builds i want them to fix glaives to allow the use of powered melees asap lol
it s really simple even for controllers when a glaive is equipped uncharged melee becomes glaive swing we already have the ability to map charged uncharged auto to different buttons
i ve got a decent solution for anyone having trouble figuring out how to set up separate melee buttons rb r1 charged melee right stick press r3 uncharged melee double stick press l3 r3 finisher both melees are easy to find and pretty intuitive to hit in combat and finishers feel a little more impactful
i m totally okay with glaive on my void hunter but that s because i roll with the dive i d rather not throw the smoke bomb
this is the same wavelength i was thinking on particularly regarding the controller mapping
i run an arc glaive warlock build that s a ton of fun very speedy and aggressive but would be an absolute blast if i could actually tempest strike into groups
my only defense for using the glaives on hunter is that you can still use your dive abilities which are some of your best
problem is with strand grapple it s becoming really awkward
i like this post boils down to warlock melee is so useless that you don t feel the loss of it when using a glaive but really though warlock has a decent melee on solar
except on console controller this doesnt work lt is shield ads and sword block lb is grenade rb is melee rt is shoot aim melee and shield are now the same button i dont always want to melee while blocking
you don t see the point in a hunter being able to whip throwing knives while using a glaive or throwing smoke bombs to turn invisible or all the synergy that arcstrider would gain the only class that wouldn t benefit all too much is warlock there is definitely some big drawbacks to titan s and hunter s losing their powered melee though especially when it s stronger than their grenades in many cases
people hated him eventhough he spoke the truth
there is literally no downside to letting us use our melee ability with a glaive in hand why are you against a change that is only beneficial to you lmao
at least swords have a heavy attack option that uses that energy glaives have nothing akin to that other than a full ability icon to stare at lol
swords use heavy glaives are specials with a 1st person view stfu
dude literally says in the post that he is well aware that he can swap weapons but it feels clunky and awkward thank you for not reading the post and contributing nothing
would being able to use your charged melee in addition to all current function of the glaive make your gameplay experience worse if yes how so if not then why are you against it
agreed the idea of imbuing the glaive with the element of your melee sounds like an awesome alternative idea while custom animations for each might be too big an ask it would be super neat to spend your melee energy to have the glaive blade surrounded in that energy type for a limited time making melee attacks do that damage type and synergize with mods like surge orb generation instead of just kinetic damage
or a damage buff dependent of the player s strength stat any reason to build into strength would be great
you can t use a charged melee using swords that im aware of there s light attack like glaives and heavy attacks which would be the firing function on glaives and blocking of course which is the same on both glaive and sword though mnk probably differs tell your friends to run a good secondary weapon and switch to it to use your charged attack
shot yes melee no https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ft-bl6ua6ntnen7_btqwlfjapytaeifvlhpkvwhtajc/htmlview#
it procs but because you can t use melee abilities with a glaive equipped it s super inconvenient as a perk you have to totally break up the gameplay loop to switch off of your glaive use ability swap back get melee energy switch off etc it s just really clunky and frustrating cuz swapping off of your glaive and back while surrounded by enemies which you usually are while using one isn t really a good idea also if your glaive has another perk that gets removed on stow you gimp yourself there too every time you swap
glaives feel lackluster but like i said the melee has no cost and deals more damage than a regular unpowered melee while still being able to shoot and provides a shield which i consider to be the most underrated part of glaives it really helps a ton in some encounters if you build around it properly e g on a build with high resilience and or hp regen glaive allows you to play quite aggressively and the ammo economy is decent enough to allow you to run double special weapons
to be fair glaives were pretty damn good even without the ability to use your powered melee so that actually could have been a design decision back then bungie has just been nerfing them since they added the exotic compatibility for them
my point was that while we can map powered and unpowered melees to different buttons it s an accessibility feature not the default so it would be pretty weird if bungie made a weapon forcing you to use separate mappings especially on controllers on which a lot of people dislike being forced to remap some actions muscle memory and all that most games only have a single melee button
this is what i currently do i don t run glaives often but would prefer the r1 melee when spamming glaive melee instead of r3 but for all gameplay outside of glaive spam i prefer these binds
i have kind of a similar setup but without using the stick buttons as i tend to mash them when i don t want to i left auto melee on r1 right bumper and bound charged melee to l2 r1 left trigger right bumper so overall it s the same as default button mapping i can still just use r1 like i always have in the past but when i specifically want charged melee it s left trigger melee kind of like super but with the trigger instead i also set finisher to double click right stick to avoid the accidental finisher
i did this except i kept finishers and melees on same button at 1st then changed finishers to same button as sprint l3 sometimes i ll go to sprint away from enemies and i ll get pulled into a finisher mistakenly but otherwise it s been working well
a good finisher alternative is double click l2 lt double tap aim down sights to finish works fast and easy and occasionally like magic
i m positive consoles can change keybinds now so that really isn t an issue give players the option to do it and if certain players can t be bothered to change their keybinds for it then that s fine but don t take the option away from players who would want to use the feature i plugged in my ps5 controller to check it out and it would work fine they would just have to change the light attack or heavy attack on glaives to be the glaive melee and the fire to be the opposite i set light attack to r1 heavy attack to r2 charged and uncharged melee to r3 l1 is grenade l2 is block if i played on controller and the glaive melee was separate from the charged uncharged melee then that s absolutely what i would do like i said if players don t want to take advantage of the feature then they don t have to but give players the option if they want it it s the same thing with auto melee being an option i m not using it but other players can if they want
arc hunter is probably a good example for why it shouldnt work with charged melee imagine combination blow damage but then with glaive attack speed in addition to all the other stuff cb does
it s true insert cringe clickbait article headline here
possible technical limitations also tradeoffs
you can shoot with a glaive that seems pretty akin to me
i don t see how any of that is relevant
i will respond but am about to watch a movie then dinner
glaives offer a free melee option with shield option and ranged shot to charge it it s three in one weapon with maybe the downside of not having your melee ability available when wielding it being able to use your melee while wielding the glaive removes the one downside you get in order to use it also when people run glaive in crucible while they have it the expectation is they don t have access to their melee it would be quite the combo for titans to have some kind of shoulder charge then turn on shield so yes i m sure someone would figure out a way to ruin my gameplay experience due to a change like that
yes exactly this
the block node takes up the space of where the charged melee usually is
but at least swords have a light and heavy attack glaives just have the and it doesn t even add an element which would be fun and probably op
if you bind regular melee to a different button than charged melee then charged melee still does a light attack on sword and literally nothing on glaive at least on controller you have to press uncharged melee with glaives
oh i see thank you for the explanation
a glaive with karnstein armlets is so good when the mobs aren t incredibly tanky i do the data nullifier section of avalon entirely with just that combo
i honestly forget it s even in the game
void grenades in general need a pass i m pretty sure of players on a void subclass use the vortex nade considering there are so many options why not buff some of the others to shift up the void grenade meta in both pvp and pve that being said compensation buffs for hhs since they were previously directed at its hit capacity make sense and should be done
i just started using it today for a little mixup to my normal build and boy does it chunk things and just absolutely wipe adds but fuck me sideways does the canceled charge bug me i honestly thought my controller was broken for a minute before i saw this post
literally nobody has used it since the original nerf and since hunter knives can one shot and also have ridiculous tracking i see no reason why it still has to be outright castrated
i wish i know it was strong in forsaken launch but honestly with how strong so many other abilities are in the game right now hhsn could be buffed and it would be fine can t believe i kill myself more than the enemy with this thing such a shit ability
they could honestly bring it back to its pre nerf state besides the shot in pvp and it wouldn t even be overpowered given our current pvp sandbox
it should become a melee
it should be a melee
i ve been using it recently it almost one shots the ogres in master oryx all it needs is the charge and hold time buffed
nah warlocks don t need everything they have to be op
would be nice if they decrease the time it needs to charge the hhsn
absolutely agree not only handheld but many other warlock ablities and exotics should have there nerds rolled back there is just so many things made less viable or even just useless
because its locked behind magnetic grenades now
so did i until yesterday decided to try it out on a whim and was having great fun with it in battlegrounds despite the awkwardness and then it became painful in master lost sectors the drawbacks just get in the way of actually using it properly which is a shame because it s a fun piece to add to the arsenal otherwise unfortunately it s hard to justify over vortexes in it s current state
i use spikes in pvp people really don t understand how deadly those things are
of the grenades still need a pass most players just use vortex on void fusion on solar and storm on arc most grenades are just to way to specific in their use cases
bungie made a whole deal about removing ohko abilities then in the same update gave hunters a second one now here we are well over a year later and they ve pretty clearly abandoned that philosophy but refuse to revert the nerfs made to shoulder charge hhsn
that would be sick
we literally have well starfire and that s it even then starfire is getting massacred next season so the class will be back to being the wellbot
sad as magnetic grenades are my favourite uncharged grenade handheld is nice but i wish magnetic had a different charged variant
there s nothing as satisfying as perfectly placing a spike grenade and just melting some poor unsuspecting fool
i mean warlocks are already in wellbot even with current starfire nothing is gonna change other than losing the dps from fusion nades and ignites
would be cool if charged magnetic grenades did the lorenz driver headshot thing
would be cool if charged magnetic grenades did the lorenz driver headshot thing
especially with weaken grenades on a tick is wild
i know at least being the wellbot now i get to do decent damage with my abilities and sort of have fun trying to nail the damage rotation the rumoured nerfs to starfire are going to make it not worth running my point was that we go back to being the wellbot in the sense that it s well and then nothing instead of the well with damage we get to do now
like a vacuuming effect that draws them all in like a vortex or something
i just straight up refuse to run well when i play warlock now oh you want me to play the boring subclass so i can use the boring super with the grandma apron to do slightly more damage nah fuck you im running nova bomb
exactly standard sticks to a target charged could pull others targets closer just one big pull to differentiate between vortex grenade s constant pull
that s gonna be me after the changes go live next season specifically out of spite for the people who complained non stop about it s too op while i m spending my entire subclass and super on making sure they do additional damage and can t die during a dps phase i ve seriously never seen this community get so up it s own ass about something that benefits every single person playing the game they got what they wanted it s getting nerfed and i m going to enjoy watching people die during dps phases because i won t run well

i am not sure the definition of aiat is etymologically related to fiat aiat is latin for to say https://www.wordsense.eu/aiat/ since it is a conjugation of aio it s hard to find a specific entry for that tense fiat while also latin is a completely separate word to command https://www.wordsense.eu/fiat/ though i can see where some confusion might exist because aiat as used by the hive kinda defined like to say into being in the end aiat is a real word and not a conjunction between two words

bruh i m too high for this wtf
last question i dont care about solo flawless at this point but if i went to orbit and come back does that wipe my solo run does it have to be in play through yes it has to be in one sitting no going to orbit
it s tedious for sure for akelous i ran witherhoard a trace rifle i think it was hollow denial and cataclysmic double special helps you never run out of heavy ammo and the trace rifle helps you pop eyes quickly just make sure you have enough special ammo before dps starts kill adds with your heavy out it will take a lot of phases x200b final boss you are running starfire so well fusion grenades demo rocket for the win ran it on hunter so can t really comment too much on starfire builds but there s plenty of advice out on this sub
took like phases
for the first boss i used osteo for the eyes if you let the poison kill a group of goblins right before damage you can overload the mag with in the clip this let s you kill all the eyes without having to reload that s leaves more time for damage a good trace rifle is also a good option double specials will help with heavy ammo too linears are still good even though they got nerfed but if you can do fusion grenade spam with a demo rocket that s probably better
for the second boss i wouldn t say it necessarily miserable it s just long as long as you are comfortable with your movement and getting to all the nodes you should be fine i would recommend use an smg really good for popping boss eyes and wave frame gl the speed of popping eyes determines how long your dps window is complete nodes leaving the 4th where you killed the minotaur for the buff don t kill the other minotaur if you have to kill the next set and then kill the 1st of the next set where you want to do dps from before finishing 4th node kill any harpies near you kill some gobos below you to generate an orb or to get your surge buff profit equip a shotgun glaive in place of smg and kill gobos until you get full heavy the final boss can be miserable if you aren t prepared i would recommend for the final boss equip an orb generating build and have one or two of the boot mods for a burst of health regen on orb pickup have a weapon surge or two on boots that match your heavy weapon element wave frame gl and either trace rifle or smg if using smg have trace glaive for heavy ammo farming after dps phase use a rocket for dps it s not the highest possible but its braindead allowing you to focus on not dying don t be afraid to run like a bitch and hide everywhere
i did it last season when we had mods like solo operator and linears weren t nerfed also on a titan with loreley for survivability witherhoard and a cataclysmic for akelous same thing with persys even though crits were hard to hit
here s what i did when i did this last season for akelous i switched to voidwalker devour old gods with riptide ticcu s trinity ghoul and taipan i practiced with both bows don t remember which one i actually used in my solo flawless clear i used secant filaments and empowering rift damage phases aren t the problem yes you ll need of them the problem is the time between damage phases this is where i found ticcu s or even trinity ghoul to be exceptional you want to get through the wire connecting as fast as possible and with spawning harpies i just couldn t do it fast enough with the old meta of witherhoard calus bows cuts this time down dramatically and riptide is amazing at breaking eyes if you flick your aim right as you shoot you can easily get two eyes with one burst starfire is largely useless for akelous so if you re deadset on well go with transversives for the sprinting reload or lunafactions if you re going to sit in the well the whole time before you connect your final wire throw a grenade on the goblins under it and have firepower time dilation and at least 2x of the surge you have for your dps weapon alternatively if you have the new trace rifle this season acasia s dejection it can roll reconstruction envious assassin or rewind rounds
i did this on a mix of loreley and synthoceps hammer titan for the first boss i used vorpal dmt this one shots the eyes and is very good at dealing with the harpies which are the only dangerous thing in that encounter and you should try to keep on top of them as they will flinch you off the boss on pc it s really easy to shoot the eyes quickly with an smg or trace but on controller it s much harder to do that effectively dmt has enough ammo to kill every eye without reloading and it s fast i used a blinding gl for weakened clear at the time but this is obviously not a thing any more so that does free you up to run something else here bait and switch cataclysmic for heavy make sure to proc radiant before damage by chucking a hammer it must hit the eye in terms of time it will take ages i think it took me or phases but it s very safe and you basically can t die to anything as long as you stay on top of the harpy spawns for the last boss it takes more damage from supers i ran witherhoard calus mini tool and some rocket i think ideally you should leave the goblins in the middle alive so you can get roaring flames x3 before dps and your hammers will actually do a lot of damage i was able to very comfortably phase the boss and likely could have phased with a better loadout but obviously again i had weakened clear the only things that can kill you on this fight are the supplicants basically never ever stop moving and you should be fine it is possible for the boss to kill you but you need to screw up your positioning quite badly just never be near the boss one tip for the start of the fight is to run into the back room the boss will lock himself in the front section so you can safely kill the hydras from the back room do this at the start of each new phase in terms of solo flawless or otherwise it has to be in one session can t go to orbit this dungeon is one of the easier ones to solo flawless if you are patient it took me hour to do my flawless run
linears are still meta for akelous when i did my solo flawless run i used starfire and cataclysmic with witherhoard and got a comfortable phase but solo operative is gone total amplifier damage breach and clear is gone debuff damage linears are nerfed linear damage font is nerfed solar weapon amplifier damage all these combined is probably gonna push you into the phase area here s exactly what i did each phase well of radiance for damage buff witherhoard for debuff shoot eyes with smg or trace once eyes are broken use witherhoard again to set up for bait and switch and to reproc weaken snap for free ignition then throw both grenades for another ignition switch to smg and get bullet off then switch to your linear shoot your linear bait and switch should proc in the well until you run out of ammo in the mag with 4ttc and in the mag it should be shots get back shots get back for a total of cataclysmic shots dps phase might still be going but just hide under the railings to avoid retaliation it s just safer that way and the extra bit of dps isn t worth it
i did my solo flawless when we had solo operative and weaken clear back in seraph which really helped but isn t necessary if you have hollow denial from season of the haunted that s my favorite gun for hitting nodes and doing eyes infinite range so you can ping the nodes from nearly all the way across the map and the eyes go down in one magazine if you hit your shots i ran that with witherhoard on solar titan double special gave so many heavy drops hollow denial also gets lead from gold to give extra ammo on heavy pickup i used cataclysmic for the harpy boss and hothead my hammer super for the wyvern both bosses took like phases consistently is really important on starfire warlock the final boss should go faster for you since your damage inside well counts as super
alright i ll say it because i haven t heard others say it leviathan s breath for first boss is decent damage comfortable phase with players using it in well so you should be fine as long as you ve got ammo and the catalyst 2nd boss rocket with demo and fusion grenades witherhoard is your friend there i would suggest a void legendary energy weapon for the bricks from beyond artifact mod i figure it s around drop rate for heavy from yellow bars using a void weapon as for your last question i think you already know the answer you ve gotta do it all in one go
did it once and won t bother again what a slog they made me hate it
first boss took me a long time like dps phases though i was kinda trolling myself i ran we ll lock didn t get much if any use out of starfire except maybe to hail mary multiple fusions at harpies and minotaurs i ran conditional finality should ve been witherhoard the solar trace from root and fttc b s cataclysmic special finisher and double solar surge i would also move my fragments around to get firesprites and use that to fuel my ammo economy i would get all of the node paths to the last node and activate at once after that i d trim all the harpies and start dps i would get maybe and a half mags deep into cataclysmic before dps would end it s an endurance test not a sprint same with persys though persys is much much more scary with those supplicants running around all i really did for him was run an alh rocket my solar trace again and witherhoard with special finisher not as many opportunities to get finishers and firesprites with all the supplicants i had to go through though you got this
akelous first boss done in easy phases but it could have been if i hadn t screwed up during 4th dps due to poor ammo management this was during the season of the seraph when we had access to the artifact mods for more damage when solo and applying debuff with witherhoard it should take you now around dps phases with this strat for akelous i used witherhoard the void trace rifle from the season of the haunted but any trace rifle will do and cataclysmic i also used transversives steps when you complete all of the cables and are getting ready to shoot the eyes and dps use the trace rifle to shoot the eyes it takes a fraction of a second to break them so your dps time is only restricted by how fast you can switch between eyes that s why i recommend soloing it on pc if possible when you break the eyes witherhoard and start on cataclysmic breaking the eyes should count for tagging the boss with the trace rifle i also recommend not staying put but actually going after the boss so it is easier to hit the crit spot that s when transversives steps come into play when you have to reload just run towards the boss not only will it reload the cataclysmic but you will also get closer to the boss so you can more accurately use witherhoard and hit crits important akelous notes do not neglect the fact that you are in a thin and airborne boss arena starting to fall on warlock is almost a guaranteed wipe use icarus dash also use radiant at the start of the dps phase and well at the end this should maximize dps and keep you alive after the explosion when you run out of special ammo switch the trace rifle for a primary and get lots of green to drop before switching back in my experience having empty secondaries drops no ammo but having a primary and empty secondary drops a ton the other one final boss done in phases if i hadn t screwed up with poor well of radiance management just like before this strat had access to the artifact mods but using the right surge build you can make sure you have a weapon buff during the complete dps phase i used witherhoard ikelos smg and roar of the boar or whatever the ib rocket launcher is called with impact cassing demo and lasting impression also star fire protocol fusion grenades and the grenade artifact at dps put down well at soon as the explosion inside the boss room happens if well isn t changed don t start dps tag the boss with witherhoard than rl grenade rl grenade witherhoard grenade rl grenade witherhoard grenade and so on there are probablymore optimal dps starts with sfp but this worked for me just fine the dps phase should end when the well has seconds left this is especially important if using lasting impression because depending on when you shoot the last rocket you might waste a rocket the most important thing here is spacial awareness you must know where the boss and exploding harpies are at all times notes for last boss after dps run for the other room through the side doors there may be some enemies there but they don t respawn there yet it gives you some safe time to breathe and catch your bearings
did it last season so i took advantage of solo operative dmg increase and weakened clear debuff on gl and pre nerf linear fusion rifles so take this with a pinch of salt i went with a starfire warlock and used whitherhoard calus mini tool ad clear eyes cataclysmic 4ttc focused fury for the first boss deliverance demo chill clip calus mini tool anarchy for dot fusion grenade spam for the final boss i think calus or at least a fast smg is the best option for the eyes of the first boss linear are still good too for this encounter given that you need crits and range for this boss try to use surge mods on your leg armor too if you can
osteo is great for the eyes just plan it out to kill the group of vex that spawns underneath the final node with poison and you should have about rounds in the mag for the eyes it also will work well for taking care of the harpies that are a bit far away
the first boss is the worst it feels like i melt everything and then that first boss is like shooting a titanium wall with a squirt gun
here is a clip showing off how whisper of the worm does solo very solid imo it also showcases a solid method for breaking eyes with ease first part is without any buffs second part is just the catalyst third includes radiant he s on a bonk titan so you would have to figure out your own plan for how to utilize it but it looks like with whisper catalyst radiant landing all your shots it would kill him in 4ish phases you could probably reduce that further with other buffs or supers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf426-wnsau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf426-wnsau)
first boss it s a precision damage boss so hot head it s no bueno but it ll be a slog best option would be cataclysmic with 4th bait but other liners will work like taipan with triple tap focus fury
not looking forward to this spire is tedious in a group never mind alone supplicants listening to osiris stupid amounts of boss health i will do this once for guardian rank and that s it i used to want to solo dungeons and i did sf grasp and was going to do the others but it s not an impressive achievement anymore that s off the progression path and just a skill flex now it s a checklist item
i did akelous in phases with the immortal smg acascias denial trace rifle and leviathans breath with the catalyst did it on a hunter with gathering storm persys can be phased as well but i ve only done it on hunter persys takes increased damage from supers so i use strand hunter with star eater then grand overture volley gets of his health down consistently enough
in order if by miserable you mean long yes it s going to take a ton of phases way more than in previous seasons for various reasons for example i could easily phase akelous solo last season but it takes me like or this season my secret sauce for the akelous encounter is dead man s tale i know you re making the o_o face everybody does it s cool i get it d dmt will tap eyes though and they proc cranial spikes so you can pop eyes almost as fast as you can click the fire button nothing else comes close plus as an exotic primary it drops way more heavy ammo than non exotic primaries it also feels like more than double special loadouts to me but i m not sure i usually do solo runs on hunter but on a starfire warlock i d probably bring a demo explosive light hothead plus your choice of special with alh and a damage perk but it sounds like you know that already this boss has soooooo many hp though i don t think any loadout is going to get you to a non tedious number of phases sadly i don t have any tricks for the final boss it s just a really really long encounter solo yeah it has to be all in the same run sorry
i did it on solar titan but starfire warlock would have probably been better on first boss i used arbalest and cataclysmic for for damage on final i used gjally and my super two tailed should probably be the better choice after its buff but anyway try to get really consistent for me it took phases on the first and phases on final boss
eyes die pretty fast with trace rifle just need to stop and quickly move to next eye so you don t have to reload was also using wavesplitter at the time so one mag is enough for all eyes x200b after that enjoy suffering with akelous was using super taipan and it took at least phases it s a terrible boss since you can t use much else though i hear leviathans breath is pretty decent now persys thankfully is not like akelous can use whatever load out and weapons you like usually takes around phases casually
i stuck with the basics for my run soloed with a hunter void gryphalcon s build garden boss i ran witherhoard funnelweb cataclysmic smashing a tether and vortex grenade for bonus damage the big problem with that boss is how much of it is immune during damage my tethers more often than not did no damage not sure if starfire nades will even hit final boss rockets were my lifeline hothead with autoloading and explosive light for sure although since starfire will definitely work on this boss i d recommend demo for you witherhoard as well for the tick damage helps with the hydras as well you can hide out in the back room where the reactor is during the first half of a boss phase to clear out the hydras and supplicants it will still take several phases took me about
i had a good time with star eater silkstrike whilst it was bugged otherwise safe solo flawless takes a while with the usual meta weapons
i did wither calus cataclysmic you can use any linear for first boss linear still feel best to me on first boss you aren t going to be doing a bunch of star fire spam there so just focus on doing high damage and playing safe if you need to do eyes faster use a fusion or a trace rifle use surges make sure you have armor charge before starting the dps phase and kill all the harpies before you do as well to reduce the amount of flinch you get last boss just use star fire and a demo rocket star fire is the way to go for dps there you will comfortably phase the boss
i did it this season on all characters and can second the recommendation to use witherhoard hollow denial and cataclysmic on akelous keep the calus mini tool in your inventory in case you run out of special ammo witherhoard demo rocket on persys tbh it s a bit painful without the mods people had last season on top of elemental surge mods being weaker than font of might and a big nerf to lfr damage it ll hurt when you watch runs from last season and see how much harder their bait and switch cataclysmic hits compared to yours expect akelous to take a lot longer this season lfr is probably still the best option though you could also try leviathan s breath https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ahfpeiobg). i used that when i did the solo flawless on titan while i used wither cataclysmic as a warlock i think the titan actually had fewer dps phases although that may be due to better execution worth a look at least persys should still be about as fast as it was last season starfire warlock absolutely crushes this fight i think it was or dps phases for my starfire warlock while my cuirass titan needed i think
i solo d both duality and spire last season with an arc titan cuirass grand oberture font of might charged with light weakened clear build absolute monstruosity for dps at the time and still needed damage phases por akelous that guy is tedious as hell persys was only phases though you should be safe with starclass for persys but for akelous some precisiom damage build would be optimal
i did this last season with starfire witherhoard hollow denial and taipan i think i crafted my hollow denial to have surplus and unrelenting cuz surviving was an issue for me the double special was great because i learned how to abuse the ammo drops in my favor i kept starfire on the entire time cuz grenades were my lifeline i would use them to clear groups and get heals i was by no means optimal just persistent the trace rifle was fantastic for taking out eyes and ad control for final boss damage i used a demolitionist rocket witherhoard and grenades took me somewhere between phases i can t remember exactly it was my first time soloing a dungeon and it really tested my endurance i did it over the course of days
if you have it tarrabah is excellent for eyes just pop ravenous beast right as it s starting
for first boss i was able to phase with bas cata and a lunafaction well running a trace rifle is recommended so you can break eyes as fast as possible and have more time to damage for final boss i would definitely be on warlock since you will deal double damage inside of your well witherhoard starfire demo rocket allowed me to phase final boss once you learn where all of the nodes are in both encounters it goes much smoother with each run
for the first boss the struggle is mostly watching purple brick after purple brick go flying off the map even post lfr nerf i d still tell you to use a triple tap lfr just for the ammo refund while i haven t tested it yet this season what i used for eyes was long arm as solo operative and boss spec allowed it to one shot them this might still be possible without so as you should get some extra damage from being above power for the dungeon failing that arc surge mods should be able to make up the difference emphasis on boss spec though this tripped up many when they tried using it for eyes last season when they tried this if you re willing to commit your exotic slot to this a vorpal dmt or forerunner should also work as for the final boss hectic as that encounter is solo it s worth taking the time to farm a super before every damage phase one of the things that makes wyverns frustrating is their damage reduction and the boss unfortunately inherits this trait super damage such as a well of radiance bypasses this damage reduction another one of your struggles in the final encounter will be add clear specifically the swarms of exploding harpies everyone has their own suggestions for those devils but for me what finally worked was a wave frame gl in my case i ended up doing my solo flawless on solar titan it was perhaps the least optimal in terms of boss damage lacking a one and done super to combo with guns but the main issue i was having was staying alive while doing nodes and it gave me access to frequent healing and the safety net that is lorelei i somewhat got around the gun issue by using grand overture and opening up each damage phase with a fully charged missile salvo before popping hammers also something to consider is that the final boss can be staggered the primary ways to do this i m aware of are stasis freeze shatters and leviathan s breath hunter s super and ager s scepter in overcharge mode should provide sources of constant freeze shatters and a pair of stasis turrets should do something similar at a slower rate these options aren t the best damage wise but if you want safer damage phases they ll make it hard for the boss to shoot back
i switched to lunafaction before dps and used mids for the eyes not sure what the recommended loadout is this season but witherhord linear for the first boss and witherhord demo rockets was what i did
i used retraced path for the eyes and a linear cataclysmic for damage i would suggest double special with witherhoard and a legendary trace rifle would suggest retraced path or the new ron trace rifle and a linear for damage i tried a couple of other damage options xenophage grand overture rockets etc but a linear lead to the most consistent damage phase i wonder how good thunderlord would be on this boss it absolutely cooks the last boss
i did my first clear of the dungeon over the weekend it was also solo and overall i d say only the last boss is a pain in the ass but that s because of needing to use supers to do good damage use a shotgun for the harpy boss eyes shot eye i used an auto loading raghnild d shotgun farm armor charges before dps phase the rhythm of the nodes makes it a quick cycle to get back to dps phase and drop down into the holes to avoid the arc shockwave seconds from when the eyes activate i read i used thunderlord for it to keep it quick and simple as consistency is key pop eyes weaken grenade dip into bubble and then dps was what i did for the last boss memorize all the node locations i used bonk build just to oneshot the minotaurs so i could just run between the rooms and farm them for super energy as i was getting the nodes primed way before my super was up hammer of sol with synthoceps and leaving goblins in the first room alive also watch out for supplicants and keep moving i wiped on the boss at health left twice due to supplicants before clearing
i used welllock sleeper for first boss and then demo rocket star fire for final boss first boss was very tedious took me or damage phases final boss took three
for the eyes boss i ran revision zero smg funnel web ikelos mida tool linear fusion rifle smg works fine to destroy eyes linear fusion rifle revision zero procced precision shots for boss dps kill all the harpies with revision zero precision to get your shots finish the arc nodes drop well kill eyes with smg then dps boss with lf revision zero
honestly it depends akelos was just tedious for that i d stack everything you have into a good linear last season i ran a witherhoard ikelos smg and fire and forget on arc liars handshake hunter did around phases if you have cataclysmic with b s and fttc use that with witherhoard and honestly a trace rifle for chicken man a good rocket and starfire will trivialize it you got this
solar titan witherhoard cataclysmic for both
took me about or phases each last season uploaded a full video here https://youtu.be/yq87uiixork my honest advice is don t worry too much about damage worry more about surviving the round survivability is way more important than damage because damage phases that you survive will still be faster than damage phases where you keep dying once you have survivability you can start speccing into damage a bit more but if you keep dying lean back into survivability
for my solo flawless run i was more concerned about survivability than my damage especially in the last room where supplicants can finish your run pretty quickly thus i opted for solar loreley titan also has the ability to practically ignore the harpies in the first boss as for weapons witherhoard and calus mini tool were my main weapons for the run though a trace rifle is a decent option too catalysmic for first boss hothead for second boss definitely took a while which is why i also played music to help me concentrate during my run three main tips do not finish the four circuits in the very first part of the dungeon until you connected all remaining nodes will prevent supplicants from spawning don t try to squeeze more damage from the first boss if it means that your probability of death is high better play it safe and drop down earlier than to be blasted and get killed in the part where you have to kill the hydras in the third encounter go to the second part of the room as there are no ads that spawn during that period
do solo shattered throne it s a breeze compared to anything else
im running starfire res dis recov i was using wavesplitter hot head but i pretty much have every option available should i do whither calus and a linear why aren t you using witherhord with starfire the damage over time constantly refunds your grenade energy i think my biggest struggle thus far is loadout for the 1st boss i am having trouble shooting the eyes fast enough to do any kind of damage i know it ll be phases if i am lucky smg is ideal for this use a reload mod if you need i did it last season and for the harpy boss i was also starfire and ran a witherhord calus mini tool and a cataclysmic took phases depending how well i did for the final boss i used a blowout with demo and wither calus mini tool again this too took phases
witherhoard funnelweb cataclysmic starfire and bricks from beyond should do it
use grand overture for the final boss and thank me later i m shocked no one mentioned this it makes it a possible phase or a very comfortable phase as long as you make sure to load 20x missiles before you start dps and this is easy because you need to shoot hydras and minatours anyway
for testing recommend this guy whole set of dps videos best choice for solo damage is whisper with catalyst but channel will give other options if you want https://youtube.com/@blodler
i did it on a titan with lorely first boss use witherhoard a trace and a linear with heavy ammo finder you ll never run out for the final one use rockets and hope for the best both bosses are a slog but just play safe and get it done
lots of comments already stating what i would say but one thing i didn t see in my quick glance i used healing grenade in the final boss area and then swapped to fusions before damage phase while waiting to shoot the nodes to close the door never had a time issue on xbox and this was before loadouts which should make it faster now
forerunner one shots the eyes you can just setup a loadout to swap quickly
i didn t phase the harpy boss i swear
first boss forerunner oneshots eyes good damage as well i used bait and switch cataclysmic for my main damage i recommend listening to a song with a consistent rythem it helped me stay alive throughout both boss fights
guardian rank got dayyum i have dreams of this it feels so far away though
does anyone know if this step will be retroactive i solo flawlessed the dungeon last season and would rather not have to solo it again
so i did it last season when we had access to the two valuable mods solo operative and breach launcher since then the viable loadouts have shifted quite a bit while linears used to be the go for akelous i would more likely recommend using a hmg and a trace rifle don t use starfires nova bomb or needlestorm akelous moves too fast for starfire to be effective and both nova bomb and needlestorm cause it to go off path in detrimental way personally i would use a devourlock build for akelous i would even consider the the exotic hmg with the weaken bullets when it comes to persys it s pretty much the same as last season best dps is just rockets if you re comfortable running star eaters and not dying i can t really say anything against it on this fight just run witherhorde and be patient otherwise i would also recommend devourlock and twin tailed fox if you have the catalyst fed persys should go down faster than akelous expect akelous to take damage rounds with the current meta maybe for persys
this season will be a pain due to the artifact mods solo operative and weakened clear missing for sure
i did this last season with weakened clear and the solo damage boost mod so i m not sure my build still works for the eyeball boss i ran karnstein armlets witherhoard and a trace rifle for the eyes i punch a weak enemy to death for a massive health boost i switch to my heavy weapon and also punch something to death if i m running low on special ammo heavy is your call i used a linear fusion i m not sure if there s a better option now i ran solar for this encounter in case i needed a well to save to me for the final boss i actually ran arc i used ikelos smg wither hoard and hot head for heavy i made sure to use the spark of restiance aspect a melee damage resistance and a void resistance mod between that and an arc soul from my rift i was able to keep most harpies off of me and i also survived much better if one did explode near me it took me about rounds to beat him but i felt the survivability made it much easier the armor exotic is up to you i used fallen sun star for ability up time i think getaway artist or geomagnetic stabilizers are good options too good luck and stay patient once you learn where to connect all the nodes in the final boss room you ll be able to stay in motion pretty easily and survive way better i hope this helps
i did a lot of phases like a lot full run took me like 1h30 i used a fusion rifle to pop his eyes and then ran b s cataclysmic on a hunter switched to orpheus rigs for each super to get shots off and then back to graviton i think it took me like damage phases last boss was similar but i used rockets edit trace rifles are op for breaking eyes
for akelous you wanna run something that lets you clear eyes fast for longer dps i used forerunner one shots eyes and you can do it in one mag if you don t miss for persys well should be good you re probably looking at a phase
it wasn t too bad as solo solar hunter about damage phases per boss used cataclysmic with b s and a witherhoard if you re using starfire then you should be alg for the first boss use a high rpm primary to kill the eyes
harpy boss i used riptide auto loading chill clip for the eyes i could destroy them way faster compared to using a trace rifle or submachine gun so i highly recommend giving that a go because it gave me way more time for damage using taipan triple tap frenzy then path of least resistance subsistence one for all for the nodes and ads
i did it on my warlock solo flawless for first boss i wouldn t worry about starfire he moves away pretty quick and taking the time to try and line up a perfect fusion just isn t worth it lunafactions are what i used even after the nerfs linears are still the best bet for the 1st boss unless you really know what you re doing cataclysmic would be best since you can easily self proc and if you hit your shots you shouldn t have to reload until the very end of the dmg phase for eyes make sure you pop your well right as he starts the animation it ll last long enough and will help you break eyes faster a trace is really good for this so wavesplitter is still a good call expect a phase for 2nd boss rockets w starfire will be your best bet witherhoard should also be used to give better damage and nade uptime with a good rotation and ammo drops it should be an easy phase
first boss took me about phases last season and the final boss i just used gathering storms glitch to de spawn him
they really had to make the guardian rank solo dungeon requirement require the most tedious dungeon to solo
first boss use leviathan s breath w catalyst last boss use starfire well w rockets
i did spire of the watcher the first week it was available the number of dps phases i needed on akelous would ve melted my brain if i didn t listen to critical role while flying around with arctrician as a behemoth
there are still currently lots of cheesy safe spots for the end boss to make it easier play it safe equip wishender and it should be relatively painless this makes vex gambit a more difficult clear imo time pressure open area lots of adds run a void class spec for orb gen and abuse devour volatile with a void machine gun there
linear first boss demo rocket wither fusion spam for the second
i ve so far only been able to make it to the first boss solo and i just can t get past him it s not hard to get to a damage phase for me but towards the end i make a small mistake and end up getting killed it s a fun dungeon i ve always liked the seraph architecture wrath of the machine had me exploring a lot and i wish there was more
your main focus for soloing or even solo flawlessing a dungeon is to stay alive nothing else matters since you have infinite time the amount of damage phases needed is admittedly unbearable but with the bricks from beyond artifact mod this season it should be fine as long as you re using a void primary special weapon for the first boss i would actually advise against using starfire protocol the boss is weird with grenades and other projectile weapons i instead recommend karnstein armlets they provide a good emergency heal if you can deal a melee kill as for damage i would recommend using leviathan s breath if you don t have the catalyst then use cataclysmic and witherhoard for the entire phase as for breaking eyes trace rifles do it very well smgs are a secondary but not as effective option do note that you shouldn t be holding down the fire button when moving your reticle from eye to eye listen for the sound of the eye breaking stop shooting and start shooting the next you should be breaking the eyes as quickly as you can for the final boss i strongly recommend any rocket with demolitionist and a damage perk like explosive light or frenzy paired with starfire and witherhoard you can comfortably phase the boss if needed feel free to swap between starfire and karnstein when in and out of damage phases to survive please remember that the goal for completing it is survival not killing the bosses as fast as you can don t be afraid of using your well to save yourself you can spare the extra time it d take to farm your super for damage phases
i ve used solar warlock for my solo flawless used cataclysmic linear for the harpy 4th time focussed fury and well needed roughly damage phases if i remember correctly i did farm enemies for heavy before each damage phase so i could get off the shots one mag shots the rest from 4times each time final boss i ve used fusion grenades withhoard lmg for damage took a bit longer because i derped a damage phase but i think i was done after or dps phases don t remember exactly
it s going to be a fair bit more annoying this season than last i would assume solo operative and weakened clear were incredible for doing solo dungeons the main thing to remember about the last boss is because he s a wyvern any damage that isn t a super is reduced by warlocks can circumvent this by standing in their own well of radiance as that makes all weapon damage count as a super everyone else just kind of has to do a fuckload of phases i think i did eight or nine phases on my solar titan when i did my flawless solo run it s an ordeal
very tedious took me about damage cycles for both bosses with thunderlord
i was able to solo it a few days ago and kept using only a single loadout warlock i used riptide mini calus tool with incandescent leviathan breath rain of fire i had in total resilience and discipline healing grenade phoenix dive fragments are ember of mercy ember of searing ember of solace ember of empyrean this build is made to basically never die pretty much constant restoration and to do decent dmg constant radiant to kill stuff faster and leviathan breath will carry you for dmg i was able to solo akelous in dmg phases i used calus tool to destroy the eyes and persys in dmg phases
for me harpy took phases using a cataclysmic with hammer titan final boss took like phases using hothead and witherhoard
i think the play is still lfrs on the first boss then rockets the second the big difference in damage is honestly whether or not you can buff stack effectively if you are on solar then you will want to behead one of the vex trash ads so they walk to you at the end of the platform kill it for an orb pickup for surge if you go void you can debuff and use emp rift damage increase instead of well surge s final boss is just well unload with rockets witherhoard and fusions you can run double special or not depending on your comfort level
as a hunter i used a sniper succession hollow denial and leviathans breath for dps if you can hit all your shots you should be able to get all the eyes in one trace rifle magazine there s no enrage mechanic so take as many phases as you need
i used terrabah to bust the eyes and a 4th time bait and switch cataclysm with a kenetic sniper on boss one i used wither and funnelweb with a vorpal rocket on last boss keep in mind the last boss takes more damage from supers than normal i did phases with my hammer titan
smg for the eyes the key is to have a set starting pattern then mop up the last few you may have missed i always start bottom tight and do most of the right side then mop a few up on the left
i did it last season but veles x with backup mag can take out all the eyes without needing to reload one burst per eye it s also a void weapon so minotaur shields volatile rounds bricks from beyond work with it other than that i used witherhoard and bait and switch cataclysmic having solo flawlessed all the dungeons this one was a slog literally double the time to complete this one compared to any of the others the bosses are long and a war of attrition ammo economy is your friend for akelous especially
i was lucky enough to solo it 2nd try for first boss i ran witherhoard calus mini tool great for popping eyes and b s cataclysmic and did it in like phases just being careful and methodical last boss i believe i just used lasting impression rockets for phases
did a flawless run the other day the harpy took me phases go slow build into healing or invisibility once you can confidently survive with ease then focus on doing damage it just takes patience
i found that the dps for the cat boss took ages like or more rounds to finally kill it it wasn t particularly hard once i got into the groove of it it just took ages the wyvern went better around rounds for the kitty i used funnelweb and commemoration and i had dmt around for the eyes and occasional harpy cleanup bricks from beyond kept me well stocked with ammo i d just farm minotaurs until i had a reasonable amount of heavy and keep moving and clean up harpies as they spawned with commemoration and volatile rounds for the wyvern funnelweb a precision shotgun heritage for the hydras and gjallarhorn got him down in a reasonable amount of time kept devour up a lot of the time and made sure to hit the boss with weaken debuffs for improved damage during the boss fight again farm the minotaurs for full heavy i pretty much got solo on my first try just the other day it took about hours but i wiped on the fans and lost flawless
i noticed a three round burst or full auto sidearm really burns through the eyes
i main solar titan and for the first boss i used forerunner to shot the eyes fast and a triple tap frenzy taipan for dps and final boss i just used a hothead not very ideal dps strategies but it worked and i got the solo flawless first try i just saved my ult in case i was about to die never used it for dps in final boss just remember you can t dps if you re dead
akelous is super tedious i did it last week i think it took a dozen phases weapons i used were witherhoard trace rifle with incandescent and cataclysm with bait and switch there were a couple of phases where i didn t get the eyes down fast enough so elected to skip dps and get to safety rather than risk getting yeeted
what i didn t was using xenophage for the chicken front right corner behind the stairs i pop my well so he can t break it then do the old shot and throw granades repeat easy phase sadly bungie removed the perk for gls to reload all your stowed weapons use solar autoloader with parasite it reloads after seconds so you can unload all parasites per dps phase for the first boss use callus minitool to pop the eyes don t hover over them till they pop just tag them and go to the next one bullets per eye and for dps kataklysm with witherhord or sleeper and for ad controller just aktivate a note kill all harpies repeat till the last one about phases no way around it
another tip for the eyes i really like using long arm or even dead man s tale a single shot can pop an eye so you should be able to pop all of them safely without reloading my runs mostly use dmt and then some sort of void special plus cataclysm
i found that a bow for the first boss i used le monarque was able to one shot each eye with the minimum draw you just need to be able to predict the arc of the arrow with that little draw
deadman s tale pops eye with a single bullet
akelous was easier in my opinion actually went flawless most of the way through until the final encounter i just nailed him with an lfr and kept my distance while using icarus dash to mitigate his push if it hits me i ve run sunbracers to get my well back asap and eat grenades for healing as well as keeping ads to a minimum i ve also run void to grant myself devour and used contraverse hold to get my grenade back fast with regard to eyes if you have access to tarrabah it shreds them on full ravenous beast otherwise a quick reloading smg or hell a fucking trace rifle helped i ve used ruinous effigy before with fair success best of luck
i used rain of fire with vex riptide cata for akelous then starfire with wither retraced path a demo vorpal rocket for final boss heat rises and phoenix dives with double grenades will give you a considerable amount of survivability with on demand heals it can require a lot of dps phases but they are quick to get to and you have all the time you need
i think dmt one shots the eyes
are you running demo on your hot head with starfire it s going to be a lot of phases just be patient because an extra damage phase is better than wiping i will say tho i hated this dungeon more than duality
i almost gave up when i saw my damage on the first phase of the first boss went hunter arc the whole way used grandoverture
akelos was a pain but i ran marksman gg hunter with taipan and forunner took phases forunner is for eyes harpy clear but it does decent damage if you re outta heavy ammo persys yea i couldn t solo the chicken bc he s not even the real boss for a resil hunter it s the supplicants so i used the gathering storm jolt bug to shot him
i found an auto rifle with large magazine plus a perk that overflows your magazine will do it fast enough to get damage in i saw people using trace rifles but i wasn t able to break the eyes fast enough
i actually just did my first solo last night i used izi rocket hot swap with starfire for extra dmg and got it in phases
if you re using an smg don t shoot between each eye that way you won t have to reload if you re lucky
i think my biggest struggle thus far is loadout for the 1st boss i am having trouble shooting the eyes fast enough to do any kind of damage i know it ll be phases if i am lucky use a 900rpm smg but you need to try to aim fast and get at least eyes per mag then shoot the boss with an lfr or a good weapon for damage it s all about precision
can still be easily detonated by enemies and allies and cause a self destruct fun fact gunpowder gamble is an ignition but it is also the only form of ignition damage in the game that deals self damage also tripmines don t always stick to teammates only when you have yas equipped
absolutely agree it needs a buff more fragment slots is probably the single thing i want out of it the most
gpg demands all of your fragment slots to be effective actually if you completely ignore the scorch aspect of the class it s not too bad i use ember of torches solace empyrean w healing nades and just basically focus on keeping radiance restoration surges active all the time i use gpg parasite and blade barrage to constantly feed each other having all these nukes makes ember of empyrean actually pretty useful even in gms for example when i toss my gpg into a crowd i immediately use the healing nade regardless since gpg kills will give me a full secs of resto
what it really needs is more fragment slots it s fun as hell to use but it needs more fragment slots what i really want is a crit buff to celestial nighthawk
i forgot gunpowder even existed man if only it wasn t horribly overshadowed by the other aspects or just give it another fragment slot it d be fun to try
i want gpg to be activated by charging your grenade once you ve got the stacks not being able to choose when to use it is the biggest deterrent for me
i agree completely i ve honestly just stopped using it until they add more fragment slots and buff it
i never use it because it blocks my healing grenade
doesn t every other class only have fragment slots any way is it that bad only having
this guy uses lightweight knife
i wouldn t run beams combustion or lightweight knife ever char torches mercy searing lean into firesprites imo
still don t understand why we have fragment aspects
you basically have to give up having a build to use gpg
i d like if it gave another slot too
the biggest issue with it is that it overrides your grenade when it is active meaning you are locked out of using a healing grenade until you throw it not ideal neither is the loss of fragment slots
i wish they would buff this thing so it s actually worth the single fragment slot it gives i want gpg to be on the level of the titans bastion aspect or just as good as the warlock bleak watcher but instead of crowd control or team buffs it s just straight nuke it ain t even gotta be strong let me use it more or let me have more control over when i use it hell let me store two charges at once or something i know they re probably leaving some of this design space open so they can have a gpg specific armor exotic but it really should be better to use right out of the box right now there s a good list of negatives and not a whole lot of incentives to picking this aspect over either of the other two
also tripmines don t always stick to teammates only when you have yas equipped ahh makes sense i almost always use yas so i wouldn t have noticed that
iirc if you use the fragment that increases the range of ignitions even the normal ones start damaging you
the only form of ignition damage in the game that deals self damage related similar fun fact with caliban s hand in the right circumstances you can accidentally self kill with your own proximity knife at which point your ragdoll will ignite and damage targets in the ignition radius
ah so it sounds like an outlier so bungie should fix it per their policy of hammering down outliers however this outlier isn t fun or helpful so bungie probably won t fix it
this is in my opinion probably the best buff to give it considering the aspect demands so many fragments to buff it s effectiveness anyway
also i like to use gpg with calibans hand instead of yas and its always a lot of fun easy to maintain resto and radiant at all times
your loss
it actually only has if you want to use the one that let s you refund your knives lol and that one is borderline necessary
it depends but it s not just the amount of slots it s how many slots you need to use to shore up a poor ability there s ways to get slots in gunslinger even if you just don t use gpg
it s more like i test lightweight knife sometimes use it for an activity sometimes and i can tell you i ve stunned more champions by getting radiant with it than with gpg which tells you how poor gpg is for champs
same problem with void warlock and the grenade charging aspect because most the fragments are necessary both should be buffed i m not saying that s it s ok for this problem to exist because other classes have it
ember of torches makes all powered melees grant radiant on hit not only crits hunter knock em down aspect refunds melee on melee kills you ll never be without radiant and you will have full uptime on the weapon damage bonus granted by radiant ad athyr s and weighted knife can stun unstops caliban s hand and every proximity knife kill is essentially a gunpowder gamble itself fan of knives does good damage and applies scorch will consistently kill a red bar i agree that gpg falls short which is unfortunate because it is a fun tool to use it either needs an extra fragment slot or something extra but know you re handicapping yourself if you re using it this way
yeah i already know all that i wanted to test out lightweight knife
to their credit the past year they re very quick to fix stuff like that what pisses people off more is how it seems they don t ever playtest or run through their own objectives or else they d know how crazy some are the nightfalls flat out not being able to achieve scores needed to advance is a huge red flag
i m glad it was fixed fast but they re making it way more cumbersome to walk it back even if quickly shows that they are out of touch also requiring specific accommodations just means they will be farmed and defeats the purpose of the system bungie needs more active testers longer term players giving feed back and tweaking things that way
i m just tired of what feels like them breaking everything they introduce just to fix it in future seasons it feels like a hamster wheel of play this season because of new thing play next season because we fixed that new thing
i just wish they spent those resources on other parts of the game instead
i m just glad i unlocked the extra loadouts when they were in rank objectives because i m locked at without owning the wq dungeon key
not sure why they didn t wholesale copy ff14s system you get one commendation per activity you cannot commend your team members so you cant farm them and they aren t an integral part of ranking up or what have you just gives you some nice cosmetic rewards as you get more and at you get access to mentor roulette which is meant to queue you into stuff with new players to help out doing of these gives you a cool mount in destiny i spam commends on everyone in ff i legitimately think about who i ll give my commendation to that s where destiny s system fails for me
commendations should be no part of any progression system at all just let them be things people get awarded in their own little menu that you can inspect
exactly this they aren t prototyping things and they adjust mechanics with a wrecking ball instead of a scalpel it s beyond exhausting and it doesn t make me want to play the game
you still don t need the dungeon key you can get them at rank you do need lf
that wouldn t work in destiny or at least for the vision they have non team members effectively locks out every end game activity cause they have no matchmaking and most of them shouldn t have matchmaking defeats the whole purpose of their system where they want commendations and ranks to show people s experience don t get me wrong right now it s farmable and near pointless too but that s not the solution
ah so they moved the requirement it was the flawless legend lost sector that got moved
they want the guardian ranks to show experience with commendations being a requirement to rank it up i m saying separate them entirely and unfortunately you have to lock out team members otherwise they re meaningless anyways they shouldn t be something you can farm you still do plenty of matchmade content in destiny same for ff that being said in ff mentors having to just get a bunch of commendations despite not actually needing to be good at the game has turned it into a bit of a meme lol so it s not a great solution either but it s better than then being a time gated number that you mindlessly slap on everyone s face at the end of the match it feels good in ff to get every single person s commendation because you did something that saved the group in a fight or something in destiny i just get mad at not getting everyone s cus one person is being lazy and slowing my numbers down that sucks
proving grounds should also be possible just checked esoterikks master video and he was close to 190k before he ran out of time
considering i ended arms dealer with 220k without revive farming i d say that one is very possible too
don t think so arms dealer was possible without to much of problems to get 200k and 230k is not that much more the increase of the multiplier should allow it
200k should be achievable without having to cheese anything in all master nightfalls i don t see why bungie smoothed the scoring curve it didn t need any scoring rework it worked as it was i so hope they dial back this change cause i can t be fucked to run nightfalls for a single pinnacle and if gms can t even achieve 200k for me that s actually bad design
arms dealer and hypercurrent are possible but more difficult to hit 200k in without revive farming you just have to go into it with a proper build dedicated to making points which i feel like was bungie s intentions they just goofed the execution i feel like 200k was intended to be something you had to try for and not just do a run on the hardest difficulty
you won t be able to cheese revives anymore either since they re fixing that fix the actual issue no fix the workaround the players need yes
none of these ranks should be tied to time gated missions aside from brand new dungeons raids given that they occur early in seasons i d love to know why in some instances we ve got champions being defeated for instead of tho
i did master glassway with an lfg team and we got around 210k without any cheesing other two dudes were super solid tho
did you really pull those numbers from the blog post and write up this thread analyzing them without looking at literally the next paragraph where they said they re going to patch the multipliers to be higher soon
they need to just calm the fuck down with lake of shadows holy shit that boss room is ass
rip my score on the glassway gm
locking buzzard behind glassway was a real dick move
are there not also usually a good few more champions on gm
just wait till the next update where they stop us from gaining points for revives they said it s coming
bungie needs to acknowledge and fix this during this season
i m guessing you completely missed the huge blog yesterday where they said they were changing scoring on nf
you can get 230k on several master nfs so it should be possible on gm already its just optimizing make orbs get headshots kill everything and move fast
crazy thought they probably made the score so high only cheaters could achieve it which would result in a ban of people positive out come and maybe a week or ext later that change it to a reasonable number
my favourite gm
change it back plz
its very possible in the mars one i managed a 250k there on master no revive cheese sadly i dont have a screenshot of that run but i do have a 210k screenshot https://i.gyazo.com/e1433698b80d15c7f7d61cf14d28863d.jpg) of a run i did after to help out a friend to get his master 200k this time we didn t do the farm to such extent 250k cuz i knew it was overkill but like i think is very possible to achieve in most gms if i remember correctly they used to give around 350k points there is no way 5x nerf will make it go that low to make 230k impossible
they didn t make anything smoother every grandmaster for a platinum completion should reward more then enough to reach the goal they don t so bungie once again dropped numbers without testing anything
didn t they also say they re going to tune each strike specifically so that scoring is more even across them
do master and gm have the same number of champs i thought gms had more but no confident on that since i don t really bother with master since gms are more rewarding have adepts
i m sure no one at bungie plays the game on this level
what threshold does signify exactly
my fireteam made 205k pretty easily on arms dealer master just by generating tons of orbs throughout the strike no farming enemy respawns or anything
technically you don t need to cheese revives in arms dealer to reach 200k but you don t really get there naturally per se
i was getting 200k per run on master and it was actually the funnest one this season
bungie is too stupid for effective balance changes
there will also be more champs and such to increase the score
thinking about it arms dealer would probably be possible due to being able to kill the orbs carriers repeatedly and gm gives you more time than master before the score drain
we also hit about 207k w o really putting much effort into farming score we killed an extra orb guy shot down a thresher at the edge of the map and we definitely made sure to utilize supers frequently that was about it i dont think arms dealer will be an issue on gm
just to add some info to this we got 201k in arms dealer but we did have to have the centurion orb bearer spawn in about times for that score is this a cheese they were talking about and will we be prevented from doing this after the changes i don t know
they smoothed it because they tied score to rep they don t want people earning loot too quickly and they didn t bother checking the negative impact on other parts of the game as long as the grind was safely protected
yeah you should have to try to kill everything in a timely fashion on the hardest difficulty not dance around reviving teammates for five minutes at the ass end of a gm the point threshold for the triumph is there to show that the player didn t cheese their way around encounters or sat in safe exploitable spaces for twenty minutes plinking down enemies with infinite ammo primary weapons like the warden of nothing roof cheese we should be able to do the strike as intended and be fine but we re not we have to farm centurions and jump off ledges that doesn t demonstrate any combat mastery or buildcrafting expertise
love how they spent three paragraphs just to say we ackgnowledge that there s an issue with scoring but we don t care lol get fucked
usually means you got assist scoring credit someone on your team got the full score
more or less i interpreted that in a future patch as being separate to the incoming mid season patch that and the part that mentions reviewing vanguard scoring after season concludes
and what does that change now right now if you want to progress your guardian rank your options are wait for literally that longest strike in entire game that has champions or resort to using cheeses glitches exploits
glassway is lowkey one of the easier strikes this season up until the boss has always been pretty easy and now with suspend basically everything in the boss room can be trivialized if you have one player with a strand build on the miniboss hydra can even be tied up
i m about sure that master and grandmaster have the same number of champions i think the increase of champions is when jumping from legend to master
literally the bullet point before the one where they said the rez cheese scoring change is coming they said they ll be increasing the scoring multipliers in the same patch
my best guess is that it ll be either a cooldown on when you can gain score from revives or a hard limit on the amount revives that grant score
good job conveniently ignoring the part where scoring changes are coming which is incuded in the same section destiny fans will find every excuse real or imaginary to whine like a bunch of little tiddy babies have some respect for yourself
i hate that you re being downvoted i also find it kind of ridiculous that no one even bothered to play test the requirements for their new guardian rank system having to cheese score during even the highest level nightfall is a really stupid system that shouldn t be there like i get that people on this subreddit get tired of everyone complaining about stuff that doesn t really matter but i feel like this one is a valid thing to be sort of upset about
jesus christ they literally announced in their blog post yesterday that they will be adjusting the nightfall score multipliers to match up better with the guardian ranks triumph thresholds in a midseason patch if you re going to be sanctimonious about bungie needing to acknowledge issues you should try actually reading their news feeds to see whether or not they have
the blog post is where the score multiplier reduction from 5x to 0x information came from it does mention a future patch that will take a pass at multipliers and guardian rank score objectives but future patch seems to imply that it is separate to the mid season patch likely arriving further down the line though i would be fine with being wrong and have the score be more attainable in the nightfall selection when gms unlock next week
teams with combined orbs all splitting up to kill every enemy solo rather than all tagging them why do i have to res farm
why would we care if cheaters scored high in a pve mode who does that effect
in grandmaster is one of the objectives to go from guardian rank to
just make an orb generating build no need to farm a single enemy
there s no reason to hold a super especially not with how many orbs you can make using them
for sure it was the rezzing cheese
it s not great either when you have to intentionally drag out encounters to ensure the maximum number of adds get spawned like in hypercurrent when you withhold dps on the tormentor so that you get a few extra waves of cabal to spawn in and then during the sparrow section getting off the sparrow so you can kill all the taken that s what i dislike about the scoring system it incentivizes you to play in a very unnatural way which also happens to mean slowing you down making you take longer to progress and potentially improving bungie s engagement metrics it s quite a metagame we re cheesing their nightfall mechanics to maximize our rewards they re cheesing their playerbase to maximize their engagement metrics the circle of life
but you don t have to farm on several of the strikes and i completely agree the point totals across strikes is completely out of wack people just farm because it s easier than the intended method which is definitely a flaw in the system you re supposed to create orbs and get precision kills for extra points
yeah not specifying the mid season patch as the target drop gave me the same impression as to it being apart and further down the timeline
can t even rez farm in gm due to limited lives unless the number required is under the amount you get from killing champs
gildy boys
dude i didn t even think of that that will be a game changer
yep there s been a regime change and glassway is a top dog for farming now
the miniboss hydra can be blinded with a grenade launder too
there are a few more on gm to my memory i know of some strikes where in gm certain elemental shields are gone entirely because everything that had those shields on lower difficulties have become champions instead but it s not like noticeably more over master it s like maybe across the entire strike
cheers for the understanding buddy
they re getting downvoted because bungie has acknowledged it and has said they re fixing it mostly likely in this season though in a future patch is rather non specific usually if they re targeting the next season they say they are tho
they said future patch which isn t necessarily midseason
ah got it
also make sure that you do not kill the tormentor to quickly and try to tag all enemies before they can be killed by the allied cabal
still shouldn t be necessary the scoring is poorly designed if you do the correct difficulty kill all the enemies do it quickly you should be able to achieve the target score
yeah you shouldn t be punished for capturing a plate too quickly or burning a miniboss too quickly the whole step off the plate to make sure adds spawn in is just dumb if you kill every enemy that spawns within the time limit you should be able to hit any relevant score thresholds
oh shit i missed a precision kill that s a wipe
i ran a few masters last week and it was an absolute cakewalk
oh for sure the amount of people melting the tormentor and losing an easy 30k
arms dealer has a tormentor
sure i personally feel things like rank progression should require a small potential change to playstyle
this makes me feel much better about farming it when gms come around cheers
arms dealer and lake of shadows both received an update with lightfall
only in the nightfall versions i believe
i think even bungie admitted it s not intentional they pretty much confirmed the theory they just wanted to nerf outliers so we don t earn rep and loot too quickly making it not possible to rank up was a side effect
no all versions were updated i m pretty sure
sure but it is still very possible to rank up i d expect players at rank to be able to put together a simple build that can score enough points to do the triumph obviously if the challenge was impossible or obscenely difficult i d call it bs but its not
only the nightfall version has tormentors
my bad i saw another comment and thought he was replying to that one
is this console only i press r on my keyboard and it cancels just fine
i always cancel reloads with sprint so i think i just haven t noticed
i cancel arrows by switching weapons lol
shit no wonder i can t cancel my draw on my leviathans breath very well always thought it was me tbh
hold down the cancel button and release the shoot button simultaneously
i use full auto accessibility i don t have issues firing or cancelling bow shots
seemed to work fine for me on mouse and keyboard so far
i ve been forced to adapt to just swapping weapons
huh so that s why that s been happening
i ve always swapped weapons any so i guess i didn t notice it
i actually think this is a new bug since lightfall
i haven t had that problem but i don t use bows very often what about switching weapons wouldn t that cancel it too
i just double tap the switch weapons button
i use sprint to cancel now it works well enough
only for controller for this game being primarily marketed to and played on consoles the controller experience is absolutely horrible compared to mouse and keyboard
oh so that s why that was happening
you press the reload button to cancel the draw
makes verglas unusable for the same reason losing your charged shot is awful
i hope bungie fixes this just make it so that full auto is disabled on bows
i noticed this too i ve started cancelling the draw with either sprint or a weapon swap it s irritating but a small drawback for being able to shot everything else full auto
or leviathan s breath so that s what was happening god dammit
ohhhhhh so that s why my bows have been all trigger happy now
i was wondering what was going on there thought i just got worse not too bad to get used to though
you can still sprint jump or swap weapons but it s super annoying as a mostly bow user not being able to unknock arrows with the reload button was a no go turned that shit off real quick
only if you re dumb sure
thank you so much i was wondering why i was still shooting my leviathans breath after canceling
i don t understand why you d turn on auto for a bow tho
glad you posted this i was getting very confused as well
no it s a mistake people make where they continue to hold the fire input as they cancel the arrow
same
i tested it on xbox and it seems to work just fine i even tried enacting bad timing and it still worked
same here
not a console issue i m on playstation and i ve had full auto on since the moment it became a setting and i cancel arrow draws all the time no issues
yea i have to sprint melee cancel alot in this game specifically glaives if im melee ing and shooting run out of ammo but still want to block the second i stop blocking game auto reloads for me never before did i notice it as being an issue till then
same
lol same here
sprint to cancel and it works just fine
yup gotta waste it before it gets wasted anyway this is why the bow sits in the vault
this has nothing to do with the full auto setting after testing this with it both on and off i can find no difference at all in arrow cancelling if someone can t cancel they just don t have the timing down cancel and release the shot at the same time not hard
because while on and off are options on but off for bows is not
when i continue to hold fire and press cancel its just a quick way to reset perfect draw lol
op and some other commenters are on something then idk lmao
another same here haha
this is true however a lot of people forget that they also need to release the fire button as they cancel if they don t want to immediately redraw
if it gives you nothing it was going to be a blue item means you re past the soft cap the game just auto deletes blues from your rewards rather than replacing it with something else
i ve been getting the same on the edz i haven t been to the other areas this season i m glad i m not the only one having this issue it s super annoying at least give me glimmer or something
bungie doesn t understand rewards i can go play diablo basically any one of them kill a boss and then have items pop up on my screen with piles of gold and gems i do that in destiny and i ll get like one purple world drop that i auto dismantle mayyyybeee an exotic but odds are very likely that i ll auto dismantle that too for a looter game destiny is very very stingy i ll dismantle like items in diablo then use those dismantle pieces to possibly give me rolls at something else only for those rolls to also end up being nothing but that s the loop and the incentive to go back out there destiny has you farm and go back out there but you ll spend minutes maybe even an hour doing an activity like a raid and you ll get like drops all which can be trash and as much as i like crafting it s antithetical to the reward loop of a looter game lol no need to go back out there if you can get exactly what you want especially if that item is now permanent for years to come so yea idk bungie shot themselves in the foot with how the game has been for so long it needs to be waaaaaay more rewarding with how random loot is but crafting is also a risk now no idea what their design goals are but they just don t seem like they know what they are doing with this loot based game
at one point if you opened to many chests in an area they would stop giving you anything dunno if it s still a thing
for me it s only the edz and nessus that are empty but all the chests are empty i see glimmer but i don t get any i ve taken to just running around skywatch on the cosmodrome when i need glimmer bc at least all those hive chests are full of glimmer i really want bungie to acknowledge fix this bc it makes me not want to spend any time on those planets i know the rewards from chests are minimal but the disappointment at opening a chest and getting nothing is a real deterrent while they re at it they should also fix the rewards on the psi ops battlegrounds in the strike playlist bc i have never received any rewards from them although my friends have i wasn t playing during risen didn t start playing until plunder so my current theory is that the psi ops battlegrounds are somehow still coded to season pass ownership idk if that s possible but psi ops are a slog and it feels icky to get nothing at the end
no way we ve circled back to complaining on not getting blues
they re bugged but people on reddit will just tell you you re at the glimmer cap even if you re not
hmmm i think patrols need help what if you could collect chests and do patrols that reward a region key fragment and when you have like you can open a heroic public event chest and earn a random red border from the lost seasons
those chests used to drop a planetary material and maybe a blue now planetary materials have gone and blues are considered the rare drop therefore you get nothing
don t worry they also give nothing on neomuna but let s just make neomuna more bullet sponge with nothing to compensate on that
i noticed that in trostland i was doing some glimmer farming with bountiful harvest and just scooping materials up dusk shards gave me 4k each and all chests a whopping among them
game is shit but we still play it because there s no alternative
i ve never encountered that strange
i miss the two tokens and a blue days well no i don t
it didn t give you nothing it gave you the joy and anticipation of opening it
i ve been saying they should have glimmer shards and a core for a while now in the feedback forums
sry i got to them first
it s the psiops battlegrounds they re bugged and always give literally zero loot
i think they give like xp which is totally worth it and a lot ik
this has happened to me consistently however mine is the opposite location any chest at all that i open on neomuna except terminal overload for example hvt chests or randomly spawning chests in the world drop nothing no glimmer no rewards now it s anecdotal for me but i believe i ve killed enough hvt s in this game to know at some point you ll see a legendary at least once every so often for hvt kills since neomuna became a thing no hvt has dropped anything period there i don t hear much about this problem so i assume i m in the minority here only place this happens all other random chests and hvt s in the game drop something glimmer at least now i m not expecting a legendary drop from every hvt like they do with them on europa but damn give me something for my effort here just for reference i am above powerful cap and my glimmy ain t full
as others have been saying lately this game is a looter shooter that s allergic to loot
happens to me everywhere even in strikes i get nothing not even glimmer
it gives you glimmer in my experience
they re supposed to give the amount of glimmer when they do that these are empty like a raid secret chest looted more than once a week
terminal overload chests still give blues
i ve been gone for a while did they get rid of planetary materials
it s the psiops battlegrounds they re bugged and don t give loot
destiny falls into the category of not as much loot but better drops the only issue is they are failing on the better drops at endgame activities for example high stat armor from raids not every looter shooter needs drops from a boss they just need those drops to have some meaning whether that be drops that you dismantle to reforge hoping for a god roll or a single few drop s where the loot pool is smaller therefore hoping the god roll drops
i ll dismantle like items in diablo then use those dismantle pieces to possibly give me rolls at something else only for those rolls to also end up being nothing but that s the loop and the incentive to go back out there that sounds awful during vault cleanings i dismantle items at a time and it s a gd slog i d rather be shooting things than be in menus i d rather fewer better drops bungie has the fewer drops at least but i want even fewer drops and every single one should be actually usable the percentage of my time spent just dismantling shit drops post match is too high maybe make the game actually fun and reward the player intrinsically on repeat plays rather than extrinsically a new strike or raid is fantastic to play regardless of rewards the first week either make repeat runs not suck or abandon a constant engagement model
destiny was not made with a loot system that would be going on as long as it has and bungie keeps trying to reinvent parts of it which i think has slowly been causing more and more problems crafting sunsetting and now no longer getting blue rarity items after hitting a cap all are large changes around or to the rewards system but without changing the core of the reward and loot system results in a rather disappointing system hell even in d1 the joke was that destiny did not give any loot i think the loot system was not that well designed to begin with and all the changes over time have both to rewards and loot have made things feel worse
agreed needing to grind for tens of hours to get a halfway decent roll is fine if i m being showered with glorious trash so i can feel like i m having chances at things
this old comic came to mind https://imgur.com/ytznsoh
leans in that s because it s not a looter it s halo but there just happens to be some loot and rpg lite elements
yes loot lockout it s either or minutes can t remember which this could be related but honestly i ve had chest just straight up give me nothing regardless of lockout lately
yeah i farm those chests as well literally the only chests that drop anything in the cosmodrome
good old toxic positivity
it happens with eliksni and cabal chests all the time
don t they only spawn glimmer when a blue engram would ve dropped from an enemy could be that the devs forgot to think about direct to inventory blue drops and making sure those also grant glimmer when they changed the system a couple months ago
maybe op is at glimmer cap
two tokens and a blue
the game is supposed to auto dismantle blues some still sneak through i m guessing here it s because blues are great infusion fodder and neomuna is the new place
which is great the removal of blues once you are in the power band made it significantly more difficult to fill in your lower slots since legendary drops are rarer
and these blues don t give gunsmith reputation when dismantled
for the most part yes planetary nodes are still there they just give you planetary vendor reputation and some glimmer instead now
the problem with destiny is that it has far too many of layers of rng everywhere
oh it s not that bad diablo also has console versions so it s not like it s a pc only experience i can see why you d be skeptical but the main difference between a game like diablo path of exile etc and destiny is you ll spend 30m in destiny to get trash a single weapon roll in destiny has like slots that can roll even if you don t care about a god roll you still probably want the final columns and this columns can have chance or chance depending on the gun per column armor then has the stats it can roll and that s not counting the drop of the gun or armor piece itself so you have to have the gun or armor drop first then multiple that by the perk columns you want or the stat distribution it s brutal because you might get one drop an hour a week etc take a raid for example certain guns only drop off of certain bosses adepts only drop from their respective master challenge this week s challenge sucked it s super buggy because it s the second encounter you spend however long completing that challenge to get one drop one adept trace rifle the drop is guaranteed so that s at least one obstacle removed but then the barrel the mag the last two columns or the masterwork could all be terrible and you wasted your time meanwhile diablo can have you do one activity and see things explode out of one boss and you ll trash of them but you ll get a few pieces that are nice you had chances to get those perfect or close enough to perfect rolls you wanted where as destiny will give you one shot maybe a 3x a week per character it s crazy the only thing in the game remotely rewarding is weirdly the seasonal stuff defiance engrams get sent to you at an insane rate it feels like sadly focusing requires multiple engrams so is only like or rolls or something like that but hey at least it s doable bungie doesn t get that though you could spend of those engrams can get those final two columns of the gun you want to never line up and it s not bad rng it s a chance to hit one in six chances at the same time x so yea diablo gives you a lot there is a ritual where you do spend some time after each run to dismantle or sell or break down your loot you don t need but it s not pointless like the blues were you can turn the components in for even more rolls or other methods things it feels a lot better to grind for minutes and get shots at the thing you want with 5m of menus than spend minutes to get shots like man i farmed for a matador for a bit in goa and after runs of not getting a single matador only to then finally get a matador to drop but it s an absolute trash roll hurts who knows when i d see one again bungie doesn t get that psychology or maybe it s an engine latency limitation who knows but i would rather feel like i m getting a ton of loot and distilling that down than getting very little loot that that varies wildly in quality master raid armor dropping sub stats
agreed that s what s annoying though game is almost years old by this point and they still haven t figured out some of these key issues we ve had since forever destiny has potential is the refrain i ve heard for years along with the gameplay is amazing though both are true getting tired of waiting though
i had that as well at the start of the season while i still had to get my blue gear it seemed to be a reset wide affair one day i wouldn t get anything in the edz the next day they were fine
supposed to happen as far as i know glimmer only
i mean i ve spent a good bit of time on those places doing weapon bounties and restocking glimmer etc and in months have never had that happen just saying maybe it s a problem limited to certain people certain gaming systems really not sure but definitely some kind of bug it s not an intended thing
i m at 5k glimmer
that won t be it anecdotal i know but i ve been under cap and had this happen and also been at cap and still seen the glimmer pop up on screen
removed
only d2 og s understand
you can still bank dusklight shards and data lettuce from edz and nessus bounties though store away for a rainy day to trade in to rahool if you need money fast
and amusingly the planetary material typically gives more glimmer than the chest full of glimmer does
that s a neat change i guess but it s bizarre how long it takes them to come to these kinds of decisions and also how they keep entirely getting rid of or replacing systems instead of making improvements the move to modules was already done to make the material system less taxing by not forcing armor weapons to use one specific planetary material seems like that would be the logical place to just jettison them
i get you on the shit destiny rolls i m just not about to inspect rolls to see if one is good the post game ritual you talk about is what i m trying to avoid i d rather the cadence of drops in destiny or less purples have replaced blues in my book but fewer things that can roll badly fewer perks in each column better chances guaranteed exotics etc hell i d take a toggle to auto dismantle everything i get except like exotics as long as we actually get mats for it that s the shitty thing about the blue removal is that they also removed the mats except from playlist drops i have the weapons and armor i like i ll only care about getting loot if i m chasing something rather than just playing activities seems like bungie is scared that people won t play if they aren t chasing loot and my answer is that if they make something intrinsically fun people will still play instead they make a grind wheel that people hate but will still do cause of the chance at loot this is ignoring the general gaming industry capitalist landscape and the fact that bungie isn t the only dev doing this and they have invested enough in destiny to go the shitty but guaranteed route to keep up maus and keep the players from playing something else also the fact that they are a profit seeking company above all else makes anti consumer decisions easier to make
it happens to me pretty often i like roaming patrols when i m bored just what i do i d say it s if it ll be empty or drop even just glimmer
it is certainly possible it s very frustrating though
our most rewarding public event yet
mercury was why i quit back in y1
that s a neat change i guess but it s bizarre how long it takes them to come to these kinds of decisions dude tell me about it we re almost at the end of the big story arc of destiny several years in the making and lots of expansions and we somehow still don t have a team text chat that works reliably on pc why because it s not turned on by default so people straight up don t know it exists why is it off by default fuck if i know only bungo knows it really rustles my jimmies as a deaf guardian that i can t reliably talk to people in matchmade activities unless they specifically turn on team text chat or i join a premade fireteam
but making the game intrinsically fun seems like you re leaning away from the looter game style inspecting each item to see if it s good is the whole point of looters getting the ideal drop you wanted and grinded for is like half of the fun lol having tons of unique loot that can all roll randomly but then limiting how often you can get that randomly rolled loot is a recipe for disaster the slot machine nature of getting perfect stats or roll on an item is the point instead of just adding more drops you could reduce the number of perk options or give a higher chance of getting the good ones but that means each gun has less options and is less complex limited rolls no way that works make a lot of guns and make some guns much rarer than others but have fixed rolls no one liked that though might as well make unique weapons like halo it has nothing to do with engagement or maus it s just how looters work lol and looters have a high volume of drops destiny is a looter and has always been advertised as one if you don t like that no worries but that s the type of game they claim it is and that s the real issue bungie has never nailed down what type of game destiny is they try to appeal to and please all types of potential customers it is a pve or pvp game yes is it a looter or is it more experience oriented yes is it multiplayer oriented or solo player oriented yes is it a rpg with choices and stats builds or is it a linear action game like halo where that doesn t matter yes is it a fps or third person action game yes is it targeted at casual or hardcore players yes you can t appeal to everyone and that s why destiny has been such a mess for so long it appeals to all kinds of people but honestly it also pisses everyone of i bet a lot of people would like a pure competitive pvp mode balanced purely for pvp but bungie said they don t want to do that i m sure a lot of people would like pvp to go away so bungie can focus solely on pve the story and raids and whatever but bungie doesn t want to do that either some people love stat and roll farming aka looter gameplay loop people like you don t care and just want their gun to be unique and fill a role but also just work with minimal min maxxing farming it s a mess a lot of the game s goals and themes compete or outright contradict oppose each other
oh how i don t miss not being able to use my sparrow there
why is it off by default bungie s social systems lead at the launch of d2 specifically ensured it was set up that way to curb toxicity
i d rather every game turn off text and voice chat by default if i need to talk to you i will but unless we re raiding trials or gm i don t need want comms unless i like you
it s off by default because online gaming is toxic by default if you choose to engage feel free but the toxicity usually comes in without you choosing to so that s the best part to filter out by default
voice chat has always been the same too like how do you have a game where you re force to interact with other players for almost all content but also have all forms of communication disabled by default i remember trying to do the heroic taken events and having randos kill all the blights and there s nothing you can do in game to tell them not to so i d go into the roster find their name go to their psn profile wait for it to load click to message them and oh my fucking god they have messages disabled
well not like you can use it now
do you happen to have a link for that interview legit asking because i don t remember bungie ever making a comment on it since they implemented text chat in vanilla d2 just kind of felt like they threw together a basic text chat after players complained about the lack of one at launch and then called it a day still a poor decision either way imo it s throwing out the baby with the bathwater given that you don t even need to be able to communicate to be toxic to other players especially persistent ones will find other ways outside of the game xbox live messages ps messages discord whatever to communicate toxic messages anyway so
that s fine you do you everyone plays differently i guess i mostly just want to be able to tell the blueberry in the corrupted hero nf to stop shooting the immune boss and help throw the orbs at the boss or to call out invader location in gambit freelance so everyone doesn t drop dead or yea you get the idea i m not looking for long meaningful conversations with blueberries just small things like corrections or some semblance of coordination in activities that aren t usually done with premade fireteams
that was supposed to turn opt out this year but i think it changed from that plan edit opt out not opt in
here ya go https://financialpost.com/technology/gaming/destiny-2-social-lead-m-e-chung-on-how-bungie-used-a-super-bowl-ring-philosophy-to-balance-community)
local chat is opt out now at least no one uses it though cause everyone assumes it s off since it has been for like years
thanks much appreciated
they most likely nerfed the ae of whisper
if the leaks are true some are getting decent reworks others aren t some of the reworks still make the exotics completely worthless
there were leaks i won t link them but they re most definitely better than bonus ae
they better not change promethian spur i just got a crcked roll and used it for infusion
i just want them to make sanguine actually worth using and no the leaked changes for it will not do that they may see a maybe very small increase in usage and even then mostly just to check the change out
please make chromatic fire a real exotic i just got that cool ass ornament
eternal warrior now grants ae to the first shots after the fists of havoc super is over enjoy
i hope they undo the nerfs to wormgod s caress and winter s guile there was no need to nerf them in the first place
i just want phoenix protocol to buff phoenix dive imo
nah theres leaks that are real and its mostly good stuff
if the leaks are to be believed they are pretty decent changes but let s hope they don t stop there there are still plenty of armors that didn t see any changes like gwishin vest that need to be changed
i wont say what they are but there were leaks and they are definitely a lot more interesting than ae buffs
if the big leaked list is anything to go by my stronghold build is ready
laughs in sniping with whisper midair
necrotic grips removed damage over time melee kills now create a pulse which spreads to enemies increasing their airborne effectiveness and reducing pulse rifle damage taken
theyre counting the nerf to starfire as a buff to all other solar warlock exotic options
looks like graviton lance is possibly back on the menu bois
never overdeliver
the leaked changes overall look pretty good sealed ahamkaras grasps are getting worse though which is pretty funny
i d say ae really only affects warlocks since titans and hunters especially aren t in the air for that long and even when you do fire in the air it s usually a semi auto gun like a shotgun or a nade launcher
i just got an incredible roll of felwinter s helm so i would love for them to actually make that exotic useful
it s not don t worry some of them are pretty great imo
i like that they are touching the exotics we dont use good start i wish that before lightfall we also got exotic weapon balancing the same as now we get the armor each class gains a new aspect make all aspects grant you fragment slots this one could be done in seasons with bringing in one new fragment for each light subclass and other bringing in for darkness this would be hard to do in a season so maybe in a dlc after final shape when we get our last darkness subclass but i feel like at least stasis could use another super just as foresaken brought us new supers exotic armor changes are a great start i hope they at least give us stasis rebalancing one of the seasons and exotic guns rebalance new aspects might be too much work before final shape they could wait with it for 3rd season after fs so that the last darkness subclass also gets the 4th aspect
if the leaks are to be believed a lot of the changes seem like they d shake up the buffed exotics in very good ways
fyi the leaks are credible and all over twitter some of these changes are gonna make very strong builds
so far the leaks look promising
tommys matchbook finally getting the love it deserves
ha thank you for reminding me the freakin ae buff to whisper of the worm absolutely lunatic stuff xd
i think the changes are pretty cool
well not now way to ruin the surprise you jerk
i don t want to give credence to leaks but this number matches the amount of exotics that were slated to get changes if it s real these are actually substantial and positive changes but it s a leak so take with no belief whatsoever it s just nice to have a bit of positive belief
ae truly the buff sanguine alchemy needs
so we actually got leaks for the buffs spoilers ahead if you don t want to know they uh they re proper buffs nerfs actually changing the behavior of the exotic though not drastically just making the exotics fit their role a bit better for example vesper of radius or whatever it s called now will periodically release a dmg in pvp arc pulse while the rift is active which is much better than before
they aren t they re pretty impactful changes
if the leaks are correct it s nothing to get excited about most nerfs and a few guns to test out
as someone who has seen the leaks a lot of people in this thread really need to learn that they shouldn t be treating leaked information like it is common knowledge not everyone is aware of the leaks and believe it or not some folks would rather stay that way even in those cases where someone is explicitly asking for the leaked information you should be marking it as such and spoiler tagging it on top of that it really isn t asking all that much it should just be common sense
just caught up on them you know as someone who has been glued to dawn chorus for a while i didn t actually think it needed any buffs but if what i read about them is true oh baby oh my baby
mechaneer s tricksleeves we added airborne effectiveness calling it now
i don t understand how people are still angry about the whisper thing it was just a change to an exotic listed along with changes to other exotics they didn t say they would be reworks or even major changes people just hyped themselves up based on nothing and then got mad that bungie didn t do the thing that existed only in their heads
i hope it isn t like they did last season that most of the buffs were pretty useless
remember their reasoning for not moving darci to secondary slot like everyone has been telling them to do for years their reasoning for not doing so get this was because there was already a lot of competition in the energy slot for snipers like if the legendary snipers the competition are a better option the the exotic sniper what fucking makes you think keeping it in the heavy slot will make it better
airborne effectiveness perks is such a l
despite nearly all of the titan exotics falling off in endgame content they only buffed and nerfed one
yeah i remember how no backup plans got airborne effectiveness as buff lol
burning steps is apparently getting a nerf won t stack with surge no titan exotic being allowed to boost damage is their plan going forward
airborne effectiveness perks is such a l
lol why are we nerfing dunemarchers
five for each class lmao that s optimistic not a single titan exotic will be touched
i literally could not care less about airborne effectiveness any more than i do now or have ever since it became some kind of weird issue because streamers got all sweaty about omg my bullets don t go exactly where they should when i m flying through the air shooting a weapon stfu and play the game bungie has better things they should be worrying about
they undid the whisper nerf it wasn t supposed to be a buff if you re not going to pay attention to the whole story and just the fun parts you should consider not posting
if leaks i read are to be trusted some changes are better than this and others are more of a side grade all i can say is as a warlock our meta picks aren t changing and one of our best and literally only pick for solar is getting shat on too side grades and down grades the stuff that is meme tier mostly continues to be so besides vesper of radius which could be interesting
we got stuff like ae added to whisper a heavy sniper rifle lol i know people like to meme on this but they also came out and said either via interview or twitter that they shouldn t have added it to the patch notes the intent of it was because of ae to make it so you don t have an accuracy penalty for being on uneven ground not as a buff it was a fix anyway that s just a small gripe of mine any time i see this meme away if it makes people feel better
no i don t think it will the ae change on whisper and darci was not meant to be in that twab a dev confirmed it publically on a firing line podcast so i think it ll be okay also that twab had some cool changes it was a bit overstated but it was cool tbh
meh from leaks i ve seen a fair amount of the changes coming are nerfs
worry not insignificant buffs will be joined by nerfs to all that s meta these days starfire star eater s synthos oh these already got nerfed
spoiler alert it s not
where are these leaks and wen should they go live
my permanent restoration2radiant build will have tommy s matchbook glued to it s hands
i just wish they would make the grenade kickstarts and other mods actually work on all grenades like grapple for instance on hunter with charges i d also like my dive that literally takes up my dodge to activate stuff that a dodge would cause as of now it doesn t and it blows
you d be surprised
changes have been leaked so no
if the leaks are true i m really upset about the nerf to burning steps its perk needs help not a nerf
you just know there will be point af nerfs also
hoping the astrocyte buff is what the leak says suppressing when you blink sounds like a lot of fun unless you come against it in pvp anyways
i saw a leak saying oathkeepers will buff the damage of bows the longer you draw them i m hoping this is real and you can run around doing charging shots like mega man
i think is time to sunset exotic armor and weapons and yes i know they are not sunsetting anything else but they think buffing so random exotic will make me drop one of the that are usable by hunter for example
they seem to be good there are leaks out there that go over it but that s all i m willing to say about leaks
just wait for the nerfs
i ve lost a all of faith in the armor balancing team what we need is at least buffs per class that makes some armor compete with stuff like curious starfire stareaters etc we need real competition between armor pieces that are attractive to use because of their power but in reality they will probably nerf the gold standard pieces and give very modest buffs reworks to other pieces the competition between pieces will be picking between mediocre pieces which isn t that exciting it s just so weird weapons have been allowed to get so powerful that things like voltshot and destabilizing rounds exist but bungie seems extremely reliant to allow exotic armor to fulfill many power fantasies
i just hope that leak list wasnt real its very disappointing especially the hunter category i like the athrys one and that s it i like the claws of ahamkara one too
who else is ready to have to use like verity s brow for a year with no ornament
according to leaks the buffs are legitimately sick as fuck
if you re interested in leaks check out bungieleaks on twitter they have some stuff on there about exotic armor buffs
make darci deal percentage damage like health on marked targets and that does mean of total health so while it will take shots to kill a redbar it will also take shots to kill oryx
hey that airborne effectiveness really matters when my gaze grabber can t do their job sarcasm
pretty sure all the buffs were leaked a youtuber put out a video of them
omfg it s finally happening for tracer is gonna get buffed please bungie give it a never ending target lock on top of it s damage buff
i m so lost as to why bungie pushes airborne effectiveness so much
if the leaks are to be believed i can assure you these buffs won t be just ae bonus
here s hoping actium war rig gets a buff to auto rifle damage by s
once i got a stat roll wings of sacred dawn with the exact stats that i wanted high discipline high res some recovery etc it felt so good yet so disappointing at the same time the exotic is trash unless you re a pro pvp player who knows how to float above doorways with this thing in pve it s useless unless you enjoy dying the second you enter marginally hard content they really gotta give these trash exotics some love in all types of content
i can assure you it s not
where did they mention this out of curiosity
i agree that i want substantial buffs but let s not pretend the additional ae on some exotics isn t useful
didn t they say what the buffs were i know the blinking warlock helmet is going to allow blinking further more often and will supress after blinking vesper of radius is going to release periodic pulses of damage while standing in a rift
if the leaks are true i ma become a eternal warrior main
this is the list https://twitter.com/bungie_leaks/status/1637247462321819650)
plottwist whisper gets another to ae
until we get to actually fly like ikora did in wq i don t care about how good my weapons are in the air when i m in the air times out of it s either to get away or progress faster i hated being in the air with that new exotic veist smg it just made me an easy target
are they buffs or reworks
who the fuck thought that removing the extended melee range from ophidian aspects was a good idea that s literally the entire exotic they may as well just remove them from the game entirely
as a hunter very underwhelming
lol the stompeez nerf
the list is out there
they got leaked and none of the changes seem interesting enough to make me use the exotics that got touched up
the leaked buffs are definitely not just lazy ae bonuses but i was extremely disappointed when i saw the leaks honestly nothing there as a hunter main is going to make it like having a new toy oathkeeper buff has the most potential but we still need to see the numbers and hopefully there will be another exotic armor pass because there s still a ton of worthless exotics even after this pass
idk maybe i m crazy but i noticed this when i was looking at crafting weapons go look how many perks you have available now that boost stability handling and reload vs the total number of perks out there that do or mitigate damage it makes me curious how many s h r things we need and how much they stack if any it feels like just fluff imo an easy way to inflate perk pools without having anything good the speedloader slacks are a good example why waste an exotic on something like that when theres half a dozen weapon perks that do it because they needed to add an exotic as a selling point inflate the loot pool but not something that they would have to actually manage there seems like nothing that this exotic does that isnt done better by something else am i missing something here is the increase in s h r really that valuable of a bonus
at least are going to get nothing but a small stat buff and increased ae
make stronghold work on the ruinous effigy orbs you cowards
crest of alpha lupi should also reload equipped weapon on barricade plus the usual heal
welcome brother
well done i am grinding ib this easter so i should look up the requirements to try and get it
well it was only in the game for like less than a year but still great job i don t have that yet this season
thanks
it s because the game doesn t really have any competition if another game like destiny comes out that is just as much fun but actually respects player s time you can bet that bungie will miraculously start to improve all the player retention pain points asap
i just stumbled on a vex incursion my first one and no one else was there to help with it until about half way through of us beat it with like seconds to spare got an exotic was a good time
lol you just proved bungie s strat works and why they don t need to change it they are stingy af on rewards but people like you and me still log in every day we re all clowns here while bungie swims in money
the first you ve seen you new to looter shooters or something an unrewarding endgame is like dev blunder for looter shooters
it s live service and relies heavily on consistent player retention unfortunately
bungie doesn t think about the game the way that we do and that s why these conversations will never do anything but make us more frustrated as a player you re driven by fun as a aaa studio bungie s big decisions are driven by player engagement and retention what we want from destiny is not the same sure there is overlap between these things and that s when the game is really good witch queen but there is not always overlap between fun and player engagement retention bungie has to keep the fun on a drip feed or else you might not play for xxx hours this year and bungie knows that players who play at least xxx hours are yy more likely to buy the next expansion and that s the shit that gets shareholders rock hard and rock hard shareholders keep the paychecks coming in
they have to balance the guy that plays hours a week with the guy that plays hours a day and will post negative opinions about having nothing to do once he s got everything
makes me wonder how people would feel if it worked more like raids dungeons where you do it once and get your reward and have no reason to go back and grind it afterwards outside of maybe spoils rep like if legendary lost sectors had this system instead ls available per day head arms leg chest first completion in each gives you an exotic drop just seems clear that they are wary of giving us anything when we are too good at racing through easy content if every activity in this bloated game felt rewarding to do at least once a day week then would that be a better route get players engaging with everything for guaranteed max rewards instead of grinding a strike ls nonstop for a chance at more rewards
sub stat armor from a master raid is a valid point i ll give you that
what other looter shooters have you played
this is just like every loot game ever there s always a grind to do the same activity to get what you want and more often than not you walk with nothing of value after multiple repeatable runs not to mention this is intentional if it was easier for players to get what they wanted the game would lose its main player base less than weeks into the new season
a master lost sector flawlessly should always reward an exotic especially considering the one you want with the stats you want are still two layers of rng
that s because it s mmo lite not a looter
my turn to do this post tomorrow
i ll give you master lost sectors and master dungeons being unrewarding but in what world are heroic strikes and heroic patrols endgame content
https://imgflip.com/gif/68eya6
genuinely curious say they start handing out whatever you want what will you do then personally i enjoy the game for the grinds trying to get all the red borders from raid raid exotics that kinda stuff if i d everything i wanted i wouldn t play much at all
you must not have played the division it s even worse over there because most of the loot sucks and exotics have less than a drop chance in most content
i mean lost sectors suck and have always sucked unless you are getting an exotic for the first time gm s give out a shit ton of loot especially on double reward weeks golf balls prisms and exotics plus any other guns you get for one run
jesus christ man a dreg can drop an exotic engram
bro i get do much stuff from this game
it s like the lottery you know some guy who knows a guy who got it so you reluctantly still login and try your luck even though the odds are slim and every lady luck hits you with a fat enough jolt of dopamine to keep you coming back like when i ve completed my single ever deep stone crypt completion and got my eyes of tomorrow which was cool at the time due to rarity but never actually useful oh btw since you re here check out our eververse offerings
most looter shooters dump a bunch of trash ok you and you weed through it to pick out the rare good things destiny used to do this as well all the blues we used to get but recently changed that to just giving us currencies directly the amount of good stuff you get isn t actually especially low it s just historically been very transparent about what drops are garbage and has recently trimmed most of that out while pushing a lot of rewards from dropping on completion to more deterministic things you focus at a vendor afterwards
you get guaranteed loot doing raids and dungeons that s the opposite of afraid if you actually engage with the game you re swimming in loot choices that your postmaster is always overflowing
it s not great but i still remember d1 hardly seeing purples purple engrams then turning to blue gear exotic engrams turning to purple gear tough times lol i do agree though took me games of gambit to get a single shit trust
because it s not a looter shooter it s a hybrid between an ls an mmo and an rpg and because it is not true to a single genre imo is the main reason why this subreddit is never happy
based take the loot was the fun we had along the way but actually
it s a looter shooter the game is rng
to play devil s advocate if flawlessing a master ls guaranteed exotics it would be insane it s already easy to farm ls except neomuna ones that are inherently a slog what needs to change is the base stat range where the minimum should be tbh you get vanguard engrams to focus for loot now and i guess that s just the gameplay change they did it s not like other seasons were better with the fucking perk pool weapons vex strike force for sure has increased spawn rates since the update it s not that hard to check neomuna if one is spawning however spawn rates get fucked if terminal is at the incursion zone and people are activating it just because you haven t seen it doesn t mean it doesn t exist lol it rotates between public events in my personal experience zc is the most consistent one heroic patrols valid it sucks armor drops in endgame content in general is absolutely trash i shared anything under of drops are under go figure as far as weapon drops and weapon rolls it s been better than ever tbh armor stats and exotic armor drops rates as well as exotic armor with high stats are what needs work i know ls seems to be something people are bitching about lately but a lot of them can be cleared in sub mins on master using strand so it would be pretty stupid to buff the drop rates even further on these if it had a chance to drop high stat armor it would be nice or weapons that are exclusively not craft able
it is possible that the developers may have intentionally made the endgame loot scarce in order to encourage players to continue playing and grinding for better gear this can be a common approach in looter shooter games as it helps to create a sense of progression and achievement when players finally do obtain the desired loot
idk my problem with destiny is there _too_ much loot from a single game of iron banner i got two of the same weapon different rolls and two averagely rolled armor pieces this stuff stacks up fills my character postmaster and vault and discourages me from playing becasue i ve just got to spend an hour dismantling all this shit
it s calculated for optimal player retention if everyone got everything they wanted in an hour of playtime then people would be complaining about nothing to do
i d like to see bungies stats on completed activities the landslide from normal activities to trials and master nightfall must be substantial enough for them to not really care about rates
i think it s very deliberately put together by people whos job it is to understand player retention metrics but also partially player feedback people asked begged posted every day about wanting grind reintroduced to the game over the years and that s what we got sometimes its going to be unrewarding because of the scale destiny has to work at content is both time consuming to make and burnt through very quickly raids and dungeons especially take months of work but are done in a matter of a couple hours on release the stinginess is built in to keep you coming back i think to some extent this is inherent to all loot based games
yet somehow i managed to replace all my armor last season with artifice armor i manage to walk away from trials flawless pool with rolls on adept weapons to sort out i have craftable raid guns countless ornaments and gm s that always drop weapons often exotics and usually have double loot weeks where my postmaster is literally overflowing x200b but yea no loot drops says everyone who s vault is perma cause apparently no loot drops
because theoretically it is possible to have the best items in the game and once that happens then there is no reason to play other than the weekly story mission in order have a loot centric game looter shooter last a long time you either need to make each season s loot better than the last or make it so hard to get loot in the first place you almost never have perfect rolls on everything therefore there is always something to grind for some people just play for fun but those aren t the ones spending money on microtransactions
your not playing the right activities nor keeping up with any news
ascendant alloy drops are garbage no other ways to get them this expansion apart from doing the weekly mission
agreed yesterday i spent around hours grinding for red borders and rank ups on neomuna and got nothing
i ve been trying for awhile now to understand exactly what changed destiny or me like i remember starting destiny and just replaying over and over to get specific loot and i ve done the same in destiny several times but now it seems like i just can t get into a grind rhythm any more i get home all excited to play i do three strikes and then i m done for 24hrs
and that s why i don t even bother doing legendary lost sectors sub min runs some mins didn t even get a lollipop
i don t personally need a destiny killer to stop playing i barely played last season and i ve already given up this seasons the last two or three seasons have been utterly demoralizing in the return on investment front for me i m old and disabled so yeah i m something of an outlier but my time still has value bungie values our time so little they didn t even bother making a fucking cohesive storyline let alone making it a full time job to get random loot drops they ve tipped over the line of layered rng for me what is the goddamned veil
you clowns keep playing the game and buying the expansions why the fuck would things change you re the problem alongside bungie
the loot pool in d2 has always been small compared to other loot based games while it has slightly improved over the years it s still extremely limited depending on the current meta there are only a dozen or so weapon perk combinations worth chasing in a given season but i feel like guardians can t be bothered to experiment or use anything off meta now that armor affinity is no longer a thing and artifice armor exists regular legendary armor is basically trash as soon as it drops unless it has a unique stat allocation or if you get lucky and get a drop on the front end i believe that guardians are showered with loot but in the aggregate of the drops in this game are trash as the game moves forward i don t think the quantity is the problem it s the quality not to mention that their should be more guaranteed ways to get the thing you want even the smaller easier activities regular lost sectors heroic public events high value targets and strike chest should all be a guaranteed legendary any activity that has a master difficulty level should reward artifice armor exotic armor stat allocation should be a minimum it should never be less than that unless you re pulling from collections finally bungie should introduce a new tier of loot should be between legendary and exotic that contain unique perks and set bonuses for armor pieces this could be a good replacement for strike specific loot and would help the population of the vanguard playlist also this new tier could be introduced in master level content and pvp complete with unique cosmetics destiny needs a loot refresh focused on quality
me and my buddy were talking about the new adept focusing he said that focusing was pretty much a pity system i replied you wouldn t need a pity system if you reward people properly i kinda believe the reward structure is based on the who will farm gms in sub mins runs and not the average player
i remember two seasons ago i went flawless in a lost sector on master and i didn t get anything not even glimmer or core or anything i couldn t believe it so i no longer try to go flawless or play lost sector on master
just wait til you touch pvp trials card with seven wins and a flawless in the 11th sickening airtight meta in a row wins miiight give you adepts i ll never telllll
you described getting actual loot multiple times i don t what issue you re having since most people don t have trouble getting loot fairly easily
jesus any of yall plays d1 this game positively showers you in loot by comparison if you get what you want from your first completion i promise you ll find the game boring fast
doing a heroic strike and somehow getting literally nothing from the chest heroic strikes aren t endgame content they are nowhere near endgame content they award blue weapons most of the time the real reason you do them is for the reputation gain or glimmer calling them endgame content is fucking absurd i m gonna be real here you really aren t saying anything here you are saying the names of activities and saying they aren t rewarding giving nothing of what more you d like to see while you are saying there is a disparity time investment and difficulty vs reward i hate to tell you but the game since they scaled back the difficulty again hasn t been all that difficult especially not with a subclass like strand still in it s release state we know they release things like these a little hotter than it should be and it shows on strand and every class having access to some sort of infinite suspension which makes lost sectors and dungeons that want you alive more than doing damage a cake walk difficulty was in a place to get us scaled forward rewards but now that they ve brought it back it s basically the same of what we had last season which really isn t much at all i agree with you on the case of lost sectors a tiny bit like larger material rewards feel like a good idea but like master dungeons red borders this especially because they ve said repeatedly at this point that the crafting weapons element is a long term aspiration and that they ll have stuff to support it better in the run up anything involving non material loot foci isn t at all a problem exotics have been the least rare they ve ever been weapons drop mindlessly i didn t have to focus a single thing form the seasonal stuff beyond the shotgun and the swords and i have most of their patterns we re showered in everything but real want or need
crazy how anytime there is a loot farm players absolutely flock to it loot drives engagement always has
how else do you keep ppl playin the base gameplay sucks now bc its so dirt ass easy hardly anywhere to show off build potential
yeah but have you considered that if you get something good then you might become less addicted to our game and stop playing a thing manipulative scumbags would say
you sound like an actual child crying in the department store because your mom won t give you the toy you want i have friends that started playing with lightfall release and i only started playing a few months before that and i m already in gear that i will likely wear for the next years if horizontal progression never changes my friends are close most of them have already managed to get their main stat to with resilience at they have most of the weapons they want to use for now
doing a master lost sector flawlessly and getting nothing for it but a few enhancement cores this one is the only one on this list thats actually wack but master lost secors have literally never been worth it so doing a heroic strike and somehow getting literally nothing from the chest i mean you re right that you shouldn t get nothing but getting a blue like you would have last year ain t much better you re literally doing the easiest version of that activity no duh it ain t rewarding haven t even seen vex strike force since this dlc dropped irrelevant to difficulty doing heroic patrols and not getting a red border in hours heroic patrols are braindead easy idk what you expect doing a master dungeon and getting one sub stat armor slot you get loot chests per dungeon idk wtf you re on about acting like you get a single drop from a master dungeon
i thought it was my week to make this post
some of yall never played runescape and it shows
this is not a looter shooter sorry to tell you guys this but it is borderlands is a looter shooter as when you open up a chest or kill a big boss you get a shower of items destiny you get items depending on the activity chest they are not afraid the game isn t designed that way
destiny isnt a shooter looter it s an mmo that functions exactly like every other mmo as far as drops go
nice attempt at karma farming by making a complain post with cherry picked examples if you re having trouble getting loot in this game it s a skill issue the activities you re talking about aren t even hard a solo master ls can be done in less than minutes and there s a chance of exotic drop maybe do activities that either guarantee loot or give out loot that s worth keeping dungeons give out way more loot than one sub stat armor slot strikes are not even worth doing if you want loot lost sectors should only be done to unlock exotics you don t have there are tons of activities that guarantee loot weekly pinnacles weekly powerfuls iron banner gives out a ton of loot equip the crucible ghost mod all dungeons give out a ton of loot all raids drop an insane amount of loot master nightfalls and upcoming gm s drop tons of loot ranking up vendors trials last week double rank up gambit this week double infamy tons of loot defiant engram drops like crazy you can focus and get whatever loot you want spend your time on activity that rewards you and you will be rewarded
ive done vex strike twice and both times on the final group of bosses my game crashes ive restored licenses and my ps5 still crashes if i use strand on endgame stuff or strand neptune
the fact i can t grind the master raid for adept weapons is absurd why only per week when i can hop into trials and grind as many adepts as i want at the very least make repeating the challenge keep dropping adepts and doing anything but the challenge encounter is a waste of time either make the armor artifice or make them drop random adepts
i really don t know what op and upvotes are expecting most of the loot that matters in the game is the most accessible it s ever been i can get godrolls for of the weapons in the games by just collecting red borders and now we can even focus which weapons you want from ritual activities leaving only world drops as complete rng outside of those being available from gunsmith in random rotation the only thing that isn t dropping reliably are high stat armor from master dungeons which i assume isn t intended since it was fine before this season and more consistent enhancement materials drops if you are wondering why the strike chests don t drop anything anymore is because you don t see blues anymore would you prefer they brought blues back or something lol edit btw hero strike bungie said themselves is entry level for brand new players that isn t anywhere near the higher end of endgame
that s the best part there is no loot
you can do master lost sectors in like minutes though right
disagree with you completely love the loot system new raid especially
the fact this game is still the number looters game out there proves its rewards system is far better than any other out there
sounds like a skill issue to me
it s because there isn t actually much loot in the game getting new armor sets for example is like pulling teeth they didn t even bother adding vanguard etc armor for the expansion for f sake directly making themselves liars from an earlier statement
they want the sandbox to be such that there are single builds that are objectively the best with nothing else capable of competing for some reason because of this it is possible to pretty much beat the loot element of the game in one day they need to be stingy or people will have nothing to grind for after hours obviously they could just make it so that more than one thing is viable at a time but i m not a game developer so i must be missing something
everytime i see these post they seem to be made without any thought into why the loot distribution is how it is destiny for starters is not a looter shooter destiny is a fps mmo and like other mmos it does not hand out gear for everything you do no matter how easy or hard the content you are doing is lost sectors while they are more of a challenge now only take about minutes depending on the sector in question as well as if you re on legend or master giving you an exotic every clear would just invalidate content after what hours of gameplay many content creators have done tests with 100s of clears and pre buff on the drop rates it was about in runs netted an exotic those are not bad odds however rng will do it s thing and sometimes you go on a streak that is not in sometimes you might get in there are plenty of videos you can find on youtube demonstrating this they ve also already said first accuisition of exotics will be moving back to vangard playlists in the future heroic strike if by that you re talking about hero nf then you re on the easiest difficulty for that content again handing out geart gear from this would invalidate higher difficulties if you do a master dungeon and got a single piece of armor then you got weapons for the rest of your loot that s just rng you will never not recieve a piece of gear from a dungeon raid boss for every extreme there s always someone on the other end of that i had pre lightfall and have since nearly gotten back to that with on my gear i don t no life destiny i have about active play hours and i don t have any issue with how loot is handled vex strike force spawn rate does need to be increased but that s a different thing entirely this is a game that needs to have a steady player count to be successful and if it was handing out loot like it was candy on halloween people who slowly stop playing much because they have nothing to hunt for there s very deliberate decisions made in terms of loot distribution to keep the playerbase active and engaged in all content to make sure people can get into fireteams to do the content they re interested in
they re the stingiest fucking people on earth with loot it s sickening they pile rng layers on top of each other and think giving out a low amount of loot is fine it s a ton of crap
compared to a million other games the randomization system is pretty ridiculous even a super farmy game like ffxii had better rare drop rates and gave you better ways to increase them through your own actions and that s not counting equipment stat and weapon perk rolls
the game has very limited endgame loot like if i can think what is the endgame loot in this game that will ascendant shards high armor stats rolls and maybe some exotic from raids and dungeons and tbh the moment that people will get this they will stop playing i guess that s why they don t want to give any loot because there are no loot lmao
all you have to do is become dedicated lobbyist aka streamer youtuber bungie will get to work on whatever you would like to change
they admitted that neomuna patrols events are insanely tuned up and doubled downed on keeping it there i feel bad for any new light players trying to just farm stuff there and getting floored
the most hardcore want a the best rewards tied to the highest difficulty b a reason to continue grinding that difficulty on a hardcore time budget and c the casuals who don t can t run that high difficulty to get much worse rewards the only solution to these goals is a very stingy reward economy for all the rest of us
i ve never even seen a heroic patrol
at this point i just log in and play with my friends for raids and dungeons or just to help out the clan cause i know bungie doesn t care about rewards their focused on padding out playtime for as long as they can and give you nothing for it
i dunno i ran heroic strikes today got plat in them and ended up with exotic armor drops not bad
well i just lfg d the nezarec fight as my first ron competition and got the shotgun so rn it s good for me
i think a popular theory is that this is one of the ways they try to get you to play longer to make the numbers look good for the higher ups
didn t they just say today that they re adjusting it again like they literally said vex incursions would give an unowned exotic amongst other changes y all fucking entitled i swear
the way this game works i don t think it makes economic sense to throw shitloads of stuff at you there s ways to target specific stats on armour and if you follow those rules you can end up with what you want quite easily thats the method to get geared you just need to sharpen your claws a little more
my favorite is when i m max on glimmer and chests unironicly just drop nothing because they were supposed to drop like 3k glimmer
honestly this is why i probably won t really ever get into another live service game i still go back to borderlands after years hundreds of playthroughs and thousands of hours because i can do the content i want to do at the pace i want to do it and it is infinitely replayable this drip feed stuff isn t working for me just give me stuff that i can really sink my teeth into and stop trying to get me with fomo
i get lots of loot from end game content what are you talking about i don t fully engage with the end game every season but on the seasons where i do get to the point of gm and master nightfalls master dungeons lost sectors etc i end up swimming in the rarest materials and tons of exotics i have a total dad gamer schedule i don t have nearly as much time to play as others and i have literally every exotic i ve ever wanted a handful don t interest me and i ve never bothered to get them and several full sets of master worked artifice armor i dunno what game you are playing
when you start to understand that every design decision in destiny is based around wasting as much time of the player they can without them quitting a lot of things start to fall in place
we need a live service borderlands game
i don t understand how you guys play this anymore this expansion has been awful qol is worse weapon rewards are worse same maps horrible balance i ve played for over years and this just isn t fun right now
i think you already pointed out the obvious spending time loot because if it does then they do not have player retention they want you to keep playing so it looks nice on their board meeting
just finished a raid and my reward for the final boss was a pair of boots which i already have at a total of base stat what a fucking insult to my time
i m not asking for diablo levels of loot showers but holy shit i do not understand why bungie is so fucking stingy on top of being ultra quick to patch anything fun that gives us an edge yet leaves issues that detriment us for months or years
i add for the consideration of no one in particular that the entire philosophy and ideology around which the destiny lore is based considers avarice and greed to be terrible and unworthy characteristics this is why they were tied so tightly to calus indeed at several points throughout its run bungie has had destiny npc s pointedly make fun of the guardian s willingness to engage in repetitive mindless tasks if it gives them something shiny or neon the underlying philosophy of destiny is however one that encourages balance deep thought hard work on a complex path and group commitment to the betterment of all thus it should surprise absolutely no one that bungie is stingy with rewards for people who spend hours and hours and hours alone grinding mindless tasks bungie in my experience locks the top level loot behind complex puzzles hidden quests and activities like raids which require a group to work as a collective why do you think i m still trying to solve the vault of glass eight years later that s where the really cool gun is p s as someone who largely plays as a lone wolf this is in fact painful for me i do not have many of the best weapons because of exactly what i am identifying here
the developers keep deleting portions of their game entire campaigns and destinations that peopled paid for leaving new players stranded seasons are all dumped when a new expansion drops players who missed them are lost they deleted the tangled shore recently for fun with bungie s fetish for removing stuff people paid for they re desperate to keep you playing what content remains if they just give you rewards easily you re less likely to keep playing
don t forget about iron banner you pretty much have to buy all your rewards from that turd fest i think in resets i got actual drops from matches autumn winds you say got of those
because the loot pool is astronomically small and the only thing that gives it any depth is the perk stat rolls and once you have a good one top or so you are pretty much done with that specific item forever if bungie was too generous with the drops people would instantly notice how abyssal the game is in terms of content
totally agree at least legend stuff didn t used to take as long now it s frustrating takes ages and rewards very little i can t believe this isn t mentioned in the feedback today
this is what happens when players cry about sun setting and removing power grind etc they need to get playtime hours up somehow
couple things it s not a looter shooter the gear available is incredibly shallow
i would say give them a chance of an ascendant shard but you cant get an exotic and an ascendant shard in the same run exotic ciphers definetly not
personally i d rather they give ascendant alloys they re such a pain in the ass to get right now
nah some runs can be mins long you run them for the chance of an exotic having a golf ball drop every run is too easy just level up and do them later when you can run them fast they re meant to be run later in the season even bungie has said this
eh no master lost sectors can be speedran in like min why would anybody run a master nightfall if you could get these mats in an easy lost sector
as someone who doesn t get to do a lot of end game stuff i d love to have another way to reliably get ascendant shards i ve got so many armor pieces stuck at energy it s crazy they ve gone this long without noticing this is a major problem for non lfg players
golf balls are easy to come by through master nightfalls too honestly probably a more efficient farm
and ciphers need to be increased to at least only having one at a time is pointless
ascendant shard already drops like candy in other activities so not sure about that i would not mind seeing exotic ciphers in ls though would at least give a reason to run them beyond exotics and would not leave players empty handed all the time
yeah i think they either need to do this or increase the cap on ascendant shards
i would be happier just with a higher drop chance
even better ascendant alloys
let s throw in some spoils too because why not s
i ve done master lost sectors and legendary and despite the drop rate changes i ve only gotten exotics that s quite strange
with exotic ciphers being used for focusing they need to add more ways of obtaining them
people that are running them in min are also already at shards
people who already have all the golf balls they ever need can run them in minutes people still trying to put together good builds need more sources and will take more time getting through master difficulty lost sectors
mins long if you re a good player let s be honest with all of the complaints about the difficulty of legend you really think the majority of the player base can confidently do master solo
unfortunately the response over and over seems to be suck it up and join an lfg
the game has always incentivized pushing players into the end game and into fireteam stuff at this point it is just the baseline expectation even though the game is super lopsided with rewards
they are going to next season
once you ve got some loadouts ascendant shard prisms shouldn t be that much of a problem when gm drop with double rewards farm them on gm and you got enough for a while i did so last season and i still got loads of shard and prisms
there are leaks that suggest that ciphers will drop weekly from the exotic mission rotator
i definitely agree with needing more sources of ciphers but lost sectors seem a bit too easily accessible for a resource like that
that s why it s called master
yes they should all the complaints about legend are from people who are light level trying to run them so obviously being light it s gonna be hard it s a solo endgame activity for the season if it s too hard right now level up then do them when you re higher light it s really that simple and if you re only within light levels of the activity and still can t do it solo then it s a skill issue
let s be honest with all of the complaints about the difficulty of legend they re not raising power next season and lost sectors don t have a power cap people are complaining they re too difficult because they re going in levels under they re not any harder in reality
i consider myself kind of bad at this game maybe i just have low confidence in myself and i can run certain masters i know well in mins others it was faster last season as they were even easier i m i actually not as bad at the game as i thought
if anyone could do it easily it wouldn t be master wouldn t it
master content shouldn t be easily accessible to the majority of the player base
thank god
what is with all these leaks i don t want to be bored of the changes they make before they even make them
not really bungie themselves refers to lost sectors are end game activites then it stands to reason it should give end game rewards
solo endgame activity that is also one of the only ways to get new exotics hmm im seeing an issue here
yes but what if i do not want to get better or engage with the game s system and would prefer to be handed loot have you considered this
the issue is that destiny isn t offering consistent avenues of progression if master shouldn t be accessible then apparently masterworking armor shouldn t be accessible either but the game encourages players to buildcraft in order to take on tougher challenges and part of buildcrafting is leveling armor so is master about heaping more rewards into the vaults of those players who already have all that gear or is it part of a natural progression path that any guardian can follow it seems neither bungie nor the community knows what the vision for difficulty is
you re not wrong i ve run a lot of hero nighfalls this week in lake of shadows just getting some ranks and have seen a lot of people struggling
yeah they are definitely endgame activities but given how short they are and easy if you have good light and gear it would be way too easy to stack tons of exotic ciphers unless they had a stupid low drop chance in which case people would only complain
next season you will be able to get new exotics from the vex strike public event on neomuna
oh good that s a very reliable way to get new exotics no it isn t
just moaning for the sake of moaning now
not really no the problem is the fact that most people haven t even seen that event i ve only seen it times since lightfall started and i tried a lot just sitting in that area in case it happens boring and stupid
they increased the spawn rate and i ve seen it a bunch actually so there will be two ways to get new exotics if that s not enough for you that s your problem
it has a chance to spawn at the minute marks and the best way to consistently get them is to be in a clan and have them call you in same as s ranks in ffxiv
yes and your anecdotal experience invalidates the experience others are having
a bunch in how long though
that s a terrible system you shouldn t have to server hop to find this event how many hours do you have to sit around as a solo player just to see this event i can t believe people think this will solve the exotics acquisition problem lol
so that your grind isn t too efficient for their liking to populate the pvp playlist outside of ib weeks
because they want you to also do vanguard and gambit during pvp events so they give you the carrot of double rank points
it used to be that during ib it was always double crucible rep bungie stopped doing it only last season for whatever reason
some bean counter looked at the numbers and realized that having for example double gambit rep during ib week did not severely if at all negatively affect ib player counts bungie is all about not having limited time events overlap they don t even overlap ib and trials so that players don t feel stretched between events and because when players get stretched between events player count in one of the events will suffer so the fact that they are continually ok since it s been happening for two seasons now with a non crucible double rep week overlapping with ib means that they realized this particular overlap doesn t have a significant negative affect i promise i m not this cynical in general but for this specific scenario you can t convince me it s not the case
i would grind ib if it was double ranks i don t want any of the guns enough to grind when it isn t 2x bungo
i chalked it up to the last two seasons having abnormal schedules mucking it up for everything else because i much prefer having double crucible rank on ib week so i can work on my reset then not having to micromanage the shit out of ib and vanguard or gambit especially gambit when it s still lackluster
forced engagement
more grinding gotta get those dogshit engagement metrics up by any dishonest method possible
so you play both
you d think with their focus on not splitting the player pool this would be something they d stop doing bungie goes against their own words so damn often
it used to be lined up but they moved ib off a week this season and did not correct the bonus rep
trials and ib each have their own reward structure and crucible gets to progress because of it in a way it s already a bonus if there were limited time vanguard and gambit events then it might warrant aligning bonuses
the ib grind is so unreasonable i havnt reset saladin twice yet i have earned and gilded my title though how was that faster
because not everyone like pvp is simple answer d
engagement
i really wish bungie would stop ignoring gambit it s a fun mode that just needs some tweaks they should aslo do some kind of iron banner style even for gambit make it fun again
pretty sure extra crucible ranks were a week or so ago
this sounds jaded but it makes sense from a game social economy management standpoint if you have a large event where everyone is encouraged to just group up on a single week a lot of people get burned out of that which is fine but also if you give massive exp boosts during this time you re removing people s reason to play those activities later in the season which creates an unnatural drought in the player counts we can joke lol engagement numbers investors board lol but the truth is that this is a real concern just to maintain a relatively consistent player pool in all activities across the season
jokes on them cause i still won t play pvp outside of the occasional pinnacle
they should just remove the gambit one at this point no point in trying to force people into a mode they won t support
coincidentally they also heavily nerfed crucible rep gains during the same period
there was an issue where they had to delay ib the double rep rotation has been off ever since and they have never bothered to correct it it seems like it s intentional at this point
i haven t even bothered for the pinnacle since beyond light i ll take missing out on a pinnacle or two a week to not deal with the bullshit of pvp
i ve played more gambit than ib this week not everyone hates gambit lol
i ll take gambit over pvp any day
seems like it s intentional it actually started before that delay so yeah it s intentional they just want people to play pvp outside of three weeks per season
this week should ve fixed that though i thought they said they were just flip flopping trials and ib earlier in the season and they were leaving this week s ib at its intended place that s why it feels like it s so soon after the last ib we had
ik not everyone hates gambit i ve tried myself to help get an answer about it s future but you should see how many people told me they wish it would die or be removed it be great if people would actually rally together to get an answer about the modes future
to extent same over trials for sure it s just frustrating seeing the mode get zero support yet bungie continues to try and get us to to play it
i m not referring to the ib delay last month there was another last year and it seems like that is when they got offset but i could also be mistaken either way it does not seem like they want them to line up any more
it does not seem like they want them to line up any more bingo they had the chance to line it up with a brand new season starting and it wasn t double pvp rep during the scheduled ib week so it s pretty clear
just make it a new grenade tbh no need for aspects or exotics new grenade
to have a void grav nade can imagine spamming it in pve as well
that feels like it would make a great exotic tbh maybe throw in some cooldown related stuff based on number of enemies booped caught in path
you can kinda do it with severence enclosure
it s called tractor cannon
would be a good candidate for a new void aspect for hunter they need something not related to invis maybe it augments void wall into the psion boop and does something about grenade energy when you weaken or kill weakened enemies the fragment that spawns a single orb when you precision kill a weakened enemy is okay but not great
could add it to warlock s chaos accelerant under void wall or spike
i m hootin and hollerin i m banging pots and pans around i love this
they won t do it because that requires making new animations for enemies flailing in the air
ptsd to the calus suck room
i d like it for raids when i m helping people learn mechanics sometimes shooting or getting to close to something starts the encounter so being able to ping it would be awesome for that inconvenience
great idea i d love it but bungie seems to be very adverse to enabling any form of communication or coordination outside of voice chat still waiting on bungie to make team text chat enabled by default that aside i dunno if bungie is even capable of designing and making a ping system in d2 given the spaghetti code in there
every game deserves apex legends ping system
i love the idea of a ping system for many reasons accessibility for the love of god montressor there s a few reasons i can think of why there s no focus on it for implementation a outside of go here shoot that heal me and thanks there s not much to ping ammo bricks engrams and glimmer are mostly your guardian only yes i know there are scout mods now but for a very long time there weren t brainstorming potential pings leaves me with maybe activate that or maybe super here as leftovers b three or four variations on there guardian and thanks guardian from nolan north would get real tiresome quick how many different ways can he say guardian down over the years c outside of raids and dungeons and maybe trials most content is very fast paced strikes gambit and crucible are all so quick that the engagement is over before you ve had a chance to direct traffic in raids and dungeons the intent is direct player to player communication on execution for the most part
would be great again just copy borderlands they have a great ping system that even has unique dialogue and tons of it
no joke i m so used to having a ping from other games that i try to ping in destiny all the time especially in pvp since i play a lot of cod
fucking please
i would love something like this so much i was playing overwatch a lot before lightfall dropped and when i came back i was missing that games ping system sooo much
i d like to see this as a feature if they ever make a destiny but i feel like it would be weird in destiny a lot of mechanic heavy encounters dungeons raids are fun because they require a good communication and establishing that with your fireteam is part of the fun just being able to ping stuff would probably make things a lot more artificial at the same time i can see the value as an accessibility feature for people who have trouble communicating all i know is this would be hell for me because i hate having a ping on the keyboard and all my mouse buttons including extras are used up and if i ever need to change anything after so much hours of gameplay my mind will collapse ahah
if you hold right trigger it pings what you re looking at has done since day
do we tho
in a blog a couple of months ago they had stated they planned on making team text enabled by default but then went back and edited the line to something else https://www.reddit.com/r/destinythegame/comments/1178k5x/did_bungie_walk_back_changing_text_chat_to_optout/ they changed to start we want to change our game wide text chat channels from opt in to opt out what this means is that more players will naturally be put into our text channels to eventually we want to change our game wide text chat channels
they re working on social systems but youre right they need to be much more open to the idea of letting people communicate in easier ways pinging an area or object would benefit everyone
i took like a good month break from destiny and was playing a lot of apex during this time when i came back for lightfall i tried using pings so many times lol

honestly this sounds more like a you problem lol overall a ping system would benefit greatly just thinking in terms of solo queuing into strikes nightfalls but even in comp trials players would be more aware if you could ping an area an enemy was spotted or something like that
why not
yea i m aware of the blog pretty underhanded of them to just ninja edit it so they have plausible deniability about whether the change will happen in lightfall at all it s already been several years and text chat is still barely usable outside of premade fireteams and they want to push it out further come on it s not hard to switch the toggle
i love apex but am tired of solo queueing really wish i had a crew to play with so i can get back into it haven t actually played in ages
well you talk about solo queuing but as i see it pve matchmade activities do not require coordination they re easy enough both in terms of mechanics and combat difficulty to not require a ping or any form of communication as evidenced by absolutely no one using the voice or text chat in game pvp activities i could see a ping being useful in competitive modes like trials but hey destiny never was and never will be pvp friendly the balance is constantly broken people complain all the time about everything matchmaking is drunk half the time so if bungie doesn t fix this i don t see them caring enough to implement a ping system something that s probably hard to pull off in a game that wasn t meant to have one that being said yes a ping system would be great as it would be in any online game i m only pointing out that adding a ping now in d2 doesn t really make a lot of sense and that s probably why bungie won t ever bother
iirc it was something about child privacy and was something epic almost got sued over for doing a similar thing i don t really remember all the details but i do understand if that s the case
yeah it and dreaming city were such good locations in forsaken i d rather have tangled shore back over neomuna
the zone was mid
i don t
yeah i was thinking about tangled shore the other day it was nice
i miss the tangled shore but i don t miss the people who used to speed through the prison escapee public events and jam you up before you could get them heroic
ehhhh disagree neomuna has so much more to than the shore but still it was a cool place
tangled shore may have looked nice but it was boring as shit had absolutely nothing to it except a funny lost sector and an annoying hive strike at least neomuna has partition terminal overload and vex strike force
my bygones rip brother i ll never dismantle you servant leader comes a close 2nd
malfeasance and hammerhead

forerunner might just be the nostalgia from growing up playing combat evolved though
precision frame bows especially if you can dial up their accuracy and aim assist they re so sticky it s insane
funnelweb is really satisfying for me

ace of spades obviously
seventh seraph officer s revolver and m5 wastelander honorable mention to the last word which deserves a catalyst
midnight coup handcannon from leviathan raid only handcannon at the time to roll with outlaw rampage had a nice vertical recoil direction at the time hand cannons could one shot most red bars and it felt so good to just pip heads with it with a mag masterwork you could have rounds in the mag ah the good old days
malfeasance or mythoclast there s something really satisfying about the way they fire
currently it s my main load out for anything besides the highest of end game content bastion way too fun and good feeling for it s own good trust rapid hit explosive i was a little disappointed i couldn t get my old roll but this is still great fun still feels amazing and is incredible for pve and decent for pve personally i like rapid hit as it is a fun little thing to build up too gun and run is also enjoyable crown splitter stronghold makes me enjoy life this build carries me through almost every pve content and pvp contents hopefully the hand cannon buffs will allow me some more leniency in the level of content this build works in id take this into any pvp content and i only feel limited in pve through champion synergies and i feel like bastion isn t a terrible choice since heavies are so powerful
it s gotta be the mechabre sniper rifle for me i can t believe they actually made a gundam themed sniper the sound it makes when you scope in is pure
submission i love the sights and how smooth it fires
scathelocke
fel taradiddle with archers tempo and successful warm up makes you feel like legolas and in momentum control guardians feel no different than thralls

sweet business
hung jury for me it has very little recoil and the range is amazing by far my favorite feeling scout rifle in the game
krait is really satisfying to me i somehow don t even have that good of a roll and i still default to it all the time battle scar with kinetic tremors is really nice too
tears of contrition gave me the nostalgia of y1 nameless midnight and well let s just say i am a happy camper

i miss my outlaw rampage duke thing was a beast also hush please bungo at least bring back archer s gambit
this is like the fifth time i see this question and i m gonna answer it as i always do ager s scepter the gun which makes you imagine you have a mega nerfed devour while playing on stasis against large groups of enemies xd
as far as the feeling of the gun glaives of any kind with impulse amp that sound upon firing and that thick thunk ish impact instant dopamine rush every time i lead a shot land it especially in pvp i feel like the best player to ever touch the game
outbreak for exotic legendary midnight coup give it back
traveler s chosen is a total blast for me
devil s ruin sidearms may be pretty bad but dr s laser perk is what sells it to me i m pve focused so i barely have to worry about the charge time much besides sometimes gambit the current season artifact means it can cover barrier and unstoppable champions it s generally decent at melting health infinite primary ammo and just one auto reload armor mod means i can stow it one second then laser again the next since all it needs is bullet plus the recoil is just the perfect manageable amount for me been running it in my titan void overshield build so i m a tanking unlimited laser beam
the last breath auto rifle from prophecy demo and osmosis make it such a versatile gun i knew when i heard about the reworks i was ready cause i knew osmosis would finally shine the gun itself feels like a laser i just wish it would hit harder
le monarque my beauty
ntte ticuu s hung jury
highly dependant on archetype i d say for bows i really like whistler s whim i ve got pretty much the definitive god roll elastic string fibreglass rapid hit kill clip accuracy mw for submachines i have been vouching for escape velocity for years somehow this gun just feels special especially since and i ve been telling this to people for a veeery long time it can still have zoom for sidearms i just love forerunner though i m probably not alone here i especially love it as a very reliably tool for basically any situation for handcannons to this day nothing feels like kindled orchid it was just perfection obviously the curated roll is nuts as anyone who had the plesure of owning still owns one will know but you have to remember that this weapon in general got fucked good roll rangefinder explosive paylod dropmag kill clip explosive paylod surrounded rampage man black armory weapons were on another lvl for pulserifles i ll have to give it to outbreak it just overall feels amazing though i feel like it could use a slight dmg buff for autorifles i d say something about chroma rush just hit different though it could have also just been because it looks so god damn cool d for shotguns historically speaking my olg quickdraw opening shot astral was simply the best i ever had it was and still is a max range astral though after all the nerfs i am currently leaning towards duality since it just offers the best of both worlds for fusionrifles vex might almost be considerable as it plays more like an auto rifle but it just still is so god damn good versatile if i had to choose a regular fusion that i would say feels the best i d go with trinary system it s insane for pvp with my roll smallbore projection fuse firmly planted tap the trigger stability mw while both firmly and tap are nerfed on fusions overall this thing is still a crazy stable laserbeam for grenadelaunchers single shot i ll have to actually go with the new kid on the block prodigal return with voltshot just feels so god damn good for gls heavy i m going with my copium canis major roll impulse amplifier vorpal max velocity spike nades it is a good general roll i just have so many better gls at this point in the game that i rarely use it though it still just by far feels the best to use for rocketlaunchers i love my old tomorrow s answer i have an impulse amplifier last impression adept roll and man this thing goes hard for machineguns i s a close one between hammerhead commemoration but i d say the enhanced perks just give commemoration the edge here for linear fusions i feel like vow just dropped the basically perfect linear on us cataclysmic is just straight up nutty and feels excellent to use and last but not least swords personally even though i mostly play hunter warlock the titan sword just hits different it feels just so heavy to use which is also reflected in how much dmg it deals though i ll give any eager edge sword a close second as i enjoy shatter well bubble skating too much xd though i wish i was just a little better at bubble skating or rather a little more consistent it is just so hard to properly hit
unforgiven easy
age old bond
haven t taken off my chroma rush much since splicer with the right rolls it just shreds adds and refills the mag along the way
cerberus
cyrothesia 77k sp is my current sleeper favorite i just got it and started a stasis lock build for it after getting the catalyst it has good ad clear potential and i love the freee shot never worry about champions again
servant leader i don t know why i love the gun so much
ace and last word used both since i got them back in forsaken
bad juju has kinda been doing it for me lately my all time favorite is invective chunk chunk chunck chunk
nameless midnight with explosive and triple tap
nothing really ever came close to me as forsaken era duke mk with outlaw rampage and maxed stability tapping red bar knights with 3x rampage was one of the most satisfying kills of the time
i just love the noise of chattering bone
graviton lance feels so good for pve seeing the orbs being created as you mow down enemies is so satisfying and dead man s tale for pvp feels solid at least to me i love that gun
duality first random drop exotic i got when i started playing super fun hip fire to ads gunplay just love an shot cylinder break action shotgun design
d f a is my favorite handcannon
chroma rush w rampage subsistence
such a sucker for aishas embrace man that thing just destroys in pvp
i love my deafening whisper just feels right to me
trust hc such a sexy feeling weapon
nights watch
steelfeather repeater
the sewing machine aka monte carlo the american express of melee builds don t leave home without it
cloudstrike
i just got collective obligation the other day and i am never taking it off i am so in love with everything about it for legendary i d say time worn spire year one lincoln green was my baby and tws has the same profile with better handling and stability
duke mk with rampage and outlaw hit like a truck and outlaw fixed the only drawback
the bxr battler is one of my favorite weapons it feels good hits hard and has a satisfying sound to it
gridskipper with killing wind and double fourth column multikill klip frenzy with a stability masterwork got back on destiny during splicer and wasn t really feeling pulse rifles at the time when i was rolling it so i just tossed a couple in the vault when anti barrier pulse became a de facto default artifact mod and i settled on maining voidwalker i pulled this bad boy out and cursed myself for sleeping on it so long this roll suffers in range a bit but the added stability keeps it so crisp up to the longer end of midrange my go to barrier weapon crucible primary and one of my top all time primaries
conditional finality doom music intensifies
after getting destroyed by jotunn a frustrating amount of times last week i grinded out xenology grabbed it from the kiosk and haven t taken it off since my apologies to anyone running ib this week
cloudstrike when you land that crispy lightning crack
posterity
i forgot the name but it s a sniper from neomuna i think starts with an i just love the sound it makes
lumina
something new idk what it is but it has the best feel for me by a good distance sadly 120s aren t very good rn
anything with a catalyst i need to progress in crucible
conditional finality and the bxr
i still like my piece of mind and cartesian coordinate
rufus s fury is a goddamn laser and so fun to use
i don t play a ton of crucible but i ve come back to my crafted piece of mind from last year enhanced perpetual enhanced moving target they nerfed the zoom on it a little but it s still a machine hoping to land that rangefinder headseeker roll on the new crucible rapid fire
i like high impact aggressive pulse rifles depending on bounties i ll run various elemental versions of them but i prefer disparity and my cqc shotgun the alternates are veles x void stars in shadow solar phillotactic spiral arc no time to explain kinetic revision zero kinetic when running energy pulse rifles i pair them with fractethyst
i ve been running crafted round robin with duality and it is unequivocally slapping
i m running the dad rifle build with an enhanced dynamic sway reduction tap the trigger ammit ar2 with ricochet rounds and small bore one of the most stable guns in the game so i don t miss too many shots i pair it with witherhoard and young ahamkara spine basically gives a ton of zone control with tripmines exploding knife and witherhoard pool get a lot of trade kills with the aoe spam and it helps contain where they can move during gun fights with the ar
crimson and beloved been my goto combo for years love my baby crimson have since y1
void hunter using autumn wind and shayura s it s fun for me at least
stay frosty and devil s ruin got me a solo flawless this weekend
i ve been using chroma rush and have been having the most fun i ve ever had in pvp
i m surprised i haven t seen more quicksilver it just feels so good
explosive personality and osteo striga i am a terrible person
i run phyllotactic spiral with imperial decree most of time
legal action and glacioclasm on shadebinder
i ve been fucking it up with quick silver storm not sure if it s meta tho
use my adept horrors least with zen kill clip that with an opening shot snapshot silicon neuroma that combo is clean if i get a close map i switch to imperial decree seems consistent enough
le monarque because im that persom
i use disparity and wizened rebuke most of the time disparity is probably still meta though it s one of the best pulse rifles in the game and easily my favorite
currently using the forerunner and the void rpm auto from curse of osiris
suros regime my first and only imtfy medal and the enyo d
quicksilver storm is a monster
i m a dirty tripmine yas hunter using the xur ingredient depends on my primary but lately it s been rufus fury and i get too many dms shit talking me about me being a bitch player
i m pretty comfortable with my mida summoner combo
wish ender void hunter wormhusk if i get the first shot eith wall hacks its easy and swap i can out ttk immortals if i miss then i can wormhusk away to safety and try again hopefully
bows my favorite at the moment is my crafted under your skin with reload speed masterwork elastic string fiberglass arrow shaft archer s tempo and successful warm up i ve been pairing it with conditional finality
hand cannon is still best to play sometimes with sniper and other time with shotgun much better to play this then some bs meta as immortal
i ve got a hung jury with no distractions box breathing that s pretty fun and just any grenade launcher you re comfortable running as a secondary it s been pretty solid so far
i m just leveling my rufus s fury but it starts with target lock at level one so it s pretty much meta lol i really just level my guns whenever i m playing banner
bow glaive or bow shotgun depending on if it s an energy bow sometimes witherhoard bow i have a hard time not running with a bow edit really digging my impulse amplifier imperial needle right now
not forgotten and adept astral horizon
syncopation ikelos smg has been my go to for a while syncopation is stupid good at long range nails headshots like crazy and the ikelos smg cleans up up close
yes by not running pvp
not sure how non meta this is but i run defiance of yasmin with no distractions opening shot ikelos smg with threat detector rangefinder gjallarhorn peacekeepers
wishender and a shot gun great in 3v3 if you can land shots
got a pretty good immortal that i think is fun but a hung jury and swift verdict w rangefinder slideshot is my go to
i like auto rifles mostly like perpetualis tigerspite chrysura melo age old bond the number
i was having a lot of fun with a target lock rufus s fury last time i did trials i was also playing as a threadling warlock consuming my grenade and then casting rift to send out threadlings around a corner got a kill more often than i didn t also big love to mida multitool and vision of confluence i ve been surprised that scouts are in an ok place in 6v6
depending on the map iv been picking away at the catalyst for mida multi tool and suros regime
deliverance and catana
drang allied demand and eos beloved cloudstrike depending on how much hand holding is going on in that particular match i ve had the most success with those two side arms dealing with immortals
i ve been just mucking around with combinations of sniper pulse so far the best one i ve used is a godrolled bite of the fox movingtarget snapshotsight and range mw and a demo killclip bxr pulse not having a shotgun for close quarters encounters sucks though but that s what my throwing knife and tripmine grenades are for i guess
i got really lucky with this but i like to use the vision burst sidearm with surplus ec on void or strand little to no recoil and it hits like a truck at close range kinetic slot i just use anything i feel like using
i m having so much fun with allied demand aisha s embrace and gally
raconture and edge of concurrance
devils ruin plus coldsnap nades it s just too funny
sidearm pulse rifle
i ve been have a great time success with the rat king and the 1000yrd stare
bxr and cryosthesia have been fun lately with the new titan helmet that or polaris lance and path of burning steps had a blast with that before the update to polaris and having a blast now
a disparity with desperado and ruinous effigy is a strangely fun and good combination i also get really gitty when turning a guardian into a ball and space jamming the enemy team
autoloading blinding gl paired with quicksilver i m surprisingly decent at special grenade launchers and would definitely be better off using a different launcher but i m working on the catalyst for quicksilver so whatever
osteo striga with a veles x for long range fun lady s choice for the accompanying power weapon roar of the bear has been working for me that blast radius is lethal
osteo bxr cause i m a horrible person forerunner ikelos smg and whatever the strand sniper is sunshot
it s still a smg but borrowed time and i swap between ragnhild and imperial decree as of late
autumn wind is still kinda meta but it s been a standout weapon for me that plus picking up duality again so i can be more aggressive and make some plays if my accuracy is on point
symmetry got my fastest we ran ever while using heatrises warlock lol
trinity ghoul
my favorite is sweet business war rig bastion rally barricade which equals a very fun pvp scorpion turret build
i rolled a great sacred providence ages ago and didn t know it was burst pulse needed a blast furnace replacement and i ve been using it since
joke s on you no one plays crucible with immortal
i just use my current pve loadout except i swap ammo finders for targeting mods because i don t give a shit about the meta
outbreak forbearance disparity the hero s burden sometimes i ll interchange forbearance with hero s burden
monte carlo found verdick and any lmg as a returning d1 vet it is a very familiar and nostalgic loadout
dead messenger with a hc then khepri s home strand titan
i use crimson not sure if it s meta
stuck in the past using hand cannon shotty been getting absolutely shit on but in those games where i do well it feels amazing as usual round robin crafted or rose and timelost found verdict
crimson and beloved
no time to explain felwinter s lie cry mutiny chaos reach warlock with getaway artist just got my first solo flawless in trials last weekend with this loadout
hc shotty til the day i die
i ve just started running yas build with ep fatebringer and explosive personality with aland disruption break and boy does it piss off immortal peacekeeper users hard counter
horror s least adept perpetual motion kill clip this thing is the most consistent weapon i ve ever used amazing stability great range spray and kill
divinity shreds
hero s burden with iron grip and fragile focus yes it is pretty close to meta but it can kill people here and there
went flawless with a funnelweb this past weekend pretty fun to use
the stag strand resilience rec discipline threading do more damage suspending burst on super using consuming grenade reloads weapons and improves handling autumn wind arrowhead high cal rangefinder headseeker range mw cloudstrike you can play somewhat aggressively with it it s just designed to rotate quickly and set up positioning to use the stags damage resist and large damage via threading and unravel to disincentives pushing and keeping others at range the rpm handles the s reasonably well outranging them by 5m with headseeker doing a lot of the work cloudstrike is because i just love that gun and have spent so much time with it and helps mitigate the stags downside ohko special weapons
lodbrok and a glaive
crafted syncopation with a iterative loop has been carrying me in iron banner
sad emote to victory
don t know if it s meta but adored sniper quicksilver storm or monte carlo
tommys matchbook got about kills on it and it competes pretty well against smgs i m a vet player btw top of overall kills in pvp with close to hours and i m not talking shit the thing slaps once you learn the hip fire and got a good strafe on you other than that ace is the bread and butter when i need to sweat trace rifles when i m feeling edgy
bow handcanon under your skin hawkmoon
devils ruin or final warning on dawnblade flying pew pew
i got a perpetual motion tap the trigger immortal from trials last weekend but before i got it i was using surplus frenzy extraordinary rendition with a genesis disruption break explosive personality and it kinda slaps without smgs it s coldheart with anything in kinetic slot and getaway artists to bully titans bunkering behind their barricades it s also just generally nice to use once you get the hang of it
bad juju and fugue
deliverance and polaris lance
witherhoard and funnel web sometimes a glaive
drang and whatever mid range weapon i wanna use mainly rufus fury or austringer
mos ultima ii
love my no time to explain
for a primary i really like either revision zero or quicksilver storm and then for my secondary i use gunnora s axe
my beloved toaster jotunn every map no regerts i may be trash but at least i always have ammo for my toaster
my autumn wind with heating up and rampage or my lodbrok c with fttm and target lock grinded for a whole week during season of plunder
huckleberry go brr
le monarque w quickswap to rose my rose has perpetual motion so by the time it s time to swap i m at handling i ll swap off le monarque and sub in a hipfire grip opening shot legendary bow with a freehand grip mod and go for hipfired headshots in casual pvp games
super good advice action war rig makes it fun to use
new purpose it s probably not as good as the messenger but i love the sights for it and w feeding frenzy and desperado it shreds
heritage and point of the stag
autumn wind with a firmly planted rangefinder main ingredient been having a great time
reckless endangerment ikelos or multimach without remorse have been the fun pvp loadouts for me this season the few times i have played
this means in pve a single grim harvest effected shuriken can freeze instantly given that freeze stuns two technically all three champions and hunters have access to two again technically three charges that sounds really powerful
interesting do you mean that the stasis shards created with every shuriken kill only spawn because i have grim harvest as one of my aspects i thought that they were created just for having stasis equipped as subclass
no i mean stasis shards are not tied to aspects or fragments they would just always come from shattered crystals or killed frozen targets no matter what
that was my understanding that stasis shards are not tied to aspects or fragments they are formed like you say if you get a shuriken kill then you get a shard if you defeat someone frozen then you get a shard i think they just already spawn the way you want no need for a specific aspect to be equipped
i don t think that was the question
op misunderstood you re only creating shards because you have the aspect equipped you can only create stasis shards with grim tectonic or glacial harvest aspects
now that i think about it it does seem to make more sense
yea i d love a spot to hand in the i have
complexity without depth i endorse this change
for literally all of the inventory items that are consumable this is how it goes i do my vanguard playlist for the week the last one drops a consumable i go crap i should have popped some of those then i forget they exist then i do the same thing after reset
bungie is going to come back and say you didn t say what kind of shard and turn them into a single legendary shard instead in all seriousness i d rather have the enhancement shard than get something that s disrespectful of my time at least let us stack a few of them
while they re at it they can take all the rainmakers out of my inventory i don t care just please get rid of them
that would be overdelivering
yeah i rather the boss the thing classifies just drops an enhancement core every time instead
or add chance for prisms and ascendant shards
how do people accrue so many of these i use them as i get them and have never had more than like three in my inventory
does anyone know why they have a second cooldown
or just give us the option to dismantle them or not put a timer on their use i have like rainmakers that i need gone damn it
i once had a pile of i just pop them in between activities when im in my menu anyways im down to
a shard there s a lot of variety there you want an ascendant one or a legendary one
i recently ran out of cores and was delighted to discover what the finest matterweaves in my inventory did buddy told me how to quickly redeem them on the moon and now i m down to with a healthy balance of cores
not a shard you get an enhancement core which is much better i use multiples during strikes etc
mods for the love of the traveler can we add this to bungie plz it s been years of this lol
bungie response we hear you and we re going to remove tangles from quicksilver storm
ps while at it could you also file my taxes bungie
remove the effect and change it to give you cores one time when you randomly get one and there s no reason not to make it stackable so maybe do that
bungie no fuck you next question
have of these i ll never ever ever ever use them
just pop one every time you have your inventory open or every time you go to orbit i ve never had more than of them in my inventory at a time cause i spend them the second i get them
i see so many people complain about matterweave it is so easy just to pop one everytime you see you picked one up i ve never had more that in a stack because i always check to use them
non sense we use it to get enhancement core the ghost has a mod to get enhancement core too i used a lot of enhancement core to craft weapons i need more sources of enhancement core where is double nightfall rewards
no those are load bearing matterweaves if you remove them the dreaming city stops existing and trying to load into it will result in your character being deleted
by remove you mean let us trade in existing matterweave for shards and then remove
at least let me pop the entire stack of matterweave at one time
it stacks at i am on my 3rd stack along with those glimmershitters i fear when i run out of room because these take up half my space
right i m gonna blow all your fucking minds do terminal overload and you will constantly need to pop them simply i blew the other day
someone commented below but i would compromise for rahool traiding in two matterweave for one core
or buff it so it s time based drop increase like the glimmer one
right they definitely should or have an exchange option to exchange so many for glimmer shards etc
they should leave it in and just have it drop for your fireteam too would be a nice way for people to help newer players get materials same with rainmaker if it doesn t already do that
just let us pop a stack at least and make it a passive stack able buff i have so many
or make a slot so i can put consumables rainmakers matterweaves etc that auto use when possible it s a pain to have to open the menu and consume a matterweave after each core drops
just needs to grant more than core when it activates so that they are actually special and not just an enhancement core with extra steps like cores normally with a small chance of an explosion of cores
i have over ain t no way i m getting through them all or even gonna put in the effort to
it d be nice if we could just convert them over
either that or better yet have it work like rainmaker have it last an hour or so
or at the very least can they auto activate while you have them in your inventory
we need to just be able to take these to one of the vendors and exchange them for cores one to one
or make them auto reapply
i will take a to conversion at rahool at a minimum if they don t just make it automatic or just remove it entirely
that or just have it auto apply the stacks in my inventory and glimmer one too so i dont have to go back in every 30s to reapply like make it easier to get shards i have maxed the other tier mats above it just shard deficient
make them worth and reward on completion of a raid boss dungeon boss legendary lost sector strike boss
i d love this change and i m probably one of a handful of people with zero in my inventory i get one i use one needlessly annoying system like in d1 when rahool would take your exotic engram and give you some crafting materials
i d be fine with how it currently is if they would allow toggling them as a stack so i wouldn t have to reapply them
finest matterweave has always been dismantling for a core with extra steps if they remove that extra step and just make it drop a core i don t think anyone could complain
what bungie can do is make them mass dismantle to shards based on the amount of matterweave we have
more than anything they probably can t without a small but code heavy change to do that or it may have been done already
the worst part is that if you have one active and it procs on a mini boss kill it doesn t just go to your inventory the shard falls on the ground
i agree thank you for making this post
but guardian it s fun but with extra steps
how are you even getting those i haven t had one in like months i m only getting the extra glimmer thing
i m the only one in my clan with matterweaves because i use the religiously but everyone else has a hundred what i want is to to make a dent in my rainmakers but even using one every time i play the number keeps going up
or just drop more cores
please just let us at least turn all our current ones into rahool for an enhancement core it can be i don t even care that this point it s such a chore to constantly go into your inventory and activate one then have to repeat that when a core drops so many potential cores just sitting there in my inventory but the process is so monotonous i just can t be bothered
yes who tf even uses that anymore
there should be new player features that disappear once you reach certain level in the game
i have like of them and i couldn t be bothered to keep using them
tbh i like the lil dopamine spurt from popping one before loading into something more than i d like more shards
datto wait hang on boys matterweave check
we all know logic had no place here
i have so many of them i don t even bother using them it makes no sense but i just can t be bothered
laughs hysterically in stack of matterweaves and cores
had once worked through a good few but still have and no more energy to farm that moon knight for the drops
just use them just use them
no you must spend hours spawning and killing the moon knights and getting matterweave every kills and waiting seconds between cooldowns for no reason until you have used the hundreds of matterweave you have saved up i have done this for cores and recently used them all up im now core poor because i refuse to do it again for the matterweave i have left fuck that
sweet
i have like
do yourself a favor if your like me an have endless prisms rank up all trash gear to then dismantle you get back double the cores you invested to upgrade you invest cores prism get cores in return again only if you have endless prisms
probably can t due to technical limitations
please i need this i have a stack and a half of these shits and im not gonna take the time to go through them x second use cooldown hours of waiting to use a matterweave
i gave up hope for this year s ago
let me answer this for you hey dude we did not answer other postings about the finest matterweave in the last couple of years a what do you think would our answe be if we dared to answer b why do you think will your posting be different than the before yours
or just let us consume them all at once and have them drop cores til it s spent
doing so would break the game in some way
no play longer bungie
yes please it s literally a waste of space i know you can pop one when you re in your inventory or do the failed moon chests but let s be real there s no real use for not having it be a core besides bullshit
i have
i d rather they replace it with a powerup that increases legendary shard drops for a limited amount of time
rainmaker is just as bad for me i made the mistake of playing a couple hours without using it as it dropped and now i have hundreds
i never use mine out of spite for this exact reason useless inventory consumables are so annoying after years of qol updates they get ignored every time
el oh el
i just play the game as if finest matterweave and rainmaker don t exist
some kind of toggle to automatically consume them would be great
i have like something prisms across all my characters but barely any cores and i d love to trade prisms for shards but maybe that s just me
should let us turn them in for higher tier materials like for a prism or something
they should just change it to be an increased chance of bosses dropping one over a four hour span similar to the glimmer one that d finally make them not worthless drops
this and don t even think of activating matterweave and rainmaker back to back only seconds apart
supra c8 m4 these are my feelings so that makes me right and you wrong
with uh some info that s out there seeming more and more likely this isn t going to be changed because there won t be a use for them in a few seasons
i only have left to use up i can usually do several in a single battleground if i remember to pop a new one each time i pick a shard up
i have in my inventory thats the worst chore in the history of this game to get through lol
oh shit that s what they do i should use those right away
i m ever gonna spend them all
sitting there that i don t ever think about
i don t think i have ever used any of the consumables i never remember that they exist and even if i used em i d wanna be super efficient
i just pop one whenever i see one in my inventory since they have no time limit after activation basically never end up with more than a couple lying around end of a session pop one anyway it ll still be active when you come back
banshees last perdition should be a solid pulse pvp roll if you are a newish account and not sure what to bring into iron banner this week rangefinder helps you win a duel and then kill clip helps keep the kills coming if this feels good then start looking for autumn wind drops while youre in crucible with rangefinder headseeker can also focus them with crucible engrams another easy pvp pulse to grab right now gl out there
that s a nice last perdition that banshee s got there
skydock lost sector niceeee
new prime gaming loot is out if you guys have your prime account linked to your steam etc account a gold red shader which looks kinda sweet is part of it i think there s an exotic emote i must have already had a ship and a ghost shell too
picked up the last perdition based on comments here and it feels really good resulted in my best iron banner match so far
easy lls today
a high reslience loreley will be mine
i should get the new hunter helm while it s this lost sector what build are y all running hunter on today
i have to say that arc surge has been the most fun normal mode bg yet arc punchy boy making orbs is hilariously fun
that last perdition tho now thats spicy
is throne world just not in the lost sector rotation anymore i need for of all things champion kills because i am very close to my gumshoe title which i slacked on all last year since lightfall came out i have been watching for a throne world lost sector and have not seen one and looking at a list of the rotation through may it doesn t look like i will was this announced anywhere
titan sword has a great roll hungry enduring jagged edge heavy guard relentless strikes whirlwind blade roll will change at pm pdt
is anyone else just randomly dying in ib i ve just been walking down a hallway by myself and just died to the architects never happened to me before but it s been five or six times since i got off work yesterday
damn i like that boudica c roll the gun itself is a personal fave
i just got foetracer drop how good is the damage buff really and around what does it kick in i m picturing it only being good to finish off bosses tbh
when is fathers sins in wellspring it s the last thing i need for the seal is it tomorrow or do i gotta wait days something tells me i just missed it
when is legs for lost sectors
does riptide still roll with chill clip and alh used all my engrams focusing them on my way to resetting crucible rank and didn t see either perk once
i currently play on xbox if i wanted to switch to pc do i need to buy all the expansions to use my weapons from those expansions for example do i need forsaken to use wishender since i already have the bow
random question does the vendor reset bonuses multiple perks apply to focused weapons in the legacy section i feel like it would since adepts from gms would get the bonus perks but i don t want to grind out resets to find out it doesn t
i don t think anyone needs to look for autumn wind lol
nice pve ammit roll too with dynamic sway reduction and incandescent
if this feels good then start looking for autumn wind drops while youre in crucible with rangefinder headseeker noob to ib and got my first autumn wind yesterday feels goooooooood
aaand it s gone it s now outlaw rampage
i have an old rangefinder kill clip roll that had drop mag it s a great option when i need a void pulse in pve although i haven t played with veles x much
rangefinder kill clip range mw spo long range scope also tactical mag pvp banger i d imagine
nice i ll go pick it up hopefully before pm est today
any tips
gyrfalcon s leviathan s breath unstop void shields veles x anti barrier repulsor brace void shields lingering dread pardon our dust disorienting
my gyrfalcon s build basically hasn t come off through lightfall wishender judgment of kelgorath demo incandescent and retrofit escapade fttc target lock energy would usually be hollow denial but for the ls i d run a glaive
void invis with 6th coyote for that extra invis dodge weapons will be outbreak for barriers glaive for unstoppables and your best void machine gun void shields
i got shinobu s vow last week and it s much better than i expected the grenade spam helped me a ton on my last few lls of yesterday
strand hunter with shack grenade wish ender you don t even need any other exotic but i ran 6th coyote for the extra suspend but honestly it s kind of overkill suspend the understoppables and nuked them and kill everyone else with a wish ender i used a shotgun to quickly kill the unstoppables so i could unload all my heavy into the boss
strand subclass shackle grenades warding isolation binding generation fragments outbreak pointed inquiry with fourth time s the charm and focus fury palmyra b with impulse amplifier and chill clip
when the weekly throne world story mission is one that starts in throne world patrol load it up on legend solo and just go to a lost sector there will be champs in it and they should count idk which one it is this week though
you probably had a streak going and didnt get a kill to restart timer welcome to eruption
slickdraw is handling fenzy gives handling and reload now so you all you are getting from slickdraw is a scaler and a reduction in aa
it s useless don t waste your time
actual garbage only activates at hp where it gets per hp under so hp would be a buff
yesterday unfortunately
tomorrow in the quarry
fyi if you save your engrams until you have multiple resets if you plan on playing that much each riptide you focus has the possibility to drop with more perks resets is the max benefit with up to perks in the 3rd and 4th columns i always save my engrams until later in the season for this reason they re not going anywhere lol
it does just gotta get lucky cause it has a massive perk pool
i burnt through probably engrams before i got a good one rank resets cause bonus perks to drop in 3rd and 4th column so it does technically get easier have to say gun is totally with it
there are perks in each column so you have only a chance i d consider any roll with chill clip close enough to the god roll to save my shards
any gear you and got you can keep using you d only need the expansions if you wanted to run content from those expansions like nightfalls or raids and you d need bl for stasis and lf for strand
i went from xbone to xbox series x and they made me rebuy all the dlc but any weapons i had in vault on characters i was able to keep
all those ships above the last city they re just shaxx s cargo haulers full of autumn winds
i had a postmaster full of like of them after an hour of ib lol all garbage rolls though of course
haven t had a single drop
man i thought i got a lot of riptide drops this season dang near has tripled that with autumn wind i got one the other day that has nasty rolls for pve and pvp and i m done except maybe or that i have in the vault already
i have this roll and it cooks almost anything you fire it at
considering the availability it s a must scoop for sure just missing accurized rounds
rangefinder plus base scope is nutty right
strand ostrigo glaive and lmg covers all bases
arbalest for barrier champs has worked well for me
strand subclass shackle grenades warding isolation binding generation fragments outbreak pointed inquiry with fourth time s the charm and focus fury palmyra b with impulse amplifier and chill clip the red bars are weak enough that you can use outbreak or pointed inquiry to stunlock them use the shackle grenade to sun the unstoppable at the beginning and use pointed inquiry to kill it and the redbars it s void so it ll match the surge for today and the shields throughout the ls don t jump all the way down the tube instead you should jump to one of the platforms inside the tube from there you can easily snipe the unstoppable psions and the rest of the red bars with the scout just be careful because the barrier champ can still get wreck you there bastard killed me twice in a row luckily after the second death he turned around so i was able to hit him from behind with outbreak once you get past the barrier champ the ls is easy just take your time and use the scout to break the void shields when you get to the boss room hide on the right side and slowly kill the enemies from a distance there s some scenery you can hide behind on that side do not go toward the chest until after you killed the unstoppable champion and all the red bars in the area as doing so will spawn the boss and it s much easier to 1v1
thanks for the tip
ah i didn t know frenzy made it that way in my head you d start out with slickdraw and then frenzy kicks in so you get a boost to start the fight and then stay strong with frenzy the game works differently in my head than on paper cheers
bruh days it is thanks anyways
sorry what about arms i just got a few expansions and those look like good exotics to farm for me
i went from xbone to series x and didnt have to re buy anything
impossible xbone and series x are both xbox all your purchases carry over that s be like saying i went from iphone to iphone and had to rebuy all my apps you most likely screwed up somewhere or started using a different account or something there are probably tens of thousands of players who upgraded to the new xbox if this really happened don t you think this would be all over the sub
even i as a happy autumn wind user would like to see something else drop from time to time
i run a crafted one with ambitious assassin and incandescent i think counterbalance puts it right at recoil absolutely love that gun drills heads in pvp and melts elites adds in pve it ll routinely get like rounds in the mag
49m of damage falloff is insane on a pulse pretty sure there s only one other pulse that i can t think of rn that can get that range and it only drops from dares
meter range before falloff yes nutty
strand ostrigo glaive and lmg covers all bases
wishender if you have it is also a
palmyra b with impulse amplifier and chill clip is this for champion stun
i just checked and you re in luck this week s mission should work just fine to do this
if you want fenzy the best pairing would be pugilist frenzy takes care of damage and reload so you might as well get ability energy out of kills with it
arms is the day after tomorrow at aphelions rest
i believe it might be sunday
seems i misremembered where i got certain weapons definitely carries over between console generations per bungies website though switching from xbox to pc would require repurchase
nice
jian such a good pulse my most use weapon you could get the same rangefinder roll you see here but with firmly planted up to stability
legal action ii kinetic world drop i want to say is another it gets 45m at base and can reach up to with full bore accurized and range mw it s pretty nutty
horrific recoil though
not gonna lie i really enjoy void but strand has been on since lf launch and hasn t come off yet
stunlocking the boss or releasing your rage on the barrier champ after it takes all your respawns from you
yeah i have a firmly planted roll on this weapon that is cake of course you have to get kill clip going
good to know thanks
nah i didn t know this until now thanks for the tip
as a fellow crayon enthusiast i can safely say that you just taught me something important
i realized this a week or two back on neptune i thought maybe it was common knowledge and i was the slow one idk pass the crayons
that s why when you re in a drake hold your melee button to load rockets that track highlight the thresher shots and release to take them all down while you pelt the thresher with shells
nice one i personally figured it out during arms dealer
and i shall forget it for at least another week so please remind me when i have to shoot threshers again
it was loosely tutorialized in the red war during the tank mission a tutorial pops to use the tank s homing missiles when you go up against some threshers and during that you should notice it locks on to their missiles but that campaign isn t in the game anymore
you guys got any burnt sienna left crayon eating but bougie
remind you of what
thats probably why there s a tank mission with threshers in lightfall
how do you calculate range in metres i wanna know how it stacks up compared to my godroll nightshade
how long do we have to buy it thanks for the update
can i buy it on any third party app i am not at home o o
probably using 3rd party like d2 foundry
you can use websites or you can just use darci with another person
d2gunsmith is your best bet
still there as of pm est
as an fyi gunsmith stopped being maintained months ago and the range calc is already invalid for at least a couple archetypes i strongly suggest using d2foundry gg https://d2foundry.gg) going forwards
gone now
ah i didn t know this thanks
for anyone interested d2foundry says it s damage falloff starts at meters
and that s how they keep you playing
agree and in the meantime prosperity mods for the core activities on your ghost more junk more shards
i think this is actually the season that has needed this the least defiant engrams drop so frequent you can easily farm them for legendary shards
i went from to shards in the span of witch queen
refresh chests at neomuna event run legends bgs and decrypt defiants are you burning through hundreds focusing at vendors
i just want a few more enhancement cores honestly shards for enhancement cores that isn t robbery would be nice shards too though prisms for shards or cores
defiant engrams are free shards doing the big bounty for dares will also give you loads of shards
right shit goes quick
i did last season for sure of course a bunch went to upgrade modules and master working new guns you can purchase trade for any other material in game except shards it s kind of annoying lol
yeah but only recently wasn t like that in shadowkeep and beyond light i basically build up 12k shards in seasons and then lost it in seasons
same here i focused way too much during witch queen when crafting came out i would change perks on guns before i realized what a dumb idea that was
i burned shards not realizing it while hunting an immortal like it happened so fast then i was like holy shit that was expensive to be fair with no pl increase next season of all drops will be sharded i hope to recoup that expense there
seems like prices were set with consistent players in mind people with stockpiles of currencies to burn thousands of legendary shards mats to trade for glimmer and enhancement cores which is at odds because those players are also the ones that probably already have their god rolled versions of the items that can be obtained from focusing i agree with you the prices and reward pools seem to have two different sets of players in mind
wym crucible focussing doesnt drop double perk choices after reset ive been rolling riptides for a minute and they definently have multiple option rolls
5k shards that s just irresponsible spending
you ve spent shards in just a few weeks what could you possibly be trying to focus and have not gotten the roll of not to mention how did you get that many engrams to focus
with the costs as they are you should be able to focus in on the 3rd 4th column perks similar to wrathborn hunts where you could reduce the possible perk combos burning through vendor engrams 1k shards and gif knows how much glimmer and not getting anywhere near what you wanted makes me not want to bother and just stick to crafted weapons did the same with about iron banner engrams to get a heroes burden with a certain roll i wanted sharded the lot so i ve binned off that chase as well now
i literally have no clue how you ve spent this much unless your lying i have rolled many focused weapons getting a good hothead or immortal resetting my vanguard trials reputation multiple times and i am not close to what you ve spent
this game literally has the worst economy it is balanced around the people that do nothing but play this game religiously with no let up it needs to have more realistic prices
focusing is supposed to be expensive it s only supposed to be used by people with the resources to burn it s literally an item sink i haven t focused anything since lf and i m doing fine with new loot
seems like you had a lot of resources and then used them
sure it s expensive if you want every single thing most people don t though
our resource economy is a little messed up right now and i think some tweaks are needed this is not the same thing as you being irresponsible with your currency
damn not a single kc immortal they were dropping like flies two weeks ago
maybe implement a lower floor cost with scaling increase to cost more based on how many times you focus something per daily weekly reset helps players with less time available and still satisfies the developer s drive to lower people s resource stashes
only going to get worse with armour focusing costs the economy in destiny has gotten weirder and weirder as time goes on
respectfully you have a spending problem i focus weapons pretty regularly and i ve been working on leveling my other two classes i ve been hunting a hothead riptide and some ib guns i craft new guns all the time my legendary shards have only gone up i think i started at about shards and today i m at thanks to lost sector changes i m also up like cores compared to before lightfall spending five thousand shards over the course of a couple weeks is fucking absurd
unrelated but i think the auto mod is a bit off in removing this post for being only about iron banner maybe one of the human mods can reverse it
price is fair imo
bad take guardian
then don t focus and go chase loot the old fashioned way these systems have done nothing but supplement the game nothing was taken away
if you blew 5k on weapon rolls that is not a game problem that d a you problem
eh i ve been playing consistently since season of plunder and have about 7k shards i ve been hoarding my shards for the old ib gear for cosmetic purposes i m missing sets and all of the sets will cost me 1k shards 200k glimmer and engrams with that said i really don t think it needs to be rebalanced also once you obtain them the costs cheapen
focusing should cost resources but not both an engram and shards it should be either or engram to reward recent playtime or shards to reward stockpiles
you should almost never trade mats for glimmer just equip a glimmer boost and chest finder and run a few laps
nope
think about it tho are regular players trying to get perfect stats on their exotics to make their builds better
people are either poor or they did the infinite shard macro way back there is no inbetween
for us broke bitches yes for the no lifers that afk farm shit nah
i think the shards are probably fine probably could be lowered to from tbh but the main issue imo is the amount of engrams i thought we d be seeing an increase in ways to earn engrams but its still only from rankups meaning acquiring all of the legacy armor pieces one mightve missed or started playing after is incredibly difficult engrams for an armor piece especially if you also want to focus a gun which i mean who doesnt lol we re all playing a looter shooter after all
there s such a disconnect in the community when it comes to legendary shards anyone who took part in that glitch back in may of last year have hundreds of thousands of shards and they have a disconnect of how expensive things are that use them decoding is like masterworking a weapon is per weapon need upgrade modules per rahool s special stock excluding enhancement cores are each eventually those that have hundreds of thousands will come back down to our level but until then there s going to be this rift bungie needs to revamp how shards are rewarded we need to be able to earn more by playing even casually and the currency system needs to let us trade currency backwards for legendary shards i ve got prisms that i can t do anything with cause i don t have the shards to use them in upgrades or weapon crafts
i disagree getting god rolls from playlist activities is not a good idea over getting them from endgame activities
i think legendary shards are the main issue
i would say i m a hardcore player when i am playing the game i take breaks for a few months at a time every year or so but when i m playing the game i m online for about hours after work and whenever i have free time on weekends youre not a hardcore player lol most people who play this game daily dont have an issue with the cost because they have over infused exotics in their vault just ready to become golfballs the cost isnt high its reasonable you just expect to have everything handed to you for almost free
it s for the players who get so many ascendant shards they use them on blues
yeah before i never dipped below 5k now i m about to go below 4k and i m very stingy
i got really lucky op on my third focus of immortal i got rangefinder kill clip and the thing slaps i m sorry about your bad luck though normally that s what happens to me too i just happened to get lucky this time
bigger annoyance is how the nightfall weapons cost engrams whereas the crucible ones cost seems like it s not even worth to grind strikes unless it s double vanguard exp
remember the first iron banner after the revamp where focussing cost shards a pop i reckon bungie just looked at the average currencies across the game and set it based on that which was also a way of saying fuck you to the people who used the shard exploit
it s very unlikely that i would use that maybe once to try it out but beyond that i ve got tons of rolls of most exotics i could use instead
i will agree resources could use some adjustments more in the ways to get them as opposed to resource cost reduction standpoint however your post reads as textbook example of the sunk cost fallacy escalation of commitment i can t comment on the rolls you re after if those were the rolls you wanted and like using then cool the immortal is pretty damn good overturned and the hero s burden does have some awesome pve potential i ve neither of them yet but the immortals reputation speaks for itself and the on paper poteniof heros seems solid enough worth focusing at least times each i ve doubts it sucks rng was not on your side as i feel you should have at least gotten a handful of solid rolls for each but you ve got to look at the objective loss here and realize you likely should ve disengaged at around shards hopefully your rng is better as time moves on don t get me wrong if that s how you want to spend your shards that s your business but even having that many shards to throw at focusing two weapons suggests you ve either been paying a long while or recently and often per your post it s likely a mixture of the two this is why when i go to a casino i only bring in cash as well as leave any methods of getting cash debit card and the likes at my house some miles 80km away
i m doing ok on legendary shards besides burning a ton on exalted adepts last season but that loop wasn t intended but enhancement cores get eaten up with crafting now that one feels too high i ended up switching my ghost from prisms to cores on random crucible precision kills to compensate plus dismantling old t10 armor now that i don t need so many fast swap sets and mw guns i no longer use managing to stay afloat around 1k but it s taken intentionality for a change
yup was literally not paying attention and had shards drop in half the past two weeks
just wait for the next shard glitch and macro 200k
you guys are getting hero s burden and immortal
i focused my trials and crucible engrams from the weekend and i m so broke now broker than i can ever remember
as someone with tens of thousands of legendary shards i agree let my big number get bigger but also let new players have a chance to work towards good weapons consistent focusing
i play a solid amount and i m always out of everything
yeah i would say i m pretty rich in materials in destiny because i have been playing for so long but i have some materials that i see plummeting and i just think i can t imagine what it s like for new players
generally speaking i agree and i think everyone saw this coming back when the focusing costs were previewed but of course bungie won t do anything about it now having said that i think the new exotic focusing actually is not that bad we need more uses for ascendant shards and exotic ciphers and in all honesty just about every other currency in the game so here s that solution
inflation so bad d2 economy effected blame corporate greed
unfortunately bungie will probably take this as more reason to cap materials and currencies in the future
they want players to work a ton for little value for trash weapons to feel valuable when you obtain them they dont it just feels like expensive trash that is just getting dismantled for shards again
i spend 2k cores trying to get the gl out of collections when it was bugged didnt get the godroll one so i made the crafteble one for alot less than that also went for the gambit void pulse and spent roughly 1k shards before i got the right roll i am a consistent player took a week break for the first time in ages have yet to get a good ib smg
thank god i used that glitch last year where you pulled blues from collections and traded glimmer for mats and then shards got like 60k overnight
i mean the mat cost are fine since they ve just been piling up in my inventory anyways but wartable engrams every day is insane especially since there s not even an upgrade to lower the cost
i think you need to get good
i m with you lol i have burned almost legendary shards on trying to get god rolled exalted truth immortal stars in shadow horrors least and a few more still don t have my god roll in any of them and i ve focused each dozens of times coming up to focuses on stars in shadow alone lol
honestly i m almost always at like legendary shards because i have to sell them for glimmer to get bounties it wasn t so bad previously when you got tons of destination materials in the season pass so you could hold onto glimmer that way but since they just give you straight glimmer and the limit is 250k it s really really limiting like right now i m stuck waiting to get enough legendary shards and glimmer to pull another exotic from the archive so i can get rid of my exotic cipher and take another quest from xur but it s proving to be very tedious alongside weapon crafting trying to get a wizened rebuke with offhand strike and all sorts of other stuff in the game
just wait till it takes ascendant shards to focus exotics
how about they retire lego shards and start a new currency so we aint all fucked
i had legendary shards to his season i have now lol
yes definitely more enhancement cores i m a pretty hardcore player do most raids on reset and nightfalls and such and i m struggling with enhancement cores just because i don t grind every season
i m down to under shards
sorry guys my fault i haven t found anything worth spending my legendary shards on goes back to using the same few weapons he has been for the past few years
extremely
i feel ya i have burned through so many resources lately riptide alh chill clip hero s burden feeding frenzy repulsor brace and now attempting the immortal rf tl roll no luck with the immortal curious what immortal roll were you after kill clip with what else
so the newest weapons don t get extra perk but the older ones do i m understanding it right i thought all weapons focused at vendor got extra perks with reset
focusing is intended to smooth rng not replace it entirely
i thought you could open up more perk slots for resetting vanguard vendor rep maybe i m misreading what you re saying but i agree the materials have been burned away rapidly this season buying upgrade modules has been the primary cause of me burning through legendary shards usually to guy glimmer to get them
the focusing costs from the seasonal vendor seems to have the absolute best balance most of them have no legendary shard cost and only eat up a couple thousand glimmer if we had one like that for every vendor and gatekeep the top end rewards only with limited resources like gms and trials are getting then we re gravy
they also need to provide protection for perks when you try to roll them no way should i get an adrenaline junkie roll of the time while getting no kill clip no way should i be getting harmony while getting zero destabilizing rounds i get that it makes it necessary to grind but wasting so much of the currencies i ve built up playing endgame content for years and years get burned for a singular gun roll is obnoxious and infuriating and i know its not even out yet but the new exotic focusing with precision focus seems a bit too expensive too using up of the currency you get in a season for a terrible overall stat roll or stat distribution would seem terrible while our subclasses get stronger let our guns and armor level in that playing field too

yeah i feel bad for new players legendary shards aren t exactly abundant and the cost for everything is ridiculous maybe they can make scaling costs based on how many of each currency you have idk but it needs to change
i used to be at a steady increase of shard every season before crafting existed got to 10k pre wtq and now barely get back up to 1k nowadays
engrams for a single defiant weapon was excessive but it honestly never was a problem for me since keys seem to drop from everything and defiant engrams are a dime a dozen i m only worried about the high ascendant shard cost for exotic decoding
agreed not so much engrams but everything else
i ve been suffocated by vendor prices since the start of lightfall i m constantly broke it s frustrating
you can still get double perks what do you mean please explain
i used to have 5k shards and just with the last two seasons i ve been burnt down to consistently whilst still trying to focus the exotic wall and whatever weapons i want i didn t even turn in my flawless card last weekend granted it was that bow but still just because of how fucking broke i am
the past seasons have caused me to go from around 6k legendary shards down to less than there needs to be other ways to get them
i had close to 11k shards at the beginning of the season and i m down to around now between focusing and buying upgrade modules that s a lot of shards to burn through and if i didn t already have a lot of shards i d be hurting for them now they could definitely lower the costs quite a bit
got lucky with focusing to get a heroes with frenzy and destabilizing rounds haven t touched trying to get the immortal focus yet i feel like bungie has been slowly setting us up to have less materials being needed or at least lessen the amount needed but the red flag of any game is when they have a large multitude of materials currency also the matter weaves and glimmer showers why not just allow us to use x amount per day to guarantee that item material
yeah while they re at it makes some changes to drop rates on hero difficulty i and i m sure many other players don t have the time to grind nightfalls for a single new drop the only time i ve seen a nightfall weapon drop was out of the season challenge actually running them gives me nothing yeah i could play on higher tiers but there s no match making and again time limitations keep me lfging a group i got enough time for nightfalls and i m lucky if i can do that across all character we should at least get a guaranteed nightfalls weapon for completing the weekly challenge
i m completely always out of shards or glimmer and i don t even focus that much be nice to get little bump to those for completing things like season stuff or strikes another help would be matterweave dropping the upgrade module instead of a core and also matterweave and the rain makers being used automatically or at least let me buy glimmer modules with rainmakers and matterweave directly
i mean legendary shards and i think glimmer isn t that bad i m poor as fuck in the shards and glimmer department and i can still afford to focus all the items i want
yeah the focusing costs are way too high they were set in mind to take from the people who have the problem is that doesn t work necessarily i play a hell of a lot and still have loads of currency materials but even i m feeling the costs are silly and then i ve got several friends who play more than me that don t care about the focusing at all and end up with even more materials because they don t care they re never going to solve the problem of veteran players having too many materials the focusing needs to have a price that s approachable for the time invested in getting these materials from a base of nothing instead of trying to milk players who have everything already
there s also just straight up no way to get legendary shards other than breaking down legendaries and i feel that is odd
with reduced numbers of planetary materials i ve noticed an ever present sensation of my guardian being about as broke as i am in real life this is not helping me with the escapism i was looking for
honestly for me it s just enhancement cores i can never seem to get a stockpile of enhancement cores
if you waste all your shards focusing on something and don t at one point realize you should just chill on that a bit you deserve it bungie isn t forcing you to do anything enticing you to run their hamster wheel yes but not forcing you there s always other options harsh but true i did this to myself seasons ago back before transmog and xur offering old armor where i was wasting thousands of shards at asher mir on io trying to get my hands on one specific piece of gensym knight armor just for a certain look i wanted the rolls were abysmal too but fashion i went from like shards to the mid hundreds and felt like an dumbass about it these days i always keep that in mind if i ve spent shards and didn t get what i want i chill it s no one s fault but my own if i spend all currency on things i don t really need in game and in life also shards are easy to come by it s just not in a way people want to hear play the activities use the ghost mod to get extra legendary drops at the end of activities dismantle everything you don t want hell mayhem is this week go nuts and get tons of purples to dismantle i went from shards last week to almost 10k doing lots of terminal overload and iron banner and dismantling everything anyway that takes actually playing the game instead of complaining and circle jerking so i ll just be quiet now and take my downvotes for suggesting such a crazy thing
yeah weapon focusing seems to have been designed with the purpose of draining the stockpiled resources of long time players and being borderline inaccessible to newer players
i started this season with around 5k in legendary shards through weapon focusing i am down to this seems ridiculous to me i dont even know how much glimmer i have lost but its a lot
always wondered how the several mat glitches from the past destroy the economy remember the time where everybody did the legendary shard glitch for a whole week d
it also feels worse that i just learned a couple days ago that resetting the crucible s rotating vendor reputation does not allow you to get more than one perk on the weapons just like the core playlist vendor focusing i ve reset my rank x this season and sometimes i get perks to pick from in one of the last two columns a few times i got sometimes its just one though but seems random
i ve always said it and will continue to say it mobile game economy
i dunno i ve always felt like focusing in nearly a meaningless task same with crafting by the time you farm out mats to purchase or patterns to extract i usually get a god roll anyway especially crafting i get the god roll then craft the gun and it ends up sitting in my vault cuz i don t wanna take the time to level it and waste mats cuz i ve already got the one i want it s like wtf lol big circular waste of time
i play hours on avg some days simply bc well i work from home i would also agree the glimmer cost is to high i simply don t do any activities to give me glimmer
if it helps hero s burden with destabilizing rounds isn t that good i have a hb with destabilizing rounds and feeding frenzy and it s not as good as my basic ass funnelweb also what i didn t know that happens once you reset your crucible rank who thought that was a good idea
funny i ve been hoarding engrams until i have a couple resets before focusing why the hell would focused weapons not have multiple perks glad i found out now at least
i don t think the costs are that high for the standard vendors seeing that you were rolling heroe s burden though means you were at saladin and he costs far more than the other standard vendors don t recall the legendary shard amounts but i know every pull is 20k glimmer so i definitely agree that this one is pretty steep i rolled about of them when he was here two weeks ago and was constantly going to rahool to get more glimmer
thrashers were one reason i kept using quicksilver even when the damage was bugged the bullets were crap but the grenades still worked juuuuuuust fine
bungie okay done adds crit spot to the roof
yea threshers are annoying i dislike that it restricts my loadout to deal with them quickly xenophage kills them in seconds meanwhile if i m less optimal it s multiple mags to kill it
neomuna patrol threshers are rockets a bit of primary damage to kill but yes i agree they have a turret that launches the homing missiles at us make that the crit spot hell let us destroy that thing like we can with harvesters and then they ll just sit there doing nothing i could see the engines being crits also like they are on the tanks just some way to make non explosive heavies effective against them
or just let me neuter it by shooting gun off i d get more satisfaction from it being a flyin paperweight
honestly just let us shoot the stupid gun off like the fallen s ship
shoot their turret if it s aimed at you you can also shoot the rockets that come out to hit you
the engine can t handle adding a crit spot
im new so i dont really know but does the hakke breach weapon perk actually make a difference against threshers
btw and i am sure more experienced players already known this you can shoot the threshers rockets i don t think they deal damage to the enemy itself but possible i didn t try but this way you can atleast survive much much longer
the biggest problem with threshers it that none of your perks abilites work off them you can t debuff them you can t buff from hitting them witherhoard doesn t even stick to them all of this is in contrast to cabal tanks interceptors where this shit does work if bungie want s them to be more present outside of when we have a tank then they need to start interacting with our kit more they don t have to have a crit spot but if i throw a solar knife at it and hit i should become radiant
shooting the engines on the sides or back does more damage just doesn t show an orange number they do have weak spots that take more damage from any method just not crit spots that tend to have different multipliers based on the weapon used
this is a great idea
i still shoot for thee d1 crit spot and how long has it been lol
the cockpit window should be a crit spot youre shooting at whoever is piloting it right
or just give a way to shoot the cannon off like we can with the fallen dropships
at least make it get hit by witherhoard and the osteo poison
wish ender chunks them down
or they could just make them level ornaments just disable em or at least have em fart out a loot package or chest lol
it s a dilemma there exist both tormentor and threshers if you choose rocket you will not be able to clear the tormentor room fast enough if you choose some critic focus weapons like linear fusion rifle you can t hurt the thresher at all another fact of the day bungie wants to teach us so lovely
pretty sure they are designed to counter precision weapon adding a crit goes against that design use rockets if you are having trouble
the crit spot is their turret maybe shoot that instead of letting it kill you
thrashers see fine just shoot the shoulders and then shoot the chest when it goes aggro it s not that bad
it s called shoot at the gun then you can both blow up the shots it fires at you while damaging it plus they re easy to eliminate if more than person is concentrating on it
i m okay with it not it makes rockets or haake weapons origin trait or vorpal all do more damage to vehicles kinda interesting
nope give them a small non crit spot
this is your friendly reminder that palmyra b does bonus dmg to threshers and actually shots them in neomuna patrol with el procced
the remade arms dealer strike really annoyed me the thresher was high enough that a lot of cover was pointless
and make missiles guide less make them faster but something you can evade easier
really it would just be nice if they were enemies they re more like vehicles that means that certain effects don t target them or interact with them even though it would make sense for them to like the turrets in last seasons exotic mission
if you shoot that little turret at the bottom where the missiles come from it doesn t pop it but it keeps any missiles from firing as long as you are firing on it
i m not dying to them anymore now just the interceptors one shotting me whenever i encounter them lmao
i think threshers should be able to be damaged by supers warlocks nova bomb goes right through it like it thinks it s casper or something
you can destroy the missiles it shoots i just shot the gun until it fires rockets and just keep shooting
here s a take shooting a missle when it s just been fired should damage the thresher with the explosion
in the nightfall i discovered that if you time it right and shoot the rockets as they come out that splash damage will hit the thresher
although not a legit crit spot no yellow damage numbers i aim at the gun fixed to the bottom of the thresher it destroys the mini rockets and causes damage
this is why my go to for threshers is either rocket launchers or machine guns
wishender wrecks them
if you hit threshers in the front or the sides i think it does more damage with a machine gun
the engines aren t a crit spot but you deal slightly more damage to them
if you shoot the wings with anarchy one on each side the beam between them will activate by passing through the ship and destroy it in seconds
the money paw curls we hear you loud and clear critical weak spot added to thresher s dorsal side
people lose their shit upon being told to actually shoot the things those same people sure as shit aren t going to shoot the crit on one they d rather complain in dtg and be the living embodiment of the self sabotaging bicycle meme
there is a counter to thrashers in game already it s called heavy grenade launchers which do 25x to vehicles and rocket launchers that do 7x to vehicles also the origin trait that boosts damage to vehicles in content that has champs you gear for the champs in content that has threatening vehicle enemies you use the weapons designed to take then down or you deal with the consequences of running whatever you want i for one do want a crit spot so i can run what i want but there is a way to counter them easily even in master level content people complain about wasting heavy ammo on them how is it a waste when they are a huge threat that s literally what heavy ammo is for taking out tanky threats and boss dps
make it so you can separately damage the turret
you do know you can just shoot the rockets out of the air then just unload on it
i swear i do more damage to the turret at the bottom of it i can t confirm this right now and i know there are no yellow crit numbers but i m convinced you do more damage to the turret
my favorite part of the new lake of shadows is sitting at the reservoir wall and shooting the threshers with primary weapons for minutes
in a master lake of shadows last night my cataclysmic nova bomb did 44k each quicksilver made in gl mode did 38k and additional small number
does it give grenades on hitting the thresher iirc most weapon perks dont work on threshers and interceptors
still will the grenade hits like a truck especially on vehicles
grand overture and chaos reach both are really good againt them too
hey i ve ridden threshers before so it s definitely accessible
there s already one on the roof it s designed for fourth horseman a tiny bit over mag and you re done
my biggest worry is endgame specifically grand master content having threshers in them with bungies new updates gonna take either minutes shooting a scout while hiding behind a wall or a fireteam shooting a total rockets every time they see one
the dumb thing is that the turret _can_ be targeted and destroyed it s just so damn beefy that it s easier to just kill the thresher than it is to destroy its launcher
all the spots you mention already look like crit spots any gamer will instinctively shoot the bright glowing parts like the engines or the turret that s shooting them they really should just be crit spots
they re awful in nightfalls wolfpacks don t track to them did lake of shadows on master and it took rockets and some primary to kill each and there s two of them probably safe to say it ll take once gms are out
pretty sure i aimed ghallahorn rockets and it still had over bar
the engines are the secret crit spot
somebody in this comment section mentioned that they can be destroyed but it takes so long that it is faster to just destroy the thresher
thresher begins accelerating toward the offending guardian for a kamikaze attack
yeah too much spaghetti code and would decrease engagement by so no go here s a thresher ghost shell for silver tho
i can t believe that we need to test if the bonus damage against vehicles trait works on this vehicle but i should go test that
i m surprised this comment is so far down the engines are the secret crit spot although it would be nice if we could shoot off the main gun to neuter it a little bit
til will try this out thank you although it s annoying how they back of threshers is usually a void turn back zone
lol ya i have no problem with bungie just deleting them out of the game probably the easiest solution
imo enemies shouldn t counter weapon types let people use what they want enemies countering strategies is cool like how gladiators get up in our face and counter that long range plinking style or enemies that try to flush you out from behind a barricade but don t make people s weapons useless it s just not fun
shooting the turret does not do critical damage they don t have a true crit spot
even if you match the light level of the current nightfall it takes rockets to kill a thresher otherwise you re just standing there taking primary special pot shots for actual minutes because of the reasons mentioned in the op rarely are the threshers in an area where you can shoot them uninterrupted either
you too can kill threshers in a patrol zone for only yes you re reading that right right half your heavy ammo in three easy payments of one rocket each you can destroy that thing that will just respawn again in the next terminal overload wave
this i m always baffled at how those things can turn on a dime and hit me from way behind cover
yeah the interceptors that come out during terminal overload are r o u g h friggin crack shots that can nuke me out of the air
they re just not very _fun_ enemies to fight many supers do nothing to them many weapon effects don t work on them cc does nothing to them their missiles have ridiculous tracking they can t be crit which severely limits the types of weapons effective against them even say wyverns which are dtg s other enemy to hate right now at least behave like normal enemies for mechanics like supers procs cc etc
nah you have to charge it with regular enemies but i usually save the grenades for high health stuff anyway or just use one to procc the unraveling rounds from the artifact perk and then switch back
does it give grenades on hitting the thresher iirc most weapon perks dont work on threshers and interceptors yeah fuck this in particular it s an enemy it is trying to kill me my weapon and abilities should interact with it as they do with every other enemy in the game this and taking about magazines of heavy to kill is just stupid
until they shoot you through themselves
doesn t neomuna patrol have higher health rates or something rn
yes i was running solo master yesterday just to check spawns and how it would play out on gm while talking to a friend i saw the tresher and my first reaction was tell him that we ll need at least person with rockets
they still only take about rockets on master level
wouldn t be worried about it because like all things in gm you can coordinate with your team to take them out in the most effective way it s not like in a gm you have people not talking to eachother plus bricks from beyond make heavy a joke to obtain again
if you re a real guardian you can jump onto their roof and empty a shotgun into them
it s just so damn beefy just like crow
they are not it s been tested to death and there is no crit spot on a thresher
they also respawn killing the gun is faster but after like seconds the gun rematerializes and when you re not paying attention launches rockets up your ass
cuz i have it on primary auto rifle and sidearm and it feels meh
this has been how i ve been shooting them down makes wish ender even more satisfying when i see three massive damage numbers as i line up a through and through shot from the engines into the fuselage
this is where i strongly disagree without enemies countering things people will only ever run whatever the best weapon is for everything right now you need to think about changing it up from time to time it s better game design
i am not looking forward to lake of shadows gm with those two threshers along the outside of the dam good thing aeons exists because it s probably going to take more than to take em down at gm difficulty
ahhhh i don t run nightfalls much my point was more of patrols and non gm type pve stuff i couldn t imagine the bs of dealing with those in strikes sorry my context of the situation was off
i mean in to you get enough heavy off crates that it s not a huge deal imo especially if you have more than people for the event which is admittedly rare lmao
yeah this is imo bigger issue than damage if they wouldn t have this ridiculous tracking the damage nerf wouldn t have been so necessary as you don t get hit by all rockets right away
you get a grenade every time the extra rocket hit something do you not or does it not proc the rocket lock grenade on treshers
if i had to guess it counts as a vehicle with no way to damage the pilot like how revenants work in halo
nonsense it s like riding a diarrheic camel
ya i m pretty sure everything on neuomuna has more health however light level disparity and its associated enemy damage resist is the issue in high level content there is a light level disparity in grand masters
not sure why you re downvoted it s true i ran a master arms dealer and two rockets took it down to less than health
it s probably just not gonna be super noticable with primary weapons either way threshers have so much health that even if hakke is working properly it ll take a lot of bullets to bring one down
or balance the game so there isn t a best weapon for everything to some degree i think that s already true and widely useful weapons like long range precision weapons still can be outcompeted sometimes but every weapon should have a niche and a playstyle forcing people to use things they don t enjoy isn t good game design and i hate when bungie does it i think instead of trying to counter meta weapons it s better to aim for more viability in more modes
finally holding more then one exotic cypher is pretty cool
elemental shards is back in a sense ik the chance will be low but stasis titan can spam crystals enough that it shouldn t be bad
shoot to loot can be used to loot orbs of power in addition to ammo boxes i wasn t a huge shoot to loot user before but this is amazing
elemental charges is going to be huge for revamping stasis
adding a new commendation best dressed this is actually an excellent addition
adding new exotic armor pieces to the vex event is a w though i m not convinced the event even exists i ve seen it once since launch
can t wait to use the exotic decoder and get a high stat exotic armor piece
the best part about this community is that you re not afraid to give us input this line is so funny to me such a great pr friendly way to say you guys sure do complain a lot huh
letting you keep your rank for display purposes the following season but still requiring a renewal is a smart adjustment removes the awkwardness of going up and down between ranks for active players but still requires staying up to date on the latest content to maintain
lost sectors aren t the only exotic source in town though in an upcoming update the vex strike force event in the vex incursion zone will drop a new piece of exotic armor if you have any left to collect on a knockout list with no slot limits like lost sectors have if you don t have any exotic armor left to collect it will drop a random exotic roll ok so good change here but will the increased spawn rate also mean we can reliably use this as an alternative i hope the event spawn increase is enough because right now the event is as rare as hen s teeth
so exotic drops from nightfalls vex incursions and lost sectors can t be focused it has to be an exotic engram that randomly drops in the world
exotic armor focusing sounds helpful i guess but organic exotic drops are pretty rare tbh
the memes about forever wasn t that it was too hard to get to it s that everyone was no matter if you ve been playing for years or started weeks ago
we need to see an increase to the limit on ascendant shards in our inventory with these exotic focusing changes raising the limit of ciphers from to is a great change but ultimately makes no sense when you keep the other material cost at a limit that prevents you from decoding more than exotics on one character
adding a new commendation best dressed let s gooooo
they can make the vex strikeforce event the most rewarding aspect of the game and it won t matter until it doesn t crash the game on ps5 if more than one person moves fast i ve engaged with the activity times and each time my game has crashed until that s fixed there is no point
ok correct me if i m wrong but exotic shards are the golf balls of which we can hold and those are fairly rare resources for casuals and middle ground players right
no mention of ritual playlist armor
everyone missing the part which says you can reset individual artifact mods
elemental charge looks like stasis builds are back on the menu boys
all i ll say about these changes is that if combining an exotic engram exotic cipher and three ascendant shards results in anything less than a spiky stat roll on the exact armor piece then that system fixes nothing lol
clearly gambit is getting its own reflection post right
exotic armor rework next season has me very excited
therefore it will have a higher cost one exotic engram three ascendant shards glimmer and one exotic cipher will the exotic armor we precision focus drop masterworked
the costs for focusing exotic armour is insane on top of that there s no mention of stats or stat totals if i get a stat roll exotic from focusing that s cool but if it s in stats i don t want then i just wasted a ton of mats this obviously isn t intended to really replace other sources of exotic farms i don t know when i d even spend the mats on this ciphers are very rare and don t come in bulk ascendant shards in large numbers are mostly out of reach for the average player like all new ideas i fully expect the costs to be dramatically reduced halfway into season
while it s still a little early to tell if vanguard scoring bonuses are tuned to our liking yet what have they even tried to achieve some of their own score goals add a throttle to prevent certain exploits as an optimal score strategy i mean i m pretty sure people don t want to sit there and revive chain but in order to get triumphs that bungie created it s sometime even beyond optimal and is just necessary
my issue with vex strike force is that for the two times i ve gotten it since lightfall launch the patrol zone is dead and inhave to try and solo it which isn t really feasible idk neomuna just feels like a lifeless planet
did anyone ever figure out what the vex strike event spawn times are
everything else good but no thanks i m not spending my golf balls that way lol
im really just excited to commend a guardian s clever use of the watermelon shader
the exotic armor focusing is a nice change but unless there s some degree of stat roll guarantee i can already see the backlash when people spend all those materials just to get a stat rolled exotic
ahhh the specific exotic armor focusing was nice up until needing an exotic cipher
it s actually funny bungie got our neomuna patrol is overtuned feedback and took multiple paragraphs to say no it s not fuck you
the exotic armor focusing cost is fucking absurd
u destiny2team what about artificer armor raid armor and ls armor dropping with sub stats is this intended or will it be fixed to its previous ghost focus thing
as someone who has a lot of ascendant shards i don t think i m ever going to use the first focusing option since it s still completely random what you get the second option with the cipher i can see myself using but ascendant shards and then potentially having to spend another to masterwork it that seems way too steep maybe consider changing the random focusing to use enhacement prisms instead and the more focused 2nd option shard
i m still laughing at the advanced exotic focusing cost it s ridiculous so much i ll never even bother using it
ascendant shards and a cipher to precision focus a piece of armor is fucking ridiculous edit i m all for a focus system to attempt to target farm exotics but unless the pieces you get are like this is still kind of whelming i would have preferred them just straight up introducing a new currency obtainable from l m lost sectors that you use to focus so you re getting the engram drops from whatever day it is you get the currency and you turn them in for focusing this allows solo players to effectively efficiently farm for things they want without having to jump into gms especially if they don t feel like they re ready or it would allow players to just farm when they want right now with this system if you already used your exotic ciphers from your season pass and let s be honest we all did it will take a fireteam of who are farming gms a minimum of gms you get bonus progress on xenology in a full fireteam to acquire one exotic cipher to focus one piece of armor one time a week with gms accessible in week there has to be a repeatable bounty quest to acquire ciphers for this system to have good longevity
no comment on acquisition of neomuna red borders that s pretty disappointing
so when are they going to acknowledge the fact that we were promised a new set of ritual playlist armor every year and didn t get one
so you can t use exotic engrams obtained from lost sectors nightfalls and vex strike force aka the main sources for exotic engrams for exotic focusing so we have to rely on what world drops for the chance to focus an exotic at a ridiculously expensive cost yeah no thanks bungie this is literally so disconnected from acquisition of exotics in this game
i m suprised reflecting on lightfall s launch only focused on how well the player numbers somwhow were oh bungie
the targeted exotic armor farm methods at rahool show bungie doesn t actually play the game a the cost is way too high b if i do decide to pay it out of times i m going to auto dismantle the exotic i get since the stats will roll too low sub or too evenly distributed or spike in stats i don t want like come on lol i could buy chest pieces and easily dismantle all of them with how rng works in the game if they could assure me that items would only drop and i had some way of influencing at least one stat i want i e resilience maybe it would be worth it but spending ascendant shards and an exotic cipher for a stat armor piece to in each stat evenly is laughable in addition with the season pass and one a week from xr you can only get or so exotic ciphers per season i can target farm times or so a season across all characters wtf is that
lmao still no mention of gambit just say you aren t supporting the mode
a whole lotta words on difficulty and none of them dare mention incoming damage tied to framerate
bungie has got to be smoking crack if they think i m spending gold balls to get a single exotic drop
this is great but one problem commendations are rarely given to deserving players they usually just go to random people because who watches other players mid game to decide who s best i don t
these are mostly really good changes thanks the exotic focusing cost is steep as hell though especially if you then have to spend another ascendant shards to masterwork the gear for that price there should be a stat floor with spikes determined by the ghost mods
unless we re guaranteed a roll for exotic focusing i m just not going to do it for ascendant shards especially when you consider that you need another to masterwork it if it s a good roll i already got the engram it shouldn t cost a shard for the basic focusing and it should be at most for the advanced feature is a nice idea but doa for me at those costs especially given that it s effectively limited to once a week with the cipher cost
oh this is a good article to see i like it when they share their thoughts and address our feedback
i ve had moron bosses give me insane requests before i feel bad for them having to pretend that guardian rank is a meaningful important system and also having to awkwardly lie that framerate boosted thresher damage existed because of uhhh all the tanks we get
so the exotic focusing changes sounds a lot like early crafting in that it sounds half baked and after a year of feedback it will get streamlined to be siimilar to adept weapon tokens
nothing on neomuna red borders having god awful rates even when you re doing things in the most methodical and efficient fashion come on man it shouldn t be possible to have nimbus to damn near rank and still have outstanding on a number of weapons and constantly getting dupes this is rivaling the mess of original wellspring throneworld weapon red boxes and exotic glaive pattern rates sure i can maybe entertain bungie s philosophy changes on crafting and wanting to put more meaning into things and all that but it makes very little sense whether you put in a ton of time in one session or spread out over a course of weeks and you still come up with jack squat i can t even imagine those specifically not doing things efficiently and just throwing it all to raw luck
sweet now i get to pay ascendant shards to be disappointed with an exotic roll that s worse than the one i already have s but for real though i may try this once and only once maybe per armor piece for the exotics i ve never gotten a good stat split on to begin with ascendant shards are already hard enough to keep stocked because i haven t done gm nightfalls in a year and have no desire to with the difficulty tuning as it is for the rest of the game
i feel like gabe from the office shut up about guardian ranks and commendations ya ll fucked up a really simple add on that other games have tried to tie it to other things in game and failed at that just fucking stop please spend your time with anything else but these two wastes of space
more feast or famine changes if you have tens of thousands of resources this basically does nothing to you if you re more casual you can go fuck yourself because the resource cost is so high
the seasonal model for this game has to be killing these guys
looks like season is the season to play with more of the qol changes we wanted
exotic focusing sounds great but two issues i potentially see high stat focusing wasn t specified so if we end up focusing stat exotics people sure will let you know about it bungie the cost to focus said exotics is absolutely too high being able to hold up to exotic ciphers will help but for the average player the cost is still waaaaay too high
shards cool a lot of glimmer eh alright but you had to bungie it by adding in a cipher ffs just let me focus my exotic for fucks sake bungie i will not stop playing once i get my perfect rolled exotic jesus so i guess for the future it s still gonna be a farm gms on double loot for me
bungie i love you guys but to me this reads more like giving yourselves a pat on the back than addressing player concerns the changes made in the last few weeks have been good but this post does little to address the current problems no mention of decoupling commendations from guardian rank which they absolutely need to be a clear misunderstanding of the meme of everyone being rank nobody was saying it was too hard to rank up aside from the stupid commendation requirement the ranks just disregarded every player s achievements by saying anyone who played the game for more than hours was an equal level i don t understand the argument about lost sectors being more approachable next season if there isn t a player power increase next season which you ve said there isn t then the people who are frustrated now about lost sectors being too demanding with too little reward aren t going to have any easier of a time either the difficulty needs to be tweaked or the rewards need to be massively increased piggybacking off the last point exotic farming is still awful even after increased vex strike force spawns and lost sector drop rates those buffs resulted in negligible change on the player side and if i m reading the bit about focusing correctly you ll only be able to do that with exotics that randomly drop in the wild which is a stupidly low chance nobody will be using the focusing between its ridiculous cost to do so and the fact that you can play dozens of hours without ever seeing a random exotic drop please just buff exotic drop chances across the board and more than just still not a single mention of gambit which we can only read to mean that the mode is dead as far as future development is concerned
this has to be the most tone deaf response going no talk of increasing rewards to balance increased difficulty no talk of gambit no talk of the issues with the story telling and poor characterisation legend and master difficulty basically are meant to be okay now sorry they are not not every activity should be gm light ffs
directly focus the exotic armor you want d therefore it will have a higher cost one exotic engram three ascendant shards glimmer and one exotic cipher d bungie is the lord of step forward and steps back
exotics are integral to builds unless the drop rates are a lot higher i really don t feel like this will address the issue at all
will shoot to loot proc the reload from reserves when shooting orbs though could be nasty
imagine spending shards just to get a roll lol some good stuff in here though
it s very poor qol and non sense to farm strand meditations to unlock the same fragment for each strand subclass
we want a better way to farm exotics and focus on the pieces we want cool you can now focus engrams that you have no way of farming for and then to focus it will cost you of the most expensive resources in the game an arbitrary bounty and glimmer cuz why not come on man i play this game a shit ton and i get maybe one exotic world drop per week and that shit better be a guaranteed stat roll otherwise i don t see any sane person partaking in this system
why are gms not going to be available at week also since they seem intent on keeping commendations tied to rank let me explain something they seem to be missing if you need commendations for some form of progression regardless of how meaningless that progression may be instead of being happy when they get a commendation users will be unhappy when they don t
lost sectors aren t the only exotic source in town though in an upcoming update the vex strike force event in the vex incursion zone will drop a new piece of exotic armor if you have any left to collect on a knockout list with no slot limits like lost sectors have if you don t have any exotic armor left to collect it will drop a random exotic roll this event is still too infrequent and too luck based for this to be the only way other than the rotating lost sectors to get new exotics the vague hint at another source later on is something but i feel like they re seriously downplaying how bad this set up is right now there needs to be a way t earn new exotics throughout the whole game pvp and gambit should have exotic sources even if very rare ones
bungie needs to talk about fixing vex strike force before even thinking about making it an event with any kind of importance attached to it it barely ever spawns never has other players around and pretty much always crashes not to mention it s just kind of a dumb and boring event with a ton of giant shielded minotaurs
therefore it will have a higher cost one exotic engram three ascendant shards glimmer and one exotic cipher i m sorry but this is just dumb assume i get an exotic piece with the stats i want that has now cost me x6 ascendant shards once i masterwork it looking forward to season when the cost is reduced
yeah yeah yeah another self made analysis where bungie pats themselves on the back about how great they did while failing to address any actual negative player feedback this is just tone deaf pr garbage bungie we investigated the complaints about ourselves and found that not only did we do nothing wrong we also did better than ever before case closed
over the last few years the team has set a high bar for what to expect from destiny s evolving world and we re committed to making sure the resolution of our first saga lives up to that legacy no no you haven t what you ve done is get substantially worse at maintaining your game ignored your own statements on sunsetting adding pvp maps etc created boring seasonal content loops destroyed any semblance of balance in your sandbox ignored extreme outliers and overhyped an expansion that you ve congratulated yourself on multiple times but is arguably one of the worst in the franchise s history every patch both fails to fix some of the things said to be fixed and introduces new things that are broken you admitted to knowing the launchers in ron weren t working as intended and not only launched it anyways but joked about it you blamed well of radiance which has destroyed the balance in the entire game and you ve backed yourself into a corner with it for shitty design on nezarec every blog or twab is just this incoherent mess that promises something you either don t deliver on or walk back a month or so later you ve benefited greatly from no one else playing in your sandbox but at some point the self congratulating needs to stop and actual change needs to happen if gaining more players with this faux f2p strategy and catering more to casuals is where you want to go i m sure you ll be fine there s no one else creating in this space right now but if you want the game to actually be good and recapture some of the magic from what seems like ages ago you ve got a lot of work to do edit oh and i would be remiss if i didn t mention gambit looks like i forgot it existed just like you have
once again they intentionally misinterpret our feedback and monkey s paw the rest nobody had a problem with guardian ranks taking too long to level up it was that a player who s played hours and one who s played a thousand all start at and as a whole the game poorly reflects actual mastery of content with the current rank objectives funny how there s also no mention of the playlist ritual set they promised we d get annually the framerate bugs gambit or the plethora of issues with neomuna deepsight i knew they wouldn t touch on the story because it isn t like they re gonna come out and admit what we already know but this post is overall still wildly disappointing
i m glad they took their time gathered feedback and are giving us tangible solutions for this season and next season it s fantastic to see personally i m really excited for the exotic armor focusing changes it finally feels like we have a use for shard cipher drops after building our armor sets sure it s expensive but bypassing the grind and getting exactly what you want should be expensive i hope we get some new avenues for ciphers in the future though so we can focus more often
ionic traces stasis shards void breaches has an escalating chance to grant you a stack of armor charge don t get me wrong this is better than nothing but making it a chance screams pvp nerf to me a cooldown would have been enough in pve and not make your build work off of a slot machine
i don t understand the point of the focusing methodology we already had a perfect system in d1 s glass needles we ve been asking for that system to be brought forward for years now and it s like bungie is trying to do everything they can _not_ to bring it back if we can t have the glass needles method back can we at least be given an official reason why
well that was delusional and borderline insulting once most of the player base completes their yearly power climb we will again re evaluate completion times and rates for rewards now back into the skinner box you rats
the vex strike force event in the vex incursion zone will drop a new piece of exotic armor if you have any left to collect that s great but correct me if i am wrong i am still finishing the campaign isn t that event super rare as it is
nothing on gambit what s going on over there
the design philosophy for neomuna patrol is just disconnected from everything else the game has to offer it s plain stupid red bars take more ammo to kill than contest raid red bars and it s harder to melt the public event bosses than it is to one phase oryx it s just a joke overall
we re pretty satisfied with how it plays after nerfing threshers how it encourages teamplay and buildcrafting in ways patrol zones typically do not and how it specifically allows many builds to shine i have nothing to say other than i vehemently disagree with this neomuna patrol is just blanketly unfun no it doesn t feel dangerous like a city under siege by powerful enemy forces it s just a tedious slog where everything takes nearly a whole mag to kill im spending more time dead than alive when facing anything more that enemies at time and hvts have such ridiculous health bars and drop such measly rewards that even i did spend all my heavy and special ammo to take 3rds of its health it not worth spending the next mins plinking at it with a worthless primary to get the measly sum of glimmer and a blue that comes out of its dropped chest it encourages teamplay and buildcrafting i cant believe destiny is in its 9th year as a franchise and the dev team still believes there s any teamplay with blueberries in the public space did the terrible matchmaking from escalation protocol not show this or the terrible public matchmaking of the worthy seasonal event not show this has there ever been any evidence to show the community cares at all about working together to accomplish activities together in a public space i ve never seen it how many times does the community have to beg that patrol activities that require multiple people just be matchmade to avoid all this like you had the perfect solution in season of the haunted its had a patrol join or a mm option until things are changed i m just not going to go to the neomuna patrol i don t care about crafting the weapons and i certainly don t care about chasing a random roll from weapons that i can t even craft because for some reason those weapons arent craftable when the rest fo the set is
unlock exotics from lost sectors put them in the general loot pool make drops from lost sectors high stat exotics your threshers still suck on this week s nf you can be down the first set of stairs with stairs and rubble in front of you the thresher fires a missile that impacts the other side of the rubble and you re still getting considerable damage threshers still too tanky give me a crit spot it s not challenging when i m on a timer to sit there and just shoot from cover for the better part of a minute i m either wasting heavy ammo early on to accelerate progress against timer or i m wasting them on a thresher option b give me a lot more points for taking out a thresher exotic tokens from ls after runs i have enough to get a piece that s the same as a drop rate i can get a drop instead of a token and it s going to be high stat high stat is nothing is worse than running a few ls to get a sub piece of gear that s just a spike to the face xbl lfg is such a pain game invites going to pc only party invites going to both the virtual keyboard functionality type on pc reflects on xbox is gone please implement a decent lfg either sooner or allow all content to be match made you have them for every group activity except higher tier content why i can drop into gambit solo or into the teams matchup this wasn t as much of an issue until msft ravamped their xbox companion apps and game bar into utter shit for games that require groups if you re going to force me to lfg fine at least implement a decent matchmaking or lfg system i honestly want to watch a cc do lfg on xbox because either i m dumber than a bag of doorknobs or it really is a terrific pain in the ass have you tried typing join uwu bradley on a virtual keyboard yeah no thanks
with lightfall s launch destiny saw its highest number of concurrent players in years lmao same thing happened with wow shadowlands where is it now
vanguard scoring and reputation add a throttle to prevent certain exploits as an optimal score strategy this article literally came out in the past hour and the part regarding vanguard rep and scoring has aged very poorly yes it s aged poorly and it s been out less an hour the problems with scoring are beyond rez farming as there are multiple posts regarding the new master los on the front page including but not limited to you physically cannot reach 200k in master this week don t waste your time https://www.reddit.com/r/destinythegame/comments/12c57ek/you_physically_cannot_reach_200k_in_master/) this article could do less with the we reckon we created series of problems we re going to pat ourselves on the back for being the problem and the solution why even try to respond to feedback if you re going to instantly deflect any of it with well we already fixed it by doing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ don t get me wrong there are parts where you say that there are more changes coming but especially in the guardian ranks and difficulty tuning sections the emphasis on we already did _ _ _ _ _ _ is drowning everything else out i personally do a service for my clan where i summarize the official bungie comms like this and half my summary on these parts sound like i m just going to be repeating previous summaries from twabs and patch notes edit cool i guess on neomuna patrol but really who cares you re never going to see me say aaaay i solo flawlessed a patrol heroic public event unless i m saying it on r destinycirclejerk i m just not following the train of thought on patrol difficulty it s not a raid it s not a nightfall or a dungeon difficulty in this area feels like a moot point lost sectors see this is another instance of stop patting yourselves on the back for both creating and fixing the problem people have been testing these new and improved drop rates and the feedback sounds like whatever the drop rate increase was it s pretty negligible so with that said nothing changes for exotic farming engram focusing you already told us the monkey s paw all exotic engrams aside from drops from activities that award exotics i e lost sectors vex strike force nightfalls so in the context of oh no i did runs of the legend master lost sector and all i got was a roll of nothing manacles with high strength effectively nothing has changed the only engrams subject to the system are the ones that drop super infrequently randomly in the world so just like lost sectors nothing changes edit i would like to revisit and reiterate on my thoughts about neomuna patrol i think it could be harder i think the best thing is to simply nullify the concept of overleveling retune the baseline to compensate globally and to call it a day but we wanted to make it always feel dangerous everything in that sentence is silly it s literally patrol there s nothing to hype up some positive thoughts to offset some of my negativity here lightfall s ost even debuted as the soundtrack on itunes art design music teams etc you knock it out of the park every time no if s and s or but s end of discussion when all else fails this is destiny s greatest asset keep it up as we approach fts
i was happy and hopeful to see them acknowledge some of the game s top issues guardian ranks commendations rewards how we acquire exotics etc there are other issues of course but this was a nice start and then i read the proposed solutions and i am simply disappointed i simply can t get behind their thought process commendations why not remove then entirely from the guardian ranks system from any sort of progression for that matter although the amount of commendations required per rank up was part of the issue the real issue is that they are tied to progression period remove them acquiring exotics first off i don t know by how much they buffed the drop rates on master lost sectors but it does not feel like anything changed secondly to focus one piece of armor i would need to first acquire an exotic engram which does not happen often and then spend ascendant shards are they out of their minds they dedicate an entire new system to be used on engrams which drop once every weeks so once every weeks assuming i m farming gms for ascendant shards i ll have a chance of getting the stats i want on an exotic i just don t know what to say it feels obvious they want to keep us playing their game but if not getting the gear we want to get is their solution it does not feel good honestly just give us one guaranteed exotic per master lost sector run and we re good some of the other proposed changes are good the guardian ranks rework seems alright on paper i don t care much for the changes to difficulty honestly but reading them say reworking the difficulty had some unforeseen consequences makes me even more doubtful they don t play their own game which is obviously not the case but honestly not noticing these changes before releasing the game i don t know what to say tl dr i was happy to see them acknowledge some of the game s issues but the answers provided makes me even less hopeful this game is going in the right direction
that cost for the focused decoding is way to much especially given the fact that you only get one exotic cipher a week from xur lets not even get started on the golf balls if this focused decoding guaranteed a high stat roll or higher then this can be somewhat reasonable but it is still quite a lot it gets pretty tiring having a system implemented in the most costly and time consuming way at release only for it to get adjusted later on
f to gambit still hoping that next season is gonna feature some major gambit changes which is why there s been quiet about it to avoid spoilers other than that i love the best dressed commendation but it still wont feel very meaningful until there s no real reward for using commendations and people just do it because its a way to show appreciation people are still gonna just give it to whoever they can click on fast enough
a question on the exotic acquisition and focusing changes is it possible to get post beyond light exotics for the first time now by focusing them at rahool or will new exotics only ever drop from vsf and lost sectors for an example lets say a new hunter wants star eater scales would they be able to just focus all their exotic engram drops as beyond light engrams until they get them edit and does this change affect the potential exotics that new players can get from dropped engrams
for ascendant shards and a cipher i better be able to hand pick the stats that cost is crazy
so i try to not complain about certain aspects of games that much but i have to say my piece i played destiny when it was released and was off and on playing until shadowkeep i got back on towards the end of last season and have been grinding since i wanted to use warlock as i saw all these cool builds popping up for them but that was my least used class by far yesterday was glove day for lost sectors and i already had of the gloves and was hoping to get one of sunbracers necrotics or controverse hold lost sectors yesterday ran average of minutes per run flawless runs and i got exotics total the very last i got were the ones i wanted i spent hours almost playing them for absolutely useless rewards and didn t even get one of the gloves i wanted until i pulled every other one it s just ridiculous it didn t make it fun it wasn t enjoyable at all it wasn t hard it was the sheer amount of time spent for a rolled sunbracers was of those stats combined in strength and intelligence bungie needs to respect people s time this is a video game not my life if i didn t get off work early yesterday i would ve never gotten it done in time and then they post this and say oh well it ll get easier so don t worry you can run them easily but that s not the issue the issue is i had completions in a row at one point with no exotic i m beating a dead horse but i m sorry this is ridiculous
lots of good changes still don t understand commendations why do i care about them i m not looking at people s commendation score ever i don t care about it there s no reason to
cut to the drifter shrugging his shoulders and going back to getting high from boiling vex goo in a spoon
alright everyone make sure you re keeping any of your shoot to loot rolls in anticipation of this new change being able to pick up orbs at a distance will be game changing rolls to look out for battle scar can roll shoot to loot with kinetic tremors this means that proccing kinetic tremors will pick up all ammo and all orbs in that area also proccing any of the armor mods that work on orb pickup hung jury can roll shoot to loot with kinetic tremors as well wolftone draw can roll shoot to loot with dragonfly works the same way where the dragonfly explosion will pick up all ammo and orbs basically keep any shoot to loot weapon with some kind of area damage perk as it will be very useful next season also works incredibly well with any overflow special weapon in your other slot as it will auto reload and overflow the magazine from range
any update on multiple exotics not functioning as intended most notably for me at least i m sure there are plenty others chimera perk not activating on fighting lion death throes not activating on verity s brow
is there a reason why the artifact can t be stored in the loadout it s not like the actual mods need to be just the on off state the refund per item makes it faster but still easy to forget when using loadouts esp on the fly swapping for bounties and really nerf your build
bungie let me save you me and the community the trouble and say precision focusing needs to drop at a minimum at with high chances for spikes anything below that and the community will absolutely be ruthless on your asses
so threshers have lessened damage but are still tied to frame rate
i do hope they mix up xur s quest for the cypher because dam strikes pvp gambit gambit and pvp only giving progress if you win really kinda sucks
you re not gonna find anyone
i m convinced the guided raid beta doesn t work i ve never gotten match through it i d just use the d2 lfg or r fireteams
no i d just go outside the game and get a sherpa d2 lfg discord has a channel for it just post that you re looking to learn ____ raid on any of the lfg sites plenty of people out there who teach especially the latest raid
when leviathan guided raids came out i had quite a few clears already and i put on the worst gear i had in my inventory and went into guided waited for about minutes and honestly the sherpas i had were really good but that was loooong ago
an extremely long wait to find others majority of people using it do not read the rules which say not in exact terms have a mic and really nothing worthwhile using outside resources even reddit s lfg is better
while it s technically possible to find a team it s incredibly unlikely basically impossible guided games has been in beta for years and will likely be abandoned entirely when lfg comes out next month eventually sometime this year i use www bungie net or download the destiny mobile app pretty intuitive interface and you can invite people to your game right from the app
always found it hilarious how one of the lowest got emblems is a guided games one only people have it not because it s hard but because guided games has no players
i waited forever for a guided raid match somedays you ll definitely not be able to get one and when i did finally get some sherpas they quit at the first encounter
you ll most likely spend hours finding a group and if if your lucky they ll teach you the raid and not put you on ad clear your best bet is to look for people willing to sherpa destinysherpa is great i know a few that used it with positive experiences
on top of the other recommendations here r destinysherpa is a great option for new players looking to learn the end game literally a whole sub built around experienced players looking to teach newer players how to do the end game the problem with guided games is that you generally only have new players going into there that don t know about lfg while most experienced groups go to lfg to find players when needed bungie has their official lfg through the app and their website bungie is also planning on adding this into the game there are also the discords and other sites
if you find someone like me a actual teacher and not i carry u adclear then yea it s a good time but also guided games is a mess even with a actual guide who wants to teach a few fun things i have encountered when guiding no mics insta leaves people who don t speak english at all ect there are some good groups and good runs but generally better when you just lfg also the chance to encounter people who actually want to teach you is way way higher for just lfg because well you can actually know who you are going to not a random matchmaking system
the one and only time i ever got matched on a guided game was with a spanish language fireteam after hours of waiting so there s plenty of that
as someone who guides regularly i leave it up to the people we guide if they want to be carried or learn the mechanics on occasion we also get people have have run more raids then us which is always fun but if you do decide to participate please bring a mic the amount of people we get who don t have a mic don t use it is infuriating sometimes edit i m on console if that matters
just dowbload yhe d2 app put put a post looking for a raid team saying youre new and want to learn good chance some random vet will be willing to teach u an encounter or maybe tje whole raid if lucky
not great was doing as a guide with my mates and it was literally a carry since they had no mics and leaving the activity gives you a hour debuff took us about an hour for the full completion
nonexistent literally nobody uses guided raids and never has not sure why it even still exists
just go on lfg why are people always so scared
you will be in queue for hours but on the chance you do find someone they ll either be extremely sweaty and man the raid for you because they want the emblems or they ll be shit and waste your time because it s their first time as well
it sucks too because there are some cool emblems attached to guided games for carries
nobody uses guided raid you won t be able to find anyone try using any lfg site either companion app but there are other sites and discord for it search for sherpa teaching runs most of them are nice
bad nearly no one queues as a sherpa so its just a long list of people wanting to be carried you will have a much better time hitting up the lfg or a discord community
use the companion app either make a post saying it s your first raid or join one that says teaching
i ve found people before but they kicked me a few moments later i think they were hoping for someone who doesn t have any raids completed looking to sherpa and i have quite a few
waiting for hours before getting into a match where you can barely understand anyone before they just ditch to lfg
as others have said don t bother with the guided raids but if you re looking to learn a raid send me a pm i teach raids all the time
the final raid boss of guided games is the queue if you make it your reward is a raid that is so disjointed you won t finish
i tried it for vog during season of the lost when i first started playing got a good group of people and they sent me a clan invite i am now an admin of the clan and play with some of my best gaming buds everyday people have had some bad experiences but people also have great experiences
isn t the guided raid thing only connecting you to experienced clan members with that said i ve seen a lot of people willing to teach different raids and dungeons in lfg groups
i used it once me and some buddies were gonna do vog and needed a 6th figured we d just find one while we did the opening our fireteam lead queued us up for guided game as a joke and we almost instantly got someone took them through the whole thing with collectibles lmao
i mean you might after half a day of waiting
it doesn t and it barely worked when the game came out it s literally been in beta for years
any chance you have a link to the discord server i couldn t find it
i had a group for dsc once that was a bunch of middle schoolers unfortunately they had to get off once we actually got to security so i couldn t tell if they were any good but considering it took them minutes to get through the opening i wasn t very hopeful another group i had the next day knew nothing about dsc period and i had to teach them everything this group was a bunch of middle aged scots brits and were a hilarious bunch especially when i jokingly told them some year olds from the other group did the sparrow section better than them but after hours we only got atraks to half health a couple of times and they all had to go to bed sometimes it can be a fun experience when other people aren t super serious and rage but at the very least bungie could have done it so that if someone is queueing as a guide they should at least y know have a clear of the raid prior to being a guide
yeah i ve had some really good experiences with guided games where i ll find a group that is good at teaching and have a fun time but i ve also had experiences where it s groups that have never even done the raid before and i have to teach them how to do the raid or people that will try to do the mechanics themselves with no mics while me and the randoms will just shoot adds this is assuming of course that you actually get a group that can speak your language because bungie didn t get to the phase of the beta where they put in language filters somehow or that you get a group at all long ago before i had a smartphone or computer to go on an lfg i waited hours on a saturday for a last wish guide and didn t get anything
why are people always so scared people post horror stories from lfg coupled with casual comments people read on here elsewhere it also doesn t help that most raiders are against doing literally any mechanic
no that requires other people to be searching
i think it could work if using it was similar to the lfg you select guided raid then it populates a list of available fireteams raids to join then you at lease know other people are interested in doing the activity updating the ui to make it work this way probably isn t worth the effort though but selecting it and then just waiting on the finding guardians screen for god only knows how long is insane
first result when i typed d2 lfg discord https://discord.gg/d2lfg
the people that have bad experience are the one that join kwtd posts without knowing what to do and just want to ad clear the whole time and then get mad when they get kicked because they won t learn a mechanic
yea most raiders don t wanna learn the mechanics you right i haven t seen any horror stories so i might be blind
true but its still crazy how many people are waiting for that to happen ive jumped in with my friends for fun a couple times and we always instantly find someone looking to play
they d be better off removing the clanmate requirement but even with that i don t think it would see much use
they re already adding in game lfg in season not much point in changing guided games when it s most likely getting deleted and replaced with a better alternative in months
i haven t seen any horror stories so i might be blind they don t always get upvoted but they re pretty common if you search something like lfg bad you can find a good number of posts some of which have really overt titles like lfg is not as bad as people make it out to be or lfg isn t as bad as everyone says there are even some with over upvotes
oh man lfg raid groups are a trial of patience they re doubly frustrating when the group gets the encounter boss almost all the way down in health then someone screws up and dies causing a team wipe leading to the group not being able to get to that point again for another runs you know the group can do it because they almost did it once but for some reason can t get it together again
you could get matchmade with people that have never raided before and probably don t have mics which are a requirement for most endgame content maybe if they did a message system for each raid it would greatly reduce the need for mics
you plant the flag at the same time you start the encounter vog has a lot of encounters that are perfect for this since you can shoot a box next to the flag to start it you can grab an atheon checkpoint to try it yourself
i think the restoration duration is fine but picking them up should definitely increase the timer rather than reset it they said they were looking at it though since it was a bug
i would instead add better already on legs and in cases you may need it an agressive play style you can use cloak mods for powerful overshield while using finisher heal during finisher multiple ways to heal now and orbs are a big part of the modding system mods that decay armor charges don t make it decay faster from having more on
2s is not enough to build into reasonably imo increasing the timer on pickup would be great but if it isn t a reliable window for an initial kill or long enough to pick up a second charge i feel it needs an increase it costs fragment slots or seconds is not going to be game breaking tbh i am happy to hear the refresh down to 2s is a bug though thank you for telling me
i want to add that i also run solar hunter specifically in solo content and i find the duration is fine and my survivability is good even on a young ahamkaras spine setup
i do use better already recuperation better aleady stops on taking damage so it often hasn t helped i d rather not rely on finishers either if i m honest i like using orbs for kickstarts or surges i appreciate the help though i would still like my subclass to provide better healing from firesprites it fits the needs of a lot of my solar hunter builds and would go a long way towards making it feel more in line with my solar titan and solar warlock i have no issues anywhere near this bad staying alive on any other class or subclass aside from stasis honestly
i think yas with cure is one of the easier exotics to supplement healing with on solar hunter now that we have a fragment that gives cure from grenades spawning firesprites with any healing from them at all and adding grenade wellmaker with recuperation gives a lot of total healing from grenades i think yas is a good survivability option but i ve used them so much i kind of want to mix things up at this point
but overall you are right about keeping alive can t seem to run a damaging grenade with the other exotics for solar spine takes that top spot never used cowl with solar and only really see solar hunter for nighthawk shots rarely
that s valid i didn t realize that you also mentioned yas in armors you depended on i find decent success with ophidia spathe and calibans hand in endgame content as well i adapt by making sure there s a red bar close to the to the fire sprite im aiming to get but the timing is admittedly tight
right it s already hard enough justifying gunpowder gambit too right now but all the more when i need that healing grenade immediately ready
caliban s and bombardiers are what i m enjoying most right now spawning the sprites is easy enough but getting to them often gets me killed i was struggling doing the legend tier seasonal activity for a guardian rank and felt like approaching a firesprite was a death sentence
probably master wellspring competent team can do it in min and you have chance
depending on the weekly mission honestly i run that on master and it s pretty decent i always have as many as i need best of luck on your farming
wellspring or weekly campaign missions on higher difficulties could also buy one weekly from rahool and you can get one from banshees rank reward
master only yeah
thank you does it matter what difficulty
generally master will have the best drops but people have gotten them on hero and legend so honestly it s up to you and your ability on how far you want to go
jaren wards ghost became shin malphur s though that might have only been possible because shin did have a ghost as a baby but it was destroyed
is your character power or is the artificial boosting it by a factor of power or more i believe for the progress to complete you need to have each armor piece and weapon be at least
now are you at or are you at like with your artifact kicking it up the rest of the way hover over your score and see what the actual number is
you need to equip all your gear for it to unlock
i m sorry you re having trouble i know when i reached i had to equip everything and above and pretty much all my weapons and gear were or above too before it unlocked for me sorry wish i could offer more help
is every slot or above
it s got to be a combination of all your gear minus the bonus light levels from the seasonal artifact it s not really very clear
is your guardian including the artifact power increase you ll be able to tell by hovering over your light level just like the seasonal challenges in the past it will only register if your guardian is at the desired ll without the added power from the artifact so if it says or something like that in the hover window it means your base light level is
i ve been saying this for years what s the point of a melee buff if most of the time you run out of enemies to punch run out of time on the buff this is the sole reason i ve just preferred synthos ophidians over these two
bungie can t balance melee stuff they haven t ever been able to just have to wonder why they added a melee weapon type recently
no cause that would make titan glaive builds viable again can t have that
increasing the duration won t really redeem these exotics unfortunately for titans it s in proximity to three enemies vs after five melee kills it s straight up not worth it meanwhile arc hunters can easily hit that 7x melee damage with cross counter and no one complains about that after the one two punch nerf it felt like they were still in a good spot but then the glaive melee synergy update completely nerfed them into the ground and beyond they won t really ever be redeemable until the higher stacks get buffed and three melee kills surpass synthoceps otherwise it takes far too long to build up meaningful melee damage
melee is in a weird place now especially after the glaive introduction it feels like the wormgods nerf was because a few very skilled youtubers could shot a boss if you ve ever actually tried it it s very hard to pull off it also feels like wormgods guile nerfs happened to allow interaction with glaives because maybe getting close to melee roaring flames burning fists x would have been extremely powerful idk i just want the risk reward balance back for melee in general
vexcalibur is the first build where ive felt guile is useful as the constant regen over shield actually lets you stay in your enemies guts long enough to take advantage
no fuck duration the buffs should refresh when hitting boss or other chonky enemies
that s not going to happen not because of glaives or what not it s because it was one shoting raid bosses once you see exotic enabling things like one shoting riven or belmon in glassway gm nerf is imminent and that s the kind of nerf that usually doesn t gets reverted or softened right now starfire sunbracers synthos have a very good chance of getting nerfed into oblivion in around weeks
eh before the halfing of the buff i could see the reasoning a 5x multipler on all melee damage was strong and gave it a solid trade off senario but now half the buff double the duration
if you run out of enemies to punch it s because your job is done right
yeah for all melee damage buffs stack multiplicatively so it s easy for things to get out of hand looking at the old taping ghalron with wormgods punch offensive bulwark and sheild bash and tractor cannon and some other buff i can t remember i e a damage buff of 5x2x1 4x a damage multiplier from tractor cannons debuff from old wormgods from punch from offensive bulwark
titans are the ones holding a fist on the cover after all that sure doesn t look like a glaive to me
for glaives and pvp syntho is only and honestly if bungie made wormgods stacks decay so after the second duration is up you just go down a stack they wouldn t be to bad ad you then have yo to 25seconds to kill again and not lose everything but yeah hunters solar and arc are the true melee subclasses damage survivability general utility etc they out class almost every thing titans can do
increasing the duration won t really redeem these exotics unfortunately for titans it s in proximity to three enemies vs after five melee kills it s straight up not worth it if you could have more flexibility in _maintaining_ the buff it d definitely be worth it
same with titans worm god but even then the tiny duration can take the wind right out of you sails which is why i like the idea of the decaying stacks sure you still need to keep feeding the gauntlets kills but you have extra wiggle room for single target stabbing but i am envious of warlocks necro and karnstein exotic gauntlets wish titans had things like that
then change how buffs stack since thats the real issue since all melee buffs stack multiplicatively as for the warlock exotics they where always going to be nerfed the fact it s taking this long is silly when other things have been nerfed quicker for less
only reason it was one shotting bosses was because you can stack wormgod and one two punch with the mini hammer other after that nerf they were perfectly fine
yeah if they made it more like 5x damage for about seconds i think that d be a much better middle ground than what we re at now
i wish lol i have a bad habit of playing a bit safer than i really need to
even though solar and arc hunters feel far more intune with there melees flowing cleanly from using the melee into other abilities weapons then then there s titans which have melee options but they just don t flow or feel as good as hunters sure titans might have the most damage or other best in game thing closest is strand melee and sheild toss due to the lack of any weird mechanic like needing to sprint charge it up weird drawn out lunge
made me realize how out of wack these melee changes are though i m primarily talking about a non glaive melee wormgod overpowering synthoceps by a significant margin at the high end is what made the wormgods fun and viable in the first place they still need to buff the top end to make it properly compete with synthoceps plus we ve already seen they re capable of splitting how the melee damage buff is applied they can t nerf synthoceps without an absolute outrage because it s the last stand in terms of good melee exotics the biggest thing holding wormgod caress back is it s buildup x200b 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x pre nerf post nerf that measely is aweful to work with and barely helps especially in higher tier content doesn t do much either it s only that nets you more consistent one hit melees against those tankier red bars and harder difficulty normal red bars such as those found on ll neomuna without that you re using two melees to kill mere vex goblins most of the time at the very least 1x and 2x stacks should be brought back to their original values and 3x stacks and beyond should be able to surpass synthoceps by a significant margin and although decaying stacks does sound like a cool idea the buildup will still hold it back
funny that you mention that since sunbracers are basically grenade version of wormgod yet you want one buffed and other nerfed
honestly i think even making it a second duration vs would be great i think 5x damage buff is plenty they dropped it because the issue was buff stacking causing some extreme interactions
hammer toss feels good too
yeah they really ripped the guts out of this exotic
wormgod takes multiple melee kills to get the damage going while sunbracers takes one they are no where near the same unlimited grenades for seconds on one kill damage after melee kills also knowing somethings going to get nerfed and wanting it nerfed are two very different things its obviously sunbracers and starfire are going to get nerfed because of the grenade ability spam they allow for such minimal effort and how bungie has been trying to reduce ability spam
verity s brow is the grenade version of wormgod if anything sunbracers is just throw more grenades lol
bonking the grasp ogre was kinda fun
synthoceps is 3x instantly for just existing in the same room as other enemies and extends melee lunge range and buffs your super by 5x 5x is not enough payoff for having to get melee kills which means you need to be near enemies with a limited time and no other benefit unfortunately comparisons like this will likely just lead to synthoceps being nerfed even though it s been the same since vanilla d2
yeah kinda the bonk isn t as satisfying when it doesn t take out a red bar
of high end cases melee will be better because of buff stacking sunbracers realistically is only useful against riven maybe oryx if we are being generous when it comes to day to day stuff it pales in comparison to stuff like caliban s and yet i don t see any calls for caliban s nerf when it comes to starfire i d say it should make your fusion grenade single explosion only no matter equiped aspects that way it d be the same as it was before solar
unfortunately comparisons like this will likely just lead to synthoceps being nerfed even though it s been the same since vanilla d2 saying the suggests there haven t been a wave of consistent and strong buffs that stack with syntho added since vanilla d2
neither will strand or shield toss melees arc hunter wont unless you re already stacked up very similar to solar titan and solar hunter melee will only do it if you re hitting crits or have already weakened them
of high end cases melee will be better because of buff stacking oh wait you re serious let me laugh even harder https://media.tenor.com/m8fxf74uv0waaaac/george-of-the-jungle-now-comes-the-part-where-we-throw-our-heads-back-and-laugh.gif) grenade builds outclass melee times outta cause using melee in high tier content is a swift way to spend a revive token the only exception is if the melee has some gimmick that either makes you invisible to enemies or it isn t really a melee skill it s a ranged ability in the melee slot
all buffs and debuffs stacked in vanilla d1 sure there are a lot more buffs and debuffs now but they override eachother and none are really much stronger if any than the buffs debuffs we had in y1
high end as in really high end duos and solos
syntho stacks and has since shadowkeep because it s a separate exotic buff buffs only don t stack if they are in the same category
yes i understand that i m just saying stacking was unlimited in y1 hell you could even swap exotics and retain buffs from the other for example swap from synthos to wormgods and have both buffs until synthos timed out now stacking is more limited in how much can stack so i don t think that s really a relevant argument for nerfing synthos rather they would nerf them just because they outshine any other melee exotic peregrine wormgods etc and they likely don t want to buff those others to compensate
unlimited stacking in y1 and y2 was the reason they added the stacking rules
psiops in the vanguard playlist reward nothing in the end chests no glimmer no shards nothing
my favorite part of the nightfalls i did yesterday were the nameless midnights i got
i think there might be a glitch with the end of this nightfall if you wipe at any point fighting the boss then it will only give you a silver clear instead of a platinum clear if you killed all the champions
imo there should always be an item drop after any activity completion in a loot game always period with strikes having level advantage disabled they can t be completed as insanely fast as before i think it s perfect reasonable to get a guaranteed legendary drop
all playlist activities should guarantee a weapon drop why not
i think someone misplaced a with the drop of the vanguard seasonal weapon autumn wind drops a lot and thats good
i don t do strikes other than gms and the occasional nightfall these days it feels like they serve little to no function now with rewards being non existent
meanwhile i find that normal strikes are far more lucurative than nightfall strikes while being 100x easier ive ran nightfalls today no loot at all aside from the weekly objectives i ran strikes and got plenty of legendaries including vanguard engrams how is this even possible
i never see the idea of loot quality discussed as a reward structure in my mind any completion should reward something tangible even if it s weighted to a lower tier of weapon with a small chance of a good tier weapon then you could have playlist streaks flawless completions etc give a higher chance to reward the better tier of weapon or a higher chance of good perks that way you can guarantee getting something for your time and the quality of loot goes up if you put a modicum of effort in but this is unlikely to ever be the case with how bungie likes their rng
defiant engrams up the ass but not vanguard should get one after every fucking strike or maybe score gets one idk strikes suck
strikes should drop materials upgrade modules and seasonal armor
at this point i ignore strikes and nightfalls completely the rewards are just ass and last season i reseted vanguard times this season i m barely over one time don t think i m going to reach second reset
strikes for the pinnacle that s it move on to other activities kinda sad because of all the work that went into strikes
pinnacles don t get me to run the strike playlist xenology doesn t get me to the run the strike playlist it s literally the most boring and useless thing you can be doing in the game
and it s like shards straight up joke
at least you get loot alot of activities that used to give loot give nothing but glimmer now
strike loot aka glimmer
outside of gm s i don t really care about the loot i do enough strikes a week to do bounties and get bright dust this typically means no pinnacle and that s fine i ll grind a gm for shards and a weapon if it s one that i want
they know but it makes people play more to get loot so they don t care that it isn t fun or engaging it makes their active player charts look better to investors
the implementation of vanilla strikes in this game has just never been that great imo i think the difficulty is part of the problem they are brain dead easy but the rewards being non existent is obviously a huge issue as well i remember playing strikes in d1 for hours on end strike specific loot felt a lot better back then being able to get both unique armor and unique guns was cool i liked the vanguard streak system on one hand i get the logic of moving the strike specific guns to nfs but i just get bored of playing the same strike over and over again very quickly there is no playlist where i feel inclined to keep playing i d like to see some hybrid where we get something nf legend difficulty with the strike specific loot but with random strikes to encourage replayability
if anyone feels the need to answer this post with a suggestion just shut up most of this game is broken bungie needs the feedback we don t need you re playing the wrong playlist or whatever that s not the problem and you know it
i got my s tier god roll harsh language ty bungie took almost season pass levels worth of grinding
posted this in a similar thread but what are the odds bungie actually makes a good change regarding the loot and rewards of endgame activities its something ive seen people talk about constantly in the past few weeks and i dont know bungies track record with listening to the playerbase is it in the realm of possibility or are they like respawn and we d better forget about it deal with it
it s fucking terrible and i m so fed up with everyone complaining about people complaining about loot some of y all are like an abused gf who keeps defending their man bungie being mad stingy this isn t plunder we aren t bot walking minute gms rn with arc titan adjust shit i really want a hothead i m at engrams and i refuse to do more strikes until gms they re just ass and take forever rather play mayhem fast games fast rep
you get engrams at a very decent rate that can be used to focus your drops strikes are more rewarding than ever
don t care it can stay awful it has to do with strikes i don t like them so they shouldn t be supported dtg taught me if i don t like something it shouldn t be supported
do the nightfall not normal strikes
i ve been grinding out regular strikes for shaders in the past or so days i have only gotten i just want my vanguard marshal lmao sometimes i get absolutely nothing at all not even glimmer
i did heroic glassway a dozen times last week and the last three or four all i got was glimmer and the guaranteed currencies i knew there was a high chance i wouldn t get a buzzard in that many but c mon at least give me a playlist weapon every other one
been like that since i came back nothing from strikes or world loot chests very frequently just a few days ago i also had invisible enemies
not to mention they give you less leg shards than dismantling would otherwise lol
please bungie strikes need to drop gear of the strike s respective location every time ex lake of shadows scathelocke vanguard ops need to do the same but include a vanguard weapon ex lake of shadows ops scathelocke empty vessel same again for nightfalls but realistically it would be great if nightfall weapons were guaranteed upon eliminating all champions and extra perks are dependent on score every 100k score is an extra trait in column and the higher difficulty you do the more score you d naturally accrue upping your rolls for time invested ex lake of shadows nightfall scathelocke empty vessel duty bound w 2x 3x traits champions 100k 200k score grandmaster is all of the above just with adept weapons
boy would i sure want to get some loot in this looter shooter can t believe we let the fallen take all of it
all glimmer and legendary shards they saved you from dismantling all the useless crap
gambit is more rewarding and quicker
i did like nightfall runs trying to get a hung jury and i didn t get a single one nightfalls are shit wouldn t be so bad if they just enabled matchmaking on legendary ones but nope that s asking too much i have to go to lfg and beg for team mates in order to play content that s worth it
full vanguard rep reset nameless midnights in total i just wanted ne with kinetic tremors fml
strike bosses need dedicated weapon or armor on d1 there was grasp of malock titan arm armor it would be great to have some specific loot to grind there are taken armor in d1 that they reuse taken armor from d1 too
tbh i play strike only because bright dust reward of challenge obtain ritual season weapon ornament challenge
we ve slowly reverted back to year where we turned in tokens for loot instead of earning them as a reward now we use engrams and some currencies instead while i like being able to focus for what i want it s not a fun experience the chase is being taken out of the game and it hurts the overall experience in my opinion at the end of the day this is a looter shooter
strike specific loot we ve been asking for years
destiny has always had reward issues since the beginning in my humble opinion some seasons were better than others sure but the issue has always been present
you get vanguard engrams that you can focus into whatever you want that s the reward from the strike playlist
as a day one player that has returned in the last months i have noticed that better drops come out the battleground playlist i consistently get exotic engrams in there
it s laughable what the rewards are for strikes wow shards and some glimmer i feel so special
fun some nightfalls they re where the rewards begin also make sure your ghost has vanguard modularity chance of upgrade modules or prosperity chance to receive additional legendary gear
at the beginning of the season i thought vanguard engrams can drop randomly on strike completions but no they only drop on vanguard rank up it would feel more rewarding if vanguard engrams had a chance to drop even if it was a small chance
one of the foundations of the game which the game is build on in the same way a tutorial is and the strike playlist is essential tutorial mode also isnt that gl in the world pool
you literally get no loot rewarded in this game like the drop rates are abysmal and xur is the only reason most people even have the latest dlc exotics i remember trying to get starfire protocol for at least a whole year after it s release and got nothing half a year later xur had it for sale even in the highest difficulty tier content all the loot you get is essentially trash or dismantle fodder it wasn t always like this in d1 you could get weapons like gally or the monte carlo from raids and there are plenty of videos from that era of destiny on youtube of people freaking the fuck out now what we get some purple copy paste weapon or an exotic weapon that does fuck all or we do get something powerful and then it proceeds to get nerfed into the ground because fun is not allowed like when was the last time we got an exotic armour piece that was both badass and op and what about weapons is the finality even that good in pve fuck pvp that shit is garbonzo you know what was a cool weapon the thorn sure it was broken as fuck but man was it cool in terms of design and gameplay wise another cool weapon gally d1 gally was so freaking good and so was the sparrow as well whisper of the worm is probably my favourite exotic weapon design but unfortunately now hits like a pool noodle there are a lot of cool exotic weapons in the game but like of them are unusable garbage and the purple legendary weapons both suck in design but also like of them are also garbage same with exotic armour of all exotic armour in the game is useless garbage it s almost like bungie purposely nerfed them into that state or let them be out power crept by newer guns and armour people detest sunsetting shit so bungie simply just nerfs them into the ground or forgets about em it s still in the game right you can still play with your toys stop complaining my point is is that for a game that calls itself a looter shooter well whilst that may of been true once upon a time today it feels like there is nothing to grind for nope just artificial grind for arbitrary stats and made up accomplishments that were made up by bored out of their mind players i actually found a game genre that satisfies my gear progression grind crave and thats the arpg genre games like diablo last epoc and path of exile
i literally just don t run strikes nightfall completes strike requirements so i run only nightfalls so at least getting prisms
especially compared to crucible and gambit where we usually get at least to rewards so odd you literally get nothing from strikes
ive been looking at my activity times recently for the core play list strikes 15min hero nightfall 20min with blueberries gambit 8min crucible 9min every gambit crucible and nightfall game gets me one or two guns or gear plus some materials normal strikes often only some materials thanks for coming to my ted talk
even something as simple as glimmer is woefully unrewarding compared to just running around opening chests on patrol i can get more enhancement cores standing on the moon hitting the wrong rune for minutes it s like they really don t want you to engage with the ritual content
strikes have been useless for the past years
i thought i was tripping when i got literally nothing lol
honestly even when it s working like it s supposed to the drop rates in this game are pretty weird
made multiple forum posts reporting it and it s fallen on deaf ears every time
patrol chests often drop nothing and i get that it s a patrol chest but still nothing
i think this happens because they removed blues and just give you shards and extra glimmer instead when you would have traditionally received blues
pretty sure you are not guaranteed anything you do get xp towards levels which also gives vanguard engrams don t forget about them
that s all i ve been getting while farming the buzzard i did get one other weapon drop the handcannon from a few seasons back but of the time if i do get a drop it s been nameless midnight
any roll with kinetic tremors
i rage quit after the second lmao
i noticed after wipe immediately upon spawn it says a champion has spawned twice but i didn t see any an older version of this strike had a champ you had to go back and kill before jumping down to attempt the boss again
i ve been saying this for literal years there s is no godamn reason i should win a game of gambit only to be given glimmer
at the very least from nightfalls i should be walking out of any given nightfall with a weapon at least one prism and a decent chunk of glimmer and shards
for me the last two weeks no nf weapons rewarded in any of the nights nightfalls i ran i run this week s nightfall 3x today to get the pinnacle and i get the swarm to drop 3x in a row i ended up with a pretty nice flared magwell rangefinder target lock roll honestly even when it s working like it s supposed to the drop rates in this game are pretty weird
been that way for a few seasons now nightfalls were great for rep but terrible for chest drops while normal strikes were meh for rep but far more consistent for chest drops
don t worry i did lost sector in the day of chest and i got exo arms even that the reward showed helmet the game is buggy as hell ls was gilded precept btw
agree and the idea of flawless streaks etc sounds really interesting that people will perform better for better loot and agreed again about bungie and rng system one of the many reason is their is no direct competition for destiny in current genre if it had bungie would do lot better job at player retention and do all qol changes
i think you mean to nf strikes for pinnacles at once if you do legend or master and playlist strikes
so you say
i actually enjoyed guardian games legend difficulty strike when it was birthplace of vile the strike scoring and modifiers made it a blast to tear through not sure why bungie didn t capitalize on those sort of modifiers instead they upped the difficulty a shit ton to make them take more time or implemented gates to slow your pace feels bad
a few nightfalls are fun in a sort of speed run way scarlet keep i can grind for a while to whittle completion times down but a few strikes are absolute slogs
on one hand i get the logic of moving the strike specific guns to nfs but i just get bored of playing the same strike over and over again very quickly this i actually really like the current hero difficulty in nfs it s the sweet spot between challenge and ease i have to be on my toes but i can try out different things without gimping myself or my fireteam i just wish i could just queue and run any nf like how the current strike playlist works rather then be stuck on one per week
yea i watched gameplay of a strike from d1 and thought it was a nightfall only to realize it was a normal mode one honestly i gotta ask wtf happened also wheres the loot bungie
so getting nothing at the end of a 20mins activity just to get glimmer and few legendary shards are more rewarding i ran strikes yesterday and today nothing at all from final chest no legendary gear vanguard engrams are for rank up i think that s seperate where is the actual loot for finishing the strike
did two legendary lake of shadow nfs same result not a single gear dropped from final chest
and that s not the solution there are lot of people who like to farm strikes cause they are chill easier and faster
tbh i would say matchmaking on legend will be terrible cause i have encountered even on hero people don t use champion weapons or refuse to change when even i write in chat maybe they are new and don t know about how to deal with a champion but still even after explaining they won t change a nf which should take about mins becomes 25mins worth of pain
wow that sucks sorry see that s the issue why a game all about loot us so stingy sometimes
that s what i said too in a comment but still some thinks that vanguard engrams are good reward for strike playlist i mean if it dropped every strike completion than yes
i wasn t trying to get gl from strike i was just saying that i have been trying to get that gl since week crap tons of terminal overload chest opened but not a single one dropped yet strikes have been really bad as far as loot goes of strikes i have done including nf this season dropped loot except pinnacle
it s why i don t feel bad leaving
i ve never seen that in fact i ve seen chests drop less glimmer than resource nodes hvts also seem to drop less glimmer than resource nodes
the chests don t even give glimmer
no these are straight up bugged not once have i gotten a reward you are however guaranteed shards or a legendary to the best of my knowledge they have not mentioned changing that
i feel like autumn wind and nameless midnight together make up more than half the loot i ve gotten this season
i ve been keeping every nameless midnight i get so at the end of the season i can ask bungie what the hell is your loot pool for christ sake
that s literally all i want haha gimme a kt nm and i ll move along out of vanguard strikes
holy shit i was wondering why it said that after we wiped thanks for the info
yeah i really don t get it how does a nightfall run atleast not guarantee a single vanguard engram i get that im only running hero nightfalls at the moment but they are plenty challenging with the difficulty bump and it s especially daunting to play through if you get new lights in there strikes i can solo yolo all day like most people and that actually rewards me consistently for my time invested but nightfalls lol nah not for me out of those nightfalls i ran about of them i had to run with beginners running riskrunner and night watch it was absolute pain
for me the last two weeks no nf weapons rewarded in any of the nights nightfalls i ran this has been me i was really keen on getting a tremors roll on hung jury but i m guessing the game didn t consider my old rh explosive jury to count for the focusing so i needed to drop a new one by blind luck a hj dropped from the do nfs seasonal challenge and interesting one too rh box breathing so it took the pressure off having to drop one from running nfs which is good because i haven t seen a single weapon of any kind drop so far for some reason my old swarm did count for focusing so i ll get to that once i ve bagged the hung jury i want
but i reckon that makes nightfalls more valuable cause the best you re getting for vanguard playlists is from rep gives you more targeted farming and stuff not to mention the pinnacle each week
the friends you made along the way
i did lake of shadows for a few hours today farming ranks for engrams and got a nameless midnight every runs and that was with the ghost mod with max glimmer you re basically rewarded a few extra legendary shards for doing harder content with a masterwork core and occasional master work shard i ve only had one non nameless midnight drop since farming the glassway and los
the easier and faster activities have less loot that s crazy
chill easier and faster if you make easier and faster content drop almost equivalent to harder content why even bother having harder content forest through the trees here my man
and hence aren t as rewarding as harder activities
is it not a nightfall weapon could be wrong
it works the stipulation for bosses is that they cannot be disabled if the debuff does not do that or has secondary effects that don t they will apply as normal
i wouldn t think so but suspending damage stuns some bosses i use shackle nades in lost sectors and it ll stun bosses for a second if you need a short window for a break off
they can be affected by weaken so i don t see why they couldn t be affected by sever
overload weakens damage output on enemies and stuns overload enemies does the weakening effect work on anti barrier unstoppable
most people don t mind helping new players as long as the player can be helped there are some helpless souls out here
your best bet is to use lfg and if you find some people you enjoy playing with ask them to join their clan
that s because you are
it depends on what you want to accomplish if you have specific goals perhaps you can put that in the lfg section of the official destiny app and people who want to help can respond you can also try r fireteams subreddit it s difficult when you are asking something so general
and i m at hours and still have stuff i can t do or solo or know how to do
yes there are many people willing to help new players i would find an lfg i like the lfg discord server and you will find dozens of people willing to help just be careful of some tags like kwtd know what to do and rr raid report which you won t have if you have only played solo these tags are lfgs looking for experienced players but you can also create your own lfg and mention you are new
what is the best way to find people willing to deal with someone so new lfg discord clans etc is there actually anyone out there that has patience for someone so new yeah many like i have nothing against teaching people myself but so many people don t end up in that category most will provided a few things are true you re upfront about what you need don t disrespect others many will join kwtd teams proceed to avoid any mechanic do a poor job at many roles and frustrate others have a willingness to try something different and listen to what people are saying i don t believe carrying newcomers helps anyone it actually makes things worse because someone does next to nothing with extremely skilled players thinks they re experienced and then struggle with what you commonly find via lfg don t have a big ego i personally love trinity ghoul which you can see in my recent post but i also don t bring it on high level content others are not willing to make that sacrifice which quickly frustrates people when you re killing three adds and pulling in damage to another person s and million
biggest thing is to reach out reddit facebook lfg ect try gaming with people until you find some you enjoy playing with what do you mostly enjoy playing i wouldn t mind gaming with you but i m mostly a pvp player though i don t mind running some pve activities as well let me know if you wanna try gaming together i can shoot you my destiny name via private message
you got a few hundred to thousand more hours left before you are not a noob stop stressing just play and do what you enjoy without stressing if you want to try more stuff or group stuff you can use the bungie destiny app to find fireteams or join a clan most bigger ones are active on discord and do lots of teaching and sherpas
https://discord.gg/d2lfg sherpa channel
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/fireteams/search http://discord.gg/d2lfg
yeah baby this game is all about being dragged around kicking and screaming into a good time trust me i used to be this way too did my first raid had a patient group take their time to explain the mechanics to me and then it finally clicked oh i see this game does get more fun you ll find lots of people with patience i also used to be afraid of the lfg tool but it s actually dope and you can just say things like be chill or be gentle or looking to learn and people will just show up and teach you there are a disquiet few who like to yell about people who don t know the mechanics but you ll find it s often easier to avoid them than to run into them good luck
in the dark age we called this being an alcoholic
rumble
you know what valus forge s hangover cure is a salad dinner
i ll take these posts over the usual dtg drivel and cry baby nonsense
r destinydadjokes
i see funny dad joke i upvote is simple transaction yesss
salad man tf2 demoman crossover when
thanks for showing me this subreddit i made a dad joke here and the shitty mods removed it everyone who saw the joke liked it though
dual loader imo maybe it would need the reload speed penalty bumped back up or something to balance it in the mag slot but even if you entirely removed the reload penalty it would still stack unfavourably against most existing reload perks so i just can t see it ever being worth it as a normal perk unless those all get nerfed
compulsive reloader needs to be available with more traits that depend on having over half a mag inverse of hir or something that grants a worthwhile benefit if you can feasible drop something and activate a perk by reloading voltshot is a good pair and kill clip as well in pvp i think there need to be more perks of both categories and weapons that can roll a combo of them and compulsive maybe extend the duration of stuff like the increased aim assist on kill then reload perk i think it s less the perk sucks and more there isn t enough interesting perks to combo it with
compulsive reloader is great for specials but terrible for primaries
ngl we need more mag and barrel perks full stop those two columns have been so devoid of innovation over the years and there s so little variance almost every gun has the same bloody perks in both columns that the moment a gun comes out ppl already know what barrel and mag perks they re gonna use give us double the number of perks in those columns and randomize which handful of perks will appear on new guns this ll keep things much more interesting as time goes on
shot swap and encore feel more like origin perks than something i would chase even on a pvp roll
no it and dual loader is actually pretty okay now it has some uses
i have a terminus horizon with extended mag and voltshot put backup mag on it and mag size reaches sounds quite nice but evwn compulsive reloder can t save it from the slow as fuck reload speed
i agree with this
id rather just not see the perk on primary weapons its got its niche in specials
bungie is gonna read this and be like i think we need to make alloy magazine a perk instead of a magazine trait
it s also kind of dumb because with the enemies being so tanky i m always mag dumping and not compulsively reloading
hard disagree
compulsive reloader is really strong what are you waffling on about
compulsive reloader doesn t really modify the magazine nor the ammunition kill clip rampage and a few others do however not sure if i m following the logic here
they could even give it a different name maybe drop mag
compulsive is only good on long arm in my opinion
compulsive reloader should just auto dismantle and give me the shard because that s all it s good for
we ve been saying the same about dual loader since it was released
i like the trait because i don t have to think hard about whether to shard it
its fine as a perk but imo does need some changes right now you get a buff to speed on the top half of your mag reload stat and a 95x scalar i think it would be a good change to make it reload faster and faster to closer to full you are so at full you would have a reload and a 90x scalar
i got it on the only trust i farmed for and never farming another one because i really dont like gambit but liked trust enough to get one
compulsive reloader is an instant dismantle for me
yeah it s a pretty horrendous perk i shard any gun that has it
osmosis it s such a cool perk idea but it makes basically sense to pick it over any actual stat improving perks i could see an osmosis barrel perk that has some stats on top of the osmosis effect being very cool and unique also print osmosis on second slot weapons bungie
literally every perk that s only ever useful in pvp even not useful in pvp like quickdraw gunshit shitraight offhand shitrike tunnel vishion shlide way shlide shot shit seeker shit finder snapshit shight dynamic shiway reduction shit moment no shistractions shit fire grip tap the shrigger shit swap perfect shiloat air assault opening shit the list goes on there are just too many perks for that of the game or give us a switch to turn off these perks for drops
furthermore focused fury should get a reduction for primary weapons to of the magazine hit instead of its current the opposite of the compulsive reloader change they made
nah disagree
compulsive reloaded is awesome on long arm though
i just hate rolling extended mag and aloy mag if you added compulsive to the list it would make getting 5s much harder to get
hmm nah it s actually really good on stuff with volt shot i wish it was just all the time tho
explosive rounds aka explosive payload should go back to being a mag perk in d1 i had a wail from fwc with explosive outlaw reactive reload aka kill clip
one quiet moment
same with explosive payload should be a mag perk
compulsive would also a much better origin trait for crucible guns than one quiet moment imo
if i get a shotgun any shotgun with dual loader it turns into legendary shards instantly it s so intrusive and having no alternative to it is terrible it s wild to think drop mag was a magazine trait but somehow dual loader is a perk
enhanced dual loader is pretty good especially combined with enhanced frenzy
the reason i hate dual loader so much is because i m a compulsive reloader by nature too often i reload my shotty after just one shot anyways xd
if dual loader only used one ammo from reserves would it be too strong
this post just made me realize they added a legendary scout rifle that loads shots one by one before they added a handcannon that is more like a traditional revolver
i can agree with this def would be valued more if it had better synergies with other perks
cr and reservoir burst on a fusion would be nice
there isn t enough interesting perks to combo it with i d agree and also add that it frequently ends up rolling against too many perks that make it feel either moderately or entirely counterproductive moderately mkc if it takes too many shots to kill something mkc and cr work against each other and it s just one of those situations where you want a different reload perk niche but noteworthy entirely focused fury high impact the descriptions of these perks directly conflict with what cr does sidenote back in s16 when focused fury and cr were brand new perks there were waaaaaaaaay too many weapons that could roll this wombo combo
i think it s less the perk sucks and more there isn t enough interesting perks to combo it with this right here it s a great match to voltshot chill clip reservoir burst etc the reload boost it offers is about outlaw but with basically no setup if whichever gun it rolls on doesn t have perks like those its useless
love it on my chill clip riptide
it s okay on primaries that have on reload perks you want to use or high impact scouts long arm since they reload multiple times per full mag that s fine though not every perk has to be the best on every gun alh is also great on specials but mid on primaries for very similar reasons
i love it on my voltshot neomuna fusion due to how fast the reload is to trigger volt
it s incredible on long arm
i miss customizable scopes and sights it s weird because i m pretty even some reprized weapons that had different sights in d2 year no longer have that functionality on the new version some still have it though but it s rare
encore is a very strong perk wtf are you on stability range and accuracy it s no killing wind but it definitely has its place shot swap is okay but maybe could use a little love i don t think it would be too much to ask for the same animation scalar as quickdraw given that you need to kills to access the effect
shot swap would be amazing if the handling buff came from dealing damage or landing hits as it is improved swap speed requiring a kill seems pretty pointless in pvp to me at least
i feel like subsistence and alh are still better at either niche
it basically applies a constant reload buff to long arm
yeah voltshot just isn t great on machine guns i guess
basically free load speed half the time for something like killclip no thanks rather it be a perk
it did launch in a very poor state as it is now triggering off mag or higher it s finally in a good spot it won t be an always pick but it s actually decent and has very good synergies with on reload or top of mag perks
alloy magazine doesn t affect the mag count or ammunition either and drop mag used to affect reload speed and inventory size while it now affects reload speed and mag size
a compulsive reloader voltshot iterative loop will change your mind
we have osmosis on energy weapons at home osmosis on energy weapons at home https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/susanoo)
osmosis just needs to not remove the intrinsic bonus to kinetic damage and it d be fine the old use case for osmosis was to take advantage of font of might on your kinetic slot weapon in the current sandbox sacrificing the kinetic bonus to take advantage of surge mods is not worth it kinetic also now benefits from playlist surges when your subclass matches the active playlist surge which basically eliminated the other use case for osmosis
regular dual loader sure but tbh enhanced dual loader is pretty nice i feel the fact it loads at a time with the same with no further penalty makes it a worthy pick but that s just my opinion i ve been enjoying it a lot on the ragnhild d shotgun from witch queen
i remember drop mag i still have a gun with outlaw drop mag that isn t sunset it s hilariously fun to use now that we have infinite primary
my opening shot rampage transfiguration with drop mag is fucking wild now we have infinite ammo
speaking of when did we last get new barrel mag options for weapons other than legendary trace rifles and glaives
yeah it s nice but once again there are already way better reload perks like alh grave robber reconstruction slideshot etc doesn t seem good enough to go for in its current state when those exist unless it s your only option and the gun is otherwise godly in pve somehow
raginhild d with subsistence has been a godsend for people like us lol
think itd be pretty strong in pvp x200b remove scavs just to add them back as gun perk
hey you might be onto something ammo conservation could save you finder mods on the helmet
how would you make a more traditional revolver work
i ve got a snorri with that combo that i really enjoy
plug one has both compulse reloader in the first column if u like precision frame frs
add target lock dynamic sway reduction zen moment to that list
this is part of a broader issue frustratingly fundamentally there shouldn t be perks on the same gun that don t synergise it s just insta trash stuff that is wasting the player s time
agree on the not every perk needs to be the best on every gun
i got a compul opening shot one for pvp that i adore since compulsive kicks in as soon as you reach halfway of the mag
i tried cr on long arm and i literally couldn t tell it was working it s such a tiny bonus
bungie has stated we ll never return to the days of different scopes sights on a gun due to the amount of extra effort and testing it takes to incorporate them into gun models properly choosing specific scopes sights on newer guns also helps add variety given the number of guns that get released every season alongside similar guns that have been around for awhile now i m sure that choosing one option for re released guns that used to have multiple is for general design consistency alongside entirely new guns
neither of those trigger a number of on reload triggers so dual loader and compulsive are better for those use cases e g i d much rather have compulsive voltshot on a special weapon than subsistence or alh
hot take but i don t like voltshot lol
my raggy d is auto demo i don t have time to put shells in a gun one or even two at a time
funny you should mention ol raggy d my crafted one is still only level because well i don t really use shotties that often and especially not slower ones and as a result of it not yet reaching the level to unlock all perks i ve not recrafted it from the original dual loader setup i made it with which might actually be part of the reason i don t use it that much i should probably go recraft that perk
you motivated me to do this https://i.imgur.com/bsogwjc.png happen to know if i should want smoothbore or rifled barrel in the first slot i don t wanna sacrifice too much range but idk about shotty perks really _
jokes on you mine is enhanced loader and demo too many grenades free grenade reload and if for some reason i m out of both and pick up ammo one brick is enough to get me back to grenade full to restart the loop
i know i have a glacioclasm with subsistence and rb that is basically a railgun
that plug one might be my favorite legendary fusion right now feels like an old school loaded question
it speeds up the reload speed as the mag gets closer to full does it should be obvious that it does just based on the perk description not sure why i never thought of that that s actually kinda cool
this is true but i still don t know why they also removed all sights perks on hand cannons and sidearms given these ones never changed the actual visuals on the sights and had different effects from barrels
still need two more red frames for iterative loop but for now i m using a random roll with compulsive reloader voltshot you re right it works great
indeed subsistence outright has negative synergy with voltshot imo
how many on reload perks are you using on a shotgun
said absolutely no one ever
if you manage to get that combo on the fusion rifle i d recommend giving it a try at least lots of fun and great ad clear potential but at the same time use whatever you like
subsistence demo here with kinetic loader it s dope
fun fact aggressive shotties get a fire rate bonus for 3s after a kill
the season that shotguns were unstoppable for energy i took raghild to lvl from
imo you want corkscrew or smallbore instead range for pve shotties isn t that big a deal but these both give plenty plus other benefits and you want assault mag instead of extended mag you have two reload perks already so extended mag is not gonna do much other than slow your reload down when you actually need to reload
i have that same roll and it s so much fun easily one of my favorite weapons
pretty sure its just a flat bonus above mag size let me double check edit while above magazine capacity reload speed with a 95x reload duration multiplier which is super good as it loads at a time like dmt as soon as you cross the halfway mark it just speeds up
i think the real reason is zoom factors lots of sights gave extra zoom which as destiny has evolved have become the single best stat in pvp for many guns just look at how zoom on an smg over the standard instantly makes it a contender
better question is am i using a shotgun to which the answer is lol no that said suros origin trait is great for pvp and gunnora s axe has voltshot point is dual loader and compulsive have a niche they re not meant to be the top perks and are purposely put on guns to water down the pools but they still have combinations or use cases where they shine
only reload perk on a voltshot shogun is threat detector on gunnoras axe i would much prefer compulsive reloader i suppose surplus is there too but that s worse
my wishender doesn t go through glassway boss it s annoying
i feel your pain this bugs the hell put of me too
lament wishender and anti barrier sidearm on final warning seem to not work properly with barriers they only sometimes pierce phalanx shields and what not
if lament went through phalanx barriers i think i would have a new most used exotic
the hit registration needs to be fixed too so many instances where my character flies off the enemy during a combo
are you holding the guard button to rev up the chainsaw before you swing at the barrier
hero s burden still doesn t work with volatile rounds against barriers
lament in general does not work like it used to last season i used it a lot and got very frustrated it s revved up ready to go and then whiffs the light attack given how dangerous it is to get that close that whiff can be maddening
bungie s response gives you more autumn winds
while we re at it can we get it s heavy block charge separated from being registered as an ability charge i brought it up a few months ago but when seraph hbgs were the seasonal activity i found that if the death tongue acolyte reaches the totem then sword energy won t recharge until its dead i ran lament quite a bit last season and it got annoying the times i have no sword charge to get thru a barrier shield while the acolyte was at the totem it wasn t even just lament it was all swords experiencing the issue
lament used to go through barriers and shields back when it came out i don t know why they changed it it s bugged me ever since
i thought it was a me problem but i was feeling quite a silly goose when a cabal phalanx put a mug on my head whilst i was trying to rev kill him unsuccessfully
i m pretty sure the heavy swing does the thing that needs to be fixed is the hit registration against barrier servitors the heavy swing whiffs against them of the time and the light combo animations aren t even right
got it anti barrier now only affects champion shields
it s maybe because of the artifact perk the one for glaive and sword that override the innate ability of the lament to pierce barrier you can only have one effect versus a champ on a single weap and artifact override innate effect
lament is one of the worst exotics in the game swords in general are pointless
you re just using it wrong
you mean the melee weapon that cannot pass through and continue through said barriers like a bullet would with the exception of hobgoblins it doesn t make sense for it to do that
it would definitely be cause i distinctly remember picking off his health with wishender in every glassway gm i ve been in
my anti barrier sidearm doesn t seem to work on hydra shields does anyone know if that s intended i know anti barrier for sure used to work on those
barrier in general hasn t been working against a lot of shields in the game that it used to work on i m wondering if they ll address it or if i m doing something wrong
anti barrier on pretty much anything doesn t work on the other stuff anymore with any consistency it s gotten to a point where i just assume it won t work and don t even try
unstoppable also doesn t even work on touch of malice lmao
i want anti barrier to pierce titan bubbles in or out
i honestly think it s bugged because some runs mine actually does but most of them it doesn t
it won t go through the main boss if he has his invulnerable shield up if it s his normal one it goes through unless they changed that recently as well
ab won t work when certain status effects are applied like if the boss is frozen
le monarch s poison will proc even through the shields good way to cheese it on gm
if you look closely the boss has two layers of shields that spin at slightly different speeds anti barrier things seem to shoot through one layer but won t shoot through two layers
it works if you hit the weakspot red eye through the shield wierdly
removed
i ve heard that that can happen when you have overload bow active it can mess with wish ender s intrinsic anti barrier
i absolutely don t mean this to sound snarky but are you sure you re fully drawing the string i had this same issue too and then i realized that the issue was that i was releasing the arrow a split second too soon
always good to see a fellow lament enjoyer who can understand my deep lament edit i deserve all the down votes for that one
i don t like the fact that radiant or volatile rounds doesn t give you anti barrier it just allows you to stun barrier champs so it does not work on non champion phalanx hydra etc
was gonna say this final warning not tearing through phalanx shields is big sadge
oh good thought i was crazy when it wasn t working during the vexcalibur quest and i was trying to kill the boss with final warning
i know how to use lament it s my most used exotic of the time the aerial chainsaw attack won t even break barrier champ barriers
it should work as long as you aren t also running the overload smg mod on your artifact

that or i m having a fever dream of mis rememberence
intrinsic capabilities override artifact mods ie erianas vow is always anti barrier regardless of any perk you can buy on the artifact for hand cannons
absolutely not because of that this has been an issue since its release
lol what
and the barrier a champion differs because
i disagree it makes complete and perfect sense if the sword has anti barrier properties then it should take care of all the barriers that other weapons with anti barrier properties can take care of swords are already gimped as it is requiring you to put yourself in a huge amount of danger in order to be effective and you re here saying they should be less effective than literally every other weapon on top of that you have a bad take aside from that none of what you said addresses the fact that the lament can t break barriers of barrier champs when using the revved banshee s wail while in the air
it s a giant post singularity chainsword ffs i mean i could see siege dancers and skyburners shields from d1 stopping it but red legion and shadow legion have these stupid little dinky hologram shields with a nipple in the middle lament should go through them like fucking butter
so i ve been told he has shields one you can shoot through one you can t they spin differently i guess also if you shoot at his crit it goes through incredibly strange i use to never have issue with anti barrier quicksilver in s18 just tearing into him
nanite swarms work too
you can also stick the shield anywhere with witherhoard and it will apply the tick damage this works for all hydra type enemies that s my favorite gm method
it s not layers of shields it s the normal shields all focused front it does that every time it comes out of the portal then goes back to normal
spicy never knew that thanks
so strange i m wondering if it s just like that or if because i am on an overcharged sub class and my kinetic is surging i don t have overload bow on never know what dumbass coding will mess something up so i don t run ov bow
so is wishender
i actually don t run overload bow for this exact reason i wonder if because i was on solar subclass and the kinetic bow was overcharged
i am i have like kills on wishender in the past months
do you have the artifact mod that makes swords stun overloads
that s just a lament tracking issue
but why is that that s just dumb
i always forget little things like this and wonder why stuff isn t working
piercing bowstring was overriding the innate a b on wish ender at one point
because it s a champion barrier and that s the mechanic which is separate from the barrier piercing mechanic
the lament can t break barriers of barrier champs when using the revved banshee s wail while in the air all arguments aside this is a huge issue that needs addressing i also think the sword should peirce all barriers was only trying to explain why it doesn t mechanically
when belmon comes through the portal he rotates all his shields forward while he s like that nothing penetrates them once he s further into the room the shields act like a normal hydra and can be penetrated by most antibarrier weapons aside from ones that don t work on hydras either
am i just blind lol he has shields how have i never noticed that lol
i m not sure this is just a guess but with a pulse rifle and anti barrier equipped i ve noticed it looks like it comes up immune if both of the shields are in front of what you re shooting at which happens a couple of times
fair enough then i can t say i ve experienced this issue as described but maybe i wasn t paying attention closely enough
if a weapon has an intrinsic anti champion effect it can t be overwritten by artifact champion mods
maybe maybe not either way that too has been an issue since its release years ago
just a limitation bungie built into the system only one champion type at a time per weapon
i love waiting for radiant to run out so chill clip works again
tbf wishender had anti barrier added onto it i ma blame spaghetti code
i think the current artifact mod still does over ride it with it unlocked wishender outright refuses to penetrate shields in my experience
anti barrier rounds along with now volatile and radiant allow you to bypass phalanx shields and hydra matrices so whats different
it s the barrier that comes up as it or the baby are porting out you ll know when it happens when you watch for the notches on the health bar
oh right i forgot that s how the priority worked
well it is what it is i guess
those are anti barrier rounds the sword doesn t shoot bullets so it doesn t go past the initial barrier since enemies are behind said barriers with exception to hobgoblins sword not go through
oh that shield ok i know about that
and here i thought i just didn t know how to proc volatile properly
radiant and volatile rounds are not anti barrier rounds they simply have anti barrier capability but alright anyways so arbalest wishender erianas vow then they dont use anti barrier rounds its just intrinsic anti barrier just like lament what makes that different also if lament still hits the champions that are also behind their barriers i will ask again why is that different
none of your logic makes sense at all using a void sword with anti barrier rounds works the exact same as a weapon does it pierces all barriers
i saw another comment saying the glassway boss has two shields that rotate slightly off sync from each other but i ve literally never seen that and never had a problem punching through its barriers with anti barrier rounds i m currently running traveler s chosen or graviton lance on my warlock and it has no issues i ll see it say immune if i m punching through the boss as well though
if lament still hits the champions that are also behind their barriers champions are coded different idk man that s just the way it works x x bullet with anti barrier hits first x continues thru and hits second x x x sword with antibarrier hits first x and stops as it is a melee weapon hitting a target and does not continue through to enemy
wait does it if that s the case i take back everything i said
it s not two different shields rotating off sync the boss has normal hydra shields most of the time but when coming out of the portal it has all of them stacked up in front of it and is fully immune
idk why this matters if both are anti barrier it would make sense for both to be able to counter these things the same just because its melee doesnt mean it shouldnt
while i agree it should it doesn t i was hoping to explain via visuals as to why but i give up
if thats what you were striving for i would recommend not starting by stating it doesn t make sense for it to do that lol
i reset my card only if i lose a match before wins if i get wins without getting mercy d i continue with the card to try for flawless basically i try to get at least half way without using up mercy
or and call me crazy someone could practice at the game and get a better win rate so a flawless card doesn t take hours the amount of people i see in trials solo queue who are seemingly playing with their feet is unbelievable
my experience is that this is optimal i have a theory supported by a lot of anecdotal evidence that the first games skew harder than the last on average due to card based matchmaking and the make up of people with fewer vs more wins on a card
you realize the only reason a non win rate occurs is because matchmaking allows you to if it matched players on historical mmr you d trend much more to these absurd win rates required practice all you want if it just pairs you with equal players it would be meaningless trials allows flawless because poor players exist
literally sandbagged the opposing team times in a row then went up against time flawless killers twice while my teammate didn t know how to do more than damage twice in a row to lose my lighthouse game you are at the complete mercy of the matchmaking yes you could try to get better but sometimes the cards are just not in it for you to win more mercies definitely helps but the discrepancy is very noticeable from match to match solo queue or team queue hardline to moon quality internet speeds
on average the win rate across the population is guaranteed to be by definition even if every single person practices and tryhards their tryhardest that s before we even talk about solo matchmaking trying to balance the teams out
point of the above is that while this strategy may maximize your chances of going flawless at that point on your card you re going to wind up resetting a lot more cards this way and in total you wind up playing more games
it s me i am a poor player i am not even trying to go flawless because it will never happen i just want wins the closest i have gotten is which took me games i didn t have any more time to play that weekend
i m not asking to be put with equal players sbmm would be the death of trials i m asking people to not disrespect their teammates and actually try to get better at pvp before stepping into end game pvp you don t go into a raid don t auto rifled up with a sunset heavy don t do it in trials either
my point is more for people who just hop in trials and have lifetime kds of like people need to learn that they have to take trials seriously
you should re run your numbers assuming something like a chance of winning for the first a for your 4th and a for your final three i m curious to see if a game mercy loss winds up being optimal
well trials has rewards outside of flawless so i can t say i agree many people play just to get rep to get reward track weapons and try a roll or two they re as entitled to the mode as anyone else there s very i d argue next to none incentive to practice 3v3s outside of trials random players aren t spending their time they have to play on getting shredded in 3s for no rewards without outside resources players can t actually know what s good in pvp because of how bungie obfuscates the effects of perks in their descriptions
i hope bungie reduce the amount of wins to reach flawless maybe wins or wins win is too much well i guess play time is all they care right now they don t care about content quality at all
i agree that comp needs a better rewards structure but it has pretty strict sbmm and those people wouldn t be getting shredded they would be playing people at their skill level i get that identifying the meta can be hard but honestly if you re getting destroyed by a certain weapon type over and over maybe use that weapon crazy idea i know trials is an end game activity people should treat it as such anything less is literally just wasting your teams time
it was in d1 really isn t that bad
the only one that does is titan shoulder charge where it gets an increased blinding radius while amplified thunderclap and ballistic slam along with both hunter arc melees have no benefit from being amplified
only two others titan seismic strike will gain increased blinding radius titan thunderclap with point contact canon brace will receive increased lightning strike range
nothing warlock melees specifically state their extended functionalities in their description
hunter gets reload speed
warlocks are the only ones that have additional damage tied to being amplified unfortunately
is thrice an official word now
hunters can get extra damage resist while dodging while amplified and their dodge can come back faster while amplified titans shoulder charge has a bigger blinding radius while amplified
hopefully the leaks are true pccb strikes get jolt
good to know thank you
only for years or so
no that s not true shoulder charge on titan had a much larger blind aoe when amplified and i m fairly certain at least one of the hunter melees are affected by it
thanks
hunter s disorienting blow just grants amplified it doesn t benefit from it
noted thanks
ah that s what i was thinking of thanks
only canon lake of shadows is operation babydog
i miss the rare dialogue where devrim can t stop laughing at the name babydog
what blasphemy i am glad that all i will remember in my mind is operation babydog nobody will take that reality away from me
i could listen to you two talk all day sigh
wish they d go the d1 route of the legacy version new version being playable
the heaviest loss from the arms dealer rework does this say flame turret don t forget about the signal flares long sigh
i just hope if we get titan back we ll be able to hear taeko again they did come down there as a squad of after all
wasn t there a mention of operation piccolo as well
they should really have both versions of the strikes in the game
i really hate this new lake of shadows i know it was done to prevent rushing but my god on master that mid level boss has some stupid hp
we still have operation piccolo from exodus crash
while i understand the sentimentality here and don t get me wrong it is rightfully placed i politely disagree the worst thing about the new lake of shadows strike is that it fucking sucks
i miss the different variations of strikes
why can t they just place the audio in the new strike we don t see them it only over coms is there a reason they can t use the old dialouge
i will not stand for this babydog erasure
hitting 200k on master is pretty much impossible
my teammates whenever i lfg apparently
they removed it
for me it s that i m so sick of threshers at this point not even because they re frustrating i m tired of seeing them everywhere
i m just completely miffed that the adept reward for los is the swarm instead of militia s birthright like c mon bungie you had just one job and you eff it up
is it even possible to get on this nightfall on legendary killed literally everything only at the boss room it says champions have appeared but there are none is this bugged
i miss the cayde dialogue in arms dealer more
no operation easy listening either
legends strike playlist when
or holiday asmr
i raise you amanda hopping in and saying zavala and devrim on the same feed more like operation easy listen n
that it exists the new version of the strike is absolutely punishing through the lack of checkpoints from the damn crossing to the tormentor the threshers seriously fuck those things and the awful escort sections
the worst thing is wiping at the tormentor and then loading back at the check point at the bridge uh what
the tormentor in that small a space on legend and master nf
they killed zavala in more ways than one
and some of the dialogue we got in this strike feels like red war level dialogue example the whole stupid thing about a hornets nest seriously the dialogue in these revamped strikes is not great
i just did the lake of shadows strike and i thought it wasn t that bad
i just hate how the strikes now has almost more cabal than taken also the addition of the random ad threshers on the bridge its just not a great revamp in general
the worst part is all the people who rush by everything and die and then they rush by turrets and die and then they rush threshers and die
lake of shadows was the goat now it s the shit
the worst part is that everyone keeps leaving
wait so the original version is straight up just not available what the fuck they didn t do with it like they did with d1 revamped strikes and have the option for both that s bullshit
honestly this is the greatest line in all of d2 d1 had a bunch of ringers we ve awoken the hive the moon fell to crota dont have time to explain the list is endless d2 has great dialog but nothing tops babydog would love to see this brought back
people whining about the strike is the worst thing about it
this if they wanted to change the encounters that s fine the change in dialogue and addition of the shadow legion was a waste of resources
babydog by far who was to know something tragic would happen to lance but the lines about operation baby dog should have stayed regardless of any changes i don t think the rework was needed it s okay to have a favorite short strike among the plethora of long drawn out strikes we have but bungie feel the need to hammer every nail down evenly i wish they would lean into things the community loves and at times even double down on them sometimes bugs exploits and workarounds are what make something great and fun ie borderlands
wait they got rid of that voice line
deleted
they should ve left the old one in and added the new one it would freshen up the strike experience a lot imo
damn that would have been the best april fools if they changed the strike name on the map to operation babydog
oh shit did not think of that
ahh babydog the sign that a godroll was gonna drop
yeah it s sad to see that go
hey sorry i m out of the loop but why won t that happen
yeah i even have a channel in my discord referencing operation babydog sad day
shout out to a guy i met in ffxiv a few months ago named operation babydog made me spit my drink
my tattoo is going to be so much harder to explain now
i want to be able to put in a wish before all activities so failsafe can be my commentator of adventures
think there will be some devrim dialogue in the future where he calls back to operation babydog as the name generated operation for this strike and he just chuckles from it i think that would be a nice touch for nostalgic purposes
worst thing about it to me was it was the only way you could go back to the old cult of osiris bunker where we found sagira that routes now sealed off in the strike like it is on patrol
also gl gettin 200k score
hate the new lake of shadows lol last boss room has no room for anything but taken
the effort put into the new strikes is making me wish we had gotten new strikes in the last year
and operation easy listening
also somewhat disappointed that they didn t utilize hangman s pass for the rework the sheer length of it might be a bit too long for anything but a sparrow racing section but they could at least use portals to fast track through most of it
threshers need a crit spot but it will never happen on a legendary strike they take gally shots to take down what s a gm going to take
the boos room can eat a bag of dicks tho
babydog why does this say babydog i must have forgotten to reboot the strike name generator babydog eh well it does have a nice ring to it
they should rename it so it s lake of shadows operation baby dog in memoriam
the freaking tormentor room and the reset if you die all the way back to the bridge
the meatball
west virginia s first dog our governor s favorite dog is named babydog our governor names initiatives after this dog so for covid vaccination we all had to do it for babydog to get some free money via prepaid visa cards aka west virginia s operation babydog
bungie sucks ass in general doesn t matter what they put out im just waiting for them to nerf the game to the ground
this and cayde in arms dealer rip chartreuse
all of it i stopped playing it at the tormentor i don t fucking care about the wasted time what a slog what an unfun mess now i get those comments this made me want to uninstall the game
this is just bungo being salty with players and saying let s just throw a little bit of everything to the mix the boss fight is just plain retarded reminds me of bloodborne chalice dungeon fights except those have more room to maneuver
remakes are supposed to improve on the original by enhancing its strengths and shoring up weaknesses the new strike dd the exact opposite and it really makes me wonder what the hell is going on at bungie these days
this has been the shittiest week of destiny between sam being an asshole in partition iron banner ability spam and the new lake of shadows really annoying tormentor room which is probably the single most poorly designed encounter for a game i have ever seen there s just little to no fun for me it s work and i m putting myself through it for fucking heavy at i ve made a huge mistake one i ve made before
removed
first they take away unsanctioned blaster and his cohorts now they take operation babydog what will they take away next
i swear i got operation baby dog when i randomly got it the other day
for gambit they should just have a chance of drifter to not even flip the coin and just pick the worst enemy for us instead of flipping the coin he throws it at you the guardian
im still here flair inspired by this very dialogue
i m not a fan of the reworks i understand it was because these strikes were easy and farmed like crazy when they were gm s but they were also great gm s to start people on too and i m not sure farming should be seen as bad it s engagement after all and that seems to be the driving factor of most of the changes but i understand i might be a minority on this maybe it exactly what we need but did we have to loose the originals if you want to take them out the playlist ok but couldn t we have kept the old ones to be launched from the edz map we ve lost so much already i m getting a little tired of missing more and more things we used to have and also to be honest i would rather new strikes than rehashed old one personally
everything
always thought zavala was lowkey the funniest character the way he says yes when ghost asks if he d be more useful with a bigger chassis is chef s kiss
dialogue destiny report http://dialogue.destiny.report/) it has that line alone with a crap ton of others new ring tone yup just search for baby should list clips
they could have kept the old version in regular strike playlist to mix it up same with arms dealer
the new lake of shadows strike
no the worst part is the fucking awful boss arena
we ll always have zavala going badass and calling out operation oboe
while we re on the subject of dialog we d like to see in destiny i d love to see drifter occasionally fumble the coin flip and curse and frantically set up the enemy flip ah shit uhhh hold on i can t find ah scorn on the field
operation baby dog except all the lines for the rest of the strike are just replaced by devrim continuing to laugh hysterically at zavala
removed
this is the reason why bungie continues to put cringe hur dur dialogue in the game we have players who find it hilarious
my favorite is either that one or holliday s operation easy listening followed by zavala telling her to get off the official military channel xd
more like operation easy listening
i mean if we still have cayde talking during exodus crash
zavala s reaction to amanda was hilarious too

if its a matter of space they could remove a couple of the battlegrounds only have one of each type
that s what i ve been saying
ghost why would you pick it up cayde so she could find where it does the most damage smart ghost is it hawthorne you re right she grabbed it cayde it s what i would ve done hawthorne it s not what anyone should have done
pretty much all of arms dealer dialogue is a huge loss so many gems in it sounded like a nice dunk
it was by the book the whole way
i ve been having the same issue but with grapple i bind uncharged melee and grenade to the same button to avoid using the ropedart during grapple except sometimes when i try to grapple it just does the uncharged melee despite having a grapple charge super random when it does it too
i noticed this today trying to use warlock strand melee sometimes had to press twice i m using the charged melee keybind
i have had a similar experience but only when when using strand my guess is that it happens because there is a cooldown involved or i have been suppressed it seems to work fine when i space out its use
i was doing the challenge last night in master and we had a dumb death on the second floor we went to the catapults for the third floor and i said we got our clown moments out of the way we got this then four people bumped into each other on the way up to the third floor and three people died i grabbed dark and went to light and instantly died on contact with the stairs
absolutely asinine that multiple mechanics in this game are tied to fps and players get punished for having nice computers and monitors
this challenge just sucks in general we got to the final floor yesterday and got locked out from doing damage several times that bug is getting old
the challenges for this raid so far just seem silly compared to other raids kings fall aside from warpriest challenge incorporated challenges into mechanics imagine if oryx challenge required the runner to just skip stepping on one of the invis platforms or something
the entire encounter is an absolute freaking nightmare to try to do the challenge on lose a run because guy with the buff gets yeeted feet in the air lose a run because guy with the buff gets yeeted feet down lose a run because guy with the buff just flat out dies on the catapult lose a run because guy lands on bottom floor and has to spend seconds running back up might as well wipe now no skating across they can t fix the frame dependent death smashers but they ll spend plenty of time making sure you can t do anything else if you don t yeet you meet defeat lose a run because adds teleport feet to the right and your antibarrier shot misses colossus one shot stomps guy because his frames are above lose two runs in a row because you can softlock the encounter by shooting the last node on each floor before the aura shows up finally do it get to end avoid random death boopers teleporting adds and softlocks nobody on team got challenge failed at any point one chest appears no second chest no triumph no notification of any kind this is the buggiest mess i ve seen bungie put out since spire of stars final encounter and that s saying something
i really hate that encounter because of that it s the only encounter in any raid where i don t want to do the mechanics because it isn t fun run planets sure suppress taniks no problem depose at rhulk heck yeah constantly jumping and parkour through that god awful encounter is not fun especially the second floor
i still don t understand why bungie would create physics based launchers when they know full well that the physics in their game are wonky the cabal launchers and the launchers in the vex network for example lift and place you right down where the game wants you to be they aren t physics based i don t understand why bungie didn t just do this with the ron launchers
it s a terrible challenge on an encounter which is heavily reliant on physics adding to the list of woes often the crystal blends in the environment as you are moving across floors making it harder to spot and shoot from the other side
are there any tips for using these on warlock i feel like i can t consistently cross on that class in particular
yesterday my group of experienced raiders plenty day ones and master challenges went into a normal mode root of nightmares to practice the challenge mechanics without the distraction of the master difficulty enemies we spent a full hour getting fucked by the buggy catapults before we gave up and decided to just blow through the encounter like we always do this challenge is inconsistent even on normal mode bungie please fix the catapults
honestly one of the worst encounters in any raid full stop i d rather do confluxes over that shit
i don t want to be that guy and i m not saying other people don t have this experience but as long as we re walking slowly backwards into the launcher my group never seems to have any problems with them or this challenge for that matter
embarassing that bungie released it in this state in the first place core mechanic like this should work properly in brand new raid
deleted
you forgot to mention the bug that doesn t make the auras pop before clearing the last ads on each floor so fucking frustrating i don t know what they were thinking when they put this fucking encounter in it s dire and not fun at all having to restart on 3rd floor when it happens makes me want to uninstall it s obvious this fucking shit encounter prompted them to remove physics deaths
do you walk backwards when you get launched i haven t had any problems since i started doing that can t speak to the weekly challenge but i normally love running in scission
while it s not ideal having only hunters be runners and capping their framerate to makes the catapults consistent since capping my frames i have not had a catapult bug out a single time it s unpleasant to say the least but it works
this encounter and the jumping puzzle are the flawless killers
ran it twice with my raid team last night once on master for the adept triumph then again for just a basic normal clear we did it exactly the same way both times and was successful for the master version but had the challenge failed message go off about a second after we got the encounter cleared message like we were all just standing there waiting for the chest to spawn after killing the last adds and it just appeared as the chest was spawning the failed message appeared super weird and disappointing considering we were literally all facing away from the catapults to make sure we didn t accidentally shoot one
imagine if they just used the same code and physics that the man cannons in halo worked then there would be zero problems all they had to do was copy and paste
holding my move backwards key as i stand on the launch pad has pretty much stopped any wonky jumps we still get the odd errant launch but my fireteams have all had a lot of success in eliminating any jump issues with this method
strange i did the 2nd encounter so many times and got a person launched wrongly like times out of like attempts
i don t understand you need to use the catapults in that encounter regardless of whether you re doing the challenge or not
if you can t use the catapults consistently it s a skill issue all you have to do is just keep backing up into the catapult and then shoot the node and you ll always have enough height to make it across safely
i have found consistent success at all launchers by making sure my char is nuzzle at the back of the pad before shooting may take an extra half second but yet to land on wrong floor or the like
look man i run the game at above 200fps the lift only sucks on warlock and even at that there s a way to consistently get the jump no problem it s not that big of a deal
did the master challenge on warlock and hunter and had issue with the catapult or any bug
i havent died to the catapults one time and we been running it every week
the raid team needs to be fired for accepting this
i did it without problems on the master times whoever is being catapulted has a big skill issue
it sucks but just drop your frames to it is insane how smooth they are at frames i did this and forgot to reset them util i got to the jumping puzzle and though it was going to smooth yup was still at frames
lol there is nothing wrong with them use them the right way
they already said fixes are on the way for launch pads and the bug at the end of the floors patience or read or both
it took me and my raid team like min trying to do this stupid challenge
i still look at the dev blog about this and them laughing about how the launchers didn t work and then it seems like it was never fixed like wtf you guys have to know that there s a subset of the community that finds this infuriating to just be tossed to your death
it turns the challenge into a root of nightmares imo
i m honestly surprised that the challenge wasn t that you could only run once per encounter there s three floors and two runners that equals guardians forcing everyone to participate in the mechanics
we failed the challenge when someone died because it spawned their orb on the other side we also failed when i died and my orb stayed there it was an interesting way to fail
lfg group and i struggled for hours losing our sanity we had the launcher send us to lower and higher floors when not needed we ve had them send us to a nearby wall and instantly kill us i even had my character wiggle side to side mid air as if the game could make up how it wanted to kill me
it s literally a cabal raid too just give us the regular cabal launchers and we ll probably be fine
i hate the launchers but they weren t our problem yesterday i actually commented to my team how much better they felt because i m not getting consistently fucked when using them anymore but the ads blowing up near the launcher nugget setting it off and causing challenge failed was very infuriating
i m sure someone else has said this just make sure you back up all the way into the catapult before activating it i ve never had an issue with the catapults doing that besides collision with team mates moving floors sometimes
they need to just redesign the entire second encounter
stand in front of the launcher and start back pedaling into it as the crystal gets shot success rate guaranteed you ll land deep into the opposite side you won t even be close to the edge
maybe i m misremembering but didn t they talk about the launchers and say they made them inconsistent to give grapple a chance
i locked fps since i switch back and forth from my laptop and am too lazy to change it and i have never had an issue
limit your frame rate to if on pc fixes most of the elevator issues
my team did it yesterday and failed the challenge the second that we killed the last shielded enemies on the top floor none of us shot the nut
found an entirely different bug with them when trying the challenge yesterday as well at least two times the other runner and i watched a crystal open after being shot by a person from the other side without actually triggering the launch
bungie no
that d help the player and it s likely super complicated so we ll get a fix maybe mid next season or later
i wouldn t mind or care if they replaced them with cabal launchers
the fix is limit your frames to fps or if feeling frisky 60fps at idk say i have a successful launch rate at fps though it makes my head hurt
my raid group usually gets challenges done we persevere this challenge is a diaper genie full of butts switch the challenge to something other than those gawddamn buggy launchers ffs bungie
genuinely curious as to what classes yall play on and what platform purely anecdotal but i and the guy on my team that run the second encounter havent once been screwed over by the catapults i play on ps4 and him on ps5 both hunters we both are completely still when shooting edit reading down it apparently has been confirmed its tied to frame rate damn that is bogus good luck to yall hope they fix it soon
i don t understand why they can t just change these catapults to their standard man cannons
you mentioned lunch
unfortunately you just have to accept the shit mechanic to get it done played with some people who insisted we should stack people at once to get to the next level and it never worked we got it done when we sent people up first and then the last
how we got it done have two dedicated runners one starting on light one dark have one of the ad clears on each side be dedicated for shooting the crystal for the opposing side launcher when needed for runners minimise the crossing grab buff cross do plate grab buff do plate grab buff cross do plate grab buff do plate grab buff cross do plate kill remaining ads when moving between floors send players first then have one of those players turn around and shoot the crystal to bring up their third player repeat until done middle floor the runners will start on opposite sides from the side they started once we got this rhythm it went very quickly
malicious design strikes again the more you fall off those catapults the more you have to potentially restart the encounter and therefore the more time you add to their playtime metrics why fix it when it s making your charts look better
i don t recommend trying to launch all people to the next floor at once lol if one is early the shot is harder to hit while you re flying it can t be corrected if you mess up and end up with both groups on the same side have your shooter on each side stay off the launcher and two groups of two up then the shooters can each ride up solo with someone across on the next floor activating their launcher it s slower but avoids errors with timing or someone not making it
am i the only one who has maybe experienced an issue once or twice ran that raid probably over times
i kinda lost my love for playing and damage being tied to frame rate was a big part of it just got burnt out on all the little bugs i don t understand why they didn t prioritize fixing them must be really deep in the engine code
walk backward as you shoot your your buddy s jump crystal it chips you up and makes the jump magnitudes more consistent it would be better if they just worked better but they stuck this will help
theres also the thing where the last orbs when both players have finished running just refuse to give the buff out forcing you to reset multiple runs now my team has first tried every encounter before and after 2nd but gotten stuck on it for like attempts cause of this bug in some runs and sometimes it d on happen on the 3rd floor final orbs so that hurts even more
good tip press s or pull your joystick back against the launcher to get more consistent height
motes in garden tho
so glad i don t care about the adept weapon so definitely skipping this
press and hold your backwards movement button before and while you launch it will dramatically improve the consistency of the cannon this man cannon is not an different than the one in dares it s a bit suspect but you can game it
this is always so interesting to me because i ve honestly never had an issue with the catapults make sure back up right into before triggering it and it always works except for warlocks usually because of the floof but titan and hunter are piece of cake
if you know how the launchers work then it isn t a problem this weeks challenge was much easier than last weeks imo we got it done in tries
the worst thing about this challenge is that if you run right die and for a totally strange and nosense mechanism your light get teleported left when you revive the challenge fails yes the game counts the light teleport to the wrong size as a try to bypass the challenge
when my team saw what the challenge was we laughed at how simple it was until we ran it and the shenanigans started we cleared it times without seeing challenge failed using a mix of runners shooting for each other or having a dedicated ad clearer do the shooting spent a total of hours trying to get one completion after the 3rd false finish we tried again straight away same strat with ad clearers shooting same as the run before and we cleared it with the challenge intact we even had an attempt fail on us while light and dark runners were doing the node same side node no jumps at all no stray bullets challenge failed i was going to do all characters this week i d rather spend the time farming spoils instead even on the normal mode for double drops we arent bothering with the challenge
i don t know why bungie didn t use the resonance lift like they had in the campaign
my clan spent far too long on this for reasons like i got shot up a level i didn t make it i went a billion miles an hour and splatted ect ect i wish they would have pushed the other challenges out first then tried to fix this issue before the challenge
i find the number of complaints about this single topic absolutely hilarious because none of the common complaints ever happened to me not a single one ran it several times now with multiple characters especially warlock and the catapults work flawlessly
the launchers consistently fire my warlock into the wall below the opposite platform i read that maybe it has something to do with framerate framerate is turning into the telesto of general gameplay
these launchers aren t that much of a problem the only problem i ve had with launchers is from my own mistakes you have to position yourself all the way back into the launcher if you re any closer to the edge you get the inconsistency for warlocks and titans press the jump button when you reach the peak of your launch trajectory for hunters it s even easier since all jump options give you significant height when going to the next level launch each side at different times so you don t bump into each other and do not press the jump button let the launcher do all of the work when going to another level super simple to use these launchers
there is a fix drop your frames to and hold s walk backwards who cares if the game is unplayable at because the jumpers only job in that encounter is to run the orbs as fast as possible so why do you need the fps only players need to run that encounter on challenge mode so only players dropping their frames isn t asking much at all
why did you have people on one lift asking for trouble
twice on the final see on the final floor we got screwed due to bumpers both times were with me where the first time it threw me short and the 2nd time it threw me just high enough where my chest collided and bounced me up and got bunge physic d a bunch and couldnt hit last seed both situations were recoverable if it wasnt for the other bugs with this encounter namely the soft lock if you complete one side before the other and carry the buff over in this case the other runner didnt get screwed by the bumpers and dunked
and then there s warlocks you have fps or you have fps irrelevant straight to the pit you go
solution my team used was to go down to fps otherwise physics tied to fps would do all sorts of dumb things to think they might be building another game with this engine
worst part is people will downvote and try to justify it no cap there is no excuse for not addressing this and also not even acknowledging its an issue cmon guys
this
they got tired of the pc master race debate and decided to fuck us
colony
someone is shooting the buffs too soon then they never break if the team waits for both of them to flash
our team s solution is to not kill any of the adds rebuff until both sides are dunked
my group ended up using stasis to knock the enemies off cause it s stupid
they blow the first challenge is decently easy but if a random point of damage kills the tormentor that s it the second one is just awful though the warpriest challenge on master was quite hard but you can see where you messed up and improve really fun being at the mercy of your fps guys 0_0
love how the game pushes you to learn unintended interactions like wellskating and shatter skating because the actual mechanics work so fucking piss poor lmao
2nd encounter of ron is one of my least favorite in the game i ll do any other part in that raid but running on 2nd nah man miss me with that
it s actually extremely fun as a shatterskate hunter or a rampants titan wellskating is less consistent because any random enemy near you can eat your well and you re stuck being a runner as warlock but yes if i had to actually use the jump pads i d hate it
someone mentioned it during a raid but it really feels like they are pushing you to use strand got booped in the wrong direction doesn t matter just grapple to safety they even said in a dev talk video that they knew the launchers don t work consistently and just went eh ship it
man i dont know about that season of splicer i lost many a flawless runs by just walking into the launcher launcher wouldnt launch me or anything i would just die then cabal launchers i assume you dont mean the grav lift in the shadow legion ship in the campaign right because that thing would just randomly drop me to the point i thought i was supposed to jump to a different bridge
on playstation which doesn t seem to have the issues pc has with the launchers if you put your back directly to the plate you can make every jump but you might need to boost to do it if you want a bit of extra height then keep walking back even when you re against the plate and you ll launch higher look up to go higher also seems to have an impact
constantly hold backwards until you launch
make sure your back is flush with the launcher
heat rises icarus dash eager edge transversive steps a prayer to whoever you think will hear it
theres a forsaken weapon pack dlc i think theres a newer bundle that puts the 30th and the forsaken pack together there s one on steam anyway
is this worth it it seems quite expensive just for exotics
resilience is basically the stat everyone has to prioritize these days
the chests that spawn from the intermediary terminal overload bosses the tank during round when it s in lh for example always give blues even when they shouldn t
just gotta swing by the hangar and pick it up from ama oh
to clarify it s a timed exclusivity tho i m not seeing just how long that exclusivity lasts

looking like a mcdouble with extra mustard
sorry destiny players only want black shaders
i d drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable
spring showers turns your guardian yellow ehehhehheheheheehheheheehee
when do they re typically drop first of the month
looks like mcdonalds wanted to sponsor this to go with the mccrispy
if you equip it to nighthawk exotic helmet without any ornaments than it keeps its original color scheme but also makes the yellow parts actually gold
it s not showing up for me at rahool
why would anyone go through the hassle of twitch prime just to look like hulk hogan
the day has come when they are locking shaders behind prime i was fine with the exotics emblems and ornaments because they were obtainable ingame but unique shaders sad to see
ketchup mustard false advertising on the preview looking ass
i only want it if its black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow
it hasn t been twitch prime for almost years
i m glad it looks like shit so i m not tempted to get twitch prime
it s a bad shader
guess i ll just keep using the same or shaders until something good comes out
this color doesn t work for me brother
where do we claim twitch drops
damn it s bugged for me even when i click partner rewards history it says it didn t go through and won t let me claim it again
wait are there twitch drops for watching streamers or do you have to buy twitch prime to get this
if they re releasing shaders through prime now this would be a good avenue for them to release older promotional shaders that have been unavailable for a long time like ones from overseas promotionals i think most players would much rather have shaders like that instead of stuff like worthless legendary ships or sparrows that usually make up the tail end of these bundles
just for now this shader will be available at some point
how do i claim it
ronald mcdonald time
just claimed mine not bad actually aha
i wish people outside of amazon countries could get all this stuff i absolutely hate stuff like this that is limited to certain areas
looks like i can finally make a custodes mog
will rahool wear the amanda mask at halloween now
and i just canceled my prime membership too why am i such a shader whore resubscribes
the month i cancelled prime and they do this to me
where do you get them now
too soon
mine actually says go to master rahool so they ve updated it since last time
one of hawthorn s voicelines still talks about having to go see amanda in the hanger
good riddance
now i m sad again
have shaders ever been exclusive to the prime rewards before
ronald mcdonald look n ass
i feel like with the right gear that could look good
oh boy ketchup and mustard
the spring shower is piss
thank you for showing it
that s hot
ah yes another shader that looks nothing like the icon lmao
it looks good on the whispers of the victor or whatever it s called glowy olympic armor it s gold with red glowy parts kinda smoldering red look to the glowing parts i like it for gold month
wtf the icon has like a tiny fleck of gold and red in it but actually just makes everything gold and red
i just got free prime for a month didnt even know this existed thanks for the link
if only prime music wasn t complete dogshit
yummy mustard and ketchup
thank you so much
black or oppressively pink for me
hahahah i too try to relate anything that happens in life to a seinfeld episode
pretty sure it s every days if i m remember correctly so weeks
too bad the shader is mcshitty
same i m tempted to say it is an old bug not letting people redeem from amanda but this is the first time i ve been unable to redeem rewards so it may be something new
where you ingame when you redeemed it on the twitch prime page because you have to go back to the character select screen for it to show up
it s timed exclusive not exclusive only the timing however no idea plus they ve had a shader and emblem locked behind gifting subs before so prime reward isn t that surprising
too bad you get yellow and black shake it up a little
just need amazon prime
do you have amazon prime
dost thou harbor the abilities of amazon most prime
who cares it s free
until it looks really good on that one gun or piece of armor
don t work yourself into a happy meal brother
neither this has nothing to do with twitch not sure why op put it in the title this is just an amazon prime perk only need to have amazon prime and you can claim it via this link https://gaming.amazon.com/dp/amzn1.pg.item.779ba16d-a1d3-4434-bb83-44048fac4615?ingress=amzn
rahool
ew
they have not and even if it s timed it still saves bd if you have prime
shaders not sure but emblems certainly have been so i wouldn t say it s impossible
there have been shaders exclusive to gifting subs on twitch
yeah i don t think i need to figure out twitch prime for that
where my hamburgler bros out tho
something that makes destiny fashion weird is that different armour sets have completely different colour channels for shaders some shaders like the dawning ones make most armour sets show the second or fourth colour in the primary position while the primary colour that you wanted gets put on a tiny detail and that s not even counting the many shaders that will show for example all black and grey yet the primary colour is a bright orange that isn t even shown on the colour palette
it makes nighthawk look like its default color scheme but the yellow is replaced with actual gold and the weird brown part on the back becomes a nice blood red color
as is tradition
this is the way
it looks like there was another one that ends tomorrow too so you re double just in time
yea quite unfortunate
if it aint garish it s not something i ll cherish
ymmv
i redeemed it before logging on at all i even went back to title screen a few times
they ve also put shaders behind silver only bundles like the vog shaders or that new bad juju themed one
don t have it no urge to get it
nope never wanted or needed it
nope never needed it
you should just because its free doesn t mean it should be bad
it looks pretty good on nighthawk
deaths is not enough for master rahool
cool so it s broken again for me lol didn t get last months after claiming and forgot to look for it
they knew what they were doing with amanda when they made it rahool sadge
trueeeeeeee but this would require me to actually log into twitch that fate is too terrible to comprehend
what was the watchers shade shader from
figure out like you think it s complicated
it s pretty easy if you re already subscribed to amazon prime just have to click the link in the rewards home log in to your bungie account and it ll appear at rahool in the tower for you
good shout just picked it up would ve forgotten to grab that one without the reminder thank you
if it ain t bright we re gonna fight
sadly it gets worse in pvp using strand the targeting on the melee is bonkers and just throws you off in a direction completely disorienting you and making it difficult to track your enemy after you ve just shot past them and you re a sitting duck by the time you can super to suspend them and close that gap
arcstrider and they re combination blow exist which especially when combined with one two punch and assassin s cowl invalidates any potential melee titans could use
it s so hard to locate my on fire hammer amongst the on fire enemies and on fire sunspots and the on fire fire
hearing it explode makes my heart sink
i prefer a big above my hammers location saying over here dum dum
it doesn t help when it bounces more than an enhanced weighted throwing knife after you hit enemies sometimes
that s why i run the fragment that gives melee energy back when i kill scorched enemies if i lose the hammer or can t find it i just fist everything until the hammer recharges incandescent weapons work too but i have synthos so everything dies to a fire punch roaring flames also makes it so basic melees count as a powered melee kill so you can generate orbs like crazy
losing your hammer in the chaos is apart of the balancing
titans out here looking like velma trying to find her glasses
i want the dune hammer back it was great feeling like thor
monte carlo users have you guys seen my ha nevermind i made a new one
bungie needs to make exotic gauntlets that let you recall the bonk hammer by holding the melee button
its a fair trade off from getting to use it unlimited get carried away and you pay i usually don t spec into strength and have no issues just put a glaive on for when you run out
i still think the most effective way to nerf loreley s splendor would have been to give us an exotic that let us recall the hammer it d be fused to my body until the end of time
the destiny version of mufasa dying is having your hammer blow up in your face right as you find it
just run finisher it gives bonk back when you finish someone
we need an exotic that treats it like thor s hammer so it can return to us automatically then nothing shall stop the bonk
it s so stupidly good as is i don t think bungie is interested in making hammer even easier to use
trust me this is not even close to priority if ammo orbs etc falls off the map and disappear it was intentional they do not care
they should nerf bonk hammer so that you get some melee energy back if you pick it up but not a full refresh
i don t think bungie likes maps xd
absolutely agree
it should just make an icon similar to a grenade indicating its location imho
they have ui stuff for grenades coming at you why not just add it there so it points to where the hammer is
hammer should return to you with the same catch it mechanic that the kunai for the strand hunter
tbh im not a fan of needing to go play fetch with the hammer id love an rxotic that makes it explode on contact or lets you recall it and use it again on a cooldown
holding melee for seconds should make it recall back to you mjolnir style
run with a fellow solar titan if they throw their hammer near you or hit you you ll get a refresh and they can still pick it up for themselves
as a hunter main who just started trying bonk i agree i can t settle on an exotic for it if anyone has some ideas i hate the way synthos look
no it s already incredibly useful by being recoverable having to visually find it is fair
i hate losing my hammer happens constantly especially when there are sunspots and enemies everywhere radar icon is a great idea
and the obligatory well sheee when it sails off the edge of random cliffside otherwise lethal sheer drop and into oblivion
i swear to god that fucking thing is sentient and hates me
i find myself yelling hammer like thor from his first movie when i can t find it
i want an exotic that uses up my grenade charge to make the hammer fly back into my hand like mjlnir damaging everything it hits on the way back the regular healing of the hammer ability is untouched plus on top you get restoration for a short period of time
i m all in in this the worst is when you re playing an activity with a fireteam and you lose it and you have to say hang on guys let my melee regen my hammer before we start the encounter so everyone stands and waits for me
reminds me of day one raid during wich i was a runner my brother add clearer but he lost his hammer so i calmly says i ll give him mine and threw it at him and the rest of our squad was like lol whatever wait you can do that none of them play titan they were so confused
this is why i use the finisher that refunds melee so when i lose my hammer i just finish an enemy for my hammer back
no it s too powerful you squint your eyes like the rest of us have to when we get bonked on the face
quick tip get as close as possible to enemies and just aim your hammer to the ground you re going to hit the enemy and get your hammer back instantly
a little objective icon that s always visible would make sense
i don t normally have this problem since i can see the general location its going to land but when it falls of the map oh god
yeah the whole place can get really really orange when you get to work as a solar titan
accurate depiction of the sauce
on fire fire i m dead upvoted
when you re mid slide to pick it up only to have it splode inches from your feet
alternatively hearing it explode thinking you ve wasted your hammer only to see a kill pop up in the killfeed
give it word bubbles at all times weee when thrown bonk when hitting an enemy
yeah but it s great when it bounces between two tanky enemies and stunlocks then obliterates them instantly
pls let me be a fallen dreg after you lose your hammer
buddy the wording needs to be looked at
honestly with the orbs and the sunspots you don t even need the fragment to get it back fast
was thinking this as well you already get instantly melee back by picking it up and other bonuses like healing and radiance by hitting targets why should it also be made mega easy to find i wouldn t be totally against this ofcourse but it just seems a lot for already great ability like why not instead improve the smash hammer attack
ong
look with your special eyes my hammer
with a dozen sunspots burning sometimes we have less chance of finding it
my hammer i can t be seen without my hammer
yeah fuck severance enclosure i need my lightning hammer back
same with hallowfire heart
and the hammer damages any enemy in the return path thor style
thank you for making me want something that i never thought of before in a way that will keep me up at night
sure but hammers would need a damage nerf then
way too op
never using a glaive lol
have it return to you mjolnir style you could recall it and if it hits anyone it does damage too that would be wicked
you could balance that by letting the exotic eat the grenade charge for the hammer call
i don t lose it a ton it s just my baby and it s to find sometimes
who hurt you
average starfire user
yeah cause melee builds in destiny weren t deader than shit already
it s pretty easy to catch it but the sauce i lose it
i mean it s fair to go fetch if it gives you your full melee backon pickup
you need the siva looking ornament
bonk titan here never used synthos my suggestion try severance enclosure
personally i actually really enjoy using sunfire furnace for solar titan really helps with keeping those insane abilities up also helps for when i inevitably loose the hammer down a ditch or in the firery haze
but my hammer
i m really dramatic when i lose my hammer it s like i lost my best friend in an accident
like heat rises but consuming grenade gives melee back
with my t2 melee
yeah you can straight up give him it or do the cheeky spam next to each other for duping it
it s mainly for solo content when i m in the thick of it and can t see anything because of collossus
i got that a few times when i inadvertently equipped a lasting impression rocket in pvp i thought my internet connection was bugged them post death i saw him explode and i realized
the hit needs to be bonk and bam and ka pow like in old comics or the 60s batman show
ahhh the old gl in a spider tank trick
an apt name for that comment
i know what i said
the problem with that is it s a throwing hammer designed to be thrown but if you chuck it at a guy that isn t right in your face it frequently gets lost or flies a million miles away discouraging people from throwing it why are you giving us a ranged melee ability that punishes us for using it at range why even make it a throwing hammer at this point just make it a heavy melee strike that goes on cooldown if it whiffs or let me hold the ability to call it back but it consumes a chunk of the ability charge alternatively give us the exotic everyone wants that calls it back with a elemental shards style cooldown so we can actually use it for what it s intended
to be fair if you ve got a dozen sunspots you should get the hammer back quick
yo this would be epic
one of the best weapon classes in pve currently it s your loss especially vexcalibur
i wonder if that kind of thing would be hard to implement i don t think it would but i don t really know coding much less destiny coding
i did apparently this was a joke prolly should have s ed it like bungie changes the hammer to beacon but monkey paws the shit out of it with something like my suggestion i ll take the downvotes with honor lol
not in grandmaster
i m a siva beliva
how about the bonk audio from tv puppet pals when it played during dexter s laboratory https://youtu.be/y5myzgkmz4a
and they can just reuse nimbus s dialogue he basically said all those things in the campaign
fr bro
well shield throw is based around cooldown as well and you get refunds on that ability to fetch it hammer back is a great boon imo
very true the good old roast of shame where you re sitting there sulking while you cook in a sunspot for the boosted ability energy regen because you lost your hammer
the hit registration is shit the weapons feel clunky don t like the weapons not using them
if you re a syntho titan an uncharged melee literally does more than a glaive now because of the nerfs
i thought synthoceps don t work with glaives
checkpoints would be nice i got disconnected and booted to the starting screen at second phase of the final boss on legendary and having to do the whole thing again was annoying
i was just on the last phase of the vexcalibur boss and got booted back to the start screen yeah i about threw my pc out the window think i ll have to wait a couple days to let my rage subside wtf
i support this but i don t think it will ever happen i understand time constraints without being a parent but at rhe same time these missions aren t supposed to take all day
to me the issue with the fight is that each of the darkness zones are too long a lot of time is wasted when you fail late in the fight particularly on the final boss imho a lot of length would be chopped off if you split the first two into two and the boss into three
there is a triumph for beating it in under minutes same as seraph shield did telling you around how much time this activity is projected to take with the nature of how the catalysts are earned a checkpoint system would be instantly abused by the more rewards for less effort crowd there to my knowledge has never been an exotic mission with checkpoints you could save for later for most of them i think that would have ruined the experience i understand stuff happens disconnects happen life calls but you can always try again later and do so when you know you will have the time to dig in and figure it out
also make checkpoints available by completing a dungeon raid the same week would be nice since they are making encounters farmable lately
i d consider myself pretty good at the game and legend avalon solo took me minutes to complete with a team it was at least an hour plus an even more pertinent benefit of this is that you ll be able to invite players that disconnect or fill in if someone has to leave currently you can t invite people to avalon at all so if something goes wrong you have to restart the entire thing
was my first run through it going solo and learning everything progressing took me a little over hours got leveled by you know who without his you know what lol
given catalysts are from a higher difficulty level they can just chuck on a checkpoint system disabled modifier and call it a day
well the triumph is for doing it in an impressive amount of time a blind solo run under level took me hours it s almost long enough to be a dungeon
not bugged on mnk but ever since the nerf it s been hot garbage
not sure if related but i did find that recoil gets bad when using ornaments not sure if you are using one it s an old bug so can t certain if it s this https://twitter.com/ooogypoogy/status/1390834170767753216?s=46&t=olyvvfazorqncgwsi7gd6g
is the bug while hip firing
can you post video
i dont have video but if i ever do get it to happen i will save it on ps5 and the post it it usually happens in crucible and yes i sometimes use last word in pve i like the gun a lot
i use it on pve too but i ve gone for months without using it coincidentally i used it this morning and i felt something was off but i though it d just be me but by your wording i wouldn t know what you mean
did you do it whislt logged into the game if so relaunch also look around under general not every new emblem shows on the last page but if need be give it minutes
it worked i just had to reboot the game thank you
unless it s changed after the first reset you could just collect what you want and reset the rank without getting everything at least that s what i ve always done for vanguard resets around gm time and i m resets deep
in wish ender we trust
duo feels nice never did trio so dont know but strand titan with blinding nades makes life easy
before they nerfed it was the sweet spot but i just helped two and it wasn t bad one well and two strand titans we made shit tons of orbs and spammed supers i two manned with bubble titan and gryf hunter
i had most success on warlock 1st encounter i used void with devour nova warp can easily knock the wyvern bosses off the edge at the end for the 2nd i used well with heartshadow for the invis you can pop the well once the timer gets to secs and it still protects you in the lower part for the 3rd go with starfire and witherhoard you can cheese the 2nd phase with anti barrier weapons i d say go with a team of or since you get revives
i haven t need to do it since they made it easier but my usual fireteam was doing strand warlock strand hunter and void hunter and made pretty easy work of it there are so many enemies in the encounters that you can severely abuse all the orb making mechanics to regain ability energy and health use void weapons machine guns for volatile rounds and the artifact mod that makes an orb when you break a matching shield there are so many minotaurs 1st encounter assign one person to be the puzzle solver they can hang behind the block in the back of room and are basically totally safe the have enough time to kill snipers and help crowd control between shooting the shapes your void hunter can go invisible and read the next patterns safely when it advances to the next puzzle there is no timer just chill near the back and enemies will just funnel to you you can pretty much stay out of the line of sight of all but one sniper at any time on the final leg just suspend tether and mow everything down just don t rush in too far x200b 2nd encounter definitely the hardest part but not too bad with decent timing and crowd control there is part of the arena along that outside that is lower than the rest and behind a wall everyone hang back there wait for the fanatics to come to you just light them up at least on person should be specifically on crowd control duty suspend and disorienting grenade launcher have that person do everything they can to kill or shut down the snipers and suspend blind the wyverns when you make your way to the middle once you are in the boss phase find that lower spot again the boss can t hit you if you re close to the wall it s helpful to have someone switch to an arc weapon during this phase and make orbs by breaking the harpy shields they spawn infinitely it seems just do damage when you can rinse and repeat x200b 3rd encounter nothing fancy again one person as the puzzle shooter i switched to trinity ghoul here to make tons of orbs off the harpy shields for my teammates everything is pretty straightforward here in the final phase you can get behind the milk pillars and the boss won t shoot directly through them
i did a cowl hunter build for first encounter shoot shape dodge punch invis repeat switched to omni hunter for 1st boss w riptide forbearance and anarchy to trickle the boss down while chaining invis and for final boss i stayed on omni w witherhoard a trace and an explosive light hothead for final boss i just stuck him with witherhoard and the occasional rocket until second phase swapped to wishender for cheese w special ammo finder on swapped back to the witherhoard when the cheese is finished pick up the special and do the same as i did phase
omni hunter with devour makes it a joke imo but then again i m used to the invis gameplay loop so it s second nature to me the hardest part is helping my teammates not die twice lol
i ve done it solo each week void warlock with contraverse vortex grenades void lmg carries the first two encounters the shield break artifact mod is also rly good for unlimited orbs in the first two encounters 1st encounter hobgoblins gotta die so you can see the patterns without dying stand behind pillar for first part stand beside pillar on lower level during second part 2nd encounter i fight on left side standing behind blocks kill hobgoblins as they spawn and dunk data asap but don t get in the hole either burst down one wyvern or cc with blinding nades or chill clip glaive shield can work in the hole as well to save you from wyvern shots during dps i hide on the lower level and chuck grenades super and take my time 3rd encounter cheese all the way whittle him down for first phase while killing adds as they spawn 2nd phase use antibarrier weapons or wishender to get him to a sliver and then do the puzzle use cover to get those cyclops down 3rd phase get behind one of the vex waterfalls and peak shot him to death wishender can shoot through the waterfall too haha
what do you mean by they nerved it it is easier in a team now or harder
easier from the most recent patch notes https://www.bungie.net/7/en/news/article/destiny-2-hotfix-7-0-0-7): combatant health scaling for two and three player fireteams reduced in the season legendary exotic mission
good to know thanks

incorrect i got my vex and collective obligation by farming raids on the same character while they were featured painfull but possible
was it necessary to downvote after i said fairly certain
mancannons that s all they had to do
they really aren t that bad i use strand melee for titan and icarus dash hunter is easy haven t had any issues since this plus look up
i mean i do like jumping across the gap thematically its pretty neat i do make sure i have a sword equipped if i m running through normally for challenge haha normally i just well shatter rampant across for speed and consistency though edit spelling s hard
the overshooting thing seems to be tied to frames i m on ps5 and i pretty much never have that happen i do undershoot sometimes though but i think that s because i didn t get backed up enough to the launcher the other runner on our team is on pc though and he has to lower his frames for the challenge this week because it just kept screwing him
man if only we could use some sort of grappling hook
prophesy and dares show off the hidden air tunnels really wouldn t have been far fetched to just use those i don t think we d have been bummed not having to shoot a little paperweight as a raid mechanic
i would ve cried
my frustration comes more from the ones that take you up levels to the next floor since you can end up overshooting or falling i don t have a problem crossing though
when i m on warlock i have to go into settings and turn lock my fps down just to get past the jumping puzzle between second and third encounter because one lift always starts me too low so that i can never mantle and warlock glide being what it is won t give the height its not that bad
haha same here i do enjoy it thematically i just get bothered by the fact i have to use them for challenge and sometimes they screw me over
as someone who runs with no frame cap that might be it thanks for the insight
lmao right that d be so crazy real talk tho i just well shatter skate all the time makes it really fun i m just salty because challenge requires i use them
agreed for the master challenge we had the shooters shoot up of us and then themselves instead of all
because the jump pads are inconsistent and warlock jump s don t lift you after a delay the same as other classes you really do need to use icarus dash or grapple and that s super lame
i could also be way off but it wouldn t be the first time something is wonky due to frames
we ended up having to do that as well
yeah we did a similar thing send up then someone from the upper level shoots the lower level across from them makes it so you don t have to coordinate the launch as much which is nice
dares just get the favor and pop adds in the back
use it any chance you get dares
this week the moons first campaign mission is up i tried to do it between that and shuro chi and got the most success on the moon mission i feel like i could get at least percent a run on the moon while shuro chi was more hit or miss for some reason plus moon mission is free heavy while shuro chi eats up banners
i m a pvp main and this is just my experience i think i got the catalyst done around kills last season i was using it in the battlegrounds the revision zero quest a few times solo farming the first chest of dsc three times a week and in pvp i don t exactly remember but i think on it somewhere it says guardian kills count for more than kill don t quote me on that though
wrathborn hunts
shuro chi shut your brain off and get ready to get over kills with arrows or so per run
shuro chi dares if on shuro chi run deadfall hunter tether all the thrall at the entrance arrow to kill them all should count all for progression normal dares is guaranteed starhorse for second area legend dares you can have guaranteed starhorse for second and third areas but you d need a team to run dares
shuro chi checkpoint is the best
shuro chi orpheus rigs hunter no question the best
i literally did this days ago i ran dares for it all rounds and it was done not sure about kills tho seems high like everyone said get the buff for heavy ammo and it ll be done in no time
dares
i did it using the forfeit shrine ascendant challenge in the garden of esila the one with the big well of light in the middle where you need to bring the arc charges and kill axe knights after you dunk the charges don t kill all the knights you can jump up on a busted pillar on a bridge and shadow thrall will spawn just below in sets of then then before despawning and doing it all over again if you wait until all are there then fire a shot into the middle you get kills in one arrow they can t get to you while you re on the pillar so they don t move neither do the homies axe knights they do move if you jump down for ammo so if the knights get too close just kite them back to the well of light in the middle toss on all the heavy scavs you can and when you run out of ammo swap to ace of spades as it s a kinetic primary exotic and those have the highest ammo drop chance and firefly will kill all the thralls in one shot once you have ammo on the ground swap back to levi and pick it up rinse and repeat it s a bit boring but it works super well for farming catalysts on weapons with aoe damage like levi and cloudstrike also super quick leveling for crafted weapons made even easier if they have stuff like dragonfly incandescent or any other aoe damage perk only drawback is that you can only use this every 5th week being that it s an ascendant challenge idk the next time it ll be up but check every week because it really is a nice crafted weapon farm if nothing else
levi catalyst progresses from orange bars and above shuro has the one orange bar
definitely is not in this case
not for leviathan
from what i m seeing on the destiny data compendium https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waxvblx7uoszabqdfr1u32f2uwvlo-cjunjb4nlgue4/edit), finder mods are roughly 3x less efficient when you re using a special compared to a primary and nearly 5x less efficient compared to an exotic primary so while technically there is a benefit to using finders with double special loadouts you re much better off just learning the drop mechanics using special ammo finisher using lead from gold on your weapons switching over to your heavy when you run low on special etc
you don t need it you get loads of heavy drop when you re holding specials then you can use heavy to get special to drop or just hold heavy and get melee nade whiterhoard kills and get special from those kills
thank you fantastic reply and i ll be poking through that compendium in the future

world drop
random drops it s blue rarity so most sources stop dropping it after you reach
if you haven t found your answer yet the only certain way i know how you can get the midnight oil gumshoe gumption hunter and inspector s suit warlock sets is to complete either the witch queen or lightfall campaigns on become legendary difficulty at the end of both you will be given a full set of the armor for that class for lightfall that armor will be over the soft cap this season and next season i m not sure if the armor rewarded at the end of witch queen is still over soft cap as the become legendary difficulty for each mission is capped at

focusing is one of the greatest changes to loot pools but it s actually excruciating watching my glimmer 250k drop to under 10k after an hour of focusing armor and riptides feels like they want you to play more and grind out the mats but won t give you the resources to do it
i ve maxed out times this season i honestly would love an increase
can t be done the entire warlock class is actually made of glimmer caps and blue engrams removing them would destroy the game
nice try now get back to the glimmer mines
i agree especially since we have all these different types of engrams to focus i was surprised the glimmer cap was so low especially given how easy it is to blow through it at the start of an expansion
focusing is not supposed to be the primary way you receive loot your resources are plentiful unless you focus every engram you get that s not a bungie problem that s a you thing
the problem is currencies shouldn t be passively save up then when you happen to need them you have a bulk saved to spend and then save up more when you re not using it as a developer you want your currencies to have constant inflow and outflow raising the cap doesn t do that all it lets you do is stockpile a larger amount to the point it becomes an afterthought again it s a cycle there s a glimmer cap people ask for more reasons to spend it because they re constantly at cap so bungie gives reasons to spend it and then people want a higher cap so they can just sit at that instead of actually having to think about managing their resources
it hurts my soul to burn shards for glimmer
bungie more bit for our player is too much
forget glimmer with all these guns how about some vault space
what do you spend your glimmer on besides spending glimmer on bounties i almost always hover around max
not sure what you re getting at the price to focusing exotics will still be steep so it s not like it s being handed out to everyone like vanilla d2 still gonna be hard to get if that s what you re worried about are you talking exotics or seasonal focusing or both with so many exotic armor pieces and craftable weapons in the game now focusing engrams is definitely the right direction dedicated players who have the resources to spend ascendant shards specific engrams have done enough and earned to make it the primary way they should receive that specific loot
it s a hard truth but i think you re right focusing is meant as last resort not first resort
focusing is the primary way to target loot right now it s actually the best way wish more stuff was targetable i d love banshee focusing for world drops
this is a long winded condescending way of saying bungie thinks you ll play more if you have to grind glimmer we understand that but i and many others think that tedious glimmer grinding makes the game worse
the new shaders at ada upgrade modules and focusing engrams
i m always at max i m constantly buying upgrade modules just to free up space i m happy to get a new glimmer sink
weapon armor focusing is priced ridiculously high 3k per for the seasonal 5k per for the crucible vanguard and a whopping 20k each for iron banner trials in a single ib reset you can get more engrams than is possible to focus with a single stack of max glimmer
craftable weapons in the game now focusing engrams is definitely the right direction that s like explicitly the opposite of what bungie intends they ve stated on numerous occasions that focusing and crafting aren t supposed to feel like the only way to get loot hence why they cut back what can be crafted and why focusing is so expensive like the reasons you re saying it should be the primary path are the reasons bungie themselves said it isn t
last resort for what the only reason you d want an exotic armor you already have is for a better roll on stats and that s for a stat roll that s relevant in today s meta when it could very likely change in the future meaning the resilience chest piece is basically worthless if resilience gets reworked that s a grindable end goal one where the odds aren t in out favor and giving a single rng option that requires a hefty resource sink i don t understand how it s a last resort
think you re right it s not something up for debate that s what bungie themselves have said its why they ve reduced the amount of crafted weapons as well if everything can be focused or crafted it s not really a looter shooter considering you end up not using any loot
the point of currencies is to be something you have to manage though that s like a staple rpg element if you can stack so much of a currency that it becomes an afterthought then the currency might as well not exist and that makes the game worse part of why destiny is unique is because of its rpg elements
effing upgrade modules man why is everything so hard to come by i have my upgrade modules ghost mod on for vanguard completions haven t gotten one in the last strikes shit sucks man
there are a wild amount of drops in the game that aren t exotics which based off the text in the post is what this post is referring to you re not supposed to focus every defiant engram you get that s my point and that s bungies point
it s supposed to be a last resort to just using the ones you get as world drops it s not the end of the world as we know it to use an exotic drop with meh stats it sucks but most of the exotic functionality is in its abilities not it s stats so this new system is a last resort for if you really can t grind out a better one in lost sectors that you have an alternate way to spend more resources for slightly better chances it s how focusing works in destiny as a whole it s bungie stated intention crafting and focusing were never meant to replace world drops they were meant to ease the pain of world drops for more investment which exotic focusing does
i m not using most of the loot anyway and never will it s a looter shooter allegedly yet bungie has several systems in place that are designed to restrict you from using loot got a glaive with synthoceps here s a fat nerf wanna use that auto rifle nope it s barrier and unstoppable champions wanna run arc it s void burn
then the currency might as well not exist and that makes the game worse how would it make the game worse use your words simply saying something is a staple of the rpg genre isn t an actual argument it s an appeal to tradition i think glimmer makes the game worse because it is tedious to grind and ultimately pointless i think glimmer is ultimately pointless because any meaningful purchase vendor interaction is going to involve other currencies such as shards cores prism that you have to interact with the game to get i think you could remove glimmer from the equation and the game would be better and would still have a fuck ton of currencies to juggle the idea that the game is meaningfully better for me having to go grind public events for minutes or w e to focus a pile of weapons is in my opinion absurd do you really feel that destiny benefits from tedious padding like this
agreed they could of at least made the rewards match the increased difficulty they implemented
you wanna know what s amazing particularly as of this most recent season they added a bunch of different ways to deal with all of those things playing whatever you want besides glaives synthoceps but honestly yeah makes sense woe is you welcome to the club with every other class in the game where melee exotics get treated weirdly that s just how destiny is and has been balanced you don t need to pay attention to surges you don t need to use a specific gun to deal with champions etc and honestly i m not sure how your response is in any way related to my comment the fact that you re saying you don t use most of the loot anyways just kind of further emphasizes the lack of need to focus everything
because currency management is fun it s fun to strategize and analyze what can i afford to spend what should i buy now what should i save up for later do i get more cheaper things now or buy one expensive thing and then get the other cheaper stuff it feels good to save up and finally buy thing you ve wanted like always on time it felt great when i was finally able to afford it planning out your progression path and how you want to tackle it either in terms of efficiency or otherwise is a fun part of rpgs it s boring to just accumulate so much of a currency that it doesn t matter see legendary shards currencies should be something that a player is constantly managing and planning game would be better and would still have a fuck ton of currencies to juggle a fuck ton they ve been removing currencies due to the historical cap less issue and dumbing down the currency management system now it s like cores prisms shards alloys for crafting and cores legendary shards glimmer for purchasing and the one raid currency the current destination materials have little use since those weapons activities aren t really worth grinding
that s the neat part you don t
would fire and forget w chill clip work i don t pay enough attention to pvp or stasis details to know just an idea i m thinking the burst fire would help otherwise i d say any fusion with chill clip if this is one of those quests with varied objectives i d honestly get a different one
it s mayhem this week would the shatter from your super count if so it should be easy
never grab the crucible or gambit fragment bounties always take the vanguard ones you can hold more than one at a time if you didn t know do not dismantle the bounty you already have if you do it will fizzle and you won t get to pick another one for this week
glacier grenades and of all things salvation s grip it s garbage but it s a free low damage ice berg wherever you aim it just apologize to your teammates
it should
while i agree this is good advice the shatter kills from the super should work great in mayhem
only the newest raid can ever be farmed for spoils nez is probably the quickest farm right now or maybe the first encounter with a fast team speedrun strat
i see thank you
hover over each item and the game will tell you if it serves no purpose and to dismantle
all the tokens all the patrol materials can be traded to rahul the map things that were originally from cayde
all of the destination materials are no longer used go to rahool and trade them for glimmer the crucible vanguard tokens can be deleted
like of the game constantly needs buffs to compete with the of the game that s perpetually busted that s why the power creep has gotten so bad every time bungie adds new stuff to the game they make it better than everything else to drag people into playing new content rinse and repeat for a decade
it needs to be touched up for sure i m hoping for some sort of acknowledgement of this kind of feedback every thursday even if it s just we ve heard your concerns but feel like stasis is in a good place i d take that over the constant flow of requests for it to be buffed
the new elemental charge mod coming next season should give stasis a small but decent buff qol change
i d say stasis deserves a balance pass if only because much of its balancing was to bring it in line with the old light subclasses this doesn t mean it s weak just that it was balanced around a sandbox that no longer exists in particular i think the stasis shard aspects could use an overhaul as the various light equivalents can all be generated through fragments and tangles can form off any appropriate kill
i main stasis and i was thinking how increasing frozen target duration would be pretty cool and allow the user to get more damage in before they shatter or unfreeze kinda like the duration of strand suspend pair that with whisper of rending and you can really do something with that i don t think it s in that bad of a state though some improvements would be nice the biggest hit was taking out elemental shards i stopped running hoarfost because of that and switched to the new stasis helmet
if stasis was on par rn with strand it d be fucking set if use it all the time as it is now minus maybe hunter it ain t it chief rip behemoth titan
stasis could indeed use some buffs i think having a grenade option that can at least do some damage would be helpful and give the class some viability in pvp
my wish for behemoth would be to make all crystals from glacial quake explode when the super ends oftentimes your super ends and you have stasis crystals in front of you that you cannot even use before they melt also the melee is trash it s only use is stunning champions
it definitely needs more outstanding identity strand really stepped on its toes glad they said the new mod that works with shards is coming out but i worry it won t be enough to have it adequately stand out
sounds like stasis is going to be a focused element next season so i d expect some changes then getting elemental shards back is already a big step in the right direction i wouldn t expect something crazy like new supers and melees though feels like they would ve teased that s on the way if it ready enough to be released for season
stasis is insanely strong before strand it was by far my favorite and was equaled only by new light classes with their corresponding broken op artifact mods i fundamentally don t get why there is so much negative feedback so i am assuming people possibly aren t building it correctly i play hunter mainly so from that angle i m not going to say it has equal heals to solar not gonna pretend silence and squall can compete with orpheus deadfall obviously it s dps is lower than arc and gathering storm strand has unparalleled mobility but stasis stasis fucks stasis can shut down anything it can lock down any room any non boss enemy where strand worries about having abilities on cd to suspend champions stasis is just up and available it has massive internal synergies through shards and crystal enemy shattering and it gets exponentially stronger the more people on the field there are using it literally it s only weakness is that it has lackluster dps in it s super for boss damage but it is second to none in terms of its raw cc potential and its self sustaining ability regen which again get better the more people on the fireteam are using it
stasis is solid as it stands
jokes on you behemoth was always useless
please dont force me to play with mfers who make big walls of shit i cant shoot through most annoying subclass to play with
i think people need to realise that destiny is in it s final stretch they re counting down to final shape and wrapping up the light and dark saga at this point destiny has a tiny team working on it most of the rest of the studio are off working on new projects bungie has like other new games in active development with a skeleton crew just keeping the lights on anything major like new supers and abilities ain t gonna happen i don t think there s anything that wrong with stasis that getting the ability to have armor charge from stasis shards won t fix we ll need to wait until next season to see but i think that will fix a lot of the issues in this current sandbox
back in my day we were forever and that s the way we hated it kids these days don t know how bad they have it with the sunsetting and the fomo
it s called powercreep it will always be there it s the thing every mmo suffers from it s not unique to destiny only thing bungie can do is try to catch up and looking at recent exotic weapon buffs as well as leaked exotic armor ones i think they re on right track x200b also next season will supposedly have stasis artifact mods and activity surges so that will give the subclass some time in the sun and could also give bungie more data on what actually needs to be buffed
i m not going to say it has equal heals to solar
for real anything would be nice like we got new stasis exotic armor pieces and a new exotic stasis bow so clearly they see stasis as part of the game
true it will definitely see some more play time imo i still feel like the introduction of new abilities and supers for stasis will be very beneficial as well still curious about how this new mod will work tho
it s cool but the fact that the entirety of stasis is depend on one mod is very bad
yeah shards should just be intrinsic to stasis across the board
i love cadmus landcap as well lol the exotic looks derpy but it s grown on me
which is why they really need to either buff stasis or overhaul it so it s on par with the other elements including strand
like a shatter grenade for example
how do you get shiver strike to stun champions exactly last time ive checked it doesnt have any anti champion properties
hence why i was saying there should be some reworks for stasis of some kind or new ability options as well imo
i feel like them reverting some of the pve nerfs that were brought in year will solve a lot of these issues
if we don t get any new supers or abilities i d rather they revert some of the nerfs stasis received in year for pve
it may not be as bad sure but having to rely on a singular aspect for shard creation when it should just be intrinsic just ain t it imo
generally my take as well people aren t considering a handful of things the seasonal artifact breaks solar void and strand well specifically void weapons firesprites and firebolt grenades and tangles arc and stasis don t get the same support from the artifact this season however verglas curve exists previously if you wanted to place stasis crystals with your weapon you needed either a headstone precision kill or salvation s grip neither of which are nearly as practical as verglas curve which lets you place them in arbitrary locations without wasting your heavy slot now the unfortunate thing is that while shattering a crystal seems to be supposed to credit the kill to the weapon that shattered it there s some weird buggy behavior that makes it inconsistent in some situations but verglas curve enabling you to arbitrarily place stasis crystals and freeze enemies for the cost of one kill is pretty wild even if it sometimes doesn t quite behave right give shatter damage a bit more qol and this thing becomes monstrous winterbite exists this weapon got a ton of attention when bugs were making it deal more damage than intended but everyone seemingly forgot about it after that however the shot is incredibly wild this is probably the best zoning control heavy in the game with anarchy as the only real competition in that space also the recently nerfed witherhoard if we expand to the kinetic slot in particular shadebinders with iceflare bolts and a well placed winterbite shot can control entire rooms of enemies even before they start busting out grenades and powered melees to freeze even more things mix in a voltshot weapon or similar cleanup tool for best results or just glaive melee did i mention the glaive melee slows there s your overload counter provided you don t die closing the gap in the first place which you won t because nothing is unfrozen to fire at you just be aware you can damage yourself on the projectile cadmus ridge lancecap is something i haven t gotten to mess around with too much yet but from what i ve heard it s a good time conditional finality exists honestly it doesn t interact all that well with the stasis kit so i m only listing it for completion s sake but maybe i overlooked or forgot something yeah the lack of interactions between stasis and the armor charge system kinda blows and there are a few other interactions that bug me but things are honestly looking up for stasis not because of anything inherent to the subclass but because it s gotten new extrinsic tools to synergize with a couple of the old ones never stopped being good either ager s scepter anyone osmiomancy gloves i think stasis is pretty much flying under the radar right now because a few specific non stasis things are extremely strong right now particularly suspend oriented strand builds and a few different versions of dawnblade that and the lack of boss dps supers imagine if glacial quake was reworked to be more like thundercrash if any element needs a balance pass right now it s arc which is basically carried by striker and by voltshot weapons
i was lucky enough to get well rolled osmiomancy gloves that grant me easy triple 100s on my warlock and they have turned me into a shadebinder main i m already hyped for the gms
suspend stuns targets for seconds and unlike stasis damaging enemies won t free them even if the duration is nerfed which it should it will still be superior since enemies won t be free plus threadrunners still have double shackle grenade suspend dive and a strong super
respectfully i m gonna have to disagree with you on that one friend the lack of new abilities supers as well as buffs to its kit is very noticeable compared to strand and light but since you feel this way how is still good because every stasis subclass suffers in some way from being left in the dust on top of relying on an aspect for shard generation when it should be intrinsic to its kit like the rest of the elements
yikes take
bungie said that this saga isn t the end thats already been stated numerous times plus destiny is their money maker
i never got to before the cap raised
let s hope
it doesn t need to be powercreeo does happen over time yes but it can be reigned back in if the devs put in the effort that s what has happened a few times in wow our characters arent remotely as strong in the current expansion as they were in the previous two
do they in lightfall they ve made only revenant build that wasn t completely garbage a complete garbage by increasing grenade cool down by behemoth has been on life support before and now it has completely flatlined osmiomancy warlock was pretty good before lightfall after it right now it s gameplay loop no longer exists these are the things that can be fixed and it s possible that some of these will be fixed by introduction of new mod they ve mentioned yesterday today what cannot be fixed so easily is the fact that stasis occupies the same crowd control niche as strand and strand s suspend just blows freezing out of the water it s not even close some new toys in form of exotics won t change design issues
since they re scaling the armor charge chance based on item frequency you would probably need a decent amount of shards to gain a charge but with tracking shards that shouldn t be too much of an issue still i used to main stasis with an agers perma font of might build agers spawns a million shards although orbs are plentiful these days and keep your charge topped up this mod should allow basically permanent armor charge uptime nice for double specials with finisher and grenade kickstarts for bleakwatcher etc
yeah
yeah something like that you throw grenade it does damage maybe applies a small amount of a slow stack
could have sworn i stunned a champion with it due to its slow effect but perhaps i am mistaken in which case it s even worse than i thought lol
agreed this would be good start and would help to bring stasis on par with the others they went to far with the stasis nerf in pve
it s compensated for by having above average fragments and i prefer it in an aspect rather than in five fragments easier to keep track of what does what that way also if you re not using them to charge with light you could just not create them and run a different aspect
i really dislike people throwing around osmiomancy gloves nerf bleakwatcher and shadebinder really doesn t have much to offer i d feel better if we had more exotic synergy and fixed shattering sources to help orb generation
i would love if glacial quake was better lmao
i feel like what they should do for stasis is buff shatter dmg that way when you do shoot them no one is getting out of that i would also say the duration of suspend should be nerfed imo seconds is way too damn long
i don t understand what you re getting at suspend is better for a single target usually but for a group stasis is better because of the cascading shatters
new abilities and supers aren t money makers dlc and eververse is that s where the dev effort is going to get focused on as for what happens beyond final shape nobody knows do they just keep running destiny as a mvp just keeping the lights on while people continue to play it with no major evolution do we get a destiny nobody outside bungie knows yet but you can bet they aren t piling money into stuff for destiny right now that has no direct financial return
that s basically what has happened in lightfall even underleveled we are still significantly stronger than we were at the beginning of destiny
i m a bit confused by your comment about osmiomancy s gameplay disappearing i only just got a nice roll for them and they seem good af the grenade regen is insane it s effectively infinite coldsnap nades
warlocks and titans are different enough for the subclasses to coexist warlock stasis is autonomous cc doesn t require kills to function and can refresh itself with a simple kickstart bolstering bomber loop warlock strand cc requires the warlock to get kills and for enemies to be bunched up to gain significant value it is easy to refresh but can be inconsistent in performance nbsp titan stasis has two viable builds with hoil and lancecap both can make a bunch of crystals for cc and damage titan strand just has cc it has the best cc and can make most enemies stop shooting but the abilities don t do any real damage at most all behemoth needs to differenciate itself from berserker is more damage nbsp hunter is in the worst spot stasis suffers from not having energy converter for second supers and strand is just a worse suspend bot than titan strand and stasis both being about cc doesn t mean there s no room for the classes to play differently
hence why they should be reworked buffed
the build capabilities will be nice i m just not a fan of an aspect being the reason i can create shards in the first place i am excited to use agers on behemoth again tho
i love that idea
the slow effect got removed like eons ago if i remember correctly its kinda funny how a melee ability doesnt even emit a subclass verb
they absolutely went way too hard on the pve nerfs
agree to disagree i suppose
my opinions on how stasis to be buffed fragments buffs shards being baked into the subclass like tangles shard aspects are reworked so they grant effects when you get shards slow and freeze duration is buffed and enemies no longer get unfrozen when shattered shatter damage is buffed overall duration should be seconds to since stasis s identity is supposed to be crowd control and strand shouldn t be stepping in it s territory damage buff across the board so stasis abilities an more reliably kill enemies since if strand can have such good crowd control with suspend and dos options then so should stasis
shackle grenades have a weirdly high aoe and building into it gives absurd uptime allowing you to spam it like crazy used it last week on master glassway and wyverns and champions were easy to beat as someone who would usually use osmi glove shadebinder i would argue double shackle threadrunner is just as strong as double shackle hunter
i should ve clarified i meant that last line in regards to wow characters in the current expansion dragonflight are much weaker than in a insanely powercrept expansion like battle for azeroth bungie could do the same with this game or at the least maintain our current strength and balance around that instead of continuing to add progressively higher power
this sub is pretty singleminded generally most only use osmiomancy for bleak watchers personally i m on your side osmio frostpulse iceflare bolts is one of my favorite loadouts for getting in the thick of things and freezing a whole room
i appreciate this post of yours lol
i ll reiterate stasis is directly competing with strand in the crowd control niche buffing one indirectly nerfs the other there s no chance an old product would be improved if it meant that new product would look worse in comparison
i m pretty sure it applies slow in pve but not in pvp anymore
i guess so
i like these ideas edit on an unrelated note i love konosuba as well lmao
i want to be careful because i do not think it s a binary state i don t think it s stasis or strand i think they re both very good but what they re good at is slightly different strand is good for small groups or reactive suspending but stasis slows and freezes have a lot of innate effects that strand suspend doesn t and they persist where strand is a one and done strand is also benefiting from an insanely powerful suite of artifact mods that make it superior if you re using them if you are not using them i think they re both on fairly even footing strand has stronger initial effects but stasis has a comprehensive internal synergy that is unmatched atm
cadmus landcap has been stupid fun for me it makes diamond lances so much better lol
i mean they sorta did that updating an old product s with the light subclasses with light they could certainly add things like new abilities and supers for stasis that will actually make it more viable
idk what your talking about stasis having any advantage there s no reason to use a revenant over a threadrunner at best you could try and use frosties and spam withering blades but slow freeze and shatter aren t as beneficial as just throwing a shackles grenade and be done with it withering blades can crowd control yeah but the duration is too short and they don t last very long threaded spike is faster more accurate and has more uptime due to its throw and return effect as for the artifact mods boosting it while true shackle grenades and threaded spike are still strong enough on they re own with suspend tangles just being a nice bonus since i can constantly spam grenades and next season we are getting more strand aspecrs and probably fragments too so it s gonna get even stronger
but why would they adding new stasis abilities won t sell more copies of beyond light adding new strand stuff might sell more copies of lightfall besides they d be much less rush for people to get lightfall if strand it s biggest selling point could be easily replaced by something most long time players already have
for one slow and freeze come from the same sources but stun two champion types and they can disable barriers strand can disable all three but it cannot stun overloads slows also affect enemy movement enemy activity speed and their accuracy and most sources of slow are persistent or the slow itself lasts freezes also disable enemies and when they are shattered the explosion can shatter more enemies and local crystals for tons of bonus damage so the champion and four enemies you suspended while you plunk them down one by one i froze them and then shattered the champ to kill the other adds more damage to the champ that i just refroze before it could do anything dangerous bonus points if i used a volatile void weapon for even more kabooms beyond this the internal synergy of the stasis aspects and fragments is unmatched you get super energy from killing frozen things you get grenade energy from shattering crystals another gives grenade regen from shattering crystals you damage reduction free reloads overshields from shards that track to you which is an easy way to bypass healing restriction modifiers like togetherness and attrition because it triggers healing you can have bonus recov resil and mobility along with some free sim assist and stability for freezing an enemy all from one fragment whisper of hedrons stasis has so many good fragments and aspects it s hard to choose because they are all good none of them are meh or have weird trigger rules like precision kills on suspended or blinded enemies top it off with three of the best cc supers in the game not the best just three of the best and we ve got ourselves a powerhouse of a class and we haven t even gotten to the mods or weapons
because it s a whole range of subclasses that will fall short for example with the light subclasses people have more options to choose what supers and abilities they want to use because some are better than others within that subclass yet they still get to play that subclass with stasis its different as the whole thing falls short we can agree to disagree and that s fine but bungie is able to go back and revise old content that s literally what light was friend
for champions idk how that s a real advantage since with my current build it can deal with champions just fine with auto smg overloads those champions are no threat especially with quicksilver s grenades for your 2nd point i don t see how this is as good as suspend grenades the latter completely stops movement entirely and last seconds which is longer than slow and frozen even with the duration fragment for point this won t work in gms which is my focus as enemies are too tanky for that to work and anything works in low tier content so that s not much of an advantage point again i don t see how stasis is better with fragments as yeah the stat bonuses are great but i already have a good build to get double stats with resistance and discipline for strand as for aspects being good i have no idea how winters shroud and shatterdive are gms worhy the only thing safe and effective is touch of winter and shards i just don t see how this is worth over strand your argument of the orb on suspended precision kills isn t hard at all and regarding supers silkstrike is a strong super with good crowd control due to suspend dive and wide reading damage
yeah i agree that bungie is fully able to do so i just think that bungie won t do so because there s no economic incentive for that light isn t really comparable because it was more about updating things to new system and creating verbs that can be used by weapons and armor too when it comes to new things added these were mostly melee option but if they were to add something what could they add that would feel good and yet stay within element identity because that s the biggest constraint identity they ve backed themselves into creative corner and i don t think escaping it would be easy and that s another issue why we might never see stasis
i guess we re just gonna have to agree to disagree stasis is my go to for gms unless something specific is needed
i m still have to disagree here just so this doesn t become an argument i ll just say i see where you re coming from and the logic behind it it would make sense if that s the case i m of the mind that they shouldn t leave an entire range of subclasses like stasis out to dry whether there s financial incentive or not new abilities and supers could very well be added to stasis that will keep its identity it s a cc element that relies on taking full advantage of your surroundings and shutting down enemies also regarding strand suspend i could very well see a nerf for that since that shits busted
alright
i don t think that banner shield will ever be tuned to match the damage output of well because it s also a roaming super with really good ad clear potential they won t let a single super be one of the best ad clear support and boss damage supers all at the same time that said i don t think it s so useless that it might as well not exist just because well is still better one player giving up their dps to use the shield is still a net gain to the whole fireteam
as long as well of radiance remains absolutely low effort as possible with zero draw backs and all upside there is no reason to use bubble or banner shield as for the other super strand is just straight up better for add clear
if you want some boss dps from your titan subclass there s thundercrash with cuirass exotic and that s it sadly
both already have a place in endgame content master oryx comes to mind a bubble in the thunderdome is far more effective than just a well
i can see that though i would see bubble more akin to the well and encounter that would make bubble well irrelevant would make more sense for the shield i guess maybe like a damage phase that is on a lifting mechanism or requires movement i ve never looked up the stats but does the net damage boost from say guardians shooting through the shield out perform the contributions if that titan was just contributing to damage if we remove the other augments like a well and such from this hypothetical scenario
you talking about getting teleported into the darkness bubble after damage interesting i ve never had to use it in there kinda just kill and gtfo don t use a well in their either shields from rally or a rift do the job weirdly enough i also don t get that one to proc a lot either it s a strong majority of getting shit rained on me my team maybe i m just a lucky lol
yeah exactly that bubble serves the same purpose as well they are necessary in order to fulfill the fantasy of stand in a place and dps well will get nerfed and then we will become helm of saint bitches the problem won t get solved just passed along then months later helm will be nerfed and whatever version we had left of well will become meta again rinse and repeat titans are useful they are just not practical because the meta has ways around the inconveniences they have once the meta shifts those inconveniences will still be there but we will have to deal with them
ehhh i don t know if i agree with that there are ways to make it for sure viable for both for instance increase wol buff by and change the damage reduction of the well to just being radiant each would then have a purpose for stand in place dps depending on the length of the damage phase longer ones that could accommodate the in and out go bubble short ones that last less time than the radiant buff go well or if there is a stand in place mechanic that require damage reduction the bubble would be viable it doesn t have to be a meta trade off
that s exactly what i said with extra steps
get a good pumice stone and use it after taking a long soak in the tub
as others have said if you do not care to beat calus legit and just want to get it over with just cheese him youtube calus cheese i find it s easier to see how the cheese is performed than to follow a text explanation
jump under the catwalk where you plant the flag you can complete both phases safely
aa the other fellow said there s locations to easily exploit both parts i d search it up on youtube for clarity
under the catwalk for 1st phase make sure you kill both tormentors before taking his health all the way down 2nd phase just put one of the cylinders around the arena between you and him and circle it he won t be able to melee you kill the prions when they spawn in rinse repeat use osteo striga for both phases
i ll help you if you wanna wait like min til i get home
i ll help if you wanna invite
r fireteams
yeah but those two guys with the staff that throw the purple stuff at you are too hard for me to kill on my own and when i get them to bar health s i always get knocked off the side by them
they can t kill you under the catwalk and you can shoot them through the step and when they move to the side catwalks the area we re talking about going under is the walkway directly below where you place the rally flag
are you sure you aren t just throwing a grenade after you get an orb grenade kickstart will work without an armor charge but if you use your grenade ability it will consume all stacks of armor charge you have i just tried and it seems to work just fine for me using only a strand siphon mod to make an orb and the kickstart mod edit you could also have something else that consumes your armor charge like the chest mod that provides damage resist if your shield is broken if you grab the orb while weak then i believe it just immediately consumes all of your armor charges and converts it to damage resist or something along those lines point being the mod works as intended for me
well with the mod on picking up or trying to an orb of power does not grant any armor charged i can use to test with
it does work without an armor charge you will just more energy for every armor charge that is consumed
take a screenshot of your mod selection open the character screen and then press right arrow on pc or i would assume right d pad on console share the screenshot that shows what mods you are using if possible a video clip of you picking up orbs and not getting armor charges
well i was going to and then it started working after i changed to my known working void load out and back
boss health gates start when of health is done and per cycle of envoys this available dmg increases by if an invader heals the primeval it doesn t reset the dmg towards the health you could have done say in the initial dmg a primeval of health you do dmg to it the invader then heals it back to full you would only be able to do more dmg before the boss goes immune
maybe the taken vex units making it immune with their beams of light
the big shield is due to health gates the boss can also be made immune from taken goblins tethering to him if it s not a health gate immunity shield then you have to kill the goblin that is tethering the boss
everything said in here about the gating is correct to be pedantic if you do not hit the health gate because for some reason nobody is attacking the primeval eventually it will take pity on you and move on to the next set of wizard spawns giving you primeval slayer stacks anyway you have to wait a pretty long time for this to occur though
yes there is
say in the initial dmg a primeval of health you do dmg to it the invader then heals it back to full you would only be able to do more dmg before the boss goes immune thanks that must be what is happening but it s a really confusing and thus bad system we had him go immune multiple times in the first health bar and that s what happened i guess
i dunno if it s related but i ve experienced a lot of connectivity issues recently where either exotic properties don t proc assassin s cowl doesn t let me go invis or champ stuns don t work suspend dive doesn t stun unstoppables the bones of this game are not in a good place right now
yeah the ability stuns aren t always reliable i notice stasis can be very bad sometimes counteracting with suspends and champions will self regenerate while your damaging them sometimes good reason to always have a weapon that covers each champion type in the nightfall
this has been happening to me too the volatile rounds from gyrfalcons has been iffy for the last couple days
for gyrfalcons in particular you might want to check if you have overload smg on the artifact champion mods can t stack and the game sees you have overload before anti barrier so it just doesn t give the volatile anti barrier characteristics come to think of it verglas curve might be having the same problem
there was a message in prime games last year october iirc that said in order to continue getting rewards you would have to re link your bungie account try unlinking your bungie prime account and re linking hopefully that will fix it for you
restart the game
that was it i must ve missed that message thank you
glad it worked and to be fair to you it was a tiny little blurb message that only lasted for like weeks on the prime website no email or any other notification that i m aware of and it never said when exactly you would be affected definitely no fault of your own for missing it

i just tested it and i can confirm that it definitely doesn t give you any kind of in combat healing like restoration does
something to do with load times
i think for loadouts something something behind the scene ui node space
the common theory is that it was a tradeoff for loadout performance bungie hasn t confirmed nor denied this but something like this isn t unheard of
i didn t get that move either i spend way more time on the character screen than i do on the inventory screen and i liked having a quick glance at the monetary situation while i was dicking around with the gear not a huge deal i guess but you can t really call it a qol improvement
the character screen can only display so many things at a time to fit the champion icons they had to remove the currencies it s like how guns can only have so many traits associated with them engine limitation
it s so people don t get roasted for having legendary shards when they share their build fashion
i see this post weekly now it s to help load the character screen since they added loadouts how often do you even need to look at that information the relevant currency shows when you go to use them anyway like are you on bill pay with your legendary shards and need to know your balance the numbers don t change unless you add to them or use them
it s a ui ux design choice nothing else the character tab would be too cluttered if those remained after they added the extra ui for loadouts and mod setup
for real why would even check on those currencies all the time
yeah i agree its just an annoying extra step
haven t seen anyone suggest that it s to prevent silver from being visible on your character screen
software people like to change things for no reason
gonna now have to call the inventory the guardian s wallet
it s improved my qol massively since the change i win the lottery met my soon to be supermodel wife and now spend my days traveling the globe and playing destiny on my gaming set up thank you bungie
i don t remember any post asking for it sure but i ve indeed noticed that the inventory screen loads much faster at least on xbox one if it s related i don t know but i ll take it
bro i genuinely don t get this complaint all the currencies and consumables on one page makes sense if it offers performance improvements even better it s not like these values are rapidly fluctuating unless you blow hundreds thousands of shards at a vendor for a certain roll i know the ballpark of all my currencies just off the top of my head like imagine getting upset that when you look in your closet it doesnt also have your bank account balance posted there lol it s one more click you re fine
they changed it i didn t know at all d
it s one button press
didn t work load times are still shit
save what a millisecond
huh i never thought about this actually so it s either because of engine limitation or profit reasons
i think it s exactly this people saying it s due to space i think it s so that you are not able to constantly see your resources any time you enter your inventory think about it how much easier is it to sit on 250k glimmer or accidentally spend too many shards silver when you aren t constantly reminded of how much you have very easily i believe
used to be zero _  _
are you on the last gen consoles load times are fantastic on ps5 pc
yeah but if they were there it would be even worse it s probably due to the game having to load the load outs and the mod screen so to reduce a tiny bit they removed the currencies
make room for loadouts
i made that up but i d bet money its true
when you purchase literally anything it tells you how much silver you have as you hover over it
as someone in pc no it s not lol at least not always very often i get locked in space for five minutes or more since starting this season and yes i have a m
lol
deleted
it s actually probably why bungie has random max ui or node limitations cuz spaghetti engine
i know that and it tells you how much of a resource you have if you go to any vendor that s not the point the point is those resources are not shown as easily anymore until you re already at the vendor or hovering over said item which means you re already that much closer to buying said item with silver or shards or in the case of glimmer you just don t see you re full i mean it s pretty classic psychology but i understand not everyone is as jaded as i am when it comes to a multi billion dollar company trying to eek out more time or money from it s consumers
tower load times are a bit high as a massive amount of people are actually playing for once that s all i ve noticed
it s absolutely an engine issue in the end the engine d2 is running on despite what changes and tweaks bungie has made is still foundationally an ancient ass engine and you can only do so much with old tech like that i distinctly remember there being a problem from around season of arrivals that addressed i believe it was lag slow performance on the character screen that was tied to too many mod icons being displayed at once on screen it s little things like that that you wouldn t think would cause issues but wind up pushing the engine in ways it wasn t really intended i m honestly amazed with what they ve been able to do with the game given what they re working with the house they built on their old foundation as it were probably looks like an oversized nonsensical wacky ass mess like that house from hello neighbor but it still somehow manages to work
absolutely braindead comment i understand why because fuds do not know a single thing about games engines or otherwise just wish fuds like you knew not to try speaking about things they have no idea about
but you see the total there s no psychology it s not hiding anything from you
this is mental you need your pipes at home checked for lead contamination because something is seriously interfering with your thought patterns
not for me happens loading into neomuna and dares and shit dates had a guaranteed black screen every single game for several seconds
removed
fwiw my guess would have been more along the lines of encouraging people to stream post screenshots of their character without the embarrassment of showing off they spent money on silver not something insidious lol
it s probably your internet connection
keep it civil
hmm i don t think so got 2gb down 100mb up and my whole group complains about load times they re not great i m sure they re better then they were but still aren t good we ve also had a time where it completely bugged trying to join iron banner and one of us had to leave for it to finally work
i m running threadlings on my hunter and i m chasing a perpetualis with hatchling i have it on the smg and it s heckin amazing
cascade point lasts for seconds it cannot be extended or made to happen for longer the base mag of is exactly how many shots you can get off during that duration i absolutely do not think that combination is worth it or generally cascade point on primary weapons but that s just my opinion
i have hatchling on my crafted perpetualis and i see a hell of a lot of those little green buggers running around whenever i put it to work
pretty sure the rank at the war table gives you the envious hatchling combo for free
thanks a lot that s the info i wanted i ll probably run zen and hatchlings
welcome i neglected to consider enhanced cascade point which increases the buff duration to 75s allowing you to fire shots
it s not more damage the buff lasts second longer
enhanced damage perks just increase the timer rather than the damage itself or give a stat buff for instance paracausal has its duration increased by second and firing line grants increased handling
enhanced damage perks just increase the timer rather than the damage itself not strictly true enhanced surrounded has a higher damage buff
dang
why wouldn t it be
just cannot find it anywhere and all the videos i could find are all from zephyr concourse so it makes me question tbh
im just happy this is finally happening i ve had heart of inmost light for years gotten maybe half a dozen duplicates in all that time and all have had less than stellar roles im glad i can finally at least focus farm them
my business sense tells me they won t do this here s why season passes offer half a dozen exotic engrams and are the easiest to obtain reliably while i m on board with the addition of focusing as someone who works long weeks and doesn t have time to farm lost sectors i ll take any gyrfalkons roll over my roll i see this as another way to pump the season pass granted you get a good bit for the cost i believe it s still a business tactic that would see them not implement any new ways of getting exotic engram drops we ll see though
hold on wtf is exotic focussing i think i missed the memo
i honestly think we may be losing xur as a vendor sooner or later with this change it makes him rather unnecessarily redundant
feature isn t even out and people whinging
i would greatly appreciate this exotic engrams are few and far between
love this idea
i think its good how its planned now because it will make exotic world drops really special again
they didn t mention xur so i assumed him rank reset and bp engrams are all going to your inventory
i ve wanted a real reason to do lost sectors on the hardest difficulty wish if you completed one you have a chance of getting an exotic similar to the one you have equipped for it
will have to wait and see how well it works the normal focusing won t be very reliable with how big the pool will be ls will probably be better or about the same and the precision focusing costs an exotic cipher which we can get or in the season track and per week so you won t get too many chances to focus very often and do we know what the stat roll will be like people already complain that drops from ls often have terrible rolls not trying to be negative but when i saw that the precision focusing which is exactly what everyone asked for would be throttled by what is essentially the rarest consumable in the game it just felt like they played it too safe
my first total drop was hoil and it was hot garbage big big sad there this was during arc season aka storm hoil season to get a fucking total drop that s rare as hell only to have mob on it crushing
unless they change it the cost to focus a specific exotic takes ascendant shards and a exotic cipher with no guarantee on high stats or interaction with ghost mods it is not going to be a reliable way to get decent rolls on exotic armor
within the pinned post https://www.reddit.com/r/destinythegame/comments/12cqvg3/reflecting_on_lightfall_launch_and_beyond
i can see them keeping him around as justification for why we can only get exotic cypher per week
ikr imagine people wanting to weigh pros vs cons of a new feature ahead of time the audacity is real
it s not exactly a new feature we already have several different forms of focusing vendors the concerns about the cost for this are something that should be pointed out at this point especially when the resources they are proposing to use are some of the most limited ones in the game exotic engrams and ciphers
makes me wish we had anti focus mods on our ghost i d slap an anti mobility mod on my titan s ghost and never look back remember how season of the hunt let you exclude perks from the focused drops this would basically be the same but for stats from the ghost mods
