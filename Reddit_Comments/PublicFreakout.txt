whether it takes seconds or minutes the result is always the same you will be getting off the plane
holy shit that man baby sniveling at the end was so satisfying made watching the whole video worth it
what a fucking baby
long clip but absolutely worth it to hear this guy break down in baby tears when he realized his ass was going to jail what an absolute bitch
the ending of this shit show was not what i expected
leans into walkie send the wahmbulance
good freakout best was the vest guy throwing the lost shoe back at the end
i ve flown many many times i ve never said anything other than good morning evening coke please and chicken to the airplane staff and somehow i ve never been thrown off a plane these people who claim they didn t do anything while getting thrown off of planes are ridiculous
i wish their was a subreddit just for airplane airport videos like this i could watch these videos all day
in todays lesson we will all learn we are guests on their mode of conveyance our status as a guest is highly dependent on our ability to act like a decent human failure to act appropriately will have that status revoked at their option the rest is just details and how it happens
sounds like he still wears his spiderman underwear
what crime have i committed you violated our policies you agreed to our contract of carriage when you purchased your ticket you have been asked to leave this private property the aircraft because you violated our policies you are refusing to leave this private property therefore you are trespassing please remove yourself from our property or you will be forcibly removed
you have the right to shut the fuck up
i always wish there was a page for these people s family s reactions even theirs would be fun to see also wanna know if they feel this privileged all the time
that dead eyed stare the guy in the seat was giving is telling me there s a reason why they want him off the plane it s never gonna be a good time when someone tries to look at you and they are staring somewhere behind your ear
the sound of him crying like a child was satisfying
but what crime have i committed what s your probable cause motherfucker s watching too many 1st amendment auditors bitch it s a private company that says you ve gotta go argue your civil rights to a judge not to the cop it s like those videos from a couple years ago like woman arrested at costco for not wearing a mask like no bitch the company asked you to leave you refused you re being arrested for trespassing
i ll never understand these half wits that think they can cause trouble on a plane or be argumentative it never ends well lol you ll always get booted from the plane flight crews do not give a single shit about placating someone like this these people have the self control of a wolverine on crystal meth and the intelligence of a fruit fly on life support
so cringe stahhhha ha ha ha hoooppppppp
staaaaawwwp
finally a true public freak out post
i fly a lot it s really not that hard to sit down and shut the fuck up i don t understand why that s so hard for some people
well well well someone discovered tantrums have consequences
i m slightly happy to hear him crying at the end
lol this was absolutely delicious
gif giphy 6pjnybysmfod2
that ginger on the bridge had a little smirk about the situation until he saw it was being recorded
he was defiant until they took away his screen time then he burst in to tears like a big fat baby a total manchild
is he crying
ah yes the fall on your side going completely limp and cry tactic very effective as a pound man you can even see one security guard say fuck this and walk away just two more to go
why don t they ever just tell them trespassing when they ask what crime they ve committed in response to being told the police are coming
what crime have i committed dude spent too much time watching youtube rights videos and forgot flying is using a private company and they can technically kick you off for any reason that goes againt their policy the policy everyone agrees to by buying a ticket
a grown man acting like a fucking child so sick of seeing this
man when he started wailing i lost my shit haha
where is this persons self respect if you sense that you aren t wanted somewhere say thank you and apologize for any inconvenience that you may have caused then humbly leave and move on with your life tldr no amount of money should be worth fighting over especially if it causes you to loose your self respect and dignity
are they tickling him
happens to me every time i wear sweats on the plane
this almost looks like a scene from modern family with cameron
the crime you re committing is trespassing dipshit when asked to leave a private space you do just that leave
today on fuck around and find out
the best part is the smirk from the red headed maintenance guy to the other workers as he s being removed from the plane he s trying so hard not to bust out laughing
ewwww after all that he starts crying like a year old boy what a fucking disgrace of a human
not that i m petty but if i was on that flight crew i would have claimed that shoe as a spoil of war let the man baby limp
well that was entertaining for me not for those poor passengers where was this asshat flying from or trying and to
i laughed acts like a horses ass until they peel him out of his seat then starts whining like a toddler
in case anyone needs a quick answer to a dumb question the laws he is breaking are multiple but the easiest to explain is that since the pilot has asked him to leave private property he s now trespassing same for any business don t fuck with service industry you will lose and we will all upvote the tears
instead of charging us bag fees american should taze these dumbfucks and charge extra to watch it on their inflight entertainment this one would be the avatar of inflight tv in gross revenues
he gon cry in the car
jesus that absolutely pathetic bawling at the end guy s a something year old baby
did he end up getting his gin and tonic
that is the most amazing cry i have ever heard such a bitch
i love when white ppl ask the cops what crime have i committed the rest of us already know the answer cuz i m brown i ve watched this three times just to laugh when he s crying
thanks for flying american airlines
he reminds me of stuart from madtv
i want to be friends with the red headed guy in glasses with the chartreuse vest at the end his facial expressions are sending
is is that oki data printer paper at about sec in holy shit that is oki data printer paper in i m both old and afraid for the lack of technology upgrades in the airline industry on such a basic level fear of flying
it s too late now it s too late now
this needs to be in oddly satisfying
best part after the sobbing was the dude kicking around the shoe not knowing what to do
the ending is hilarious his entitled bs isn t what a weak minded idiot
how many videos do you need to see before you finally realize the passenger never wins this argument
his crying is glorious what crime asked to leave private property refused crime is trespass get off the fucking plane you entitled babyman fuck honestly these are the only times i m hella pro police brutality lol
just get off the plane
that escalated quickly
his bawling took me off guard
god i hate people
long live dot matrix printer paper
grown ass man acting like he s two
this is way more than just what you see he s lost way more than a flight because of this
now that is a public freakout
more people need to practice being told no and accepting that
the smirk on the guy in the reflective vest at the end right before he noticed the dude s shoe had fallen off right in front of him omfg
i really can t tell if he s actually remorseful really embarrassed at the end or just has untreated mental health issues or maybe he s on the spectrum and can t properly communicate his thoughts in a stressful albeit self created situation
i wouldn t be surprised if he traveled for work good bye job and status
ahhh the tears as he is being arrested is so satisfying
with them rittenhouse crocodile tears
the more he cried at the there the more i laughed
holy fucking shit imagine being a grown man and acting like this
he turned into cam from modern family
when i get in a plane usually fly alone my main goal is to be practically invisible i get to my seat put my headphones on curl up with my podcast and aim to have as little interaction as possible with anyone else i still wear a mask simply because it means i can close my eyes and never be bothered i will be the last person off the plane if it means i don t need to put up with anyone else s shit i simply cannot understand what makes people want to cause a scene it s a bus in the air get yourself a book and a snack and get on with it
omg the crying at the end was absolutely amazing
what crime have i committed it s a private business they want you to leave why do so many people misunderstand how this works
everyone we have an opening in 1st class who wants an upgrade
he might have a serious alcohol problem if he s willing to potentially end up on a no fly list just because he couldn t wait half an hour for a drink
it s too late now bitch
i don t understand why people feel that they re entitled a seat on the airplane i mean it s not your airplane bro if they ask you to get off you have to get off
first has lost its class
what a crying wanker
went from flying first class to missing your flight and going to jail what a tool
the crying was glorious
it matters not if he has broken any laws if the captain wants him off the plane he s getting off that plane edit lol he s asking about probable cause what crime he s being charged with none of that matters on am aircraft if the captain wants him off he s off he broke the rule of not being an asshole thats all the captain needs to have him removed edit edit staaahp sthaaaahp iiit i m a white man you cannot do me like this did that man actually cry i wonder how many times this man saw police brutality on the news and thought to himself if they had just complied
what crime have i committed it doesn t matter if the pilot says you re not flying then you re not flying
the guys cries made it worth the minutes lol
this dude literally acted like a damn toddler when being removed from the plane
why didn t he just comply
why didn t he just comply
if you try to fuck around and find out with air travel you re gonna have a bad time
staaahhhhppppppppp
now imagine that guy being drunk

the fucking entitlement of these kids
we re not starting anything yyyeah
the last group you want to fuck with are groomsmen you can assume they re the closest most loyal men the couple knows
that mullet was ready to beat some ass not the guy with the the mullet i mean the mullet itself
someone needs to knock these fuckers out before they learn a lesson
all these damn pranksters keep forgetting the one main thing about pranks both parties need to be happy n laughing at the end
removed
one of these days someone s going to get shot https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/northern-virginia/dulles-town-center-victim-was-making-prank-video-when-he-was-shot-father-says/3323313/) and killed
viral internet culture is just exhausting for rational people just trying to live their lives walking down the street and some idiot tries to pick a fight but it s just a prank bro see the camera trying to shop and some idiot throws something at you for the views filming shit instead of helping a person in danger pulling stupid stunts in public spaces try to have a fucking wedding and some idiot crashes the party and acts like you re the asshole for kicking them out i just want them to realize how hated they are
don t these kids have school or jobs or something how do they have so much time to just be annoying dildos trying to be funny
whelp apparently they posted it anyway since it s ended up here it s still getting views and engagement which was their goal sort of the no such thing as bad press attitude can people please stop reposting things like this and giving jerks like this more attention incentive to keep pulling these pranks
prank pranksters
hey even mad that was very rational feedback
they need an ass whoppin
some kid in virginia just caught a round in the gut pulling some bullshit prank on the wrong guy in a mall watching these shitheels i m honestly surprised it hasn t happened sooner
i cant wait for tik tok to die and take these stupid motherfuckers with them
they deserve a good ass beating weddings are too fucking expensive and important especially to the wife to have idiots doing this stuff
my wife and i had a situation with people trying to sneak into our wedding as well a group of about high schoolers showed up with a couple of parents and asked if they could come into the venue during our reception the event coordinator was there and intercepted them and told them she would speak with us we promptly told them no and they were offended that we wouldn t let them in to take pictures for their prom most of the group were in casual clothes so i had a hard time believing they were actually going to prom we informed them we waited almost years to get in here on this day and paid over for the venue alone the leader karen tried to sneak the kids around the back and up the outside stairs that led to the upper deck patio which would have given them access to the main area they were confronted on the stairs by other guests and ultimately left upset and without their pictures
imagine ruining one the biggest milestones in a couple s relationship over some likcok views
anyone has an example of a prank that s actually funny
angry smilers are always scary
social media has destroyed humanity
all of these fucking losers are starting to get called out for their shithousery and i m definitely here for it i think i speak for a lot of people by saying that we don t want to be part of your clout chasing bullshit and now it s turning into fafo
i did this once not in a rude way or anything there were weddings in the building and we went to the wrong floor i was maybe and my cousin elena was the door to the elevator was right by the corner of the dance floor while we were waiting for it to come again we jokingly danced on the very corner of the floor perhaps feet from the elevator well several men came over and asked us if we were there for the wedding i said no we mistakenly went to the wrong floor and were just kind of vibing until the elevator got back they unanimously told me i had to leave but that my year old cousin could stay grossed me the fuck out
i would have called the cops and said we caught some people trying to steal the gifts
i really dislike this whole pranks for views thing
people need to start getting serious beat downs for this behavior
if you are doing any prank on tik tok there should be no repercussions for the people being pranked response
literally zero effort put in by these morons they look like they have t shirts on probably just walked by and we re like ohhh we can totally crash this wedding it ll be so funny
the absolute fucking fury id feel lol holy shit can we just ban prankster youtubers and tiktokers already
those kids are a bunch of losers
sick fucking mullet
people used to not do this kinda stuff because you d catch a beating
when my father died in funerals were tricky you could only have so many people show up at least where i was living and then anyone else would have had to watch a live stream of it i don t even really know what happened i wasn t watching the stream i was there in person but apparently people somehow hacked into it or whatever and started posting pornographic pictures people really have no respect for others
isn t that kid in the gray the same kid that s getting sued for pulling a prank on an old man in a mcdonald s like a week ago
i ve seen this video years ago without the tik tok voice overdub pretty sure this happened before tik tok was a thing
crashing a wedding goes very very wrong they claimed to know the bride then they were accused of lying and firmly asked to leave no one got physical no one got hysterical lame
that shit platform cannot be banned soon enough
this shit needs to stop being monetized it s so incredibly annoying and that folk like this are getting paid to make others lives more difficult
imagine thinking that walking into a formal wedding with fucking backpacks and t shirts was a good idea god damn i hate this time line where everything is half assed for views they literally made a fucking movie about this
how much of a loser do you have to be to crash a wedding
my wife and i crashed a wedding once but it was by recommendation of the bride and groom whom we did not know at all it was a fun night in burlington with them though
they need to be sued and arrested for them to learn that actuons have consequences trespassing and causing a public disturbance maybe
my dude at the end hit them with the raised voice and the crazy eyes homie was ready to start handing out naps
social media platforms should be sued for these types of videos in traditional media a show would need to get permission and a release to film social media can just have some morons break the law and post it on their platform and profit a traditional show would get sued
i love how social media turned being a jackass into a hobby job
fuck those dumb fucks
horrible little creeps
i ve always l off the guy coming in hot it s funny now isn t it
imagine waiting for so long to ask your s o to marry you and they say yes and you become the happiest person to walk on this planet best day ever wedding day happens emotions are running wild inside you and then it all goes down the toilet because the clown show decided they want views and crash a wedding and it happens to be yours what the fuck is with this generation
the standard response to pranksters should be to literally shove their phones up their asses and throw them out on the street
first priority in this situation should always be to stop them filming don t let them walk away with good content
if you re gonna crash a wedding at least look the part
should ve put all of their heads through a hard surface and called police absolutely disgusting shitbags
if you want to try this at a mexican wedding just take an envelope with cash in it or beer
if you re going to crash a wedding at least dress appropriately and bring a gift amateurs
all i m saying is that if these tiktok folks were catching more ass beatings for their shit behavior they d do this kind of thing less
ban tiktok
then they think it s funny enough to post fit everyone to see that are asshats
stupid white kids have nothing better to do
asian jordan peele
people spend thousands on their wedding day no fucking shit they re gonna get mad at some dipshits showing up in street clothes acting like jackasses holding their phones out
trying to say you know my wife was likely the first time he referred to her verbally as his wife
see funny vloggers thing whopping your ass is above the realm of possibility fuck around and find out
these idiotic pranks need to end bunch of children
i really want to be there and fucking deliver beatdowns to these absolute c nts
prankers are getting shot and these idiots are undeterred what a mind numbingly stupid menace to society this whole thing is
damn if they did that to owen wilson and vince vaughn the film wouldn t have been that good
he was so offended that they lied to him
security should have violently removed them
good for them some of this shit is getting out of control
now youse can t leave
this is the generation that makes fun of boomers
tik tok needs to ban accounts that do this stuff
doing viral videos are really getting out of hand they don t have an iota of shame or boundaries anymore for the clicks and likes
if it was my wedding they woulda left black and blue
i wish we had a day we could purge
i think one of them shat their pants when the big guy comes in yelling it s funny now isn t it
wish they woulda caught a beat down
douche bags are ruining weddings now clowns
when somebody that is being cuasi aggressive to you is also smiling you should take it very fucking serious cause they re not fooling around and are prepared let you find out
you can t crash a wedding in a t shirt i see clear violation of rules and of crashing kick them out of the guild
this is old and the crashers are still cunts fuck them hope they re still living off those internet points buying up rotten potatoes and cheap ass toilet paper then again they re probably just living off they re parents funds
i like how they pretend it is a coincidence that it was an asian american wedding they tried to ruin
they ll be more shocked when someone gets more than mad
mullet men diff
homie that read the situation and came in just to yell it s fucking funny now isn t it he s a real one
lolol the entitlement of zoomers
side note the wedding party seems like cool people i d totally feel safe around
have a woman drag them out by an ear somehow it s such an emasculating infantilizing thing to do pretty effective from what i ve seen
crashing a wedding is no joke there s potentially tens of thousands of cash lying around in the wishing well if it s one of those weddings and you wouldn t want some random walking in
the fact this video is on the internet speaks for itself yo trespassing and shii lucky no one had a gun these dumb a need to grow up and understand the vanity and shenanigans for likes will lead to demise this internet place and identity is dumb
showing up uninvited at a wedding is actually trespassing the bride and groom should press charges
damn kids thinking they are maroon
it s true these tiktokers are not sorry only sorry they got caught and couldn t make content at the expense of others especially on their wedding day cringe as fuck
we had some knuckeheads at my cousins wedding helping themselves to food and the open bar one of them had the nerve to get mad and tried to fight one of the groomsmen for kicking them out
this shits only going to get worse as more idiots try to make a living as tiktok stars
god i wanted to see some more physical karma
it would have been pretty easy to spot crashers at my wedding it was my wife s friends and family my side was literally me and my dog like oh you know the groom you re either full of shit or a zombie either way fuck off

the only upside to this is that both pearson and jones could likely be right back on the floor by the end of the month if their county commissioners appoint them back to fill their seats
how can a party expell the minority party s elected officials i haven t read how it s possible anywhere yet
they just motivated that young man more than they realize i hope he comes back and runs again because they can t stop him if he does
pearson has only been in the legislature since march 27th since being appointed in a special election only days into his term he has been expelled
whether you agree with it or not this was a really stupid move politically for the republicans alot of national attention is on this it s trending on twitter and a lot of those people who were protesting were new voters this may gave been the nail in their coffin
tennessee seems like the perfect place for the future capital of jesusland
disgusting the same party that defended the actions of jan 6th
gloria johnson is the only one of the three that survived being expelled obviously this appears it could be racially motivated
so they expelled the two black guys and let the white lady stay tell me republicans aren t racists
soooooo fuck the voters well i say fuck the tennessee legislation the voters better turnout in mass next year this is fascism through and through
why do republicans hate freedom of speech in america
remember when matt gaetz and a handful of maga idiots stormed a closed committee and disrupted testimony https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/republicans-crash-secure-room-disrupt-testimony-in-impeachment-probe.html just imagine if they had been expelled for this
so out with the two black guys keep the white lady
fuck you tennessee
do people in these districts get to stop paying taxes the whole without representation thing is real
and yet the democrats fold every damn time it s time to hold them accountable i m so tried of this bullshit party and system
has justin announced never if he is running for his seat again
this kind of thing undermines us foreign policy efforts when american politicians lecture other countries about democracy this is the kind of thing that other countries bring up but your country expels democratically elected officials over trivial meeting rule violations based on race when they try to protect your children from mass shootings
fascists squealing about the decorum of recess while standing atop a pile of dead children not only do they not care they are willing to make a show of this by airing their bigotry sparing the one white woman of the same crime they are beyond plausible deniability fascists are just flexing now
repulsive behavior by the gop fuck that whole lot and the people that support them
fuck tennessee now and forever
fuckin joke of a government we have
all this is racially motivated grew up in tn as a korean american and can attest to the vile racism that is taught by these closet racists i always told myself that they just don t know any better but in actuality they do fuck them cousin fucking bible licking rednecks
because i have no idea and i m sure others are in the same boat and may not take the time to research could someone explain what they were voting on and what we saw
out of order for receiving a loud standing ovation of approval what the actual fuck is happening down there in tn these anti american fucks are literally voting against the people in order to wrest a stranglehold on power they just blatantly disenfranchised all of those people gathered in their presence how did we get here wtf
is this an insurrection that people go to prison for
i haven t been up to date on this what reasons did they use to remove him
tennessee is a shit hole but that dude looks fly as hell
guys don t worry the governor of tennessee outlawed dressing in drag while also having dressed in drag in the past he is clearly a man of staunch integrity who will not let such an injustice stand jk dudes prob loving this more than walking around in stilettos and sipping champagne while watching golden girls reruns edit for the record i also enjoy wearing stilettos and sipping champagne while watching golden girls reruns
what time machine did they pull this guy of
don t they have other things to work on like school shootings
oh look the death of democracy
i was refreshing his statehouse webpage and they deleted him within the first seconds of the end of the vote about a couple hours after rep jones was expelled i saw they had deleted his official profile and i wondered how petty they were being and it was confirmed
fascism
they re going to regret that
the gop is really working to start something that cannot be extinguished
how many republicans are there out of the
yet they tn house allowed terry lynn weaver a congress person who was involved in an actual insurrection to complete her term without any objections or consequences for her
so if either side gets they could theoretically kick out the other party over and over until someone in their party wins the specify election
bro was channeling mlk
this makes me so fucking sick
i m a nashville local they stormed the congress floor with the protestors if you consider this and jan 6th the same senators and congressmen s heads would have been had by the left rules for these but not for me

what crime did he commit
out of were expelled what did they have in common
democracy where has it gone
tennessee fucked up
morally bankrupt trash politicians in the state of tennessee show how they do not represent the people of tennesse
expelled the black men but not the white woman who did the exact same thing as them hmmm
even yalls whiskey sucks tennessee do better
i ve been to tennessee many times it s the outpost of conservative white people even in places i thought would be more liberal like nashville and chattanooga they were really conservative with all these new companies move to tennessee for the tax breaks i expect the mentality to shift to become more liberal like north carolina and to some extent austin tx but that will take time
tennessee republicans just fucked around and now they re about to find out
reminds me of the quote from the film lotr gandalf said i think sorry so it begins
was curious what people on a fox news comment section had to say can t say i m surprised they keep using the word insurrection and calling for all three of them to be jailed you would think they would look in a dictionary and look up what a word means but the fact that they watch fox news leads me to believe that they don t like to read much
yo democrats in congress two days two days it took to expel so called insurrectionists you did nothing for two years except watch the capital insurrectionists legislate right beside you if you ever get power again let this be a lesson on how to wield power
this is not how any of this is supposed to work
a literal i m white and i say so moment
its shocking shocking to me that they only expelled the two black legislators oh tennessee you say never mind
i would really love to hear from a republican and tell me how you can justify this shit and still have any sort of pride or sense of justice
democracy takes another l to ignorance
unbelievable
first black man from any state legislature expelled or expelled since
really dumb
speak truth get shutdown
tn gqp showing that they care about the payments they get from the nra more than children being shot dead in schools
so this is what democracy looks like
this is what happens when corrupt conservative judges allow redistricting burn it all down
do not let fascism survive it s all fun and games until democrats start playing fire with fire expelling republicans from democrat controlled state legislatures still trying to find the justification for this
well well well i ve never seen such a big test of karma in my life this will certainly never come back to haunt the republicans
this guys malcolm x costume is on point
this makes me sick to be a resident of tennessee
elevate share and spread his voice
republicans are fascists
this country is going backwards
can they vote on bills without the seats filled
it s time to georgiasize tennessee
how this is democracy when one party can kick another parties members because they have the majority and then we have the audacity to label other countries not democratic we live in an illusion of democracy
the white lady survived because she didn t say anything and just stood by the other two when they rushed the well the other two had a megaphone and were chanting slogans and inciting the crowd on the gallery balcony
fascism
the gop fighting tooth and nail to hold on to power
good good good let s get rid of the people trying to solve problems that s always produced great results
this shit wouldn t be happening if liberals took the threat of fascism seriously instead of using it as a campaign prop
party of freeze peach
weird how the members expelled were black s
this is why we have a second amendment exercise your rights tennessee
so and both were the black guys ok
definitely racism
there are expected consequences for participating in an event that intentionally disrupts the processes of the legislature you hold office in
is it just me or is it strange both men that were expelled are black and johnson is white
morality and legality are not always synonymous
gqp rethuglicunts across the fruited plains shall remember this day when the gerrymandered tennessee legislator lynched the protest against saving school children from mass murder
i wonder if republicans marched into the state capitol and held up legislation for an hour in the office they were supposed to uphold if everyone here would be so vehemently up in arms about the other side voting them out
tennessee white people out of control and tennessee white people are ok with that must be that tennessee whiskey progress
straight out of the fascism playbook
fucking ridiculous they can do this shit
tn is saying that quiet part out loud
proof you can t vote out fascism they ll just expel the representatives the people voted for
i hate tennessee fascists
anything to distract us from what actually matters
muuuuuy trouble seor
love the super shitty spanglish
going to have to start using that line tu is in muy trouble senor
he is a sovereign citizen and he films himself travelling through toll booths and demands to speak english to mexican cops he is a fucking clown and the people defending him saying it s an illegal toll booth are dumbasses because even on the off chance that s true that is not the main thing going on here
i fuckin hate sovereign citizens they re such utter dumbasses he s lucky that he s alive because if he tried this in a cartel zone he d have been shot up
i feel like this dude should have got lit up
full video and context dude is sov cit who thinks all tolls are extortion https://youtu.be/31tpw7smd3y
so they record themselves running a toll and complain when the guards take action who the fuck do these people think they are
they wanted to film so they could seem like they were in the right but they also filmed themselves skipping the toll brilliance
those folks are lucky that wasn t a cartel run toll area or they ve been shot on the spot and chopped up

i remember watching this several times in another sub trying to figure out what happened to the glass did someone come up and baton it which would have been hilarious btw but no he drove into a lowered bar gate lol and this dude ran for a republican political seat before leaving for the off grid life in mexico then later dumped his wife kids for a new wifey down there total pos poor kids
this family is gonna end up dead in mexico acting like that
dumb ways to die
i wish i woke up with as much confidence as this guy when he decided that he s the arbiter of all laws us and mexican
this dude is hilarious and those toll booth cops deserve a medal for patience my white college roommate looked crosswise at a mexican cop in juarez and got his ass beat dudes partner casually chatted me up about entitled pinche gringos i just sat there wide eyed and completely silent for the seconds it took to rough him up then i picked him up and bought him a beer it wasn t a serious ass whoopin but just to make a point maybe this dude could use similar cultural relations training
these people are parents
i always laugh when she repeats you hurt my baby
i was expecting him getting arrested but the police officers were so confused of his shitty behavior hope they made him pay for that if you are foreigner in mexico don t be a bitch and behave like a normal person
this couple is dumb they risk their lives in a foreign country over a mexican toll i sort of recall a number of videos a long time back of stupid american tourists harrassing young native women somewhere in asia don t remember the country and the native people came to these women s rescue and beat the snot out of the american tourists you have to wonder how many americans act abhorrently and even criminally in other countries
you re in a whole lot of trouble senior they way he said that was so funny
when he said tu is criminal me and my mexican mom burst out laughing
privilaged idiat

dude this is hilarious to me tu muy in trouble pinche gringos pendejos
it looks like he drove through the barrier and it snapped back and broke the window and his privileged ass blames them for it
dude took one spanish lesson in duolingo and called it a day
i m shocked this dumbass didn t get clapped almost immediately after laying hands on the official his crying kids in the background probably saved his ass as those guys seemed like decent humans to hold back in the presence of children
i was waiting for someone off camera to throw a sandwich at his head when he started speaking spanish
tu eres in muy trouble seor lol
tu es in muuuuuy trouble sior
gringos are not sending their best
i feel like if they were in the usa the dude would ve gotten shot

he sounds like he s shouting at his dog
i m a sovereign citizen cool then get the fuck off our roads go make your own

sov citizens are nothing short of delusional
the guy driving a vehicle is a dumb fuck
quickest way to end up on a live leak video
this fuckwit puts his kids lives in danger then gets angry when their lives are endangered fuckwit shouldn t be allowed near his kids again for their sake
same dude got arrested at the truckee bug station
you can easily tell they do this shit on purpose cps should be contacted because they are really jeopardizing their kids safety
did a child actually say it hurt fight him
remind me of the south park episode last of the mehicans for some reason
someone s really getting their moneys worth out of that babbel spanish subscription
wow i google image searched his name and he looks exactly the way i expected him to look dweeb
is this a new reno episode
then everybody would scream and want biden to rescue them lol
i really didn t think people like this really existed if this was a mexican at a us border checkpoint it would have gone very differently kind of shows us who the assholes really are
those are some bad nombres for sure this dude is so dumb risking his children pulling this shit they ll be a time when he messes with the wrong toll booth and that ll be it
they were recording the whole time they knew what they were doing if i was in line and saw this i would ve kept calling him a jackass
who tf brings thier family on a vacation to mexico right now the griswalds with thier minivan having ass says enough right thier the idiocracy of these parents can you really be unaware of all the media attention to the cartel killing american traveller s and thier civil war poor kids
you hurt my baby was the funniest thing i ve heard this week don t blame them blame your dumb ass fucking clown of a husband
he s screaming that what they did is illegal please somebody make an example of him and soon
i smell someone is going to be a mexican prison bitch
he s lucky he didn t get shot
hey drive back over to the mex side and continue to show your ass you put your kids in danger not them you fucking twat
hold up who peed in somebody else s chair
i don t care if i get banned for saying it the people of tennessee should be rioting in the streets over this shit
hearing people like him make me want to run for some sort of office
the only prior precedence for ousting a voted in politician is if they broke serious law like taking bribes or sexual attacks what is going on here is literally making a mockery out of democracy the are going to annul three free elections by using a rule that has never been used for such a small infraction of the rules before the lady who got ousted gloria johnson is a special aid teacher and a freaking girl scout but alas she is a democrat who dared care too much for the children gunned down by school shooters the charges she was facing was stating she was yelling and hitting some furniture none of that is true it s insane how it was even included in the charges since there is video of the whole proceedings that day her lawyer asked for the person who wrote those charges to step forward none did the very same day this happened the same republicans voted in a new rule that demands armed guard present at each school in the state that was their solution to school shootings more guns
it s almost like republicans are trying to start another civil war or something what s next storming a federal building
i could listen to this guy all day it s like spoken word poetry
it was a good speech but the outcome was predetermined largely on party lines
says a lot about a political wing when they won t remove an impeached president who is demonstrably a threat to the country they are supposed to represent but in heart beat will throw out anyone who advocates for something that works against one of their largest contributors
this is so terrifying florida and tennessee and other completely red states are taking a hammer to the pillars of democracy
american hero
give the turds names so they can be held to the light
that s not how democracy work
i hope this shit blows up in the republicans reactionary faces democracy will persevere
republican party of shit bag terrorists
he kinda sounds like a preacher or slam poet anyway i think it s bs they are trying to expel him and his colleagues
republicans the party of criminals
republicans when kids are getting decapitated by rifle rounds in their own classrooms i sleep republicans when democrats use a megaphone expulsion
props to this guy
this cant possibly end well the short sightedness of what this will mean is astounding if any party in control can just kick members of the other side out democracy is over
nailed it on the head tn is going back to dark times fuck this state
just show up the next day like nothing happened get dragged out and it ll go viral
this is so silly the republicans are able to throw the random rule out and expel them because they have a majority the people disrupted the house and they had a megaphone with the democratic law makers because the republicans want to do nothing in response to gun deaths so now that means the state government is going to punish the people of tennessee by ousting their representatives what a gross perversion of our democratic systems
i m as happy as anyone that the geriatric spray tanned caligula finally got brought up on charges but please can we maybe focus our attention on the fact that things are still getting worse and that the shameful spectacle in the tn house today isn t just what we can expect it is what is actually happening right now trump being locked up while infinitely appealing doesn t mean much if his brand of fascism continues to take over
tennessee is a beautiful state but apparently the government of tennessee doesn t think so
republicans love their guns and give no shits when kids get murdered in school cause the nra pays
i think they will come to regret this he s going to eventually be back in their political lives in some form with a lot of new friends who weren t as engaged until now they just stacey abrams d him he s going to be a star
is he a politician or a pastor lol is that how he always speaks
republicanqaeda
wow powerful
the only good that can possibly come from this is that rep justin jones now has national name recognition and will hopefully run for higher office after he runs and is reelected to his seat in the special election that now follows his expulsion tn has always been a bit backwards but it s really taking it to new levels now
tn is full of people i don t want to be around if these are your reps shame on most of you
republicans are evil to tolerate them at all is cowardice

gop gang of pedophiles
gosh dang tennesee republicans are human trash oops i accidentally wrote tennessee
bravo
no lies detected fuck tennessee
why does this sound like a church sermon
this man speaks so eloquently he sounds like he s done a bit of slam poetry
this dude has a good message but the preacher cadence makes me want to tune out
i know nothing about this but can we expel him just for talking like that
i d expel him just for talking like that
adios muthafkr
they don t give a shit lol they re just gonna laugh and be like what the fuck are you gonna do bye you can t use a hypocrisy argument against someone that doesn t care
he looks like a dude who s been drinking all night before a day of exam and sleep while in class
makes me wonder why he is a republican
u savevideo
i love that let us be real at the end just perfect
oh my ga wd
whoever peed in the chair definitely expelled something so expulsion happened at least once
the way this guy speaks is a bit strange he pronunciation of words is a bit distracting also what s with the massive pauses he s not wrong though
where are the details on the pee chair
my pet theory is that americans don t riot like the french because our country is just too damn big couple that with decades of precarious employment where a single missed shift can mean you lose your home and folks have to choose between survival and rioting the capitalists of this nation have us right where they want us
majority of people of tennessee are republicans dumbass they are probably cheering this expulsion
why this is just cause and sets up for a scary future why not riot these people keep pushing and pushing when is it enough
peeing on someone s chair that s fucked up that s nasty that s republican
her lawyer asked for the person who wrote those charges to step forward none did does tennessee have some form of the right to face ones accuser
luckily gloria johnson narrowly avoided expulsion still waiting to hear about justin pearson though this is foul infuriating to watch and sets an insanely dangerous precedent edit pearson is expelled as well watching democracy die in real time is sure something
democracy has never been the right s end game the people making a mockery of it are the ones continuing to rely on it as the only tool for dealing with these insurrectionists
and essentially the precedent they re setting and the message they re sending to every state legislature out there is do whatever the fuck you want if the democrats try to argue just call them insurrectionists and expel them that s their new playbook now they re stealing the term insurrectionist and warping it the same way they stole the term fake news
is peeing on furniture still allowed
it s absolutely insane to me to think more guns is the solve to this shit
deleted
no they just know the people at the top who really make the decisions much prefer it how it is so they just let the poors debate and yell at each other it s all a made up game it always has been politicians have been knowing this since the 70s
civil war didn t turn out too well for them last time
they stormed the state capitol the fact that you don t know this should tell you everything you need to know about how the news you watch is biased
lel reddit wants a civil war at this point that s all you guys talk about huuurrr civil warrr hhuurrr
his cadence and delivery is r oddlysatisfying it s too bad the subject matter is infuriating
it actually irks me dunno why i mean i own amiri baraka records so i don t know why it does but that s the subjective ear for you
kinda reminds me of daveed diggs voice but draws out the ends of his words more and speaks more slowly
he sounds a bit like james baldwin
i like what he s saying but i personally don t like how he s saying it
absolutely the members don t give a fuck about this because they know morons are going to vote for them no matter what they ll continue to get republican support even if they murdered someone if it meant owning the libs
no need for names just look for the r after their name
tennesee is republican nothing will happen
he actually has been a preacher before don t know if he still is and has a degree in theology
this is a test this and in north carolina where that traitor switched from d to r because she got her fee fees hurt is a test tennessee and nc are pushing the boundaries to see how much they can get away with and all the other red states are watching closely and taking notes as long as they have the majority they re gonna do whatever they fucking want and not care who s watching they got away with it here and nc and now the dominos will be cascading
the nra doesn t pay shit and hasn t needed to since the supreme court decision dc v heller
everyone swings a little bit
yeah i hate when people speak clearly and concisely who needs that mess

that s what i was wondering
its because we lose our jobs and then our health insurance the only reason
the rich have figured out the perfect formula they keep us too busy to protest paid just enough not to starve but not paid enough to take time off and protest
or that france don t have nutjobs with guns everywhere
there are so many reasons that it doesn t happen like that in the us canada and a majority of them stem from the fact that out countries were started by protestors and the governments have spent the last couple hundred years trying to make it impossible to do again
it s not a pet theory it s a fact france is the size of the us and of the population
we ve rioted in the past right now we are too divided and distracted every american who values democracy should be in tennessee protesting but you won t see that happen part of the problem is seeing it as only tennessee s problem until the good people of the country come together and push back on these corrupt states nothing will change in those states
that plus it s a fucking nightmare to drive downtown with limited parking if we had solid public transportation like chicago or philly we d be protesting downtown non stop
yeah the right s common retort to left wing protests is dont these people have jobs
it s bc they shoot at us send dogs after us hit us with tear gas and water cannons kidnap us off the street cover their badges and names best us with batons
it must be nice living in a world where you pretend republican gerrymandering around city centres doesn t exist
man the more i see people saying this expulsion was right and just backed by misinformation the more i question why the fuck they throw themselves at a party which values their lack of education if a meteor were heading towards earth which could be seen plainly in the sky with the naked eye would you listen to them when they told you not to look up
why don t republicans support the constitution
majority of the voters not necessarily the majority of the people we are a deeply disenfranchised and demoralized state in my congressional district in the second largest choice made by eligible voters was to not show up in the first place
it s like a trademark that s fucked up that s nasty republican i say we run with it shit it totally fits
no expulsion for acts of piss the trumpgop playbook recommends promotion to leadership x200b all the way to the top if the pissing occurred in a russian hotel
it s the hallmark of someone who s parents bought their education and was placed into government as a useful idiot
i ve worked with some tn legislatures the bar is unbelievably fucking low for how stupid they can be like imagine the bottom third of your graduating class and you about have an idea of how smart your typical state rep is the pay is shit and these guys often run unopposed it s just a good ol boys club but not a sexy one like a trailer park one

blackrock gonna jack up all our rents now
took me a minute this is _inside_ a building hope everyone moves in
now steal the computers and comb tbrough all the files
good for them retirement age in the us is average lifespan in the us is
france protests are still going on i haven t seen it covered much lately
man i absolutely respect the fuck out the french right now
the rest of the world requests you burn it to the ground please
what s the consensus among the french people about this last time we had large scale anti establishment protests like this in britain the moderate middle aged voters dismissed it all as woke lefty cry babies and the media tried to bury it interested to know if public discourse is as broken across the channel as it is in my stupid little xenophobic island of a country
where s the monsanto offices
i picked the wrong day for my job interview
now this is how you protest
based
copy all the data that evil corporation has to have some secrets
this is how it s done
this is the first time i ever seen blackrock mentioned outside of some rambling of a conspiracy theorist what do they do edit most of these replies have been misinfo and exaggerated conspiratorial ramblings i know what they do now but i m skeptical of anyone who says they own the economy or the media or whatever else has been posted here
yeah fuck blackrock they re like an evil corporation in a dystopian novel but real
things are getting worse people are losing their unity they are no longer get along and are no longer peaceful in their country
stick it to the man
holy shit based
now this makes me smile
you know if we did things this way in the us we could actually start having some real progress instead we have a bunch of fucking chodes that would be saying while smirking when the looting starts the shooting starts don t forget the fascists made a hero out of an angry dork who killed protesters and got away with it stealth edit cope harder snowflakes your ideas are bad you should feel bad
hello based department
french traditions
imagine being at your desk doing your bullshit office job when all this shit goes down in the foyer
the french getting shit done this is a beautiful scene
no matter your political leanings i think everyone can get behind fuck blackrock
oh to see that happen on wall street
i love the french for their willingness to protest the ruling class america could learn something from them
you love to see it
the songs and flames of anti capitalism
this is the way
fuck blackrock
america is looking like a bunch of pansies now when we see how the french protest they target officials and corrupt institutions actually smart protestors
gif giphy pqmwjyrz39yag
parisians know how to fucking protest the rest of the west should take notes
can they go to switzerland next i hear davos is nice
unfathomably based
blackrock can kick rocks
what is this about retirement age
respect to the french they know how to protest
we should be doing this in the us
for a second i thought this was a rammstein concert
french are one of the only people onto the real issues in the u s we re fighting over stupid shit that doesn t really matter while blackrock steals all the land and assets
protestors in france rioters in the us
man do the french know how to riot vive la firebomb
where s jean valjean when you need him
if there is one thing to learn about the french it s the importance of fucking shit up to see the change you want
this le mis flash mob is intense
french revolution vibes
fuckblackrock
i ll admit it the french got one thing right and thats how to properly do a damn protest
black rock owns everything screw those guys
fuck blackrock
you spelled rioters wrong
i am so fucking insanely jealous of how the french protest america is such a joke in comparison lol
vive la france edit autocorrect
macron king louis the xvi
the french really know how to not take any shit when it s reasonable to stand up they don t act like this over small things they don t do it because a gilded dipshit asked them to they do it when shit is no longer tolerable
too bad the same doesn t happen to their offices in the us
and i thought i hated working
now this is who you protest people with money and power not like the stupid protestors who block everyday folks from going to work school or the hospital
they make us look like pussys over here they wit the shits over in paris if they don t like something they be in them streets be safe everyone
will they be called all the names that the george floyd protesters were call let s watch
americans be like oh no the property
france has more balls than any person living in the us right now we should be doing the exact same yet we just sit and let the government fuck us with no lube oh what s that another billion for zelensky so he can buy another mansion in a different country while our people barely have any money and can t even afford to get gas i ll take it
taken over unlocks door directs mob in giant pile of papers in the lobby light it on fire take videos your honor i have no idea where the paper documentation is it must have been lost in that riot the riot only entered the lobby are you telling me you keep your files in the lobby here are tik tok videos of the incident your honor see that fire must have contained the documents
i pray to god that the french government gives them what they want so i can stop seeing this obnoxious protest plastered everywhere on the internet it ain t that noble they re complaining about first world problems most people don t get retirement at all and reddit is a massive fucking bandwagon when it comes to this protest
broooooo i love the french so much solidarity for my comrades
americans take note ill cry tears of joy the day we start burning companies to the ground and holding people accountable until then we are subjected to parts of our country returning to the stone age and openly opposing liberty in the name of patriotism
let s go america time to stand up
deleted
guess who s going to pay for those repairs you and i
if all french protesters bought one share of gme and used drs they all be able to retire early
baguette folk sure do love a good riot good for them fuckin guillotine someone
looks like there s a black bloc in the blackrock am i right
don t burn it grab the hard drives and give them to hackers take pictures of all paperwork
do citadel next
do vanguard next
just for that they ll now have to work until they re lmao
you guys don t understand what black rock is and neither do these protestors this is almost as dumb as people protesting 5g towers y all are bots
i gotta say france knows how to protest this is all because they raised the retirement age there correct to like the us is work all your life and die years later
wake up america
my god that is great some country has to stop blackrock we wont
nice
removed by reddit
are the protests in france still going strong mainstream media is quiet
where s the fucking media coverage
america take notes
when france sneezes the rest of europe catches a cold
are they singing vindaloo in french
is this the fete of reason
can anyone identify the flags
just like the old days fire and flag
bring mecso much joy coming to a city near you
the french don t play
the roof the roof the roof is on fire we don t need no water let the motherfucker burn burn motherfucker burn
what song are they singing near the beginning of the video i think it sounds so good
awesome
this video looks like it could have been taken straight from the french revolution
did they go to the right house
wow this is effin crazy
whoops this is north maple street the dog beater lives at south sorry guy we just beat to death but you know mob justice
bakers dozens
was this the guy in georgia who beat his pitbull to death
the danger of doxxing
stuff like this concerns me what s to stop someone from doxxing an innocent person and lying about what they did
call me when something like this happens on corrupted politicians homes
i think it s generous to say maybe are actually passionate about animal welfare and just want an excuse to fuck shit up anonymously in a mob
this happend in israel mid covid https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/bat-yam-dog-abuser-convicted-for-animal-abuse-threatening-ex-girlfriend-664183
story time my mom had a friend and i stayed at thier farm house the guy got drunk the second night and tossed his little dog princess across the kitchen floor slid the poor thing amoung other things i won t put here i kept quiet told my mother the next day at home she has a soft spot for animals and a wild temper i expected her to to blow up she was quiet and didn t even blink the next monday the little dog princess was at our house i got the story years later out of my uncle my mother went drinking with this farm guy and brought her brother and went home pretending everything was okay then she slapped the guy around with my uncle supervising then said that he had to put that the dog was hers now in writing with a witness signature from his girlfriend dogs are sacred and they can t tell you if someone s hurting them that little dog had a great life with us
keep that same energy when any injustice occurs
i hate dog beaters but i also hate doxxing and the dangerous outcomes of mob mentality
i wish people cared that much about other animals more frequently abused
imagine if people cared about humans the way they do about dogs
looks more like s than dozens although both are technically accurate
why is the address of dog beater home published now he will lose his peace because there is always someone outside of his house
hopefully it s the right guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iypnwbtexc4)
people love dogs dont hurt the dog
okay this i can get behind
dozens crowd is bigger than a trump meeting
dozens r technicallythetruth
so did they help the dog or just shout
anyone have the original video that caused this
gif giphy yed7zezk5pjz8i9llf
does anybody have the videos of what happened that escalated into this
fuck that guy but fuck these people too
what s up with razor man trying to arm up he s no where near the person and is already in battle mode
nice
seems like the unemployed should be working at dog shelters then
dangerous stuff
looks closer to hundreds
good
wow this is we did it reddit in real life
more info please
can we have this energy for pedos
dozens is a nice way to describe a full on village sized mob
no no you guys this is the cat beater house the guy your looking for is two blocks down
this
dozens
dozens that looks like fucking people at least
just saw this post on instagram with an edit and knowing the reason with the help of reddit i love reddit gif giphy 9dgxhwoxhdhtf8bvwl downsized
so how come people are not like this when religious leader abuse children or when government steals from the citizens yeah humanity has their priorities right
and somehow michael vick gets forgotten
imagine if people cared this much about people
don t fuck with dogs
what if that wasnt the person who did it its very easy to do something like this to an innocent person
unless they got the dog out of there this isn t going to help hell likely just make things worse
i just hope the dude was guilty lol fuck that
dozens is an odd way of describing hundreds
dozens more like hundreds
so did they grab their pitchforks or just their phones i m an animal owner and love dogs but this is seriously over kill let the law do it s thing protest low sentencing making people fear for their lives is it s own kind of crime this guy could learn what he did was wrong and work towards change mob mentality will not change anything in this situation for the good yes i know i ll get down voted
mob rule
tons of wanna be john wicks here
amazing what lengths people will go to over a dog but not their fellow man so f ing weird man
surely there s worse peoples houses to go to
lmao what a bunch of idiots
this is definitely not because of a dog beating nice try op
i hope it s the right house at least
don t let that crowd know about the festivals in china and korea they do a lot more than beat dogs
finally a mob doing some good do not dare to beat dogs
all vegans i assume
but if its your wife an kids we dont care
yh the guys neighborhood will love these idiots on their doorstep why are people doing these things just to have something for their insta as if they really think about a fogs well being this is yet another dumb fuck mob on their way to relief their bullshit
yet most people are silent for basic human rights
this is the correct response if true
reddit i liek violence huurrr duurrrrrrr
crazy dog lovers lol
i love to see people coming together for a good cause
as much as i love dogs and consider this person to be scum this crowd are just equally scummy people looking to gang up on and best someone probably to death if no on stopped them people can not be allowed to mete out mob justice as they see fit when that happens in other countries it only leads to brutality and chaos with no reduction in crime crime does not stop crime
black mirror vibes
i fear for the future like are people insane what s stopping that guy from coming outside with a tommy gun and a cigar in his mouth to defend his home people don t even help women out when they re being treated like dogs by their spouse yet a dog so silly
this is tens of thousands on fox news
where s this kind of energy when it s a woman or child instead of a dog
i don t think that s dozens
i need a follow up
good
honestly just curious what was their purpose of this gathering and what did they achieve
black mirror predicted this
got to love mob justice sure hope he was guilty
gosh just wait until they learn about what happens to cows pigs and chickens every day
meanwhile palestine waiting on anyone to acknowledge them
i m not for violent behavior but beating a dog i hope he chokes to death in his testicles after a solid beating
i knew a couple of drug dealers back in the day grew up with them not my game one day they go to make a drop off to a street dealing lowlife and they find a starving and dehydrated staffy tied up in the back yard obviously beaten and close to death anyway after a few months of rehab barry recovered and went on to live a long and happy life once the former owner got out of hospital for what i can only assume was a totally unrelated accident he decided to leave town it was a happy ending
this is not right the court system will take care of him or her why don t you all have this energy when they abuse women and children have that energy when a child is sexually abused and their innocence is taken away the beating of a pet is wrong but why don t people stand up for their own they say that animals can not talk but children women can not either after they have been manipulated by their abuser can someone please explain this to me please be kind
i wonder how many of them happily eat meat everyday
now that is justice
fucking vegans
if we need to be engaging in frenzied rioting let s at least focus that energy on billionaires and other criminals that work on vast scales impacting mass victims i m against anyone abusing animals but let s prioritize our mob violence
well someone is going to have a ruff night

a local methhead beat his puppy to death outside our local safeway yrs ago i still have his photo in my favorite folder i hope to bump into him he was let off scott free pdx

for those of us on mobile with crap vision what did the banner say
i hate that people think i m overreacting when i say that there is an active fascist takeover going on in america right now
the gop in tennessee shouldn t know a moment of peace from here on
so the two black guys were expelled racism much tn
i know this is state level but when are we going to expel all the republicans that participated in the jan 6th failed coup
i used to wonder how anyone could let the nazis get into power during the past few years it is no longer a mystery
the just happen to be black
the u s lost the us in this scenario
we are watching the fall of democracy via reddit who da thunk
need more like this
f tennessee republicans
the party of free speech
ha jokes on them the politicians can t read suckers
tn voters having buyer s remorse don t worry they ll forget all about it and vote republican again next time
pssst they expelled the black ones btw
i don t believe they dropped it it was ripped from their hands by fascists
random thought but as soon as i saw that banner lowered so much i knew it would only be a matter of seconds before it was ripped away should have put it up higher because god knows most of those fat cats can t jumped higher than a few inches off the ground
do something pls biden
fascist is the new buzz word that of the people who use it have no idea what it means

rural tn against fascist gop
before the orange blob fish first got elected i was a dumb year old who wasn t informed on didn t care for politics yet i told my parents i knew he was leading us to another holocaust they criticized me but the past few years they ve been saying the same i was raised in florida and have a lot of conservative friends who also obviously think that my claim is irrational it s unfortunate they ll probably also be agreeing soon
yup since trump came to power this country went to hell quickly
same fucking same i have a masters degree in political science and trying to explain this to people is infuriating
you re overreacting they broke the rules of the job so they get the boot it s not hard
there base won t care they are too busy going to fake dispensary s with diet weed where they act like it s legit stuff the state is a lost cause they aren t the brightest

that s different and if you don t know why the gop already stated it was because of skin color
probably because america hired nazi leaders from japan germany in exchange for their research involving live human subjects those people lived the rest of their lives free men and were rewarded for their atrocities but it surprises you that their mask is slipping now we ve been known america s true colors and they aren t red white and blue they re red white and black with a bastardized symbol in the middle
started with covid lockdowns
fascism fascism is a system of government that typically rules by forcefully and often violently suppressing opposition and criticism controlling all industry and commerce and promoting nationalism and often racism maybe you should read a fucking book you trog
ok so what does it mean then
fuck off
fascist is the new buzz word that of the people who use it have no idea what it means and of you fucks always mis represent the facts
yea all they did was oust a political opponent who was elected by the people because they disagreed with his right to voice his opinion
you mean like ronald reagan
seek help idiot
taking guns is not the same as gun legislation for instance let s start with licensing requirements you need a license for every gun you own and it has to be renewed and licensing requires education and safety training do you oppose this how about requiring a mental health evaluation and closing all loopholes to get around these rules do you oppose all these things too i know some people are yelling to ban all weapons but the majority are not most just want better regulation why is that fascist
and uneducated idiots like you are the reason the fascists can convince you of this edit this guy commenting under this particular thread felt the need to delete the original comment fascists are the ones who take your guns away to give some context may or may not be the exact wording but that s the basic comment he made
who tf has taken your guns no one
thanks
if a holocaust would have helped him hold power he wouldn t have blinked at the idea
it s good that you card but you still aren t informed on the subject this is crazy
so yearold where is the active holocaust were all missing
fuck your decorum
that s not how that works actually expulsion is not an appropriate response to every rule break also i don t see you enraged about multiple supreme court justices not being given the boot in your post history
subversion of democracy using democracy against itself is one of the hallmarks of fascism that almost every political scientist can agree on meanwhile we got you out here doing their pr work for them pro bono suck dicks
oh the irony in your statement is lost on you
yeah tennessee is sadly trash sucks dolly had to be from there and put dollywood there everyone else is trash even the cities like nashville are just fake hicks whining about la when they are just eastern la at this point they are all hat no cattle wearing cowboys hates going to the trader joe and whining about the liberals all while the city is very liberal you see it a lot with cities in these dumb states asheville louisville savannah etc are all cities that are super liberal but still have lots of hillbillies hanging around
yep folks who want to learn more about how america secretly brought those post ww2 nazis at the top of their fields and stuck them in high ranking positions all over america should look into operation paperclip https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_paperclip) the nazis the literal nazis have been here a long long time now and we chose them
nazis copied american eugenics also fascism started in the us
if dems use it is bad reps use it good
i m not wrong low life
guns go first tyranny comes later cuba is the prime example
that s a very ignorant statement
at this rate or years away
nah i actually support their actions decorum is extremely important and in court can land you in jail if you violate it decorum is what keeps society held together it s called tackling an issue calmly and rationally i ll say it again they fucked around and found out
it s selective application of rules it s a standard facist tactic and allows the bootlickers to position an isolated argument that they can suggests is reasonable as long as it remains out of examination of the entire set of facts basically it s politicians at their worst and suckers supporting the misscarriage of the state constitution
you were so mad you went over my post history honestly that s kind of cute
don t lump us all together like that i m not trash gloria is not trash jones and pearson are not trash we are currently outnumbered by indoctrinated zealots religious extremists and power hungry politicians but my family has been here since before tennessee was a state i m not just going to give up and let small minded bigots win
the entire south is trash sorry to say it
and look up unit in japan terrible terrible stuff
literally
you are the one posting comments that sound an awful like you are in support of fascist moves like expelling representatives because they don t line up with your views and race quit while you are ahead
who is being genocided and how did you come to that timeline
you re not entirely wrong the rules not applying to white people is certainly what keeps our society going as is
i d imagine peeing on a fellow representative s chair would count as a decorum breach as would physically assaulting a fellow representative then there s the issue of video recording on the house floor none of these have been addressed
lol sure thing pal decorum dead kids am i right
says the people who hate trump shit talk his way into the white house
ya that s why it s worked so well for us since the beginning of this country like all the shit they ve done hasn t led up to where we are now shit didn t just start hitting the fan it s been splattered the whole fuckin room for a long time
you think it s hard or involved to ctrl f
wow before june 1st that s a looong time ago
agreed it s on the list of things to learn about alongside the tuskegee experiments and mk ultra governments doing mad science experiments on people is nightmare fuel
what has race got to do with anything and stop ass uming things
this is how is has started time and time again the rise of fascism leads to genocide right now it seems like trans and gay people are on the chopping block why s it always seem to be the guys with generic randomized usernames that don t see this this happening
watch and next he s gonna deflect as hard as possible to say oh but your e making it about race we re just following the rules
she escaped by a single vote seems to be because she wasn t the one with the megaphone and wasn t shouting context matters but not like you care about that anyways
ctrl f only works on a single page bruh i got a lot of pages with an year old account
yes i love a fellow history nerd
they literally expelled the two people of color that didn t agree with them and kept the one white representative that was guilty of the same thing race has plenty to do with this issue
you guys need to get off line i live in an overwhelmingly red area and no one wants fascism and no one wants to kill anyone i ve been hearing fascism is right around the corner my entire life and it hasn t happened but if you guys want to stand on the corner with the end is near signs on go for it there s a reason patriot front can t ever get more than guys to show up
stating facts isn t deflecting i appreciate the try though goldstar jpg for you
and all the lawmakers who have broken the rules and not faced expulsion bitch please
you know gun control was invented to keep slaves from owning guns
haha i betcha half of them can t properly describe fascism to you bud
tyler texas would like to have a word with you lol
no comment on the same house and members urinating in the same chamber
they broke the rules trying to interrupt a democratic process with a megaphone it s so ironic people are getting so mad over a representative being expelled for trying to disrupt democracy that s pretty high up there on the do not do list
oh god you re one of those people show the class where in this conversation i said that you shouldn t have guns this isn t about guns you idiot this about free speech and the fact that these representatives exercised their right to free speech and were expelled for that and for the color of their skin get your head out of your ass and fucking read fascists take away your right to free speech i don t care about the guns i don t own one i don t care if you own one that s your god given right or whatever the fuck you want to call it but so is free speech dumbass you want to argue one but take away the other doesn t work that way edit i see you are deleting comments now that they were downvoted into oblivion so we both know your point is invalid edit thanks for the gold anonymous stranger
expel them too rules are rules and i support equal application regardless of party or affiliation
shut the fuck up loser
see that s the problem you don t care
i support equal application three hours earlier the nra isn t paid off no way no way come on fam step back into reality lots of sane critical thinkers waiting for you on the other side
no you don t
this is what someone responds with when their argument completely fails and they have nothing else

is this the incident that happened in dc with the park police and the stolen car
need to mark nsfw as they kill him in the video
they brought stuff up like this in the academy old career lol if you didn t jump into the back of the car you would not have been in danger
never seen anything like this before why did the cop hop in the back like it s his fucking uber
shoots the driver multiple times in the back car crashes don t move don t move
it s funny bc the cop said stop or i ll shoot and by the time he said shoot he already fired
why the fuck did they sneak in the car like that why the fuck did they not just wake the dude up and pull him out the car this cop was mad stupid the car ran into a house and put those people there in danger this is dogshit police work
stop or i ll bam bam bam bam bam bam bam shoot don t move man
how does shooting this guy make any fucking sense at all the cop isn t safer after shooting him and the other people on the road aren t safer either the only thing he accomplished was to create an uncontrollable vehicle what a fucking idiot at the very least he should lose his job
did he just light that mafucka up in the back x200b don t move he s aerated his chest edit it s frightening how many people here just love that this guy was shot to death the fuck is wrong with americans
in the longer version of this encounter i think one of the cops said to the others don t get in the car so if they d each agreed not to get in the car how did this guy wind up in the vehicle as to the shooting itself i m asking where was your taser after all you ve decided with three bullets to incapacitate the driver of a speeding car so why not do it with a taser or nightstick to the back of the head
sneaking into the suspect s car while they re sleeping to arrest him probably seemed more badass in the cop s head than it actually turned out
stop or i ll shoot seconds later he drops the fucking magazine into him
classic put yourself in harms way to justify using deadly force they could ve just boxed him in before waking him up but instead decided to sneak into the car and wake him up in a choke hold jesus
absolutely unnecessary but probably legal shooting perp is an idiot though
i got banned for uploading the covenent school shooter video yet this video stays you mods are weird af
to this day i do not understand the actual purpose behind telling someone don t move when u clearly obliterated their chest cavity with bullets policy or not once someone been lit up with shots cops should juss immediately render aid or at the very least if they are that concerned move in immediately and cuff the person like i don t get why they shoot and then still maintain distance and yell commands as if the persons rlly gonna give a fuck to be a threat after being shot
okay i understand the cop was in potential danger but he gave no time for the stop or ill shoot warning i understand that grabbing him or tasing him may have made him steer the car into a pedestrian or something however i can t see this as justifiable for killing another person
this shit was so fucked up the full body camera footage even shows the officers coming up with a solid plan to take the kid in peacefully and then they abandoned it and did this instead all the officer had to do was grab the keys from the cup holder before the kid woke up but instead he started screaming at him did nothing as the kid put the keys into the ignition and put the car in park and then executed him
the kid was sleeping in a stolen car now the kid is dead car is wrecked and a house is fucked up too someone in the house could ve been killed because of mr diehard in the back seat the cop obviously did way more harm than good surrounding the stolen car with police cars and telling him to get out makes way more sense than sneaking in the backseat
kid was a complete fucking idiot for not stopping the cop was a complete fucking idiot jumping into the car in the first place also don t cops still carry fucking stun guns maybe start there in this type of situation
shouldn t he have just pulled the emergency brake
cop don t move kid
kid s a dumbass but he didnt have a taser was shots necessary
everything seems avoidable from the cops perspective driving was a stupid decision so i don t balme the outcome but someone could still have a life if the policeman just didn t get into the backseat
stop or i ll shoot gives 1s time to react
well that was unnecessary
stop or i ll bang bang bang shoot
qc who s gonna pay for that damaged house
fyi officers were told that if he drives off to leave him be the kid was asleep in the supposed stolen car this officer decided to not do what his supervisor said and it resulted in him killing the year old
the biggest problem i see with law enforcement is that they are all afraid of death it they where not worried so much about how can i die right now then they would have the headspace to make better decisions life is risky every day but especially for law enforcement and military etc don t take a job that you re gonna be scared to wear the uniform every day
as usual another american security video bam bam bam greetings from europe
stop or i ll shoobam bam bam bam
i still don t understand why exactly they thought startling him from the back of the car was a good idea in any sense and then you shoot the person in operation of a vehicle you are hanging out of
is this a setup cops on both sides of the car you can see the other through the window in the beginning cop is just standing there like he just turned on his body cam you hear a door shut or the car go into drive and the cop jumps in the back of the vehicle and because the car took off this killing will be justified why did the cop on the other side let him back in the car cops don t search your car with you in it if the kid drove out of fear for his life then they were probably going to kill him either way
stop or i ll sh pop pop pop oot
stop or i ll shoot kills him second later wtaf
stop or i shoot seconds later kills him
not much time elapsed between stop or i ll shoot and putting rounds in his spine
hey guys what about do not drive off with a police officer in the backseat telling you he s gonna shoot you all of this after the fact you got arrested i don t know seems like a good idea
the teenage brain basically formats half of its os at the start of puberty it starts later for boys on average this kid was not even close to having a functional logical rational brain empathy was still a decade away kids are fucking stupid
shots point blank in the back jumps out don t move he s dead asshole he wont be moving
stop or i ll shoot bang bang bang american police are truly the absolute worst police force in the world
in so many ways this was completely needless i have zero police training what so ever and i could come up with a bunch of better safer ways to handle this but none of those ways would have been as exciting as the cops involved wanted to make it much of policing is very difficult impossible to differentiate from a gang out having a great time with impunity and i can say all of that without needing to say anything other than the kid who died was a criminal who did bad things not really things that needed to end his life though
i don t understand that the cop jumps in the car guy takes off i have no choice but to shoot him
what a moron to be clear i m talking about the cop
how is it a smart idea at all for your own safety to blast the person who is driving the car you re currently driving seems like a good way to send this car careening uncontrollably into traffic possibly injuring innocent bystanders
stop or ill shoo bangbangbangbangbang cunt didn t even finish his fucking sentence before unloading on his back
don t move don t move well you shot him or times in the back i don t think he ll be doing a lot of moving
the timing between the stop or i ll shoot and the shots being fired is more indicative of a notification that something is going to happen and not a warning to cease
does this fit in r kidsarefuckingstupid
i just can t force myself to feel bad for someone who stole a car someone worked so hard to earn that and relied on that car to live only for a cancer of society to steal it from them
that was so fucking unnecessary if he gave him even whole second to respond to that gun this is infuriating
show the entire video how the police were quietly trying to open the door which is strange because how can you enter a vehicle without permission only after he wakes up do the police become loud
telling him don t move don t move after he shot the kid five times in the back
less than seconds took place from when he said stop or i ll shoot to him shooting times killing this man an entire overhaul of training discipline and hiring needs to take place so this doesn t happen acab
play stupid games win stupid prizes
i can t believe how many people are excusing the actions of this kid unbelievable
it s just insane to me how weak these piglets are so they actually have to shoot a yr old grown ass men can t stop a kid from driving off
that was hard to watch but i also don t blame the cop it is more of stupid all around where it just checks out
cops spent minutes chilling at the car with the doors open and it didn t come to any of them that they should take the keys out
it s a civil rights case now
why did he jump in the backseat
he could have easily tased the kid instead of murdering him
he had exactly seconds to comply to the command stop or i ll shoot before the officer started dumping rounds into him lol
stop or i ll blang blang blang blang shoot
couldn t he start with one shot and see if that would be effective i think it might be
state sanctioned criminals
need full video
this is fucking ridiculous
that deescalated quickly
i really don t know why if they were worried about him taking off they did not simply park a cruiser in front of the vehicle dude was just sleeping and woke up to people jumping him
dumb he could ve crashed into innocent people and killed them both they don t know how to negotiate anymore buuuuut cop should ve went for the passenger seat not the back
stop or i ll shoot doesn t give time to stop
dumbass cop logic
he said stop or i ll shoot as a count down to shoot didn t give time to see if he would stop
curious why cop didnt use stun gun instead of his firearm
taser must have been broken
murder
why was walking up to the car and waking the teen up not an option what was the point of getting in the car unjustifiable murder of a year old
people need to stop trying to turn r publicfreakout into r watchpeopledie at least get a fucking nsfw tag up on it
ok i m confused is it just ok to shoot whenever i thought unless a deadly weapon was used they just tased you or something
dumb cop should have listened and shouldn t have been in the car i don t care about the driver but putting others at risk is moronic
well if a cop says to do something or he ll shoot best do whatever he says fr fr him and everyone that fuk with police like that deserve what they got
when your sometimes you make bad decisions
thin blue line of murderers shooting people in the back
it is ok and he will back in the street
stop or i ll shoot immediately fires gun
did the driver survive
telling him to stop after they shot him in thr back that many times
this is heavily edited down the original had the cops discussing how to approach this for mins they talked about putting a squad car in front and on the side to keep the guy from driving away and how the officer who ended up in the back seat should not be there if the guy panicked guess what no one put their squad car in front or on the side and the officer who got into the car got stuck as the guy panicked the car thief is dead and the officers bungled every attempt to keep that from being the outcome every video i see from this youtube account always ends the same lately officer involved shooting and a dead suspect the us police are no longer simply to serve and protect but to bumble and kill any suspect
stolen firearm stolen vehicle justified shooting even if the cop fucked up also why is a 17yr old kid sleeping in a stolen car and not at their mums house bet he was a good boy too
so today i watched a nsfw video bc a few guys were wearing sports bras then i watch this video of a murder w no warning great they didn t even mention the shooting in the title that s a pretty important part of the video
surely the safest thing for the cop to do in that situation was to stop the only thing in this case a person that could prevent the car from becoming an uncontrolled death machine
2c bitch locks keep honest people out kid wasent raised right and deserved it f u mom and dad this on you bitches
this should be marked nsfl i didn t wanna see some kid getting killed
when your only tool is a hammer everything looks like a nail
that kid just wanted to go to college
gif giphy vfake5xm1tdwjgimyw not the brightest crayon in the box was he
they just created the next leader of the next civil rights movement and made this man more powerful than he ever would be if they ignored him
no surprise in klan country fuck tennessee
biden hire this man
i like this guy
gop is a fascist movement this needs to be stated clearly often and they need to be shamed for it
fuck tn
they just fast tracked his career incredible
cia definitely has a file on this man
this dudes a beast
the revolution will not be televised
i thought protesting inside capitol buildings and threatening lawmakers was bad
i don t understand how people still support blm it s been proven that they never really did anything to help the black community they just took the money and bought million dollar mansions then when asked what happened to the money they said they didn t know

the fact that they thought no one would notice that fact it s like they re doing literally everything in their power to make people hate them
hes what we need
there are so many wonderful people here but holy shit we are a racist country
bro don t say that or the us will hire a guy to assassinate him and then take the fall
you may be right no one outside of his own district would have even known who he was before this
exact same thing i told my brother in real time the funny thing is that this will cause a special election and they can just win their seat back
thats not how it works
i ve been saying the same thing i m canadian and would never have heard of this guy glad they helped raise his profile though
he really could be the future tennessee needs
he can replace clarence thomas
based
huh oh sorry i was still searching around for who asked
what happens when one party takes over illegally without recourse what do people do
how is it even remotely legal to block lawmakers who have committed no crimes from entering the house chamber
how are they officials
why are we failing with gen z gop s best minds
oh my god why are they all fat no cardio at the tennessee police department
funny this is what all the gravy seals say they need their guns for to overthrow an oppressive government ya know like expelling lawmakers who were legitimately voted in because they have disagreements tennessee just another shit hole state
vote
we the people am i right everyone
these republican fuckers are backing themselves into a corner with this kind of rock bottom fascist bullshit no way out of this without doubling down and continuing to alienate more and more people
i m volunteering for the democratic party headquarters in my city today fuck republican fascists
i see they re really winning over the hearts and minds of the forthcoming generation of voters no wonder they re so desperate to purge libraries and school curricula of anything that wouldn t be found on a christian nationalist homeschooling website the only way they can hope to produce another generation of right wing voters is by intensively indoctrinating them

what don t they allow guns in chamber gun rights for all
a parade of piggies all too busy just following orders to realize they are the bad guys some hell most of them probably like that though
free donuts upstairs free donuts free donuts free donuts
is there not a weight limit for police
you have to be trump supporters to just be let inside the capitol to do as you please didn t you know
land of free home of the brave gif giphy 10jhvifuu2gwd6
wait is that a metal detector but what do they have to fear from guns if they re expelling members for advocating for stronger gun regulations
expelled for expressing their rights where is the doj this shenanigans needs to end
i can t wait til all these boomer voters and boomer law makers expire and we can maybe have some decent candidates to vote for
good to see some places are sticking up for gun owners and rights
look an insurrection
i got a better sentence pro gun violence politicians expel lawmakers who made stand against it
what happens in the video
what is this gqp horseshit deutschland bunch of cowardly trumpers
i support these cops
a bunch of insurrectionists trying to over throw democracy thats what i see
so did they get let up
why do the police and armed agents of the states align with evil when fascists take over a state when are they going to learn to stand with the perople they serve and not beholden to the evil slime that will surely become undone in the near future
americans are stupid
it s crazy that people think that guns are gonna go away so easily it s not like it s a billion dollar industry or something
and that kids is a fascism
guns should not be allowed to prevent people from violence and killing people many people die because of the use of guns
expel officials who support gun violence prevention i can t tell who s side i m on i m going to start a group called the people against those who do not like the anti violence defenders coalition i think
what s going on are they being blocked because they want to keep minimal gun control or to regulate it more
see france at the blackrock headquarters in paris
i ve heard from a great many gun nuts who say that s what the 2nd amendment is for but they probably weren t picturing dirty liberals being the ones to rise up against tyranny or whatever
gif giphy k5y3uw6znek85g90tk downsized
sit around and say all i can do is vote oh well sorry about the fascism guys
the guns over people gop party of tennessee defend the rights of pro school shooters at all cost
stop wearing pink pussy hats and sharing memes on facebook thinking that will change things
burn it down
jan
if you live in chicago new york and california you just bend over and take it
they re not blocking lawmakers they re blocking the protesters the part about the lawmakers are the expulsions
new guns over people gop slogan give me guns and give you death
deleted
you got me i have no idea what is going on here i have read this far down and i don t even know for sure what state this is in
it s a bit misleading basicly the crowd was upstairs a few days ago chanting legally and dem members on the floor joined chanting from the floor the head of the chambers said they were leading an interaction worse then jan 6th and had the members removed from all their committees now they are voting for the gun law they are protecting before but the group and the members aren t allowed in
because the people let them be hint there s more of you than them
i always laugh when the gravy seals say they need to maintain a well regulated militia yeah sure your ar15 is going to be effective against a tank
this rock bottom fascist bullshit will be cheered on by the majority of the tennessee electorate they re alienating plenty but shoring up support from their maga base in the process divisiveness gets votes in tennessee
yeah those fascists not wanting to remove peoples right to own firearms
no on their mind they are the heros preventing the evil libs from doing what ever they do
one party rule by a minority is democracy huh
well then you re an idiot
by peacefully protesting and in no way trying to stop an elected government from performing its duties
go ahead and compare this to jan 6th just for fun the difference here is that it s in protest to the continual unnecessary death of citizens especially children at the hands of mass shooters whereas jan 6th was a qanon circle jerk started by a bunch of bullshit lies from a reprehensible man child who despite being arguably the most powerful man in the world at the time still framed himself to be a victim
american politics and policies sure also wouldn t be calling out stupidity with that username sir
you seem to be as intelligent as a discarded cum sock so you re opinion isn t very valuable to anyone
im american im not stupid so be nice
many are many aren t it s the same all around the world stupid
the national guard would be shooting to kill if we did that here
and they don t even have guns like we do
they picture getting to be the sturmabteilung seriously throughout all our history from indian removal to japanese internment to the patriot act torture at gitmo and extraordinary rendition to extrajudicial assassinations of us citizens with drones to kids in cages and involuntary hysterectomies to faceless badgeless goons scooping protestors off the streets of portland without probable cause and hauling them off in unmarked vans whenever the government has behaved tyranically the from my cold dead hands crowd could reliably be found waving flags and cheering
they weren t picturing the govt having tanks and assault rifles and tear gas ect ect
this isn t a sports game idiot there aren t teams or sides or referees
we need a forum where we are allowed to say something besides just vote
yet they do not want to allow people access to medical treatment to treat the underlying mental illnesses that are a cause of school shootings it makes zero sense
no jan was an attempt of a mintority party illegally taking over
they remove democratically elected republicans there
seriously though there are more guns than people in this country already according to their theory at what degree of saturation are good guys with guns supposed to start reducing the number of mass shootings taking place
tennessee constitution article section any member of either house of the general assembly shall have liberty to dissent from and protest against any act or resolve which he may think injurious to the public or to any individual and to have the reasons for his dissent entered on the journals
how did they violate the rules of the legislature
maybe you should learn how to read
where is this
the maga idiots days are numbered they re fat angry old unhealthy and are all gonna die soon that s why the gop is trying to fast track all this nasty dumb fake bullshit
there are fascists for kicking out elected officials for peacefully chanting for more gun laws no one is trying to remove people s rights but put common sense fun reform on the table every gun owner i knows agrees with more laws for background checks and making sure crazy people not get guns even my best friend who is a cop thinks we need to do something more like background checks more guns in crazy people s hands makes his job more dangerous
dumb shit
yep thats what the news tells people in new york chicago and california one party has ruled in those places for decades get used to it
tennessee legislators were afraid for their lives remember thats what matters
they were asked to leave the capitol and they didn t not leaving after being asked is the definition of trying to over throw democracy i have heard that everyday from the only source of news i trust so please don t disagree with cnn msnbc and the new york times or you will label forever as a democracy destroyer denier
na he s right you re the idiot
stop spreading fact free conspiracies reddit will ban you congress people were afraid for their lives their fear of harm out weights your protests
they were asked to leave the capitol and they didn t not leaving after being asked is the definition of trying to over throw democracy i have heard that everyday from the only source of news i trust so please don t disagree with cnn msnbc and the new york times or you will be labeled forever as a democracy destroyer denier
thats what people think that their protest is justfied they are on the correct side that they are the righteous ones that when they do the same thing that somehow its different the hardest thing for any person to master his having a consistant moral compass
i choose to live my life how i want regardless of who is running a country people are to sensitive
most you alright though i guess
there is no response to your comment that wouldn t violate reddit terms of service
well unless you wear a buffalo head
luckily we have more than just the first amendment
they didn t shoot to kill at the capitol
well they did kent state us a number of years back
that s what the guns are supposed to be for not shooting up schools
one does not simply defeat guerrilla warfare see afghanistan for years see vietnam vs us
leftists democrats republicans conservatives and the judicial branch there are definitely teams and sides and referees
see thats where you re wrong it is a big fucking sad game
mental health access is a big issue but access to guns is a bigger one
what got taken over it was a protest just like this or are u saying all protest that get violent are and attempt to usurp the government
when your buddy has sustained a major head trauma and is unconscious the best thing to do is to grab his head and shake it while slapping him and screaming in his face
either he has hands of stone or both those guys have glass jaws
everytime i see this video i always gotta give props to that leg kick assist
ah hobo days at south dakota state there homecoming event that usually leads to about police phone calls and arrests mostly for drunk and disorderly if i remember correctly the guy didn t catch any charges for this it was determined that the men were trespassing oh and the screaming banshee started the fight here s an article for it from years ago https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5268167/shocking-moment-man-knocks-two-men-brawl.html
bitch shut up i just got my shit rocked
the girl screaming jesus stfu
i hate people getting into a fight and every damn person wants to get involved they got into fight one lost move on
i can hear the one punch man opening when he hits
well once i take out the leader which is you i ll have to contend with one or two enthusiastic wingmen the last two guys they always run jack reacher
straight deleted them
i friggin love the kick trip more then the knockout punches that shit was so smooth
bbbbrendann waaakeupppppeeeeee lmaaaaaao
jesus listen to her scream he may have knocked out the wrong person
we had this guy in high school who was a local legend luckily i was on his good side one night at a party another school crashed our homecoming party and it caused some issues i watched this man we were about but he was a fucking man take on people at once seconds and swings later he was surrounded by unconscious bodies
love the way there s always a girl screaming like i know i ll fix this situation by adding a horrible loud noise in addition to everything that s already going on
ah yes the female blood curdling scream to calm things down
better title is wasted ppl fight drunk guy
avg gpa n a
the scream probably do more damage than the punch to the first guy
i wouldn t want to wake up if i was brandon if that s what i m coming back to
nothing as beautiful as the siren s song of a drunk college girl screeching and cackling over her knocked out bf
the first guy doesn t even have his hands up and is turning away from mr stonehands the other guy was probably drunk and banged his head on the concrete
but did brandon wake up
he s unconscious better start jerking his head around and shrieking
steve will do it
that 2nd guy that went down just barely missed the grass and hit the one section of yard that was covered in concrete
i m glad i don t associate with any of the people in this vid very trashy all round
brandon wake up noooooooo bahahahahaha maybe if your boy friend wasn t a punk bitch you wouldn t be crying for the internet
this right here is what happens when you get a kid from an area where fightin is normal and throw and them in with kids who grew up just talkin bout fightin
if that voice was yelling at me to wake up i d probably just go towards the light
jeez every time there s always a group fight there s always that one girl who screams like a banshee he s not dead he got knocked out you don t have to scream wake up inches from his face he s already moving by the time you are screaming
if i was knocked out and got woke up like that girl was doing at the end i would probably panic and still be in fight or flight and hit whoever is doing it
it took me views to see the other guy kick trip him
the 2nd guy literally ran into the guys fist
leg kick was huge
just keep slapping him in the head i m sure that ll help
weird to be at a party where no one is friends may as well hang at the bus stop
for whatever reason the second dude to get knocked the fuck out looks like he has been deserving a punch like that since childhood
omg someone muzzle the crying girl
the hysterical girlfriend was a nice touch
the second guy must ve thought football is a fighting style
she sounds like a fucking mandrake
people that think slapping someone that just took trauma to the head is a good idea shouldn t breed fucking spazzes
queue the obligatory hysterical girlfriend
my loved one has received head trauma you know what would help slapping and screaming in his face
he was an honorable dude when the first guy went down he let let him down easy and didn t continue to strike him then he tried to avoid the 2nd altercation
lol my dude is just taking a nap in the grass those girls were so dramatic acting like he was dead they ll both be fine
flawless victory
hands of st trina
ole boy has got hammers for fists
dude handing out naps like rhe sandman
this is what happens when you re bad and try to jump in
that one homie is going to wake up wondering why his ears are bleeding didn t i get hit in the jaw
slapping the guy with blood coming from his mouth is definitely the thing to do when someone may have a concussion s
flawless victory
imagine getting your world rocked waking up with a concussed headache to that shrill screaming having had a concussion i can say that would suck lol and respect to mr ham hands he didn t continue to hot them once they were out
lmao the screaming so unnecessary
damn was that brock lesnar
the first guy made a bad choice the second guy made a terrible choice you see someone down somebody that hard just give them room and attend to your friend
i d wake up just to smack that girl
that trip by his buddy was a clutch play
drunk white college age girls are the worst
weird how kids think brain damage is fun
this is what happens when you have never been in a fight but wanna act like you can fight
the best thing you can do to an unconscious head trauma victim is scream at them and shake them violently
respect for not stomping or robbing them once knocked out unlike some people
when you get on the quick toke events
is that steve will do it
they re no fun took a nap in the middle of a tussle
that lil leg trip bro with an assist
no video would be complete without a random screaming woman
this is why i don t ever provoke and always deescalate a potential fight have you ever seen people scoring a on these boxing arcade games just imagine it was your head instead you re fucked up brain trauma at least maybe dead even before hitting the floor it s insane how strong some people can hit and the human skull brain is a weak saggy sponge from that pov even if he is weak af on the boxing arcade machine he might just pull a knife it s not worth it walk away run if it s necessary better a hurt ego than severe brain damage
if you stay ready you ain t gotta get ready the first dude that got knocked out looked like he was not expecting the other dude to punch him
surprised the just run right at em strategy didn t work
screaming in his face will surely help
best thing for a concussion is to slap the person repeatedly and shriek at them
oh he s unconscious let me scream three centimetres from his face at the top of my lungs that ll help
the tactical trip was nice the second knock out you hear his head smack the pavement ouch concussion at best and brain damage isn t off the table
legend has it she s still trying to wake him up
god i hate the screeching but second guy s head landed on the pavement no good
look at those future doctors and lawyers animals no self control they run off pure emotion
those blood curling screams tells me she s never had a drunk boyfriend knocked out at a kegger before and it shows
second guy had flies on his dead body in seconds lmfao
the guy who got knocked out first is lucky he s not conscious to hear that girl screaming
did anyone notice the trip assist
screaming lady check
what a bunch of shitheads those involved and those on looking
handing out dirt naps
aaaaahhhhh brandon waaakkkkeee upppp aaaaahhhhh
brandon wake up brandon wake up looool homie needed a nap
old af

get the fucking banshee out of there jesus christ turn your volume down if you don t want your ear holes to bleed
why do women think the proper thing to do in these situations is to start screaming it only makes shit more chaotic and gets people more riled up
that 1st guy was completely knocked out by the girls screeching she thought her voice is medicine
why is it always women who start the fights then freak out when their boyfriend s get rocked for rhe fight they started
why the fuk she s screaming
glass jaws become sugar glass jaws when alcohol is added
he had a swing ko ratio
did brandon wake up yet
amazing you can have all that swelling with no cuts or wounds

ah gotcha
what exactly happened
nobody hates surfers more than surfers
holy shit hitting people over a fucking wave this guy sucks
i spent way too long looking for a shark fin
motherfucker thinks he s in point break
i love surfing but the sport attracts some of the biggest asshats i ve ever met
surfers are such a bunch of bitches
hope the little man gets identified and faces justice
i ve grown up on the beach for most of my life and i always remembered as a kid thinking surfers are the coolest people and as a grew up i grew realize that a lot of the the surfers i ever met were some of the biggest fucking assholes i ve ever met rude disrespectful shitty immature dickheads i still go out but i usually go with my brother and we mind our own business and protect each other i m not surprised when i see videos like this still disgusting
shame on the dudes nearby for not giving that motherfucker a knuckle sandwich
surfers who get violently possessive of areas of shoreline they like best will never not be the silliest way to be a human
surfers surfing is life it brings you closer to mother nature and makes you feel free also surfers that was my fucking wave i ll kill you
best lineup fight i seen was at queens in waiks all day this something brazilian is snaking all the waves from us toe hangers on his shorty i m heading back out and this huge kanaka comes paddling in with his babie i m talking like month old not walking yet baby on da nose of his longboard so you foreshadowers know where this is going best dad drops in and for sure brazilian kid cuts him right off with no contact but still best dad paddles right over to the kid and starts beef starts throwing swings with his baby now on the nose the lineup starts gasping baby baby best dad grabs his baby and with his free arm punches a couple holes in the kids board the two paddle back in i think fight some more and then the cops come i just stayed out so i dunno what happened
two butthole surfers these guys are
me waiting for the shark to appear like
goons trying to drop in
fuck brazilian surfers those insta crowds would happen at my place in el salvador and the locals would see it and then they would all paddle out to block
theres always one you ll find them at the beach at a skate park even on the road they think they have some kind of reign over their domain but really they re just dickheads ruining a good thing for others
usually after a wave i believe there is another one stupid squabble
easy warchild lol
always have a weapon in your vehicle when surfing surfers are assholes
fake locals ruin everything she had priority on that wave
she was a better surfer and human being
they don t call them butthole surfers for nothing
where s kai when you need him
back off warchild i m serious
i ll be honest i thought you were talking about a shark attack
i saw this video from nora vasconcellos professional skateboarder is that her in the video or was she just posting it for visibility
i would ve launched my surfboard tip straight into his eyeball what a douche bag drops in on her and then has a temper tantrum and sucker punches he is pos
why aren t the other guys fuckin him up pussies
sometimes i wish i could teleport into the past for minutes to beat this piece of trash to the ground
locals only doesn t work very well if you are not local most surfers i have met are stuck up tools
hell yeah i m a sponger i ll f ckin sponge this whole entire ocean up with my big ol d ck
hope he gets taken under toe and realizes the only one who s owns the waves is the ocean herself cringe
he really didn t like that last comment from her well played
baseball bat the dickheads knees see the fool surf then
what a pussy
u stabbot
i thought this was gonna be a shark attack
goons trying to drop in
metal water bottles are fantastic blunt objects
i like the end tho
trash man
fuck surf bro culture
that guy sucks on frozen hotdogs
surfers being cunts color me surprised
not very cowabunga of him
i thought surfing was supposed to be a harmonious way of life isn t this like getting in a fight at a yoga studio
man i fucking hate localism in surfing utter bunch of cunts kooks lyfe
what an incel
surfers can be the most aggro idiots on some beaches i have no idea why they are so god damn angry from personal experience and run ins spanning decades
he ll find the wrong person someday and hopefully we get that video as well
as an internet surfer this makes me pissed

i m australian when u title surfer and attacked i think of this huge ass killing animal called the shark
locals only bali style
i ve travelled the world and bali is one of the few weeks places i ve repeatedly felt unsafe in addition to that it s the only place i ve been extorted police stopped me with a valid eu drivers license on a scooter they fined me due to not having an international license
bali has been ruined by tourists
back off warchild seriously bohdi
she did cut that kook off pretty good tho
this is indonesia that s a muznut country
seems unwise bordering on naive to travel to a foreign break and drop in and not expect some kind of reaction always take some precaution whether or not youre a chick surf culture everywhere has a whole lot of this violent territorial nonsense malibu ca growing up was like the freakin road warrior towards outsiders
locals only brah
i mean at least they are equal rights dipshits
so this is a fight over surf etiquette and seeing that these girls are dealing with the locals they locals have the right of way
i know the girls we re right but they are not in their country fuck the video rec be prepared to punch someone s face
deleted
respect the locals brah
nobody owns the wave just stay out of other surfers lines she didn t even knock him over so it s whatever i would ask them to watch their line nicely to avoid smashing our faces together
surfing is safe
i ve heard too many horror stories and will never go to these places
thought this was gonna be a shark attack video lol
this is my water i own it
aren t there like some hard as nails surfer ufc mma guys who go round visiting other beaches and surprising bullying locals that sounds like a very tiktok friendly hobby justice surfers
what a selfish twat yeah you don t own the waves bro smh
paul greengrass and ridley scott collaborated on the cinematography for this clip
what the f is wrong with people
surfers tend to be assholes in my experience especially in florida i ve had a similar experience
i thought surfer dudes where all pretty chill
damn he was sprinting towards her at the last second
what a couple of losers
totally thought it was a shark attack video but holy shit
take your money elsewhere
pos probably isn t even from there
surf nazis must die https://youtu.be/zcys7bfhh3y)
that stupid ball grab really pissed me off me and the boys meet up to beat the shit out of this asshole when
i was only looking for a shark
you needed that blonde aussie dude to swing in brush his hair behind his ears and lay the dude out for you
hope he gets mauled sweet sweet karma by a
this right here is why i carry a sharp knife on me at all times
seems like she needed a crowbar to pry him away from her
agro surfers are the worst such a blight on something so pure
what shit country are those guys from no local would behave like that probably italy or israel
natives are comparable to the inner city types
by a shark or a dude me out loud to myself
who rules the beach surf nazis rule the beach
bali bogan central
apparently the guy is a wannabe local in bali who moved there two years ago and likes to do stuff like this often he thinks he owns the surf break and starts shit with other surfers who steal his waves technically the girl surfer had priority for that wave as she was on the inside closer to the whitewash but he tried to drop in on her and she wasn t having any of it

it looks like he injured himself
it s actually insane how little that punch affected her she literally didn t even budge
imagine sucker punching a girl and you end up hurting yourself
jake paul s next opponent
the people egging them on are the worst
he ll never be able to live that down lol
https://preview.redd.it/6owytbt65dsa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ec088ea80d112dbf89900eb5bfc358b1a5790a8
never thought punching someone could still result in you being the laughing stock at the end
another graduate of the carlton school of fighting
used of his power and she didn t even move
when you critically hit with your ultimate ability but the enemy used reflect
is that norbit
and on that day a new villain was born
genji s deflect ability
adamantium skeleton
imagine being suck a b ch that you have to sneak on a girl and she just laughs at you
she must be a psychic type and a poison type because lil homies fighting was not very effective
he was then know to all on the block as soft mittens pussy boi
did he even touch her she s the thanos of that neighborhood
like mr satan punching cell
you see your enemy and wait for the opportunity as they turn distracted you rear back and summon all your strength determined to down the human in front of you roll for attack natural with a modifier you learn into the punch driving with all your muscle and will power the punch connects squarely with the head breaking your own fingers as the woman laughs and walks away completely unbothered by what she perceived as a medium sized mosquito landing in her hair she walks away as your party takes an immediate vote in the affirmative to remove you from their ranks
who the hell sucker pumches a girl infront of the homies bro did nothing to her you just look like a pussy infront of everyone for hitting a girl who aint looking
this video is funny the man s punch seems powerless and after the woman even pissed him off hahaha lol but he shouldn t punched the woman because she might be the one who gets punished
r futurecucks
hit him with that reverse uno card
there is more to this as he got shocked from his own actions
no follow through
kid hanging around with the wrong crowd he didn t want to do that you can clearly tell
she didn t even break her stride
crazy this didn t start a riot
hope he didn t take revenge afterwards
that s a young peaches right there
homie rolled a
who s hitting a girl that s walking away yeah he s going to grow up to be quite a gentleman
https://preview.redd.it/xl575avcbdsa1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89b6ba4649824815bb105a78d917c29efa6d114f
think he got hurt more from this than she did serves him right for punching a girl from behind weak move
looked like his eyes popped out at the beginning but that were his glasses
he s out of mana
she didn t even need to adjust her specs
when i was his age and i hit a girl and my dad found out would have gotten an beating
u should know better than to hit a girl
so ridiculously fake
especially with those noodle arms of yours
g check failed
when you fail your unarmed strike roll and get countered with a vicious mockery
diamond chin black girl damnn
even though the kid should get a slap in the mouth for that shit i think a slap wouldnt hurt any where near as much as his ego is and will be for the rest of his days haha
can someone add a metal clang sound effect when his punch lands
i m so confused by how the fatherless losers standing around just laugh off their buddy punching a girl whether it hurt her or not lmao what fucking goofs
hp
when you push all your stats into vitality vs someone who s maxing dex
damn that s luke cages daughter
lmao
carlton banks lookin ass
thorns iii netherite armor
bro waste him ultimate
well she does have padding
my parents taught me if someone hits you and you barely feel it it ain t worth the fight
he is a pussy shocking how many kids raised only by there moms hit girls
hahaha deflected
shielded on that falcon punch
skill issue
she hurt him way more than he hurt her
he will think about this everyday for the rest of his life
the i ain t shit face
weak in strength and character
emotional damage
w
she ate that and kept walking honestly props to her
i feel like that should have had the minecraft anvil sound
punch man
the way she looked back and laughed at him as she kept walking away is what really hurt him
my friend have you ever heard of the term pulling your punches it s like when you put a lot of strength behind a punch but you slow it down just before it lands so it looks like it has a lot of energy you know like in the movies but sometimes things can get messed up and the punch doesn t land like it s supposed to maybe you hit the wrong spot or you don t slow down in time and then even though you put a lot of strength into it the punch does little to no damage it s like you pulled your punch but it still didn t work i saw something like that happen the other day i think that guy was holding back because the other guy didn t even falter when he hit him he just walked away like nothing happened so it is familiar with this so i think maybe he felt something that slow him down like you can see the way he was shock after he punch her he cover his mouth in shock it was in the heat of the moment that guy has to slow it down in a fast second if he didn t m the punch might hit the fluffy jacket she was wearing so it weakend the punch either that or that punch was weaker than my will to live but all of that aside that guy needs to have some self control
that was a vegan punch
mfer had a thorns chestplate
prefect outcome for a sucker punch
i once fought some other kid in elementary school i punched the side of his skull he was hurt for a little bit i broke my hand skulls are hard
ego definitely crushed
i remember that happened to some kid at school lol
emotionally and physically the perfect combination
her laughing it off with a taunt hurt him more than his punch hurt her lmaooo
right i thought he missed and punched a wall for a second
the boy looks like he s no more than pounds so his punchers probably didn t have much power behind them especially if he s hitting a girl that is probably pounds
a kid did this to me in like fifth grade he karate chopped me but i think he lined up his hand bones exactly wrong on the bony part of my shoulder i barely felt it but he screamed and ran away crying i took the victory because it made me look tough but i honestly don t know how he managed to fuck it up so bad
which he loses by decision
i hope he just learns that violence doesn t solve everything and doesn t use this as a villain origin story
they were necessary in destroying his ego hypemen with no team
aye bruh your remember that one time you socked that chick in the head and she just walked off i can hear it now
it almost always does tbh unless the person getting punched was being a cunt
a weak enough punch can completely remove all jeopardy from a tense situation i was once mugged on a train i was sitting with my laptop minding my own business and suddenly some youngfella was yelling at me demanding my stuff i was really genuinely scared close to panic until he punched me in the face it was such a weak punch that all fear left my body and i instantly knew i was in no danger at all i laughed at him until he walked away and because we were on a fucking train and it was an hour until the next stop he had nowhere to go and was arrested it sounds like one of those look how brave i am stories i promise i m absolutely chickenshit but he d just shown he had nothing to threaten me with the weakness of the punch caused such a rush of relief through my body it would have been an effort not to laugh i kind of see that in her posture as well she might have been afraid of him before the punch but as soon as she felt it she must have also had the same realization i had he has nothing to threaten her with
lmao
damn i miss when he was a hero who punched women from the back
he was already there
he probably went home and built a power glove for punching
r subsifellfor
this isn t an election
or he should know how to better hit a girl lmao
first time i ve seen a punch do zero damage
against a girl too pathetic
the child was so curious about what was happening that s why he s trying to remove his fathers hand covering his ears lol
at the game but dressed for the club
classy
what is she wearing
the kid was like yoo i aint missing this
i in no way think women she be told how to dress or have their bodies controlled by anyone but themselves but that is a ridiculous outfit to wear to a fucking basketball game
dad trying to cover the kid s eyes even mom helps out kids pulls her hand away
but who s she there with
why is this being reposted yet again
where d the rest of her jacket get off too
wtf is that outfit probably need a top hat and a cane
ear muffs
not much whatsup with you
brought to you by carl s jr
why would you think it s ok to wear that to a basketball game
she was so shocked her snirt fell off
the kid swapping the moms hand away from his view is all of us here
earmuffs
let the kid see that s real life and say that s who you will become if you make the wrong decisions lol
earmuff dad making this whole thing delightful
me just trying to find out what the fuck is up
she has nice cakes
relationship as real as her body
the fuck is that outfit probably wanted a girl with a little class
trashy as fk
no one is going to be in a serious relationship with someone that dresses like that in public he probably cheated on someone else with her and that s how they met
trash is going to trash
she s dressed
apparently they let people in that are half naked

let s act like children over this matter and in public x200b about as classy as a drunk dancer in a titty bar which she probably is
kid was tryna see sum
i think impeding his sight and vision is probably worse than the thing they are trying to protect him from as that gay dude in the simpsons said that one time you can t protect her forever you stupid lady
life long bucks fan in the making
what the fuck that gross woman trying to find a date at the basketball game
probably doesn t want to be with someone that goes out in public dressed like a common street whore
jesus white man just take the kid out of there
scared of some cleavage and the equivalent of a bathing suit let your son experience that shit man this is life
she forgot her pants at home
it s nice to see mayor lightfoot already found a new job
that s roughly one what s up every two seconds can someone please tell her so she can quit asking
i don t get targeting the girl the guy fucked up
damn that gilr thick in all the nice ways
r upvotedbecauseofboobs
well the parents are trying but the boy wants to watch the show
nobody saying anything about kid from kid n play moonlighting as that security guard
is this the amway center
gif giphy mcgssopdq4rhs
if you turn the volume all the way up you can hear the kid audibly say move bitch i m trying to see to his mother
the music
mah milkshake brings alltheboystothaaayahd
how are those considered clothes
is former mayor lori lightfoot doing security now
that s called getting busted son
damn bro you should be a detective or something
the highlight of this clip fr
yah tryin to watch the show
dressed to pick up some players
or the streets
can we get a no no pants rule please
it s not even club get up anymore my job hosted a huge financial conference turned out to be some crypto bros trying to sell a pump n dump scheme and i m not joking when i say people showed up and all of the women were dressed like her a lot of douche bags in suits using daddy s money trying to impress some sugar baby wannabes while pretending to think in 4d when it comes to money i was like we ain t even gonna pretend like this is a real conference huh fr though if i ever hear the phrase you should totally invest in this crypto i m talking generational wealth brooooo ever again i think i ll spontaneously combust
i think that s what the person she s talking to asked so must be an outfit designed by what s up llc
nba groupie starter pack
i literally came here to say the same thing lol
gladiator armor or a generic mmorpg high level women gear
she really should not be allowed in a place that is considered family friendly dressed like that it is indecent to say the least
stop focusing on the half naked lady in front of you focus on those cheerleaders over there
i think the dad was covering his eyes and the kid was tolerating that but when mom covered his eyes he wasn t having any of it
exactly
fake internet points
bwahahaha nice then maybe some glittery tap shoes to round it out
she s got electrolytes out the ass
extra big ass thighs
didn t think maybe
speak for your self ain t no one trying to see an obese woman half naked
time and place my man time and place
obvious troll lol
meh
fiserv forum
she gonna need to drop lbs before they even look at her
same those pants could never catch a fart
if you think that s half naked i assume you ve never been outside of your convent
i don t know about that
wtf she s thic as hell she looks great imo
bruh she s wearing the equivalent of a two piece bathing suit with see through tights it s a basketball game so whatever but let s not pretend there s much to imagination here
no it s just that most people don t watch so much porn that they lose perspective on what naked is you really should try to cut back you re losing it guy
i out quotes around it meant to be from the parents perspective i should have elaborated i ve seen tons of butts and boobs and dicks and stuff
yeah like of those pounds are just boob mass
lmao ok prude
naked is not wearing clothes anything beyond that is varying degrees of clothed nice projection on being porn sick though glad i have a healthy relationship with my sexuality and needs
i don t think you know what that word means since it doesn t bother anyone i ve seen strippers with the exact outfit minus the arm and shoulders only jacket
so you ve seen strippers with fewer clothes on which would make them half naked
nope because fewer clothes is naked i see why you got confused with the whole naked woman thing
aren t the cheer leaders also half naked
i think it s time for you to take remedial 4th grade math and learn what fractions are there sport
what fraction is fewer like at least say algebra

i want to know the bizarre ritual this is for
uhmmmm i honestly thought the turn out to this would be different i was completely caught off guard
if you slap my ass def know you will be getting slapped back consent is needed for any touching
hit her so hard the lady in white got a headbutt from the original assailant
the consent thing is legit however how dare you objectify me now where was i
she carried that slap downward like how charlie murphy slapped rick james
interesting the butt smacker was looking away as if trying to appear like she didn t do anything lol
love the work dedication in this
and then she continues with her job that s professionalism
how dare you spank me i have class lol
yes booty slapping woman is wrong but the response is not commensurate
deleted
lol i hope i see a video of her getting knocked out someday
the bouncer wasn t there to protect the bartender this time
i respect the gender neutrality of it all
i love how offended the woman is she thought homegirl would be excited
bar mitzvah
it s a bar in new orleans on bourbon street they pour a shot of fireball in your mouth and spin you around in a barbers chair it was on bar rescue actually
that s kind of the thing though isn t it she s actively giving that dude the show and even if it is another girl just shrugging off uninvited touching in her line of work isn t smart
all i heard was don t fucking touch me
what did the five fingers say to the face
boundaries
f off you don t touch another person without consent period this is a huge trigger of mine i do not like my ass slapped my partners old aunt likes to slap my ass and i d like to belt her in the chops when she does it it isn t fun or cute to touch anyone w o consent please remember that
it s not hypocritical if you understand what consent is
do you not understand consent
rubbing her chest in his face was her decision getting her ass slapped wasn t you don t really get the concept of consent do you you must be fun when a woman says no to you
no it isn t
unless you re paying for yourself then it s a bought mitzvah
ha
have you never been to a strip club wtf idiots advocating for that behavior the woman straight up assaulted her she thought it was coo because i m hot tehe guys love it fucking yuck
it was totally necessary she had to reset the tone otherwise every other asshole would think it was ok to do the same
it is kinda the thing i m not saying that it s okay i m just saying that it s kind of ironic one definitely does not get to lay hands on someone else just because one is dressed to be ogled look don t touch we gotta have rules
why you hit me charlie murphy because you hit me man muthafucka that was weeks ago
lol omg i got voted down
they never do they think that because someone else has consent they are allowed to partake as well it s so wild at this point it s some incel shit to not understand boundaries and consent
also ha well played
what you re saying is extremely close to she s asking for it
why are you guys downvoting he s not even arguing
yes it is still not excusing it just pointing out that it s gonna happen not gonna do it myself also not gonna pay for that kind of silliness i ll have my shot in peace with my friends thanks
deleted
i am a little bit but i come here to work the ol brain it s good excercise it s fine thanks for the props

it really was such an odd thing to watch on tv today the gop are just grasping for straws it s crazy to see it happen in real time
the whole vibe of america doesn t feel right
just imagine all the osrs xp they are losing seriously
can we please get away from the here are some words clap clap clap clap clap thousands of protests but only protest chants the other is word word ho ho something i don t like has got to go there is a severe need for new more innovative protest chants i feel like this might be a job for doja cat i think she would be good at that
really though they show up to do that may as well bring a chair and sit it has the same effect
empires only last so long
wait until you read this https://www.axios.com/2023/03/28/america-core-values-economy-poll).
my other favorite chant https://twitter.com/stained_moon/status/1463579893288120331?s=20
years on average iirc
i m mildly unsure lol
i m not familiar with that one but i applaud it s freshness almost has a freestyle rap vibe to it that s what a good protest needs a complex bars full blown pull all the stops hardcore rap diss impromptu celebrity performances in the middle just being intense and shit
three years to gooooo
whatever he stole probably not worth taking a dirt nap
deputy survived suspect did not https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfpy5vtlie)
officer was shot in the leg hand and neck was released from hospital a few days later dead suspect was trying to break into cars
k9 taco is probably responsible for saving the lives of both deputies and deserves a medal imo
i was sad for a second cuz i thought the dog got shot
that dog is having the time of his fucking life not a care in the world
i hope the dog is alright
taco ate his ass up
one of the few times i ve thought why doesn t a cop have their gun drawn he s yelling for someone to get their hands up while running toward them for about seconds while still handling the dog before being shot
it s easy to get behind cops when stuff like is shown on a regular basis it s a much more complicated job than what is shown to us on tv once this cop is healed he will probably get back on the street and with a much different approach after an experience like this i couldn t blame him
a cop could blow up a man with a grenade and still yell at the giblets to put his hands up
k9 said oh new chew toy for me
thank fucking baby jesus that dog was ok i was ready to cry
who has two thumbs and doesn t give a fuck anymore this guy
all of you i hope the dog is alright commenters are weirdos two men were shot and the dog is alright i can watch the video now y all need a reality check

do you say it like pinayas county or pin l as
i had to come to the comments to really make sure it was the deputy and not the k9
surprised the cop didn t have his gun out guess you can t do it when you are handling a dog
so that k9 dog had as much training as his handler but in dog years
is the dog okay

the sheriff credits k9 taco for exactly this
k9 taco was not injured
i was sad for a second cuz i thought the dog got shot dog was tearing into that pos good
bruh me and you was on the same page i had to read the title again
biggest most meaty chew toy ever best day
it looked like he missed the dog to me
if that was true you wouldn t bother commenting get a grip i d be salty too if i went from being a software developer to a truck driver
your blatant hatred is pathetic i know you won t believe me but some day you might think differently when that happens i hope you think back to this moment use the memory to be proud of the fact that you have rid yourself of this pure and unhelpful negativity
i suppose the difference is that human police officers are making an active choice to work in a career that puts them in danger where the dog has absolutely no concept of the danger he s in nor does the dog have much choice
criticizing any cop yes of course you can and should criticize cops when they fuck up in this case they didn t of course
probably because their iq is higher than room temperature and are therefore not qualified to do this job
hope you suffer a similar fate doing your job
pin l ess
great
the dog was not injured
shady cops yeah cops doing their jobs stopping crimes and protecting innocent people who get shot for no other reason than a guilty pos not wanting to go to jail no go fuck yourself
you are the problem
acab until me or my family are victimized
don t worry fam boot lockers gonna lick don t stop being honest the reality will get them one day
i hope the cops press charges just a joke shit good luck out there teach
do you teach that in the classroom
yea that bastard ass dog cop deserves to die wtf is wrong with you dude
every time you people say acab it reminds me of people in church saying amen or and also with you very cultish
he is still injured but stable enough to be at home they probably gave him a to of antibiotics topical and oral to prevent infections and his wounds likely missed vital areas on his body leaving the hospital doesn t mean being in health if hospitals kept people until they were healed the wait time for healthcare would be insurmountable

ah good i can watch the video now
he was like no one has told me to stop yet here i go
thank god i hate how they use animals as tools no dog deserves to be made into a tool for destruction and killed for what people trained it to do well maybe the rabid dogs but not this dog lmao
i appreciate your feedback
you sound like a giant asshole keyboard warrior you think you re somehow better than this person because they re a truck driver you get a grip maybe one quick look at your comment history tells me everything i need to know
what s wrong with being a truck driver
i didn t just wake up feeling this way it was a slow painful process yeah i might feel differently one day but it won t be due to any sort of introspective epiphany or newfound belief that leos are actually justified in flat out murdering people you re right though at this point it is blatant hatred i suppose that might change when officers and their policing tactics do george floyd https://youtu.be/lirhz93qj50) daniel shaver https://youtu.be/oflgwywcft8) the complete travesty that was uvalde trayvon martin and the acquittal of george zimmerman fuck you
yes this is true although i still find it strange that there s an indifference to human suffering when a fluffy dog is around
my job doesn t affiliate with burglars
grand
good boy
don t bother these acab people have no interest in fixing a thing they are just as much a part of the problem as the shitty cops
not questioning you just legitimately asking in this specific situation was the cop serving some warrant or in any way legally accessing his property seems like the cop was trespassing but i have no idea
what part of all cops did you not understand
you re welcome
redditors love to prove they have the intellectual depth of a puddle
if you think i can t think both of those things at the same time you might be fucking stupid
i also scrolled down looking for this same confirmation thank you
i m a vegetarian because by age i d sob and gag trying to eat meat but even i can confidently say dogs enjoy being tools they want to help you give a dog a job and that thing is excited to work no matter how dangerous
humans made dogs for tools
the important thing is you came into a thread about a suspect two cops and a police dog and instead made it all about you
it s not an indifference it s about understanding the situation a dog doesn t have a full grasp on what it s doing and is going along with the owner but humans know exactly what sort of danger they re putting themselves into
i don t give a fuck lol
no yelling on the bus
wonderful
they are just as much a part of the problem as the shitty cops they are absolutely not as much a part of the problem as shitty cops lol jesus christ what a stupid take
there s not enough info to determine that but i would imagine it was an answer to a call about a burglar otherwise there would be no reason for them to be there
if you re legitimately asking what little i know of us law says cops don t always need a warrant like if a life is in danger or if they are chasing a suspect
dolphins suck almost as much weener as your mom
one thing i will never understand is how some people can live their lives holding such hatred for a person they ve never met and or know nothing about

i will note to expel black men from the legislature is incredibly shameful yet not surprising for a state where the kkk was founded
yeah no racism here folks just keep walking by black dudes expelled and the white lady won t be nothing here to see y all
unfortunately justin jones was expelled from the house by a vote of 25z but he can run again in the special election for his own seat the fate of justin pearson has yet to be decided
oh look the traitor party doing traitor stuff i bet there s no accountability either x200b shame shame
gloria johnson said when asked why she was the only one who survived being expelled it probably has something to do with their skin color
this is insane
fuck fascism and never fuck a republican again
why is this not being protested if this was done to republicans say for being apart of an insurrection there d be mass protests dems need to step the fuck up
update justin pearson has now been expelled also meaning gloria johnson is the only one out of the three to survive
what kind of a fucked up system is this
the silence from the democrats nationally on this is just pathetic if they get away from this politically unscathed it will absolutely spread
i don t disagree that there is racism rampant in the general aassembly but as the video that the house members were forced to view again demonstrated representative johnson did not speak from the megaphone and did not raise her voice her behavior was clearly different than the other two gentlemen in that moment of rallying the gallery that seems to be a point of of distinction that earned her a few republican support votes or maybe they just felt bad that cameron sexton put her office in a closet for multiple years and then gerrymandered her out of her district and so she moved and she still beat a republican the unsinkable gloria johnson the super majority should have tailored her expulsion papers to her situation and not lumped them all three together with the same exact language but that s what happens when you have a super majority it becomes a lazy governing body full of groupthink
yoo shit is about to go down
i would be embarrassed to be in the embarrassing republican party in a state that is an embarrassment refugees of tennessee there is democracy reason and education in other parts of the usa racist christian nationalism looks a lot like germany in the s
anyone want to eli5 is this for a certain reason or just bs politics i can t spend the braincells to read through all the horseshit if i look it up nor do i have the time
tennessee is showing the entire world just how stupid the below average americans can go and it s boggling
we should be naming and shaming the legislators who voted for the black men to be expelled but not the white woman
you have to wonder if these goprs planned this knowing full well they wouldn t let the white lady be expelled taking a vote to make it look like they did this to all of them but secretly knowing that they just wanted to expel the legislators of color
don t break the rules and you won t be ousted seems fairly simple
good on her for being direct about it
fascism racism communism marxism fuck them all
it is being protested there s thousands of protesters at the state capitol as we speak
so brave
gif giphy bbkkebjkmfbtg
the only good thing about this is that they can run for their own seat in the special election
you know whats even more pathetic the rebublicans making it all happen
take your rational takes and evidence based opinions and leave this sub doesn t tolerate that they only want outrage
they protested in the house chambers with students about gun violence in tn in response to the recent shooting the members in question did in fact violate house decorum rules for members however they had no prior offenses and you d think they might have just gotten some form of softer penalties or warnings however the house gop compared it to j6 despite these protestors not busting through windows and doors in their path to get into the building not assaulting police and not chanting to kill any of the elected officials they were loud and disruptive but that was about the extent of it if i ve gotten any of these facts wrong someone more informed please feel free to correct me
really just could not be any more transparent
who determines the criteria by which you can oust a duly elected representative gotta tread carefully about negating the will of the people
fascist
yup should have seen the sign that said whites only
lol at you getting downvoted for saying all of these things are bad
communism and marxism are cool the rest can die off fuck neoliberalism neoconservatism too
good
i hope they burn it down with everyone inside except gloria
thank you for the information i get that they wouldn t want protests of any kind in their now but what you described and j6 are drastically different seems like they just saw a loophole they wanted to exploit for political reasons whats new
how dare they support their constituents protesting dead children in schools
how so
really dude do you really need an explanation on the differences between the first two and the last
cause it shows what reddit really is i don t take them seriously
how dare they storm into the capitol building with megaphones disrupting a democratic process then crying about it when they find out breaking rules has consequences
i mean it s really weird you d call an equal stateless society a bad thing even if the concept of marxism is untenable with humanity s values i don t think utopiaist idealism falls anywhere near the nature of racism
it s not about what the concept it s about what s been done under it communism is responsible for many more deaths than hitler but here we are
weird you d bring up communism but not also include capitalism ask somalia and zimbabwe how that economic system panned out for them honestly any economic policy that allows children to go hungry is a failure in my eyes i m not discussing communism or it s implementation more so marxism i thought i was pretty clear on the distinction marxism in brief is the concept that when all material needs have been met the necessity of hierarchy and borders evaporates because humans are truly free at that point what is the purpose of war class hierarchies and borders in a world where everyone has their needs met and i mean your example is so scattered it s difficult to not see the inherent bias in it obviously no one is free from bias but framing communism and marxism as equal to the conceptual nature of racism is pretty dishonest framing
communism you mean stalinism traditional communist thought holds that the state will gradually wither away as the implementation of socialism reduces class distinction however stalin argued that the proletarian state as opposed to the bourgeois state must become stronger before it can wither away also the irony is stalin killed more communists than all the world s fascist dictators combined https://academic.oup.com/yale-scholarship-online/book/17686/chapter-abstract/175375697?redirectedfrom=fulltext
they also never bring up christianity when they talk about the terrible things done under it s rule of law ever notice that
damn the french know how to protest
i bet this had the quickest police response time even during the middle of the beginning of a potential societal upheaval
they will be ok they have probably already got the contract to rebuild paris when this all calms down
what is black rock
i picked the wrong day for my job interview
that s it that s how you fucking do it not setting fire and robbing local shops and homes this is where it hurts the cunts the most the elites pockets good on them
yeah don t mess with peoples money especially people you ve overworked for more than years leave it to slimeball politicians to tinker around with laws that don t affect them
based on what i watch these french knows how to protest but things get worse because people don t have unity
french are the protesting goats the rest of the world is not close
love to see it
now we are talking
so when are we gonna start
love the energy of these french protests americans should be taking notes
what s the logic here ruin the country move to a different country retire at instead
trs fire
it s something about a air horn noise just makes it more comical
gee i sure hope those road flares don t accidentally burn that place to the fucking ground viva la france i wish the rest of us did it like the french remember the saying heads are gonna roll it means exactly what it sounds like
french people strike burn cars buildings is called protest americans do the same is called terrorism lol this sub is funny a lot of left people here
trump republicans watching this like gif giphy udwkgxtfradvo
it s comical hearing corpo boot licking americans joke about france because they had a rough time in ww2
on est l on est l
they re not invading they re performing an eviction
what these protestors doing are going too far fortunately the police remained calm and did not shoot them

wow people finally finding out who s the real scum in the world
all else aside that s a sweet office
red flares make everything cooler football dinosaurs batman overthrowing the french government
blackrock to the ground
extremely righteous and bodacius
god that must feel good
fuck blackrock
i think we should put this into our national heritage
they only forgot to roll in some rubber tires
how low is the bar in the western world for protest walking into a building that the capitalist isn t even in puts america to shame american s are in the street far far away from the source of their problems we are as a people politically illiterate by design we shun the voices on the real left the socialists in favor of the pro capitalist messaging we have always been given you see these protesters break into a building you know it won t go anywhere because they are protesters not revolutionaries the next time capitalism kicks you just consider if the lies capitalism sold you on socialism are true things will not get better unless we the working class start doing our due diligence instead of taking capitalist propaganda as fact you think breaking into a building is revolutionary education https://youtu.be/v6ndft22qpk) is what makes us a real force to be reckoned with not burning a car in some parking lot learning reach your friends reach your families learn the left needs you
and what will we the workers replace capitalism with more capitalism we have tried to reform capitalism our entire lives how is that going what we need is an educated working class we need to confront our biases https://youtu.be/v6ndft22qpk)
2nd largest holder of tesla stock apple stock and basically everything else they don t necessarily own everything but they definitely have a hand on everything
a trillion dollar bank investment firm they own sizable portions of apple microsoft wells fargo jpmorgan chase and the us government
the cunts that are in charge of my private pension that i never asked for or wanted
it s the biggest bank that owns almost everything in the world
lol the french do all of those things that s how you do it
how dare that company offer etfs for people to invest in with their own money woo hoo
it ll affect them and everyone when the pension fund runs dry
yeah don t mess with peoples money funny because this is the reason protests often don t work in america the wealthy in that country uses their resources to put it to an end
soon
post on reddit for that sweet sweet karma
both are riots not protest neither are terrorism unless violence is being used now that wasn t hard was it
now if only they understood context and the difference between the paris protests and their nonsense
na most americans poke fun of the french but ultimately know they have been our biggest and oldest ally the us wouldn t be without the french
nah fuck blackrock i just don t understand what they re hoping to achieve the pension funds will run dry if there isn t change
the cities are already burnt down for the regular folk these people are fighting for the survival of our grandchildren
i d rather live my entire life in a burnt out building in paris than ever set foot in a shithole like florida
finally something the british and the fr nch agree on
bruh i m british we just say oh bliven s thee the torys making us need permits to protest whelp better put on another cuppa
being educated and doing nothing is worth less than actually doing something if everybody is afraid to do anything then it doesn t matter how many people are on your side and sometimes actions can inspire more actions
i can t tell if you re real or not but i appreciated this all the same
don t forget they also are and have been one of the primary purchasers gobbling up housing in the states
a modern day east indies company
most of this isn t really true they re not a bank for one and they don t themselves own much at all they manage assets on behalf of their clients including the funds of random people
oh ok thanks fuck them then
you think people are mad about etfs
tax the fucking rich then so it won t problem solved rich gotta take a haircut or a head cut up to them
lol like ours will
appropriate taxation would solve the issue but corporations have bought french politicians and got a bunch of tax cuts passed for themselves

squints and nods slowly slides theory https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/) across table at you
we are powerless against capitalism if we aimlessly fumble in the dark burning tires revolutions happen when there is a vanguard of worker s on the same page wearing masks in the street does not actually challenge capitalist hegemony once we are organized we act we need numbers to organize to have numbers we need to educate our fellow workers we can t be lazy reform or revolution https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/)
i believe that is blackstone
don t forget they also are and have been one of the primary purchasers gobbling up housing in the states care to cite this from a reputable source
considering everyone in this thread either thinks they re blackstone or talks about how they own so much of so many major corporations the answer is either what s an etf or yes almost all of blackrock s aum is passive and held on behalf of individual investors and they earn a few basis points on when i buy a blackrock etf that holds apple they re the name that shows up on the ownership but it s not their money
tax the fucking rich then so it won t problem solved rich gotta take a haircut or a head cut up to them they tried that and it failed https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/26/698057356/if-a-wealth-tax-is-such-a-good-idea-why-did-europe-kill-theirs) for obvious reasons i think a global minimum corporate tax could help otherwise corps just leave with accounting hijinks as well norway and denmark both have very healthy social safety nets by having broad tax programs and the pension drawing age at too frequently online i see tax the rich thrown out as a sort of mindless way to be lazy and not think about the problem
ugh thanks for the reminder

how could raising the retirement age possibly affect future generations this guy
you re a dumbass

yep very similar names and very similar business propositions of making fortunes on the backs of the poor and middle class but an important distinction nonetheless
you are correct fack all those dark colored rocks though

sorry i was corrected i was thinking blackstone
norway has a sovereign wealth fund denmark is denmark im open to solutions for taxing the rich from wealth taxes capital gains taxes corporate taxes pick one but if the option is that nothing can work then it s time for guillotines
so what are they protesting

neither are the primary purchases of real estate in the us also i really don t get the point that s how a mortgage works bank owns the house until it s paid off and the bank makes money on the interest you re free to pay in cash blackstones ownership of rental properties is extremely small they are mostly in real estate
the answer to taxing the rich is that they are unreliable and to remove the loops holes their accountants exploit and have a broad tax base https://taxfoundation.org/scandinavian-countries-taxes-2021/)

lol sugar gay
this video smells like cocaine and cigarettes
totally not gay reaction
daaaaaaaaaamn i d let that dude hit me as many times as he wants cause i bet he s still got some of that every morning when i see my girlfriend s halo money and i d just go ahead and take all of it from him after
make a hole gentlemen
shoulda kissed him that ll own him
he should have doubled down choke your fucking face lol what
would love if a bigger guy calls him sugar gay right after all the insults and see the reaction of him trying to talk shit to someone who s not half his size
sugar ray ironically cool yet gestures to empty search results sorry bummer big booty puerto rican goddess edit link for the people confused https://youtu.be/cxqca4rqd_m)
let s just put into context here that this was likely late 90s where being called gay was still a heavy insult this was years ago folks times have changed and i m fairly certain mark mcgrath has as well if someone called me gay in high school with serious intent those may be fighting words nowadays it s not different times
i hate to kill the vibe but he addresses this and actually makes it funnier owns up to it and takes full responsibility starts around the minute mark x200b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asiuh8lhh3m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asiuh8lhh3m)
lol i forgot all about sugar ray
masculine insecurity is a hell of a drug
oh be nice
you calling me gay i will fuck your ass bitch
i would have gone with booger ray
they almost kissed lol
sugar gay is pretty fucking funny i would have been rolling rolling rolling on the scene
post malone reaction https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gok-ozmk9u0)
is that nick mullen
i opened for these guys at a college spring fling type deal in he who i refer to as mr ray was a complete douchebag even in they were washed up dickbags screamed at student volunteer event staff for every mistake no one was even fawning over them or trying to get autographs back stage they were literally just trying to run the fucking event and facilitate their crew complete dicks
of all the names to get angry at he should have definitely seen sugar gay coming from miles away
sugar gay wasn t wrong
by the way this happened in the late 90s or early 2000s different time i actually saw an article that says he s okay with being called sugar gay found it https://thehardtimes.net/music/mark-mcgrath-finally-ok-with-being-called-sugar-gay-all-the-time/)
wish that kid had knocked him out
he s still around guess dude hit a critical nerve
i hope mcgrath has gotten over himself since then
that reaction was very gay
he seems like a nice gay
anytime you know someone is all talk the best thing to do is tell them to either do something then or you won t do shit if you re right you win automatically if you re wrong you might get your ass whooped but that s a risk that s worth taking every single verbal altercation i ve ever had on the street has ended because i called the other person s bluff its hard to look tough when someone tells you to actually show you re tough
way to expose that homophobia mark smfh who gaf truly smfh if he was secure with himself he d feel neither bad nor good hearing the wannabe insult being gay isn t some awful thing
gif giphy h9wlfnwx9gy1a downsized cocaine s a hell of a drug
lmao pussy couldn t back his words up when mark stepped to him lololol
he our latest cancel target
i never how much he meant to me
looks like someone left their halo hangin on the corner of their girlfriend s four post bed
is it illegal to make threats of violence like this in the us
that s the guy from scooby doo god i love that movie
never heard of him probably for my own good
hi i m mark mcgrath and yeah this what i m doing now
i ll beat your fuck
r suddenlygay
smell my fart youre nothing
alcohol is a hell of a drug
if you check his instagram he leans into sugargay now i think he saw he was an asshat
the celebrity big brother season he was on was a doozy for sure
touched a nerve i think
just get rid of mark and bring back sugar ray
i don t know this guy or if he s generally a touchy little puss puss but man what a not great video to have of yourself acting like a tool for all to see for ever and ever all men
is he the guy band that comes out in scooby doo
pc principal
cocaine and shitty rock
who
what a doosh
i can t tell what s more embarrassing this video or hosting entertainment tonight

anyone will be angry if someone you don t know teasing you gay those people should be threatened to stop they have no right to tell you bad words especially if it is not true
sugar gay
sugar who called me sugar gay also sugar i ll fuck you in the ass
title is truly about two guys with homophobia
can t believe this exact same thing happened again years later what a coincidence
even though the use of gay as an insult is obviously rooted in homophobia i miss seeing homophobes tripping over themselves at any insinuation of them being homosexual they try to act tough because in their mind being gay is weak despite saying the gayest shit ever while doing so like how insecure and stupid must one be to respond to a man calling you gay by threatening to fuck him in the ass wouldn t that make him right
sugar what bro
i ll choke your fucking face lead singer for sugar gay
is this trailer park boys
i wish he said it again wtf was he gonna do lol
dude who said it had a free ticket to a lawsuit sugar gay was ready to go
lt dan he smells like cocaine and cigarettes
what does cocaine smell like
all my respect has gone out the windooowwww
and spilled liquor
and a heavy dose of latent homosexuality not that there s anything wrong with that
gets offended at sugar gay within seconds he says he ll fuck him
tbf he says you fucking homophobic motherfucker so maybe it s more of an anti slur vibe he s going for
oh easily he was close too a little more antagonizing and mark was gonna do something stupid i d buy myself a nice lake house with that late s money he d have to pay me
matchbox money

or sucked his dick would show that the other guy is gay
you are correct man it was late 90s early 2000s when this happened
meh calling someone gay was tame back then it s f got that was fighting words and it still kinda is
he was amazing on big brother was one of the kindest in the bouse he gave lots of guitar and singing lessons in there
because your e gay
i think it s even more of an insult to call someone gay right now everybody is so politically correct you got to be really careful when trying to offend people nowadays
if someone called me gay in high school with serious intent those may be fighting words this is not how most people would have responded back then this is how someone like you would have responded back then not most people
dude what lol being called gay was never a huge cutting insult people were more homophobic back then yes but it wasn t that serious he s likely just snapping because they were kind of like nickelback where they got mocked a lot so he probably just didn t wanna take it
i knew it had to be late 90s there s no way that he would look exactly the same now also the video quality dates it
he looks like pink now l
how he made it seem like he did it because there were gay people with him who were scared come the fuck on
it s sugar gay sir
post malone really is a national treasure
no it was not a different time this was no more acceptable then than it is now
the kid was waiting to get knocked out free money
he did and he addresses it on a podcast interview thing i ll post the link in the comments if you want to watch it it made me respect him more in all honesty he takes full responsibility x200b ehh i ll post it here as well it starts around the minutes x200b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asiuh8lhh3m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asiuh8lhh3m)
it might be worth the ass kicking though because with all those cameras you d almost certainly get a significant payday from suing his arrogant ass
now yes you re right but any time prior to like maybe being called gay homo or uttering the words suck my dick made any straight man go ballistic literally being called gay was worse than any thing else for some dumb reason but i digress it was the early 00s so i was a kid for most of it you d had whole ass fight beefs because some sensitive dude got called gay i still think it s funny i feel the word homophobia didn t pop up in folks thoughts until safe spaces became a thing in the beginning of the 2010s
i know that

where is it by your wiener
i hope he survived and the shooter is caught
i kinda wish they had that same since of urgency with the rest of us
someone is shot and all people want to do is catch a second clip on their phone pathetic well how would anyone believe that you were there
i hope that officer makes a full recovery and the loser who shot him gets caught everyone talks shit about police until they need them in an emergency
i shot the sheriff but i didn t shoot no deputy
this comment section has shown me how fucked up this subreddit s members are i m out
huh there giving first aid i thought cops are supposed to hand cuff the guy and watch them bleed out
he should of just complied
the walking dead episode reference
no sympathy for fascists and those who support them
don t worry the nyc ag will dimiss the case as the suspect being socioeconomic disadvantaged
ey i m dyin heah
imagine if they helped innocent shooting victims with this sort of urgency maybe more people would feel inclined to help all officers
i work with someone who is very close friends with this officer apparently he went into hours of surgery and is now recovering hope the best for him
he was a rookie too he either quitting or gonna become the most racist cop ny has seen

michael rappaport got shot
wonder what he did
did he survive
whooooo could have thought this would happen in jamaica queens
just walk it off a lot of people just watching do they train officers what to do if partner shot
man they move heaven and earth to get one of their own to medical care like right now
gif giphy j5jissrekv3kd8iowb f the pigs
oh no anyway
it s really fucked up but i just don t feel bad for her
i m confused everyone had a gun but still a shooting occurred that s not how it s supposed to work also the bad guy got away when it was two trained officers against one delinquent they better train the teachers how to use their weapons better than these cops
oh no anyway
worlds smallest violin plays
l gif giphy fsqbx1hx7hpbbpim5b downsized pig down that s a win
now see if the police had guns then ugh this kinda thing wouldn t ugh happen
weird that there was no blood when they scooped him up i m not saying this is fake at all it s just that usually i m surprised there is so much blood when people are injured

regardless of what you think of the police it must suck to watch your buddy slow pass away i don t know if he died but still sucks
how many times was he shot and where where are the trauma shears to cut his pants off and check plenty of cops to secure the scene and check to see the full extent
one of the bones that connects his hip to his leg was shattered you mean the femur literally the greater trochanier and femur head are your hip all part of the femur
r worstaid
i love the smell of smoked bacon
altercation on a bus bus driver flagged two cops over one of the two in the altercation ran cops chased guy turned and shot one of the officers got away through a parking garage
unfortunately not i came across this on tiktok
probably justified
ahh yes the shooter is precisely the piece of shit one would expect
it all started over an argument over a bus seat hell of a thing to throw your life away over they got a photo of his face and everything
this sub is so rabidly anti cop it s insane lol i don t like cops and i think there needs to be a lot of reform in this country but this sub acts like literally every cop in the country is the child of satan and hitler
people are just letting off a little steam
some of the most violent rhetoric comes from this sub
actually important if arteries got hit
by your peepee by your lil dingdong
i had to replay it to make sure i heard right why weiner i wonder if it s a fear response to make very serious things childish to alleviate the trauma
he did one of the other officers applied a tourniquet
only on this piece of shit sub is this somehow a controversial comment
deleted
one you got a pic there s no escape
this is why most people will not really care about the guy regardless of what he s actually like too many bad cops and high visibility means we can now see exactly how they act when the situation is reversed and a citizen is on the ground with a gsw which is to say they don t care barely attend to the injured delay calling for aid and often actively create situations that leave innocent people in this position it s hard to care about this man as he s very likely been an active part in doing this to someone else x200b personally i think you guys need to wipe the slate and start again from square one in terms of your police they re just a large publicly funded gang with no desire or intention to keep you safe you can wipe the slate clean by legally removing their power defunding and isolating them or you can do what your forefathers intended and take back the country yourselves with all those guns you guys refuse to give up but also refuse to use learn from the french and jfk and start destroying shit they ve already made the peaceful option impossible for you and it s a dark and dangerous road you re on currently i fear you will look more like nazi germany within the next years if you can t force them to relinquish control and if that happens we re all fucked
nope even during and after because the majority of the time they do not help at all
i m sorry but this comment is extremely ignorant look at the numbers like all of them you really can t count on cops when it comes down to it they are pretty useless all things considered i know it s difficult to have your world view challenged and to think critically about certain things but it might be good for ya to start seeing things from different angles empirical evidence and data does not lie my friend
k bye
don t let the door hit you where the good lord split you
go woke go morally broke
true also i swear one of cops said where s it at by your wiener lol
word
near the start of the video one officer is rubbing the victim to console him looked totally strange and foreign to me i thought it was a regular person who had been shot that he was helping
hahah true lol don t know why you only have upvotes it s true the police are racists all cops are bad a dead pig is a good pig
why aren t they all yelling stop resisting
cops shoot thousands of people yes it hurts
the suspect said he s got a gun before shooting so all charges dropped
that s good to hear keyboard warriors love to hate on police but we need them whether people like it or not the guy was doing his job and got shot for no reason nobody deserves that
fuck you you piece of shit where the fuck are the mods on this subreddit for trash like this oh yeah they are part of the cancer that is sjw s
this is new york
seriously fuck that a cop lot of boot lickers is this sub today
how many is that exactly
f the criminals
i hate the cops but i hate criminals even more
what a dickhead you must be
he is a rookie beat cop
you re a terrible person
the world of warcraft on your profile is all i have to see
penetrative wounds usually don t bleed a ton in a case like this most of the bleeding would be internal
where do you live in mi i want to buy some of those toys you have
ai bots and or shills bro they ve got an anti cop agenda and they push it hard hiding behind the wokeness and brought to you by larry fink klaus schwab and friends
pathetic man
probably
my thoughts exactly looks like a little bitch piece of shit hope he gets caught and buttfucked in prison

didnt even let him smash his head when he went to sleep respect
i feel like that wake up slap at the end was to make sure he didn t kill him
damn that was some controlled anger he wanted to smash the guys head in and he could have but he showed restraint and gave him a lesson
who s the bitch now
that was a proper ass whipping
gif giphy 3okippurawc6guzsuo downsized
the chick with the baby really out here saying stawwpp
good don t stop cause next time he might not
brother beat down always respect the ladies always
free melatonin in the parking lot
classic sleeper

real sonny from the godfather vibes
that was a good rnc
that s what you get for bond burgering his sister
that dude made ever last one of those blows count and put him to sleep in seconds sheesh
good job
not saying that s the case here but a lot of women be lying and end up getting their brother dad cousin caught up in some mess
the most fucked up part is the sister lied and dude didn t even deserve to get his ass beat i seen this in about other reddit threads and i wish i had the link to the article about this
chad means engaging in violence smart high iq individuals don t use violence in situations like this
what idiot is beating a person like this who s trying to back off
uhhh did he have a seizure
i felt those shots holy smokes i know i would have woken up in the shadow realm
but uhhh like what s the brothers name asking for a friend
very satisfying and he controlled himself well considering bitch didnt say sorry
he got off light and i d bet he does it again
now shit on him
that choke was perfect
yep
ummm no
fuck that the guy gave up well before being choked out controlled is talking to someone before resorting to violence
controlled anger would be to call the police instead now both have a to go to prison
i ve seen an article that said he did beat the sister but i also can t provide it gosh darn it
i saw an article that said you just made this post up sorry but i can t remember where it is right now
you re a bitch
he deserved to learn a lesson
of course he is going to run he is a fucking coward that is why he beat a woman he deserves the same respect
yes defend the abuser
you re a bitch
it s not a seizure as such its just a pretty common reaction from going unconscious from that kind of hold you see it in ufc all the time with that type of hold you go unconscious very quickly because it is stopping blood circulation to the brain rather than choking you
he was making that same snoring sound knoxville made when butterbean ko d him heard that might mean concussion wouldn t surprise me after that head slam into the ground pretty brutal beating but if the context is correct that rage would be hard to quell
legend even caught the guys skull with his foot instead of letting it slam on the hard ground don t know if it was intentional but every good fight vid is ruined for me when when i see that and hear the dull thud a skull makes when hitting the floor unprotected its all fun and games boys being boys and all that until someone gets brain damage
you don t talk with someone when they started the violence if he hit his sister then he already brought the violence
you re a bitch hit my sister and i ll fuck you up there s nothing to talk about
that man sleeping on the concrete is not going to call the police and report this as a crime
shut the fuck up
i saw an article that he actually just saved a bunch of orphans and beatdown dude was pissed because he hates orphans
mad for what
i m just going on the video i didn t see anyone hit a person s sister
if they have evidence that he did what he did otherwise it s their word over his and a video on his side if he is a scumbag time in jail is the punishment to go to not a minute s worth of recorded beating which could even be beneficial for him especially if his morals are scuffed
mad

the sissy walk hissy fit while passing by that god awful truck is all you need to know
it s like the idiots who were burning their expensive ass nike s just ass backwards
yeahhhh throw it away that ll show them it s not like you already gave them your money
you already paid for it they don t care you might as well have drank it also it s a bit weird to have alcohol all around your property like that probably doesn t have the healthiest relationship with it
why do all dumbasses have that kind of truck
i m more offended that he threw cans full of liquids into the garbage
you could choose better beer just sayin lol
i m confused
of course that s his truck
as fragile as they come
for someone so triggered that he throws away cans of diluted piss he already paid for he sure does walk funny is he bow legged and light in the loafers as well
i wonder what he ll do once he finds out that rockstar is also pro lgbtq same goes for his truck most companies are pretty inclusive when it comes to the rights of marginalized peoples
that pickup truck says it all
i mean i agree bud light is trash but not for the reasons he s thinks
lol how many i have a tiny dick trucks can one guy have
it s time for ted nugent beer
all these clips teach me is that these yahoos have the worst fucking taste in beer
what are the odds these same people have complained about inflation while simultaneously throwing out perfectly drinkable beer
bud light piss water coors light piss
giant truck to bolster his tiny dick insecurities good odds he s closeted
these folks are low lives
bud light ceo they re buying our beer but not drinking it
i thought they hated fragile snowflakes who try to cancel everybody conservatives are pros at trying to cancel things they don t agree with
how does anyone have the energy to be that angry at beer
this dumb fuck just dump out the beer he bought
triggered emotional pos american nazi mad he can t put gay americans in a concentration camp simply slaughter them why should his precious self have to live near gays jews blacks dammit dumps already paid for beer in frustration immigrants are ruining his life he knows they are but can not state how can t grasp why he s never satisfied his life is so stressful
it s crazy because most of the big corporations stands at least publicly for equal rights and with the lgbtq community there s a lot of rednecks that are going to throw away a lot of stuff they already bought lol
of course he s got a big dumb truck
hopefully this will be a chance for him to sober up and if he gets sober he might start displaying kindness and concern for others which would mean he joins the woke generation alcoholism is a disease of loneliness and isolation
not public not a freak out just a snowflake
that s where it bud light belonged anyways terrible beer
you might wanna google it i googled guy throwing out perfectly good beer and it came back with guys being idiots number will drop your jaw
it s the truck that s all you need to know about this guy
goofy hick
vans are next
rich asshole probably gets a fucking tax return
don t bother to recycle because there s an aluminum shortage or anything ugh
if you wanted to send a real message and your cock n balls with it
that s a badass garage tho
these men give off big cuck energy
i feel new so i saw the kid rock video what s up with bl and is anheuser busch is budwiser bad too
steel reserve has what your looking for
both taste like piss anyways
the very definition of toxic masculinity mah dude it s shitty beer in a can with some printing on it same shitty beer you consumed literally until you were puking just last weekend it s a marketing gimmick on the notion that anyone who identifies as lgbt might be persuaded to consume bud light of all the shitty beers in the world because of a fucking rainbow on a can but you and your lifted pickup truck are somehow offended to your core and you dumped a full pack of beer in general trash didn t even have the common courtesy to put it in the fucking recycling bin you re what s wrong with this world ask yourself what would jesus do or for that matter what would brian boitano do
garbage man is gonna be haaapppyyy
man june is going to be rough for all of these snowflakes the minute it s june 1st all of the corporations support the lgbtq community lol
he could ve at least donated them to the homeless
how dare they water down our hate
i m more concerned why you have so much bud light in your fridge who drinks light beer anyways especially american light beer it s just water
you should probably google it yea well you should probably take your own advice
he owns so much sassy stuff
so brave
and judging by the amount of beers he had and the amount he bought back it s probably just for clout loser bought a shit ton of bud light right before hitting record to try and act so brave while throwing it all away
he s just wanting an excuse to show all his property and big boy toys
he probably went out and bought it all just to virtue signal

i m offended that he thinks piss water is good beer
bud recently went woke not actually though since they have shown support for the lbgt community for years they did a sponsorship with a trans person recently the irony is that he is switching to coors who has even more blatantly been in support of lgbt
he won t say or do anything about it unless one of his beacons does these fucking people are parrots zero original thoughts zero identity of his own he s a clown he will be drinking bud light again in weeks anyway this was theater to make sure people knew his thoughts same as it always is with these turds
the cynic in me observes companies are more inclusive when it requires no actual courage i suspect many are willing to tailor their stances to match their markets
in another video he shows off his truck full of bottles of jack daniels they recently promoted supported sponsored drag shows coors too and i believe ford think his truck is a ford this guys head must be exploding
it was water now it identifies as beer not my flavor but i don t disparage the people that are picking it up
these dumbasses are all buying the beer just to dump it or destroy the cans they literally paid for it like the company cares xd
je traded trash for trash lol
it s a ford

sexual tension is loud

i was waiting for him to call her a fat ass as she walked away
people just need to have hoses ready at all times it s my favorite way to get these people off your property
when people say i m gonna call my lawyer that means they don t have a lawyer
i m glad to see there s other redditors who would also hit it but admit it that she s an idiot
i have the weirdest boner
i can smell her unbrushed teeth from here
what should be the crime and punishment for that level of stupid like social interaction level violation failure to adult properly and generally being a dumbass fine or days in a rehab where various c list celebrities encourage you to do better for hours a day
how dare you wear those shorts gross
love how the young woman claims he s taking inappropriate photos of her because of her clothing yet she went outside in that inappropriate clothing so if she takes a selfie of herself wearing that is she taking inappropriate photos of herself

when you aren t a rich business owner media personality whose daily life requires review of legal proceedings for deals property development contract deals etc it is never a flex to imply that you already have lawyers most people consult attorneys for off things like wills or a divorce they don t keep one handy as a matter of fact the more average you are the more scummy it immediately seems to have lawyers ready to go
those laddies need to leave randy marsh alone
i always feel 2nd hand embarrassment when people pretend like they have a lawyer on call
don t you love how everybody thinks they are a lawyer nowadays

i mean karen aside who gave that bitch an adult diaper
if it s his house then why does the sign say mt fern united methodist church if he lives at the church then why is he cursing like that
omgggg i used to be about her size thank fucking god i lost some weight because i know my shorts rode up my ass like that off topic but damn i m embarrassed
she doesn t have a lawyer
my laywers like she has johnny cochrans ghost lawyer at her disposal
trash women
when i was a teenager my father bluntly told me that my civil liberties didn t exist on the street they only existed in a courtroom the police own the streets i ve never forgotten that edit thanks for the award gentle reader
i m stunned they don t hit each other with that crazy shooting
did the dude pull a gun or was there simply a gun somewhere in the car need more details
ceasefire ceasefire but i got one left in the clip bang click click ok now i ll stop
thats alot of shots
the moment he didn t cooperate and there was a gun involved he was dead
did anybody see the gun cause i feel like once a cop says that he better be damn sure cuz that ll end someone s life like it did in the video
that second cop deadass ran around the vehicle to shoot directly through at the first cop
weird how when you slow the video down you see that he was unbuckling his seat belt videos are crazy things aren t they
well if you guys look closely it looks like dude is reaching for his seat belt because ya know it would be difficult to get out while buckled in
gun fetishists will tell you the right to bear arms is a safeguard against tyranny but this is the inevitable result
all because of a traffic stop
bit dissatisfied they weren t all dressed in heavy armour and driving tanks at least the ten officers let the entire rounds off
they know that s too many damn shots
what happens when over sensitive pussys are given guns n badge
while i don t agree with the clip emptying idiots here i think it s beholden on the citizen whos fucking armed to be more circumspect in his dealings with them that means complying with their orders especially when it s something simple like lower your window or step outside informing them right from the get go that you re lawfully armed and exactly where it is and maybe put your hands outside or at the very least clearly visible and making slow deliberate movements and informing them what you re about to do like i m just going to unbuckle my seatbelt etc etc would help if you didn t tint your front windows like an asshole too you want gun rights well it comes with heightened risks and responsibilities too imo
omg am i naive or desensitized or dumb that many shots
dame mother fucka
cowards
why wouldn t the driver just cooperate just cooperate and not get shot
while i am full acab this is solidly on the driver there s prior context not provided by the video he was fully sovereign citizen being just generally awful and he went for a gun
squeaky wheel gets the grease
but your honor they were only warning shots
this dude has the right to remain silent
we have the second ammendment in america
awww i wanna a fake passport too
title is completely miss leading he tried to pull a gun from what i saw in the video
what an idiot

gotta imagine all the acab folk are at least a little conflicted right now lol
article https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bodycam-footage-shows-5-utah-police-officers-fatally-shooting-25-year-rcna74129)
this is correct
what s the point of letting them arrest you if you won t make it to the courtroom alive
the crossfire is a little hairy with the cop who runs around the side
the community wouldn t be that lucky for them to take each other out
i m stunned they don t hit each other it happens nypd has a bad history of that
hard to tell its possible he had a legal firearm on his hip and that he had to reach near it to unbuckle the seatbelt its possible he was reaching for his gun to try to shoot cops and get away its possible there wasnt even a gun and the cop just saw somethinf and got spooked what sucks is it doesnt matter at all cops can just do whatever the fuck they want the second someone doesn t comply instantly
it s like the predator scene except they at least hit something
magazine not clip
but they said the magic word
the moment cops got involved he was dead
did anybody see the gun the full video shows him reach for the gun which is on the floor of the car after they pull him out while the holster it had been in is still strapped to him
and the pistol magically left the holster strapped to his waist and somehow ended up on the floor of the car
what is this statement supposed to mean gun ownership will result in getting gunned down by the cops shit i ve survived a traffic stop where i informed the cop i had a conceal carry firearm
so lemme get this straight two thousand unarmed people can have a near successful insurrection but you want me to also believe the overwhelming amount of guns in the united states would do nothing to safeguard against tyranny these two things do not coinside
how many is enough for you shot to a non vital area so he has capacity to aim and fire at you you shoot to stop the threat not to send a warning death is the intended outcome
excited delirium
too many damn shots they re trained to shoot until the threat is neutralized someone with a pistol in his hand is going to absorb a lot of bullets when there are that many cops firing
the dude had a gun and was reaching for it should they just wait to see if he fires
so in this scenario what s the non over sensitive pussy reaction to a guy pulling a gun out have a little chat let him get it all the way aimed just to make sure he s serious genuinely curious what your super not sensitive tough guy approach would be
what happens when over sensitive pussys are given guns n badge it might be amusing to see how you would react to having someone pull a gun on you other than wetting yourself what do you think you would do
dumb police are trained to fire until the threat is eliminated once they retreated back they had no idea where the gun was or if the suspect was alive enough to get a shot off whether it s one shot or a hundred shots is irrelevant they re trying to kill him if you didn t realise
i wonder if he is still alive
how close are we to this https://www.reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/comments/12dccfv/a_palestinian_boy_trying_to_stock_the_shelves_in/) with that attitude
just cooperate and not get shot he was a sovereign citizen who believed he was immune to the law his whole family shares that insane belief he believed he had been issued a special passport that tells police they cannot detain or arrest him it s a cult and cult members tend not to act rationally
gets greased
this guy is a sovereign citizen who thinks he has altered his status from u s citizen to american state national and his special asn passport instructs police not to detain or arrest him this is complete nonsense but they believe it or pretend to believe it there is such a thing as a u s national mostly people in american samoa who lack some of the rights of citizens like voting in national elections but you don t get to become one by scribbling some foolishness on your passport application and needless to say they are not immune to u s law
if you won t make it to the courtroom alive this guy had many days in court including being dragged out by bailiffs when he disrupted trials of his equally idiotic family members on this occasion he decided his delusional beliefs had to be defended with a pistol bad choice
its possible there wasnt even a gun and the cop just saw somethinf and got spooked the full video shows the pistol on the floor of the car while the holster is still on the driver s belt it is reasonable to think he pulled the gun
who cares
gif giphy enqnza1b5frhkpjxts downsized
true
that too
the moment cops got involved he was dead he and his equally insane family have had many encounters with police and many trips to court this man had repeatedly been dragged out of courtrooms by bailiffs for disrupting trials of family members screaming obscenities at judges he believes he has altered his status from u s citizen to american state national and no u s laws apply to him he pulled a gun on the cops this was on him
congratulations you won the cop lottery
this citizen was given two choices get out of the car or we re going to break out your window standing up to what he no doubt perceived as a tyrannical threat he decided to go with option c attempting to plead the 2nd so to speak and was promptly turned to swiss cheese the statement is supposed to mean that in regards to safeguarding against tyranny when it comes down to it the right to keep and bear arms means just next to fuck all
i mean did we watch the same video did this guy s gun protect him against tyranny
successful insurrection occupying one building
unarmed lol try again bud
are you a cop
i won t go at length because i responded to you elsewhere in this thread so i ll just leave this snarky question are you aware that gunfights are dangerous and can lead to unintended deaths especially when you blast off a bunch of rounds haphazardly in the middle of town
he s reaching for his seatbelt look at it again
i mean as opposed to the sheer amount of gunfire they responded with yea
i m not the person you re replying to but i m someone who has de escalated multiple situations where deadly weapons were pulled on me the whole if you were there you d suck too appeal doesn t work on people who have actually been in such situations anyways the start the gunfight crowd doesn t get that gunfights are dangerous even if you get to shoot first it s far safer not to be in any gunfights and i d prefer that my public servants start as few gunfights in my neighborhood as possible
i think that constitutes as naive from the person asking but since they offered dumb you salivated to passive aggressively give the answer you did
your mama already did that for me before i left she looked at me from the bed and told me not to let her ringmeat of a kid try to get wise with me
bullet holder
the liberal law makers that restrict magazine capacity to rounds
also attempting to violently overturn the democratic process because you lost an election is kind of tyrannical
ur really not helping the case either way its less than armed individuals if its even that high but why stop there lets say all were armed armed individuals had a near successful insurrection but also the plus millions guns would do nothing to safeguard against tyranny again these two things do no coinside if u really believe both at the same time you are lacking some critical thinking skills
nope nor do i support aggressive police tactics but i do completely understand when they are justified in killing someone before they get killed your utopia doesn t exist
he s reaching for his seatbelt he was reaching for the holstered pistol on his hip or did the pistol magically jump out of the holster and end up on the floor of the car where it is visible in the full video
they are trained to stop the threat don t reach for a gun with cops and you won t get killed
nah yeah for sure was going to edit it it doesn t make you dumb to not know something and he asked a sincere question
spoken like a true year old good for you little man
gun nuts really are the biggest losers
if you need more than rounds to hit something then you probably shouldn t have a gun to begin with
you can demand knowledge from regulators making laws containing technical details without being a dick to anyone using colloquial language in casual conversation
we almost did it you guys we got pelosi s laptop and some random podium what a fucking cosplay loser
near successful you re an idiot bud
it was nowhere near successful but they got pretty close to killing individuals and if you think a bunch of hunters are gonna take on the us military you re an idiot
million dumbasses with guns would do absolutely fuck all against any fully equipped western military are you insane
except in every other country where cops don t do this
they are trained wrong then if this is how they are trained
respect
said the clown posting this on a throwaway
you are absolutely correct
slowly looks at police officers
something 3ft away from you
not close individuals did die

this is the reality of police forces having anarmed presence in schools they are of the time going to assign their doofy to guard the school cause he can t be trusted in them streets
they only let ppl with guns in
what a fucking dick
i can t believe he treated her like this for god sake she lost a daughter due in part by police inaction
real tough guy
anyone want to explain what s going on here
dude looks like he licks lead paint
fukin pigs especially these fuks
on the one hand i understand people are pissed at how this looks on the other hand there was a massacre at this school an unannounced angry person shows up you think it s reasonable for the officer to just let them in how does he know who she is or what she s doing there considering the circumstances it s his initial reaction really that unreasonable there s a lot of context missing here per usual
i think this is the context people are looking for it s related to protest https://abcnews.go.com/amp/us/texas-dps-releases-video-altercation-uvalde-victims-mother/story?id=98415646 she had been trying to retrieve her son to participate in a student led walkout i think i skimmed it s am i be tired
those pants
treated her like what is he supposed to just let her barge into the school
no one knows once again we see half of the story
pretty sure he knows who she is but still lots of questions
if she s a parent picking up her child then yes he shouldn t aggressively grab her and threaten her with arrest that s overreach
not sure why you re downvoted when you re right we don t know wtf was going on in this situation
exactly this
after a moment or two sure that s why he let her in but she s banging on the door great idea for a bunch of kids with ptsd to deal with a random kid opens the door he s still walking towards the entrance so he intercepts her as an immediate reaction to hearing someone pounding at the door seeing a random person walking in it seems reasonable to try to bar entry after what happened there i can t imagine they just let people come go without permission or without an escort
i ll catch the downvotes what we see in the video is a woman being let into a secured school for some reason by an unknown person who opens what appears to be a locked door after being approached by the resource officer she attempts to force her way into the school and becomes combative with the officer assigned to guard the door who attempts to keep this person out so i get that the guard there probably knows the woman and everyone there is at least somewhat familiar with each other it s not like this is a surprise though it doesn t matter if you had a kid that was murdered in a school you re just not going to be allowed to barge your way into any school just because you re holding a sign of your dead child it s a terrible thing that mother is going through but it doesn t give her the right to essentially break into a school
i get that but i actually think the cop is well aware of who she is from the beginning mainly because of his remarks to the man filming makes it seem like this isn t their first interaction of the day
very well said

i m remiss to admit it but this would work on me not that i d ever be a dumb enough cunt to throw a tantrum like this idiot but it would work
this is how the scam works riders are supposed to say their name to confirm they are the right passenger the riders app has everything about the driver the drivers app just has the riders name people who refuse to say their name are trying to get a free ride and the driver loses his fare time and gas
why do you refer to the help as pathetic you didn t even know the address and the operator was helpful to google it for you them answering the phone saved you a great amount of hassle and potentially harm it s really an asshole attitude to call that pathetic i m happy you didn t get scammed or hurt but that dig makes you a jerk
minutes nahh
this guy sounds like how hank hill would ve turned out if he d been the one who crashed boomhauer s car

i m assuming that you were not there to pick up matthew
ill never understand why someone would jack someone elses uber like you dont even know where they about to take you also if this is recent uber driver kinda seems like an ass uber isnt requiring mask anymore coupled with him giving the operator shit for doing their job if its an old video tho disregard the whole mask comment
a free ride to wherever the other rider was going there are so many videos posted like this and i don t understand why a rider would do this what do they do once they get in the car just get out at some random location
oh ok i remember one time an uber asked for my name i said are you here to pick me up he said what s your name i said are you here to pick up uchiha he said what s your name very agitated i said are you here to pick up uchiha or are you here for someone else again whats your name i said uchiha are you picking up someone else he said no and started driving i was so confused by that interaction
yeah but how would the scammer know the drivers name if they didn t order the uber
i confess i don t use uber or lyft often so i may not be thinking this through but why can t the app generate a qr for the rider that the driver can scan i guess you d need to remove your phone from the dock or whatever so maybe not logistically doable
seriously dude they don t always have all common places in their cad system and you even called it two different things tavern vs cafe satellite technology isn t such that they have a camera shot of your location when you dial
them answering the phone saved you a great amount of hassle and potentially harm it is their job to pick up the phone you dumb bitch x200b sorry but you deserved that
only the first minutes is the altercation
uber isnt requiring mask anymore the driver is still well within their rights to ask passengers to wear a mask just because the government stopped tracking covid doesn t mean it s not real
the scammer once in the car will say some version of oh i put in the wrong address can you change it take me to different address so the scammer if successful goes where they want on someone else s dime i had a guy attempt this once the trick is to tell them they need to change the address themselves if they don t kick them out
this is my question they want a free ride to some random place
they might kill you you now have a person or people in your car and you have zero info on who they are
it was also the caller s job to give someone a ride how well did he accomplish his i understand why he kicked them
yeah that s what i was thinking you just have them change the address in the app if they try that i guess at that point you ve lost the previous ride already and have to deal with kicking out some asshole so it s better to figure that out when they get in
and they happen to know where an uber is coming and what happened to the people who actually ordered the uber shouldn t they be there too
this is what i do the only way a destination can change is if the customer does it
it happens more often around bars at closing time or at the airport big stadium venues etc when there s crowds of people outside lots of chaos and cars people trying to find their correct uber lyft traffic messed up everyone in a hurry scammers see a great opportunity to play on that

you want to have a conversation stfu
dude dealt with in a educated manner kept his control top man class act he is correct if they were black straight to jail reflection of racism in today s society
start blaring what ever music will annoy them the most any suggestions
there s a couch right there they couldda been more comfortable there
nasty ass fuckers
why were they even drinking in front of karen s window when there s a perfectly good couch by the dumpster
deleted
lmao sitting next to a dumpster well there was a couch there
you re gonna join in and be racist with him i was with him till he turned into a racist let s see how your people works out when the tables are turned then you have the exclusionary victimized minority race bs don t be hypocrites he was rightfully annoyed then he turned out to be a karen esh
this on a loop https://youtu.be/r67xoagrs-y)
this is the way theyre not hurting anybody and just hanging out in the daytime at their bros house guy in the vid has to make it racist
i had a cat who was a legit audiophile she would triangulate with her ears to find the best spot to listen she had favorites but she loved all music with a single exception when we played this song she ran and hid for a couple hours https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhlojruy8qq
he said your people bro did you hear that next word contextomy https://i.imgur.com/3bplrph.png) you heard what you wanted to hear it s sad that you re filled with hate that you can t hear straight i hope you find peace and happiness
he meant ppl as in his drunk neighbors friends not his ppl as in fellow hispanics jesus christ
what did he say that was racist
bruh they re hurting the dude who lives there they re loud they re drunk they re littering they re pissing on his plants they could be at their bro s house but they re at his neighbor s house also public intoxication is illegal in most places so is public urination aka public indecency which depending on who sees your dick hanging out could catch you charges that would put you on a sex offenders list the fact that the cops did nothing about it is sus af
oh right i forgot bro was the magical word that makes everything okay ie it s just a prank bro

the craziest and scariest part about this is the fact that is a full group of adults acting in consensus it is not only one rotten apple but a whole freaking family doing shit like this
if taking the kids out of the wagon rii away when u get confronted doesn t scream guilty asf then i don t know what does morons
i like how it s their wagon but they know exactly why they re being followed i didn t hear the people with the camera say anything before the thieves
it ain t yalls but you can have it
fuck thieves
yeah because when we re innocent of theft all of us just give up the stolen property when we are accused don t we
that s exactly what people say when they get caught with something stolen they suddenly don t want need it anymore you can have it you re damn right it s theirs
they re complaining about them following them as if it s an excuse for them stealing the wagon lmao
it s because we black no it s because you re thieves our fellow black people hate it when assholes do this kind of thing
and then yell f bombs at disney
he had an easy out too could have tried to save face and say i thought they were disney s for anybody to use i didn t realize it was yours i m sorry yea it would be a clear lie but it s a whole lot better than saying what he said
excellent role models for their kids
y all can have it it s not yours though if it s not theirs why are you giving it to them the fucking cognitive dissonance on display
removed
criminals making themselves out to be the victims problem is that there are no real consequences for these people
it s always the groups with matching t shirts
these are the same people who will go through a mcdonald s drive thru park at some nice parking lot with a view eat their calories in sodas shakes burgers and fries and then throw all of their garbage right out the window and drive off trash humans
removed
the audacity is a tactic a way to get away with theft we re angry and so you want us to stop or go away we will
notice how the thieves immediately make themselves the victim by saying you guys have been following us and are harassing us you can have it instead of apologizing they double down gaslight the real victims and make the whole situation even more awkward doing all this in front of their own kids too what a way to set an example
had something similar happen to me my baseball equipment bag was stolen when i was younger i had a first baseman glove a regular glove an eastman aluminum bat batting gloves water bottles and a bunch of tape in it long story short when we confronted the kid that stole it his mom called us poor and shamed us for asking for my stuff back funny thing is that that family was known for being amongst the poorest in our town they were on welfare not shaming but made sure to call us broke
a few years ago my wife and i took our then newborn baby to park on a sunday for a picnic next to us was a group of like to african american adults having some kind of family reunion all wearing the same custom tshirts we were there for like minutes when we get up to go and my wife realizes her phone is missing she had been leaning back and was placing it on the grass behind her at arms length we never moved so we immediately thought of a moment when one of the reunion people lingered behind us for a second but we doubted this could be possible since they were all mature looking people in their 40s and 50s i called her phone and immediately heard it ringing among the group of reunion people one of the guys immediately started walking away and i could hear as he answered the phone to silence it and slip it into his pocket i jumped up and jogged up behind him and asked him if he had found my wife s phone he said no he hadn t meanwhile i could literally hear our delayed voices on my wife s phone in his pocket and tell him so he gets agitated and starts to get aggressive yelling at me that he doesn t have my shit at this point of the people in his party come over and start immediately defending him telling me to fuck off ect i very calmly kept pointing out that you could hear my wife s phone speaker in his pocket they were undeterred the entire time he kept walking to the parking lot i m assuming to get to his car i followed as did the people who were now threatening to beat me up as we got to the parking lot in a moment of pure luck a patrol car pulls in and i told the guy i was going to ask the cop to help settle this he immediately reached in his pocket threw the phone onto the grass and said this ain t your phone but your racist ass can have it the other people started calling me a broke ass racist the whole situation was equal parts comedy and depressing i really don t understand what the fuck they were thinking
no one would give anything up that easy if it was theirs
notice the kids immediately leap out they knew it wasn t theirs poor kids
removed
somebody took my to go order from the counter just when i arrived yesterday thought it looked sus but wasn t gonna chase then into the parking lot or anything they remade my order still pissed fuck thieves
i m black and i hate when black people pull the race card
you can have it they re not fooling anyone
what a fucking prick the second he sees them like feet away he s yanking his kids out of it and trying to walk away and he has the audacity to say its not theirs
the lying bitch pulled out the race card god i hate this shit
it s always hilarious when people are so easy to turn victim be willing to give up what they stole act like they are doing the person they stole from a favor with guilt tripping
scumbags the whole lot of them
broke ass trashy people we didn t steal it but you can have it fuck them entitled garbage
no one tells i didn t steal it but you can take it unless they took it
why would they do it in the first place disney is filled with security you can rent a double stroller for like some bucks hell you can buy that red ryder wagon for right now straight from red ryder shit that s actually a good deal anyway if you got money to go to disney you got money to buy that wagon or a stroller shit you re spending more than that if you buy a few meals and snacks at disney such a shitty thing to do
nobody cares if your black just stop being shitty
i used to do loss prevention for work the amount of people that get angry for being caught with merchandise that s unpaid for and somehow try to reconcile their actions is crazy high well other people are stealing more right now i didn t take that much i m only here because of x it s insane and baffling
it s always the ones with the matching family shirts
always put your name on your belongings strollers baggage drink coolers etc
all of those kids are learning by example on how to behave when they are adults
just a trash family
fuck those people seriously fuck them stealing from people at disneyland in front of their kids what a way to set a fucking example trashcan ass fucks
i feel bad for the kids fuck thieves
pull that race card yo
disneyland is in california disney springs is a shopping center in orlando
lmfao because we black yup that s exactly why
this is why people can t get along shitty people from shitty families that scream and yell bevause they aren t intelligent enough to form sentences
should have been kicked out of the park you knew as soon as those kids hopped out with the quickness
this is what these parents teach their kids
trash with below average iqs and above average bmis
just take it don t ask us anymore questions just take it because we re guilty as fuck
i m glad they got their wagon back the sad part is their kids know exactly that their parents did wrong you can see it in their faces
wow what kind of trash person steals from children then acts like that when caught
some people are complete trash
only one thing worse than a liar and that s a thief

funny how the guy accuses himself by already knowing what they want without them saying a single word
the saddest thing is those kids will most likely end up stealing like their parents setting them up for failure i hate parents like this set a good example for your children they represent you
there is a real psychological toll in this kind of situation at that age your parents or guardians are your view of what s right in the world when a young child is put in this type of situation it s like their worldview is being challenged it s the flipside of seeing your parent abused in front of you when you are very young anyone remember the balloon boy hoax family in that kid watched his parents lie repeatedly and was coached by them to lie about the circumstances but he knew it was wrong the stress of that conflict actually caused him to throw up on a live tv interview it was so sad to watch
i often offer up things i am using to people that accuse me of stealing a guy once asked me where i got my new bmw and i gave it to him but said it was mine this is normal right
imagine spending a fortune on a trip to disney and then ruining it by taking a wagon and yelling at the people that own the wagon in front of your kids and theirs
we feel like you re harassing us for taking your shit can t make this shit up
well at least i know what the pavement at disneyland looks like
we always tag our items when we go to parks permanent marker on the inside the bottom and in the wheel base took the kids in restroom and it was gone when we came out spouse thought he saw our exact wagon go by where he had been purchasing something we got security to confront family they suddenly couldn t understand english so they got a translator they claimed it was their wagon they had covered the marker name inside with stickers so we told security our name was also on bottom there is was on bottom then they told security they thought they were for guests to use security didn t buy that we got our wagon back kids got treats not sure what happened to other family but they were with security and were becoming increasingly animated as we went on our way no one beats the sharpie
what a surprise guilty always then play victim
it ain t y all s but y all can have it classic line from someone who totally owns the thing they re holding especially when someone who couldn t possibly own the thing comes towards them with the swagger of someone who owns the thing also he sounds like chainz
had someone try to take my wheelchair before they said it wasn t mine it was the only one and had my name on it
i once owned a nice and reliable toyota corolla for years one day some asshole blamed me for stealing it so i thought the best option was to give it to my accuser and develop an attitude
can t even steal a wagon without someone coming up and harassing us
yeah i obviously stole it because i m going to immediately give it back to you but i cannot believe you followed us around the park to confirm it was yours
cause we black come on now
pure ignorance once again as a black american i am constantly embarrassed enraged at the shit other black people do same people will be crying over being racially profiled but are the exact people who contribute to these stereotypes
usually the one who committed the sin are more angry than the victims maybe because they got caught hahahaha
definition of gaslighting right there can t be explained is simpler terms
real great example
even the kids are well trained future criminals they hopped out quick
the worst part is that they are part of a larger group with matching t shirts lord help us they got the money to go to disney springs but then have the gumption to steal and harass from people together
that s disgusting sad part is the thief family in probably complained and got free passes to something
they re the victims here obviously
i cant believe they followed the people who stole their property the nerve or some people
i hate people
the kids getting out of the wagon fast was kinda sad how on earth do they do that in front of the kids
the girls got out fast once because they knew damn well it wasn t there s and they didn t want to get in trouble i m not saying it s the girls issue but the fact the dad believes it s okay to steal and to do it with their kids present
one time someone stole my bike that was locked up outside of the bar i was at i found it about a half block away with a homeless guy i confronted him and his street wife immediately started screaming about how curly came by and gave the bike to them weeks earlier but all he could say was if it s yours just take it
so uhhh even at disney huh even at disney with matching family trip shirts
they should be banned from the park
those folk should have been kicked out for been thieves
trash everybody giving these tips about putting their names on the wagon etc yes wonderful idea also need to question why do we need to conform because of thieves have to worry label everything why not just make them have consequences like arrest jail for stealing other peoples belongings which is the better deterrent
getting caught and being angry about it is always a classic
they know it s not their wagon but they proceed to play the victim
who the fook spends all that money to go to disney to act like a dick instead of just enjoying the limited expensive time you have
surprise shitty people being shitty
following us around after we steal from you is not okay i ve never seen anyone be so quick to give something away to a stalker
what a scumbag family rotten apple absolutely rubbish people
then they make it a race thing my guy it s not cause your black it s cause you stole something
trashy ass people

impressive speech rising star
tennessee is doing its best to be on the wrong side of history and this legend is standing up to them
old dude can you file a police report cop sighs in paperwork i mean yeah we can
would be funny if the old man was the real prankster
my buddy was in cuffs briefly weeks ago at lowe s looking at a box and some hs kid came up behind him and blew in his hear and made some creepy noise and rubbed his thigh he spun around and his elbow caught the kids nose and he broke it fukd with the wrong one kid was lucky he explained to the cops he felt someone touch him and out of the side of his eye saw someone behind him and reacted no charges
prank your friends not strangers
right of course he wasn t chasing views rofl
i love this reminds me of fried green tomatoes face it ladies i m older and have better insurance
in addition to being dumbasses for the prank they were dumbasses for not leaving immediately after so they didn t have to deal with the cop
didn t someone recently get killed for chasing views edit i m not condoning shooting someone over views but the fact of the matter is we live in a country where fuck around and find out is well fuck around and find out
chasing views on the internet ain t everything man need that framed and hung on the wall
homie shoulda just left never woulda got in any trouble you don t pull some lame shit and then sit around the place
how about don t touch strangers for internet clicks
this looks like the beginning of a horror movie the old man follows the prankster home and starts fucking with his family it starts with small harmless pranks but eventually the family chihuahua ends up missing the prankster checks the mail one day and finds the dog dead in the mailbox at the end the old man ties up the prankster s family and kills them one by one in front of him while live streaming it all on the prankster s own youtube channel the old man was actually a retired serial killer that never got caught
how is george rr martin supposed to finish that book if y all keep poking him
you can t be fucking with my customer tip her well
grown ass man wearing a i m a naughty boy hoodie is so cringy
views aint everything man yea but that ain t what we were after fuck off all you care about is views don t kid yourself i fucking hate these types of youtubers
looks way too old to be doing this looks like a year old trying to act like a year old
it s really weird how annoying all these pranks i see on social media are to me now but i absolutely loved jackass when i was a kid like i can t tell if i m becoming annoyed at these pranksters because i ve matured or jackass was just different
i m willing to bet that all the editing on this has conveniently removed the reason why this went from a handshake and no big deal to the police being called what else did this insufferable douche do to piss off those folks
real talk at least the cop wasn t a scumbag one of the few reasonable cops i ve seen
why can t kids just go back to smoking pot and playing video games
im with the cop on this views on the internet aint everything man
sue him for personal injury i am kicking and screaming
i hate pranksters but this is the least douche bag pranksters i ve ever seen they were chill about it they weren t even being assholes about it tbh there s a lot more worse pranks out there that are literally shit idk if they really needed a call for police
the cop at the end is actually giving him good advice but his stupid ass isn t registering any of it lmao
great way to waste an officers time i m not the one to defend actual asshole pranksters but a tap on the shoulder warrants a police call and a threat of suing lol fuck that
grandpa has his own channel trolling trolls
honestly a little bit of an overreaction once the cops were called for such a tame prank dude told the prankster to stop he did and that was the end of it getting the cops to write a report and claiming personal injury is a little excessive
years too old for that shi
look if you haven t got this dumb shit out of your system before your 30s you re just out of luck dude is simply too old to be giggling behind a booth after poking people like a fucking child
leave people the fuck alone it really is that simple
fuck these pranks but sue for personal injury really i wouldn t cry if the pranksters were sued but the court system doesn t need shit like that clogging it up when there are people with real damages who need redress
obviously no way of knowing for sure but my guess is the man has no real intention of suing but will hopefully serve as a decent life lesson to not be stupid to people minding their own business
it s simple leave people the fuck alone
i wish that everyone who does these types of pranks had to encounter this exact scenario after you have to meet the person face to face and accept whatever reaction they have no running away explain why it was funny and explain why you picked them to prank i feel like no one would do these anymore if that was the case
if you don t know the person it s not a prank it s just being annoying
people here acting like a tap on the shoulder is attempted murder the guy is annoying yeah but he didn t assault the old man he tapped him on the shoulder and got a response one that he most likely didn t want but that s all that needs to happen i get that everyone here is annoyed with pranksters but come on guys use your heads this one isn t worth getting angry about save your anger for pranks that are actually harmful if i had a choice between a guy coming at me dressed as a clown or some guy tapping me on my shoulder while i m at a donut shop the answer of which one most people would prefer is pretty obvious like this guy doesn t need to be sued or arrested over this don t take everything so serious he faced some consequences immediately and that s all that needs to happen
so what do you do i run a drug recovery program for at risk youth how about you i tap people on the shoulder at dunkin while wearing tiny red shorts for views on tiktok huh
i get that it s a harmless prank but life is hard enough without some jack offs trying to get laughs and likes at your expense prank your friends that are consentual to this type of behavior but quit fucking with strangers
stop touching strangers and filming it stop
stupid pranks on random people for views is as bad as the slamming of faces down in birthday cakes it s not funny just please stop and thank you
didn t someone just get shot in a mall for doing a youtube prank
i expected it to be a teenager doing the prank not some dude who looks
i m a victim of abuse and a victim of assault i have severe anxiety and moderate agoraphobia i feel a a gross jolt if people even accidentally brush into me please just don t touch bother or prank strangers even for the tee hees likes and subs
i wish you could have seen what happened
i hope the old boy takes everything from this piece of shit
trolled him back i like it
that woman explained what a youtuber was to that man and he had in his eyes
suck shit douchebag
chasing views gonna get you in trouble it wasn t even like that it was like that
don t touch people you don t know especially exhausted elderly desk attendants
in many places the law books define assault simply someone touching another person without their consent the older man may have a legit claim no matter if he s actually hurt classic case of fuck around and find out
other people is not your content
i do whatever i want but am genuinely surprised that others do also it wasn t even like that
cop had a deep sigh when the old guy mention about a police report
god this is embarrassing he doesn t even look that young
fuck this stupid little prick at the very least it s horrible judgement if you loop strangers in public into your world of immature personal amusement then eventually you re going to fuck with the wrong person that will guarantee you have a very bad day
good for the old guy hope he gets some coffee money out of it
why do they all have the same cringe f boy voice lately
some youtube praankster got shot a day or two ago over pretending to fight people or some shit pranksters have been the scum of the earth for over a decade and will continue to be
he didn t even seem that angry the old man is at a dunkin doughnut at night in what looks like his work clothes for a very manual labor job he is angry he s just so god damn tired he doesn t have the energy to deal with your shit
the way he s crouched in the beginning such a fool
why is a year old grown man making videos like this i m and wouldn t even do this shit it s so cringe
about time these idiot pranksters got stopped
pops was calm cool and collected he handled that prankster like a pro
it s like people have just forgotten how to be adults
i m a grumpy old man myself and might reflexively stab someone with a fork if they got between me and my meal with some bullshit at the end of a long day
trolling for likes we are sick of your shit leave gramps alone you mfers
dip shit
the weird lying claiming it wasn t specifically for views like yes it was there s no other reason why you would film yourself messing with strangers and post it you want people to watch so you can monetize and try to be the next big annoying shitty prank youtuber tiktoker
ha ha ha that slimy prick wants to earn money off him he needs to pay up
it was super fucking funny i like the part where he finds out about being sued roflcopter
there are million guns in this country and basically zero mental health services enjoy the fuck around phase because you will not like the find out phase why not just play the who can hold on to the firework the longest game it s probably a lot safer idiots i m sure there are people that actually love you that will be very upset about the find out part
fuck youtubers chasing views by fucking with people in public they re scummy as shit
haha good
good
hopefully the lawsuit is successful my town is full of idiot kids being dumb while their friends record them for internet views
this dipshit looks and is wearing a shirt that says naughty boy
love when these actually have a good ending
good
good lol
fuck idiots like these
good i hope this becomes the standard response they still posted other people s faces and i imagine the old guy didn t sign a release so another potential infraction
all this kid needs is a healthy helping of consequences and a judge that wont take any of his bullshit
that s great old man knows a lawyer there should be a subreddit just for pranks that take a turn for reality and backlash on the asshole chasing views
troll got trolled back twice as hard that s fuckin rich
this prankster has absolutely zero charisma embarrassing
well at least no one got shot
leave the old guy alone assholes
dude is looking like he is and acting like a year old
they said they aren t doing it for clicks but for a laugh how is this funny like maybe my sense of humour is off but how does anyone find this funny
this guy looks like an adult imagine his age doing shit like this for online likes i can t even think of a bigger loser than that no shame either you put this shit online without any shame i can t comprehend how delusional you need to be fuck these so called pranksters
a grown man doing pranks whomever gave him the encouragement deserves a slap as well
these pranksters are fucking idiots and deserve a swift smack in the lip and i m on old mates side here but wtf can u sue them for in that interaction
this genre of content is fucking garbage jideon baylen levine danny duncan and just stupid shit like this is just not fuckin funny
fuck this little string bean kid and his shitty greasy haircut
don t fuck with strangers in public i hope that every one of these it s just a prank idiots gets ass cancer
we weren t chasing views we were just trying to share some laughs as evidenced by the recording camera fucking prick
fucking cringe even his shitty naughty boy t shirt glad i don t know his name and he will be obscure forever loser
why do people think its okay to fuck w others

that security guard never took her eye off that woman idk what happened before this clip but that security guard was just waiting for that woman to do something stupid
did anyone else try to pick off the little bug
she was protesting or trying to https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/grizzlies-vs-timberwolves-woman-runs-on-court-delays-game-4-in-continued-protest-against-glen-taylor/amp/
damn how d he know she was gonna do that she must have been talking too loudly about what she was going to do or something his reaction time was super quick
protesting the suffocation method of killing chickens at the timberwolves owner s factory farm they turn the heat up in the barns and cease all air flow so the birds suffocate and die this was done due to avian flu which makes sense but the method of culling is the reason for protest also these farms are noted for keeping birds in small cramped cages personally i buy my eggs from a local with a small flock seems like this would be a better way to protest but i also realize this isn t an option for everyone
thought that bug was on my screen lol
nope
yooo that bug on the screen had me
i was at a trailblazers game and my phone has a chrome cover i was sitting in my chair with the phone in my hand and security came in front of me looked at my phone and told someone through his walkie talkie its a phone they don t f around
one of the jobs of the security guards is to watch anything untoward and be alert to what the people around them doing
gif giphy knuhetktx63xgyhbt1
someone get that mosquito off the screen
a sista if you look at it from the beginning she was looking from the jump no pun intended she must ve been acting weird already before the video give her a raise let out all that aggression for the week kudos
the fly on the screen
heeheehee her little feet as they dragged her off the court
i guess we re calling situational awareness premonition now
using eyes is premonition
that was the speed we needed on jan 6th get onto it once it starts don t fluff around do your job defend the building
not sure what you were trying to accomplish here crazy lady but if it s a broken collar bone looks like you succeeded
anybody else think that bug was on there screen
had her dumbass pinned quick damn
this is why you don t plan out loud lol
is that a fly on the lens
refs are so blind how does it take you that long to notice security to tackling someone in the middle of the court like right next to the play and everything
i thought that bug was in my scree
there is a bug on your screen
they discarded that person like it was too easy
guys look he s levitating away like jesus
why tf that mosquito all up in the screen like that
dang that was fast it looked like he was keeping an eye on her at the start i m guessing she was already acting a fool
there s a lacefly on your screen
what a waste of courtside seats
it wasnt a premonition the staff were told people were coming to mess things up in a disguise so he never took his eye off of her
give that guy a raise
he knew she was gonna try something he was watching her the entire time
i tried to wipe my screen off
why do some people want to take the chance at running onto a court as a potential threat around a bunch of lbs professional athletes lmao she s lucky security got there
funny story is the security guard pierre felix was tackled as a kid trying to get on the floor he later got a job as a guard and recognized the lady after receiving a tip about the protesters being there that day he knew she was going to do that
so about that gnat fly in the screen
she was going for ja
she was wearing a shirt of some activist shit
so does that bug on ur tv screen
anybody else try to smush that bug on the screen
the real issue here is the fly in the screen that really messed me up i touched my phone wondering if it was irl
bug
theres a bug on the screen o o my brain shorted and it was only me and the bug
did we ever find out the reason she jumped
iirc they saw her with others and noticed she had some super glue so they probably were waiting for them to stage a protest gluing hands to floor
the person with her was filming the people she jumped over were trying to snatch the camera at the end probably trying to do some dumb shit for views
there had been a few other protesters who tried a few things in the days before so they were on high alert apparently she wore a makeshift referee jersey had the glue people were filming etc security guard clocked it
they identified her the moment she arrived expecting something to happen
his eye
they were on alert as some people had previously run onto the baseline in a previous timberwolves game and glued their hand to the floor some animal rights activists angry at the teams owner for something
yeah that little bug had me trying to squash it on my screen
looks more like a fabric lint but yes i tried to blow and swipe it away lol
glen taylor billionaire business magnate politician owner of multiple sports teams abuser of animals receiver of million dollars in social welfare bailout
by paying for nearly courtside seats
probably overheard them was already eye ing her out then the mfer next to her pull out the phone camera which is another indicator
these places have watchlists of known activists and groups they work directly with the fbi and le who track these groups usually they won t actually stop them from admittance but will shadow them and wait for them to try to pull something which will incriminate them
they need to protest the usda because they have approved this method for use
also that he gets mad gov t money
regardless of where you purchase chickens eggs all farms purchase their chicks from breeders who kill the male chicks shortly after hatching they either do this by tossing them alive into a macerator https://youtu.be/t_u0jxi_v-w) or throwing them in large plastic bag tying it off and letting them suffocate additionally it s common practice on many farms to de beak chickens sear off the end of their beak which contains many nerves without any pain relief to prevent them from attacking each other due to close quarters or just the general stress of being imprisoned and exploited each day there are no ethical eggs buying from a local farm is not protesting it s deluding yourself
i wonder how he knew something was up with her
can t go five fucking seconds without making this about something else
yo that fly must be on the tv lol
removed
they did this a few times last year to protest against the owner of the timberwolves something about an egg farm
well silly of her to use glue then huh
ah you re right didn t even see the phone view chasing i m sure everybody tries to take the phone away from her friend too at the end
i sell eggs i ve never done any of these things i know a dozen of other folks around me that sell eggs they don t do this either not saying it doesn t happen but to say all farms do this and that there are no ethical eggs is false honestly it is very easy to raise chickens ethically just not at scale
as if there s even an correlation to be made between this one woman and that violent treasonous mob
i dunno man i don t like these protest either but when we re all underwater at least she can say she tried
jesus christ man talk about an over reaction
the owner burned alive and inhumanely killed millions of chickens these people caused minute delays at most and were such a stupid and selfish species that fams defended the billionaire and were upset about a small delay humans fucking suck
i assume that gluing ones hand to the floor doesn t concern an egg farm so much
unless they somehow sneak down i find it kind of ironic that they re probably spending thousands of dollars in order protest something a billionaire did court side tickets aren t cheap
i mean out of protest options i don t care all that much about disrupting a game or concert just don t block roads they could end up harming someone by preventing emergency services from getting through
believe it or not there are defenetly better ways to raise awareness and stuff using glue to stick yourself somewhere and be annoying at least imo brings more people against you than with you
even if the worst happens there will be no noticeable changes in our lifetimes
if you let these idiots continue it only gets worse
where the animal cruelty laws that s horrible
yummy chickens
to be fair memphis was already booing the twolves team and the twolves owner was in the process of selling the team so not sure what you want us to do at a basketball game in memphis
not sure i didn t pick the means of protest but i will say it did raise a lot of awareness at the time even if i forgot the overall message already
or causing someone to be late to work and getting fired or like that one guy who was on probation parole and was either on his way to a new job or to a meeting with his po can t recall which and the fuckers were protesting something and blocking the highway that kind of shit will get someone sent back to jail prison if they miss a meeting are late or lose their job
i m ok with climate apocalypse solely because someone glued their hand to a basketball court is not the thought process of any normal person
man people on this site fucking hate every form of protest i live and breathe basketball but it is a fucking game this clip is old they were doing this because the owners inhumanely killed million chickens torturing them and illegally trying to dispose of them i m not a vegan at all i m going to sound mean people it s pathetic it s pathetic how people disapprove of every single mildly inconvenient protest not supporting something because you disagree with the form of protest is the lowest iq thing you can do the world is shit because we are so indifferent and selfish we have no one to blame but ourselves every time on this website the majority of users get upset and angry at the protesters for the dumbest shit it s truly embarrassing a billionaire owner cut corners a gruesomely hurt animals and received no punishment and these protest literally made thousands of people aware of it delayed games minutes max and tons of people still sided with the owner because a basketball game was delayed people are honestly so fucking stupid and selfish we deserve an asteroid
another way to get people against you is to come to the defense of bloody hatchet guy probably not what you re trying to do but i think the appearance is your main issue here
is that a fucking joke lmao there are already physical consequences not to mention the geopolitical consequences
maybe for basement dwellers like you all of us here in the real world are already seeing real consequences
our species is pathetic
it s really not a big deal bud
some of the chickens were sick with bird flu so instead of trying to quarantine and separate the sick population it was cheaper for glenn to just light them up and burn a couple million of them alive he s a piece of shit outside of basketball and has been for basketball reasons too
that s what farmers did to cull the avian flu epidemic that caused egg prices to rise they basically cooked them alive
animal cruelty laws don t apply to farm animals seriously look them up they have specific exceptions for agriculture as long as something is an industry practice then it s legal the same exact acts that would be felony crimes if done to a dog are perfectly legal if you do them to a cow pig or a chicken
top notch level of humour we are truly living in the idiocracy era
i was wondering where the free range roasted chickens were
i m not even sure what you are trying to communicate here with this response this game is clearly in minnesota the purpose of these protest are to create awareness i only know about the farming incidents because of the consistent protest it was until the 3rd or 4th one do americans not even understand the purpose of protest anymore this was a highly efficient multi day protest it was the topic in r nba multiple times it s literally being discussed now years later like we sacrificed minutes of basketball for thousands of people to be aware of another reason this billionaire is a piece of shit
yeah man i dunno i guess it s fucking apathy at this point like i m sure we are absolutely fucked on this planet to the point where i won t have kids but this type of shit just doesn t seem to do anything to move the needle in peoples heads we need million people marches stage general strikes mobilise as a populace in order to that we need to fucking organise not just have singular acts of blocking traffic or glueing hands but just like we need the working class and middle class to come together regardless of politics to make any meaningful change in our corporatocracy i doubt it ll happen till it s too late edit maybe if france can become a super power and take over the entire world spreading the most frenchiest part of french culture burning shit down when your government fucks up https://reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/comments/12cx3e4/the_french_know_how_to_protest/

when you lie about having no more gum then someone sees you putting a fresh piece in your mouth
a light of all nations sheesh
you would think that as a once persecuted group of people themselves they would have more empathy for those who s homeland was invaded by antisemites and their people massacred forced to flee for their lives guess no one ever truly learns from history at the rate we re going i wouldn t be surprised if we are already in another cold war that no one has told us about live each day like it s the last bc i doubt they ll be honest when the nukes are coming guys
i can t wait until the u s just cuts them off the mayhem will be golden
it s just slow motion genocide they think if they do it slowly no one will notice and they wont look like germany
all these bad things in history happened to us so this makes up for it
you can spot the trolls when they call the kid a camel jockey
i would question why the footage has been cut between pm and 09pm period of time between when the soldiers are spotted and they enter is missing before assuming the shop owner is faultless
the way they re acting angry i suspect the guy threw a rock maybe or somsthing doesnt justify that fucking beating at all i just suspect they were beating him for a shitty reason bunch of pussies 5v1
they re not violations if we don t classify them as humans american foreign policy
and this is only a small portion you don t really see the yemen videos and the african videos
it pisses me off
don t forget they come here to train out cops

this is like the least violent idf video i ve seen this week their raids of the major mosque in jerusalem are horrific but not covered as well
because this is a tuesday this isn t exceptional or beyond the norm
i would like to see it but to the powers that be it would make no real difference the us would make some weak sauce statement about respecting rights the israeli army would say we are investigating of which nothing would come from it because the israeli army has no desire to investigate themselves and both sides would act like nothing had happened i mean we can t even get any indictments after the israeli army killed a american citizen who was a journalist
keep sharing the video
most big news conglomerates are owned by jews you will never stuff like this in mainstream media
because kanye west
from the very founding of the nation they inherently were
i m on the palestinan kid s side here but i m wondering if this isn t a retaliation for sone sort of anti israeli propaganda that they found him distributing and they are trying to shut him up
if he knew scripture says god is both omnipotent and omniscient if that s true then your god has always known this was gonna happen but has done nothing to stop it
if you still believe in a just and loving god when you see shit like this well thr isn t to much else to say
are they even considered terrorists at this point
i would not say its the last surviving apartheid state
when you lie about having no more gum then someone sees you putting a fresh piece in your mouth hahaha it s funny because someone got assaulted by police for no reason in an apartheid state fro buddy
my dead nazi grandfather watching israel follow in his footsteps good good let the hate flow through you
this is regular speed if not faster nazi germany didn t happen over night
that s the perfect speed for alt right movements the slow brew vel d hiv roundup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vel%27_d%27hiv_roundup) alt right groups prefer their needs met whilst we all stay quiet till some level of control has been gained pedal to the metal comes after and then it s just full right wing
comments like yours pop up on every video okay but what happened before the video etc literally every thread with a video of idf brutalising people it s guaranteed wonder why
sure
yes yes the kid is definitely a terrorist and belonged to a secret organisation which possessed a threat to their fake nation
i would question why the footage has been cut between pm and 09pm period of time between when the soldiers are spotted and they enter is missing before assuming the shop owner is faultless memory maybe we are talking about seconds i hardly think this boy stacking boxes pulled out a kalashnikov or a pipe bomb in that time unless just being a palestinian is a deadly weapon s
ahhh i see cus of ur logic sure ur a smart guy min difference is the missing context that allows the police officer to assault a kid do you not see how incredibly stupid you sound
in that seconds it looks like he goes out of sight of the camera further into the store that s seconds of nothing on a gif so it was cut you don t want dead air if you are going to keep people s attention
op said funding the us gives more money to israel than any other country
take a poli sci class
zionists scared of pink eye

i mean i get that but can somebody boost it on social media or sumn the past few years im realizing how much bs we have been fed about israel being a victim of palestinian aggression and all of these videos coming out should be pissing good people tf off rn it s unacceptable they re as bad as the kkk during the turn of the 20th century til now it s a bad look for american jews too none of this is good bleh
big news companies won t run it unless they can verify it
i have seen propagandists defending that raid with the excuse how do you know if they didn t hold a rock it s easy to defend those atrocities when they don t see the other party as humans
if you feel like you need to imagine excuses to justify what happened then you are not on his side
that would just make it worse honestly it reminds me of when during the blm protests against police violence when cops were shooting protesters in the face with rubber bullets and literally pulling up in unmarked vans and black bagging people thereby exemplifying the exact type of behavior that was being protested against in the first place like even if he was putting out anti israel propaganda their response is to get a group of soldiers to stomp out a single teenager and pepper spray him in the eyes before beating him with a rifle that will teach him not to hate israel
shit that god flooded the whole world because we were made wrong by him definatley not all knowing
one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter
https://youtu.be/obfubbhize4
this has been going on for decades and generations much more akin to apartheid south africa in that sense
palestine s population has been growing faster than israel s for years educate yourself before you discredit yourself
like boiling a lobster if you drop the lobster into boiling water the lobster fights to live but if you put the lobster in cool water then slowly heat it up the lobster lets you cook it
it is very suspicious because of when it happened the cut happened right before the man started to get attacked there is a good chance it wasn t warranted still but he must had said or did something otherwise the cut doesn t make sense it was his camera too so he is probably the one who did the cut with the full video the context can drastically change from did it because racist assholes to did it because he threw something at the officers neither justifies the officers actions but it makes it so neither are blameless and the officers did it for a completely different reason
we are not talking about before the video that s why i explained specifically where the footage was cut it s a very odd spot to be removing seconds worth of footage
maliciously stocking shelves
maliciously stocking shelves
he s responsible for the toilet paper shortage geesh s
thats not minute thats like seconds
seconds
i m not saying that the force used here wasn t excessive i m stating that people should be careful about jumping to conclusions when the video has been selectively edited to remove parts that are important to understand the context you could switch the sides in this video and i would still state the same concern
i had been sharing views of what is actually happening and what isreal was actually doing but i got my accounts ban for breaking guidelines
as much as these palestine israel get posted and boosted till never get national attention cus the united states is so close to israel and we turn a blind eye it s disgusting even politicians gotta be careful cus saying anything bad directly about israel is career suicide it s fuckin vile
seriously how can they do the same maybe nazi knew something about the jews we dont
you should read about the zionist leaders when they first invaded and some of their racist quotes
yeah but most new companies will choose not to verify it
i know it s horrible it s just something i wouldn t put past the occupying army
but he s pro life now
the boston tea party that helped spark the american revolution was an act of terrorism
https://youtu.be/obfubbhize4 no
fair point just without the soldier of fortune ads
that definitely makes it okay
what credit
or frog
come on bud there are literally hundreds of videos of idf terrorists attacking killing palestinians simply going on about their day
dignity is optional in the 21st century
can someone get an ai to do rogan commentating this

this guy has some serious balls lol
ironically enough him being free to kneel on the flag and pray to whatever he wants is the most american part of this video and that s coming from a veteran
funny how the people wearing the liberal tears shirts are so sensitive and easily upset
party size sauce for y all https://youtu.be/cn2ei1xdppk)
free speech until its speech that i dont like
lmao literally dozens of times these idiots change the flag colors to black or put their thin blue line on it put it on the ground watch trump have a guy skydiving with the flag where it comes down and lands on the ground but now they care when it s just on the ground conservatives are literally the stupidest bunch of dipshits this world has ever known
flag worship is crazy
they re so concerned about the flag on the ground but don t follow the rest of the flag code otherwise they wouldn t be wearing the flag on their clothes they d be putting their hand over their heart every time they pass one and they wouldn t be waving altered us flags
god i m going to send you down to earth i m giving you an extra pounds that you can use to make yourself taller or more muscular or more stout your choice pounds this guy i ll take balls of steel
you re going to go to hell if you rip it
i like this guy just straight up trolling i love it
lol american republicans you may wear my flag as a shirt pants suit tie hat bikini or cape you may add trump desantis and any political figure we like on it you can add trump and fuck biden on it you can change the colours to blue and white for the police you can pray as a christian to it but we draw the line on islamic prayers for the flag that s disrespectful
i ve seen his videos servers times and it s always hilarious we came here together
he s grown so much on me love how chill he is and unbothered
imagine getting mad about a piece of cloth touching the ground meat riding a country that would use them as cannon fodder for the stock market
but half of them will wear american flag shorts and rub their dirty unwiped butt cracks on the stars and stripes with no problem
sacha baron cohen would be proud
why didn t the cops arrest the people who assaulted him
the flag should never be used as wearing apparel how do they abide by one code and not the other dude has the flag on his sweatshirt but screaming about how it shouldn t be on the ground
love how conservatives like to pick and choose flag code
i love how these guys get so fucking offended over a piece of cloth
why do these people love flags so much its really really weird
someone please answer me why are people so offended by the american flag on the ground like are they actually mad or do they want something to hoo ha about in front of others to seem like they re good people
michael picard he is the best
does he have more videos he s hilarious
gif giphy 3okhwkzqslxj9olgka the flag should never be used as wearing apparel bedding or drapery it should never be festooned drawn back nor up in folds but always allowed to fall free bunting of blue white and red always arranged with the blue above the white in the middle and the red below should be used for covering a speaker s desk draping the front of the platform and for decoration in general
the man with a make liberals cry again shirt is absolutely losing his shit because a piece of fabric was on the floor
one day those two are going to hate fuck
they don t like the flag on the ground but have no problems with american flags with trump or an ar on them
don t step on muh flag alters the american flag by blacking it out and throwing a blue stripe in there i love it when conservatives pretend like they care about the flag code
looks like they re trying to cancel him
let me finish my prayer
off topic but i will never understand minorities be that racial ethnic or lgbt who support the republican party i understand how a lot of people have been basically brainwashed or just terrified into thinking these people are their salvation but for minorities they don t even try to hide their hate why would you support something or someone that at best doesn t see you as a person and at worst wants you dead edit i m part of the lgbt community and i just don t fucking understand this i get enough hate and nonsense in my regular life without willingly subjecting myself to it
i love how none of them get arrested for continuously putting hands on this dude and his property gotta love people who claim to love america attempt to stifle his ability to partake in free speech ignore him you fragile cultists honestly they should just leave if they get that triggered
why do you allow that says the free speech and fuck your feelings crowd lol
these guys flag fetish is on another level it s just a damn flag who gives a fuck if it touches the floor
will never understand how people get so twisted of a flag so easily triggered
so now they decide to wear masks probably think it prevents the fbi from recognizing them
being able to keep a straight face while doing all of that such art
i just met this guy when i went to checkout the circus outside trumps court appearance tuesday really nice friendly and funny told him i loved his content and had a good chat
let me finish my prayer got me cracking up
get that flag off the ground and get the name trump written across it
idiots freedom of religion means freedom from hateful religion good on him for exploiting the hypocrisy
dumbass republicans trumpie cunts vs weaponized reddit autist let the game begin
make liberals cry again their shirts say as they go into hysterics because the american flag touched the ground
let me finish my prayer absolutely love that part lolol
it s a good thing this fat man wasn t beaten here in our country if the flag is used like that people will be imprisoned
michael picard is a national treasure
look at these fucking triggered snowflakes lol
gif giphy utb9lk1pqyjdw
i got better taste in men lol at least he had humor
don t rip it you go to hell if you rip it that s flag code rofl
upset about the flag being on the ground yet will break flag code to wear shirts hats desecrate the flag with back the blue bullshit hmm
america is the land of the free but if i don t like it than it needs restrictions
crazy to me how brainwashed zealots people are about a flag that has interest in helping you lol
i love him
funniest thing i ve seen here for a while
they re protecting flags like it s the biggest accomplishment
this guys is an idiot but at the same time an absolute balls of steel genius
a lot of fragile snowflakes in this video isn t there
going to the police station tomorrow because i said god dang at work about the tornadoes and the christian customer took it to heart and made threats to the point that a coworker who knew of him in this small town wanted to walk me to my car fuck religion and those that use it as an excuse to commit felonies to people just working and being nice all because you don t like the words used
the guy with the make liberals cry again shirt is awfully sensitive about a flag that doesn t belong to him being on the ground
the hero we need and deserve
imagine getting that emotional about a flag
i don t really get nationalists obsession with flags same with german right wingers and their endorsement of the black white and red flag alltough i know what they d love to fly even more than the kaisers flag
the only patriot here is the troll he gets it
imagine giving a fuck about a flag
so he was robbed
americans are so funny with their obsession over a flag
imagine getting that worked up about a piece of fabric that was probably stitched together by chinese prison labor
we need 100s of this guy
they only allowed trump to hump the flag like tommy wiseau with the red dress
this is great maga pussies can t handle someone worshipping someone other then their lord and savior trump
magats sure love stealing people s property remember these fascists only care about the symbol of the flag not the liberties that it represents probably has to with privilege of never being a second class citizen the cold war brainwashing not to question the overly conservative government
he should have told them he was paid by fox to fire up the crowd so it would be good tv
so many police reports needed to be filed
fascists hate freedom
yassss feed the troll mooorrrreeee
funny little fuck let him host the daily show
more please
hahahahahaha
quality troll
that guy has more balls than trumpsters
fucking with trumpies should become a national sport
like props to this guy for standing up to the lunatics but i also hope he doesn t do this again just for his own safety genuinely surprised one of those lunatics didn t hurt him
ive never understood why ppl get so angry about flags being on the ground
gqp nuff said
some legends are born to troll the living fuck out of the stupid people so the rest of us can enjoy the stupid people rage
pics of him in us flag overalls are making the rounds on twitter they think he s for real
is there a law about flags touching the ground
the ultimate hypocrisy you wait in line for a glimpse of an insurrectionist while being outraged that someone kneels on the flag the gqp haas become a laughing stock
flag on the ground crime it s a fucking flag who gives a shit jesus the us has some serious sickness
what s with all the maga wearing covid masks
the goat michael picard can t wait to see his new video from his trolling in nyc this week
legend
who is this guy the risk this guy is taking for a joke is unreal
do you think these fake flag hippies know they shouldn t be wearing the flag either or that desecrating the flag is actually protected under free speech
he should carry more flags so if one gets taken away theft he just brings out another one
i just love how all of the trumpers have zero clue that they re just reinforcing every stereotype about them over and over here

any background on when this happened i know this exact spot on this highway and i ve never seen anything this wild on it the really crazy stuff usually happens on the nj turnpike
go birds though
it s stolen he can t wait for the cops
maybe this man is drunk so he was out of his senses or maybe he left on purpose so that when the police arrest him he would say he was drunk to avoid being charged
it can happen to some people after a stress situation they want to run to get away from the stress of what s happened knew someone like this at work

this is more of a light jog tbf
i work in the insurance industry and we get a few of those wasn t paying attention and flip on the side of the road left because i didn t have my phone suuuuuure mister dui
mf a gta player
he s from new jersey he was born to run
this was back in december i couldn t find any updates besides this article https://dailyvoice.com/new-jersey/gloucester/police-fire/hit-and-run-state-police-probe-south-jersey-crash-going-viral-on-tiktok/800166/
its like a low rent version of when tony and johnny sac s meeting got raided by the feds and tony had to run walk home in the snow
right where they are i watched an old ford explorer lose control into all lanes then swerve hard right flying down into that clogged wooded area it was awful to witness
you can t park there
he might ve stolen the car
don t have to pump your own gas don t have to file your own accident report everything is legal in new jersey
deptford is in south jersey that is a whole other country
when that third cup of coffee kicks in
well is call hit and run not hit a drive
he s going to steal another car ctc iykyk
probably running away from the feds from johnny sack s house
gif giphy zdhmvj9dm7kus
i have heard this before which is horrifying if you know you are over the limit and get in an accident some say to run home and wait for the cops when they come for you you say you drank to settle your nerves from the accident and now you can t be charged with dui because they can t prove you were drunk while driving am not a lawyer don t drink and drive you fucking idiots
actually makes sense
or it s a stolen i live in st louis mo and there s abandoned cars all over that were stolen crashed and abandoned he looks older tho so prolly drunk asf
the drivers are the worst in city i drive everyday in
looking like tony soprano running away from the feds at jonny sacks house
it s go phills for now
my son runs away when he gets hurt not far just away once he hurt himself ran away tripped over a log fell again got hurt again and still ran away further after he hit the log we were laughing so hard we couldn t even ask if he was ok
if you can make it past traffic off the road is the safest spot after an accident like that on the highway that car is waiting to get hit by someone not paying attention
or just say nothing and lawyer up i always wondered what would happen if you did that and claimed someone must have stolen your car like if you had good insurance could you even get a check out of it
we had a local super rich polo mogul try this after hitting another car into a drainage canal where the kid drowned rich guy john goodman not that john goodman said he ran to a buddy s place to call for help and drank a bunch of booze to calm his nerves he was convicted
drink and drive you fucking idiots you heard it here everyone
when they come for you you say you drank to settle your nerves from the accident and now you can t be charged with dui because they can t prove you were drunk while driving something tells me this is not true at all and you can still be charged especially with witnesses either way hit and run is not a good thing to have on your record especially if there are injuries
this guy doesn t have the making of a varsity athlete either
they would ask why didn t you report the car stolen
i actually knew a kid in my druggie days who crashed his truck drunk left it and reported it stolen in the morning afaik it worked which sucks
most crashes there s going to be at least one witness
in this case there are tons of traffic cams on they may have been able to track previous images of car driver even before he hit camden area
you could tell them that you were too drunk to notice that it was missing lol
i ve been inside drunk all day what business would i have even looking at my car first i heard about it was right now from you
what if you don t answer that either
drunk people shouldn t be looking for their cars isn t that right officer
well i d say they may take that as obstruction but i m not a lawyer so don t quote me on that lol
you are not required to answer you are not required to testify in court either
ah shit they would a got me lol
hell yeah i will not even respond to this reply
he looked like he was pullin a doctor strange move two snaps up
i don t know if i love this or find it sad
this guy reminds me of the movie men in black when the alien roach took over a guys body
hope he got out of there before he finished his curse

that was a beautiful kick to the face so graceful so skillful so remorseless
slap at the end said so much
i appriciate the honest title
that last kick
stomp on that goomba
the bible use to call this stoning but no stones were hurt in the process of this so
dude was running like his pants were either full of shit or pound weights
that s actually in colombia i recognize the regional accent they are accusing him of raping a girl they are not going for his belongings they are going for the belt to strip him and shame him after the beating colombian street justice translation attacker motherfucking rapist attacker learn to have respect for women camera man this is what rapist get
they are literally robbing him
the dude in the helmet starts picking his pocket it s a robbery with a bs title
i know i don t believe any titles like this
i thought this was fake until that one
architecture looks colombian too and they speak portuguese in brazil parent comment is so weird
as far as the rapist accusation is not by op is by the people attacking him they are telling him this is what you get for being a rapist learn to respect women as per the robbery i think he is going for the belt to strip him and shame him typical street justice in colombia for rapist sometimes they get tied to electrical posts so everyone can take turns why do they do this because our justice system is crap when it comes to rapist
i think that a lot of people run the pockets of anybody they beat up adding insult to injury or whatever
nah he just wants the d by going for his pants
is not the tittle it s what the attackers are yelling at him rapist
that too
so all the christian s who hear god in their head when they pray are schizophrenics we can play this game too
this isn t a public freak out soooo why tf is it here this is such a bad attempt at propaganda lmao
wait wait wait you re telling me that the same people who didn t even think autism was actually a real thing until minutes ago now suddenly believe in it and are blaming it for turning people trans can i please get a refund on this world i don t want to be on this ride with people this blatantly moronic
if you look at is a classic trump nonsense phrase that he uses as a substitute for proof you tell people that if they look they will see the conclusion there s no mention at all about the arrival at the conclusion you ll notice it next time what you ll notice if you actually look very strongly at these people is they all sound the same it s a fucking disease
as someone who is transgender and autistic there s actually preliminary research to suggest autistic people are more likely to be transgender https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770077/ neither should be used as a way of shaming or invalidating the other autistic people are able to self reflect and figure out their gender and sexuality just like a person without autism can
can anyone explain to me why there are so many videos on this subreddit of people getting knocked out and this dipshit hasn t been beaten to a pulp yet make it make sense
that s the guy that went to congress and was sexually harassing aoc
so now they ll come after folks on the spectrum is it just anybody at all who s even a little different that they ll go after
these guys are both absolutely brilliant experts in this field of study amazing geniuses really just spectacular knowledge that obviously comes from a lifetime of study and personal experience of course we should all take everything they say to heart without question
wait did you post this video to make fun of the guy talking about autism please tell me you re laughing at him and not agreeing with him this is the most dogshit take i ve ever heard if you guys get on the we need to fix autists because they re trans train it s not gonna go well
if you think about the reasoning for a lot of mental issues and how they are defined and you agree with that assessment then yes all trans people have a mental disorder as well mental issue just means you aren t like the majority
even if this were true what difference does it make
shutup caterpillar face
this is flat out right wing propoganda not even a public freak out op needs to be reported for this bs
i m not lgbtq but i am autistic and this is just extremely du b made up bullshit although it makes sense that autistic people would be willing to question pointless rules like the gender binary
if you actually look at the mental health studies buddy you and i both know you don t understand a single lick of that shit
hey it s me a trans minor who is not autistic using circular reasoning such as if you look at it in reality or even because with literally no source study or proof then it isn t a valid statement neurodivergence is not related to gender in like literally any way blaming hyperfocusing in autism and other mental disorders on the cause of transgenderism is ridiculous and they tell you youre a boy youre a girl quote only time i ve been told what gender i am is by people trying to detransition me nobody forced me into something never heard of a case of such but i have heard of plenty of harassment from people towards my trans bros and sisses and to me directly that can be taken as attacking such as literal death threats physical threats outing threats currently still closeted and of course plain ignoring also this is coming from a literal sexual predator and a conspiracy theorist so i m taking this with a gallon of salt i don t like it when cishets try to explain the existence of me without knowing anything about the existence of me
if ur ideology is so fucking good why do u have to constantly advertise it op
this dose not suprise me they been blameing us for years for almost anything
i thought he had autism this whole time man was i wrong
lmao the music ain t bad
lol that leftist taking friendly fire with the water

i just visited my local aut gallery it was nice
all of these people at the events are completly autistic hahahahhaa gotta agree on this one
i don t know if this is true but i have noticed that a lot of the people i ve seen on fb who identify as nb or other things often have autism in their bio as well i suppose they could be self diagnosed
most people aren t ready for that conversation unfortunately
anyone who believes in fairy tales about god s is at least a bit insane or a grifter
you can feel like the pronoun stuff is nonsense that biological men shouldn t compete in women s sports and that kids shouldn t be attending drag shows where performers are dancing provocatively whilst also knowing that people are entitled to do whatever they want with their bodies and the right wing use the trans community as a distraction and drum up hate by constantly reporting on a community that makes up such a small percentage of the population
well there has been numerous studies showing the overlap it isn t a game
is it wrong that i think both people are crazy
yes
if you actually look very strongly i have to hope you did that on purpose
did you just point it out and turned it around at them in one comment
lots of people are saying big tough guys looked at me with tears in their eyes and said sir
i don t know about that but i know the guy in this video aint seen pussy except for on the internet
joe biden
deleted
you forgot the s right
hoping for an s here
i just posted it to get opinions man and i m here to not really challenge anyone s opinion but more ask questions to get a better understanding
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770077/
fr
not all drag shows are provocative
wasn t the provocative drag show with strippers set up by two straight white republican ladies didn t that happen literally once and they whole lgbtq community is disgusted by it
i ve never seen anyone overuse and incorrectly use that adverb like trump everything he does it s done strongly
no but i can see why you were confused low cognitive ability https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alex-stein-troll-sexually-harassed-162549960.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alex-stein-troll-sexually-harassed-162549960.html) the dipshit in this video is alex stein and he is a sexual predator he is also a grifter a con man

ha yes i m being sarcastic i won t add s but i will make it a little more obivous
ah yes the classic i m just asking questions that s not at all just conservative concern trolling in bad faith to frame your shitty unsubstantiated views as questions instead of statements
i m autistic and am perfectly fine with what i was born with and i m straight
dont think it will ever stop ether sadly gotten use to it by now
there s not just one instance
i m pretty sure they were pointing out that you used the exact same phrase you were criticizing
dude fuck the s that is so bullshit i mean half the joke is mystery of you being serious or not the s is lame o
thanks for verifying it tho
lol it s really not that deep bro https://youtu.be/obfubbhize4
i have like two friends with aspergers one is gay and one is straight
yeah that s how it be mane but i mean if someone is doing something odd it s probably because they do have a mental illness
i wasn t aware of that where did the other ones happen
lmao yeah i took it so personally i spent an entire seconds typing a single sentence response to call you bad faith and stupid i m literally seething right now
asperger s is an outdated term
there is a huge spectrum of mental illness you will never pin it down can defently say that towards the trump supports to i do doubt lgbtq are all mentaly disabled though think thier upset over thier lack of rights and the fact the goverment is ignoring issues these people are just claiming it is cuz they stand behind the idea that autism is worse then death can we please stop getting blamed for others actions when alot of us just wanna live
if i have it i should be able to use that term right
i just don t think it s fair to say i m on the spectrum because i don t know how to communicate with new people in person
how can you have something that no longer exists asperger syndrome isn t recognized as a medical diagnosis anymore
what wait how dose that apply to this conversation i am talking about trump supporters blaming autism being the cuase behind things when its not what are you on about
lol autistic apparently
and your point its not uncommon for people on the spectrum to have issues with socilizing
lol i just thought you were autistic too lmao i thought you didn t like autistic people being blamed for the rising number of trans people lol i didn t think you meant trump supporters
i m not even japanese you idiot lol
nothing like a bit of racism to start the day
everyone take notes from the guy in blue every single time you see behavior like this we all need to be the guy in blue
good man stepping in like that kudos
i love this woman s energy tho
jesus he looks similar to the beat your dick guy https://www.reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/comments/iots7u/the_worst_turn_any_threat_could_take/)
wonder why he assumed they were japanese
ty to the bystander for stepping in and being a good guy
i love that man for saying sorry to her for what she s going through it helps her get through that trauma of someone denying your right to exist with racism a little better as she goes home
the good thing is old racists like him will die out soon it won t end racism but it s definitely more prevalent in his age group from what was accepted in his lifetime good riddance
that woman is awesome
i like how the other dude came over and was like i speak a little white nationalist lemme see if i can communicate with him
sammy hagar has really let himself go
man bizzaro einstien is way more of a disappointment to humanity than i could have imagined
is that the guy from the vid saying he was gonna beat a guys dick off
as that bystander i d have a hard time not pulling him out of his car and throttling him well looks like i m going to jail today boys
what an arse
i love the i m not even japanese you idiot totally completes the racist outburst video
why do i feel like this is the burger king crown plane guy
i love that lady
she was about to end this pigs life before a good guy stepped in
what an angry old jew

dickhead with pent up stock phrases aiming blindly
you re not my mother
nice car loser
hair dude is a weak ass bitch
jesus when did the garfunkel hairstyle make a comeback
he s wearing a clown wig hee hee hee
funny he looks exactly like the burger king crown airplane guy
you re not sons than me
that loud as fuck you re not my mother has some serious mommy issues behind it
ngl i laughed when he said they are gonna bomb hiroshima lol
i know i would say the same thing in that situation but that guy will never in a million years give a shit what type of non white you are
agreed
i was thinking this as well
sadly they tend to breed another generation of racists we just have to hope as a society we are able to show those kids that they don t have to follow their parents beliefs
ageist
hurry up and diiiiiiie already
i was just having this conversation with my boyfriend it doesn t matter to people like this all they see is not white racists like this think there s two countries in asia and have no care for where anyone actually is from just whether or not they can spew hate it s not only disgusting behavior but it really shows those people s willful ignorance
doesn t sound like him though
this isn t an individual person or parents problem racist societies breed racists
oh i agree with that i had a weird childhood as i spent my youth in the south then spent overseas in japan and england what i found is there are racists literally everywhere and it s so sad i honestly don t know the solution as it s a mindset that s bred in an echo chamber
there s no solution it s a product of a person s own sadism half of humans are sadists imagine a scale one side is pure altruism the other side is pure sadism now consider that there are more than seven billion people in the world naturally they are all evenly distributed along that scale roughly half are on one side and half are on the other racism is simply tribalism adapted to modern society racism is hurtful to the target mentally and emotionally sadist derive great pleasure from hurting people in anyway they can get away with most sadists don t want to risk going to jail so instead of enacting violence they enact racism because it s not against the law in most places to say hurtful things to people sadists are simply using racism as a way to legally hurt people
in thailand the thai really hate the indians and miramar people so i agree it worldwide
idiocracy was a documentary

shame the horse didn t kick it into the next country
time to put down the dog and charge the owner criminally
in america that dog would have been shot
that dog was really chewing hard i wish the horse would ve broken that fuckers jaw
any animal dumb enough to keep biting the ankles of a pound quarter horse deserves to have their head stoved in
hey guys it could have easily been a golden retriever okay my pitty is the biggest baby every pit bull owner ever
dog needs to get shot
slag chet nannied reddit is really helping me up my slang from other countries from the comfort of my favorite sitting chair
lots of questions here why didn t the other cop do something why didn t they gallop away or was it too dangerous for that the horse was well behaved while being attacked as in i d expect it to bolt regardless of training it s under attack at the same time people will want to intervene but also not want to be attacked badly themselves
original news story https://www.the-sun.com/news/7699113/dog-attacks-police-horses-park/amp/
is that a golden retriever
pibble kisses that horse got really nannied
dont intervene horses are like lbs and can kick a good sized dent into your head
also the police riders are fucking unless as well poor horse i would have gotten off and done something about the dog
shoot the dog
so i started blasting the cop
i have not seen a masculine display by a british man in a long time their men have been castrated long ago officers and several men afraid of a dog what a shame
as horse i would no longer trust my rider and the other policeman is as useless as can be unbelievable
can anyone explain why didn t they just run off with the horses the horse could easily out sprint the dog then someone could grab the dog or why didn t the other copper dismount to do something
why are police still on horses it s not anymore dog owner is an ass obviously edit no really cops have absolutely no reason to put horses in harm s way
the cop couldn t get off his horse to help it or even his partner just sitting their watching it play out isn t think all cops in the uk carry guns but surely they have a stick paton and maybe a taser
fuck them and the horse they rode in on
or the owner
dude
for what its a dog wich genius decided to bring a horse to a dog park its like bringing a steak in a lions den
rightfully so and owner charged
nope it got stomped https://youtu.be/n0umpawluwa)
honestly that was fantastic police work neither of them could really get off it risks the horse getting out of control and there are lots of people around one of them gives space whilst the other tries ti maintain the horse as best he can then they verbally communicate with the public even saying now someone be brave and grab the dog moments later someone finally takes a chance and stops it we should take a second to commend that horses are huge animals and when they get frightened then can easily accidentally kill the rider or nearby members of the public
that actually happened in tampa florida during a parade it was a homeless person s dog
no why bring a horse to a dog park a dog has hunting instincts
i ve comment above but i ll just reply to explain how i see this the horse being attacked it s under massive stress if he tries to force it to run it could end up meaning he gets thrown from the horse the main task his if focused on is staying in the horse the second horse it s watching another horse be attacked if you know these animals they are very easily frightened even police horses are still horses getting off that animal without a safe space to tie it up risks the animal doing damage to the public in the area whilst you try and stop the attack all they could really do was wait for backup and try to get members of the public to help i think it was very well handled the dog should be put down and the owner should be fined banned from owning dogs for some time imo
update on urbane https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-horse-attacked-american-bully-29645064.amp
well according to the shelter it s a lab boxer mix escape artist requires large fenced in yard no kids or other pets
must be a chihuahua
it s a macrochiwawa
lab boxer according to the shelter plus pibbles are likely illegal there
you are a horse on reddit neigh that can t be true
speed is your enemy on an out of control horse rather to be bucked off going zero mph than at mph on a bucking bronco
lmao no way they re gonna make a horse run full speed in london that s mental might as well drive 90km h on oxford street
or the owner back to turkey was definitely a racist comment https://imgur.com/a/0xppzg3
yup i m proud to call out a racist asshole racists are pigs who deserve to fuck off thanks for the shout out
whoa what a racist and ugly thing to say i hope your parents are proud of raising a bigot
you re quite sad please find a therapist you should have better things in life to achieve than hate millions of people you don t know
never seen a turkish guy with a pitbull
no it s a dog
that s a police horse in a public regular park what even made you assume it was a dog park there isn t even a fence or any other dogs running around keep your dog on a leash in public space
it s just a park you silly cunt
a normal dog doesn t instinctively jump at a horse dumbass modern dogs aren t bred to fight shit several times their size i d understand if it was something like a small cat but horses nah that s on pitbulls that fucking horrid ass breed no other dog is bred to jump at things like bulls
tbh in america the owner probably would have been shot too
i remember that video it s crazy these dogs try to go for horses
oh it was handled well considering the circumstances even the horse showed restraint to a degree i was just saying here i ve seen people go straight to killing the dog
tf it s a regular park any dog park i ve been to is an enclosed area also the damn dog should ve been on a leash
so when i toddler is with his mom and dad in the dog park with a dog and another dog thinks yeah lets fuck this kid up so the parents are fault cause its a dog park and a dog has hunting instincts this dog is fucked up put it down and safe possible victims in the future
you call that hunting instincts are you kidding me it s a police horse it goes where the police go pft
it gets way worse with the owner defending the whole ordeal https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/officers-seize-dog-attacked-police-29535872](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/officers-seize-dog-attacked-police-29535872) niyazi told mailonline that the incident in victoria park hackney london on wednesday has been over exaggerated he later defended the dog and said she was intimidated by the horse and felt threatened kind of incident had never happened before he claimed adding that he know knew not to take coco off a lead what a pos why isn t he being charged with a crime for having a dangerous animal off a lead
reactive also
neigh that can t be true but it is true i have a very large keyboard
ostensibly the rider knows how to control his horse and should be able to gallop under control seems like that should have been an option but i m not a horse rider and i don t know how capable a shod horse is on pavement and maybe asking them to gallop would require more traction than is available
there it is can t hide from the internet
woooow
to be clear for anybody who is reading this nubile coder posted that the dog owner should go back to turkey and then edited the post to make themselves feel better they also claim they re left leaning so they can t be racist what a cool person
this exchange kind of reminds me of the video that was on here of the two migrants stealing a disabled person s mobility scooter where the woman behind the camera said take that back and then go back to your own country in other words you can t come to our country and steal we won t tolerate it https://www.reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/comments/125g1tq/two_men_steal_a_scooter_get_a_tellingoff_from_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) the comment section was divided with half saying she was racist and the other half saying she was expressing a genuine non racist request likewise you can t come here own a dangerous dog and then fail to intervene when it attacks i m relieved it was only a horse that this dog latched onto what if it had been a toddler here s a direct quote from the owner of the dog redacted owner s name criticised the have a go hero passer by who stepped in to help using a long stick to keep the dog at bay the guy was rude said redacted who has had coco for around a year i was so angry at the time he said i didn t do nothing i tried i reciprocate energy if you re rude to me i will be rude back to you the guy is a complete knob i wasn t trying to be racist in wanting the guy booted from my country if he has this attitude and allows his dog to do this in our parks it was more just to piggyback off what u violentcrapper had said about wishing the dog had got booted out i was saying yes and the owner along with the dog
perhaps this user s comment https://www.reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/comments/125g1tq/two_men_steal_a_scooter_get_a_tellingoff_from_a/je4lzw5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) from another video better sums up what i was trying to say my point was that it would be great if the dog got booted out the country by the horse and its negligent owner who allowed the attack to happen it was nothing to do with the owner s race just to be clear also i really don t appreciate the find a therapist concern trolling
deleted
don t blame the entire breed blame the shit stain humans that a created the breed to be what it is today and b do a terrible job raising the animal causing it to be mean and aggressive garbage humans are always the cause if a person jumps over the fence into a tiger sanctuary and the tigers maul them to death we don t blame the tigers though it s real shitty that they usually euthanize the animal in many cases if i owned a king cobra and i let it out while a guest was visiting and it bit and killed them no one would blame the cobra for being a cobra pitbulls aren t born and then make the decision as a puppy to become aggressive killer animals no the scumbag that abuses it it s entire life is to blame torture tease beat and or starve half to death any animal and they ll become aggressive and dangerous let s be completely honest so would you or i if we were raised in such a way besides the fact that the vast majority of instances like this video the dog breed in question isn t even technically a pitbull usually the breed is a staffordshire bull terrier or some other similar breed pitbull is a common misnomer i d be willing to bet most people have never even seen an actual pitbull
many dogs were bred for hunting i d bet they all jump to attack if the animals bigger have you ever seen how a dog attacks a person
pit bulls are viscous inbred dogs they don t think
yeah needs to be charged and banned from owning any animals
shelter s like this sweet baby just keeps managing to find his way back to us let s see if this time we can t find him his forever home for the last time for real
hi please could you stop i find your behaviour to be quite harassing you ve already compared me to a cow and told me to quote get fucked pig my point as i have probably made numerous times now was that i was not intentionally trying to be racist another user had said they wished the dog had got booted out of the country by the horse and i was saying yes and the owner along with it please leave me alone now thank you
oh shut up you racist cow none of your explanation makes any sense and racism has no excuses get fucked pig
lmao the hoops a racist will jump through to justify themselves
anybody can racist you just proved it congrats
so why did you make it about race nationality then
had an instance in my neighborhood a couple years ago where a pitbull mauled a toddler to death along with the grandmother that was watching her this was the family dog they had for years these dogs were bred for the intent purpose of bloodsport they are not guard dogs they are designer dogs at this point the only reason anybody would own a pitbull is for the perceived status symbol that they are so the old adage goes you can take the dog out of the fight but you can t take the fight out of the dog
they regularly maul and eat their littermates they are in fact born aggressive it s the breed
there s a difference between hunting dogs and fighting dogs a hunting dog usually won t do a whole lot without its owner a fighting dog like the bull terrier the pitbull and the modern designer breeds the bully xl and the abomination known as the toadline bully they re all known for a bulky appearence way too much force and a specific type of bite yes the hold n shake is a thing exclusive to the pitbull can you guess what all of those have in common they re desired traits for taking down a big animal like a bull or a horse and most distinct thing is pitbulls don t even have exceptional bite strength instead they were bred to have this weird bite method that only causes more damage this can t just be hunting maybe wild boar but what would you need a hunting dog for in the 21st century it s because they re not known for being particularly good hunting dogs but for being fighting dogs and sadly dog fighting still exists
the thin skinned racist got their feelings hurt how tragic have a wonderful day
you seem entitled to think anyone would sympathize with a racist you said and the owner back to turkey not yes and the owner along with it that s the edited version you re not being harassed and yeah you were trying to be racist also stop trying to justify yourself instead try to better yourself
you knew what you were doing
nah it does make sense who gives a shit what race the guy is if he really has come from another country to conduct himself like this he should head right the fuck back nothing racist in saying that
do you want me to edit the comment and remove the reference to kicking the owner out of this country and back to his own i rewrite it to just kick the owner i m happy to do so i was not trying to be racist my point was person comes here allows dangerous dog to attack others u violentcrapper says it s a shame the horse didn t boot the dog into another country and my point was yes and the owner along with it that was all
how a pitbull bites is irrelevant to what i said you said normal dogs don t jump to attack i just came in to say a dog jumping to attack isn t strange nice small essay tho
do whatever helps you sleep at night xenophobic asshole

people always give or throw the magnet back and try to leave then are furious when he tosses the same magnet on their car those break pretty easily so just fold it in half toss it in the back seat and wait for him to put another on repeat it s literally ron swanson with vegan bacon
cant blame them people who leave their carts in spots suck
i heard it summed up before that putting your shopping cart back in the corral is the perfect litmus test if you re a decent person because there is no reward or punishment for returning it or not it all comes down to if you want to put the effort out there to do what we all know is the right thing and put it in the corral as to not block a spot or roll off and damage a car or leave it in the spot next to you after reading these comments i ve come to the the conclusion that most reddit users are not the most considerate bunch
easy pickens
strong gay guy on roller skates from reno vibe with this one
i hope i run into these guys some day i d ask for all their magnets try to cover every square inch of my car
publix has good chicken
fuck that truck lady using autism as a jab loser
she looks likes she s in her 50s but talks like a teenager lol
he s going to get shot one day
this guy is pretty obnoxious though l
it s just a small thing you re exaggerating you should have taken the shopping trolley instead of fighting the customer
her kid is definitely starving now
who has time for this shit
he sounds like he looks like this
i purposefully leave my cart in a space just hopping this guy comes out to get me
texas is the last place i would mess with the lazy bones
he speaks like a south park character i love him
i don t understand why these people don t just drive away ya i would probably be annoyed depending on why i would decide to leave a cart out like that but just go free magnet my guy can t get much free these days
uhh the carts are my life ma am i fucking lost it
lol the girl at the end trying to be tough only to be rubbing her nose constantly at the end trying to figure out where she went wrong she was much more enjoyable than the crazy lady in the beginning
we got a for with this one
both of these people are super embarrassing there s no way something as minorly annoying as a left behind shopping cart should escalate into a weird magnet standoff and screaming fit at publix the guy slapping magnets is a total self righteous dork and that lady is really unhinged and yeah i want a chicken tender sub on multigrain
florida
yet another person with the blue plastic protector on their hood ornament can t unsee it now
it astounds me when people get so riled up and angry they forget how easy it is to just drive away man keeps putting things on my car drive away for five minutes then remove bumper sticker person telling me i m doing a bad thing and won t leave me alone drive away
cart narcs forever
cart narcs doing gods work
i always love these videos because you can immediately pick out the lazy people
how is this man still alive
this just exposes how manic and on the edge a majority of the population is if this was me busted as i ve been known to leave the cart but usually will put it back but i d just laugh it s funny how do people have zero sense of humor and immediately go into melt down mode jesus lady get some meds
i understand what he s trying to do but he also seems like a virtue signaling asshole there s better ways to get your point across
bruh get a job
florida people are the fucking worst as if i need more reason not to visit that hell hole
do not get near me as she charges at him
kids gonna get shot one day he s got a point but damn at what point do you just give up for your own safety
as someone worked as a courtesy clerk at grocery store and did carts i respect this guy people will come up with every excuse in the world to simply not return a cart typically it s old ladies who pretend they can t do it as well just cut your grocery store workers some slack we re literally always open and make absolutely shit money
let me guess shes the first one to say those people that get paid to collect the carts shouldn t get a decent wage to do it
people love to try to be the victim she is trying to twist the narrative here when she is at fault
i like this guy
god damn this guy is beyond annoying at this point
this dude is one those youtubers whose gonna get shot for doing these annoying things
as someone who used to push carts i really could care less could care less that it s an unpopular opinion but this guys videos have annoyed me for a while very much a double edge sword scenario where nobody is right but really does he have nothing better to do other than instigate people in busy parking lots he seems like more of a hazard akin to the public prank trend maybe i just have other things to worry about than a cart
i have to preface by saying i also get annoyed by people not taking their carts back but i also have to recognize that this guy is intentionally making them angry and then blasting them on the internet for what not taking their cart back to me it comes off more like he s also an asshole and just takes joy out of shaming people publicly rather than being someone who s actually trying to raise awareness
okay she sucks but this guy is immensely cunty about the whole thing and quite obviously just doing it for views likes
getting kinda tired of this guy much more things in life to be concerned about
he sounds like the love child of randy rainbow ned flanders
this is just sad to watch like honestly a lot of these videos on this sub are as infuriating as it is that people leave their carts all over the place and regularly do equally inconsiderate shit this woman is clearly upset about something else she is clearly going through some shit having a hard time with something and lashing out i didn t watch the whole thing because i honestly got tired of it agent karen probably went overboard chasing after her and trying to stick shit on her car several times at that point you re just putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation for no reason other than shits and giggles by fucking with someone who is clearly in an emotionally volatile state it s not that funny to laugh at someone getting super upset after you intentionally antagonize them over and over again when they re clearly already having a shitty enough time
am i the only one that kinda hates this dude
i spent most of this video trying to place this woman s behavior into the pantheon of leaf drivers i ve known and never succeeded i d expect this of a tesla driver but a leaf
this guy sounds like cartman
i love this guy the carts are my life
i might not put my cart back to spite this guy
cart narcs videos are amusing and sometimes depressing imagine getting this mad at the guy who just ran up to you going woop woop wooopity wooop lazybones expend more time and energy fighting cart narcs than they would simply returning the cart
this guy has no discernment
how is this guy still alive d
this guy needs a better hobby obviously his passive aggressive method is doing more harm than good just causing chaos over carts
i m not antagonising you i m trying to get you to react well good job buddy you got what you wanted then
as someone who retrieves grocery carts for months this guy gives me so much satisfaction nothing good came from leaving your loose cart in a parking spot for it to roll and hit someone else s car is he excessive mayhalps is he entertaining hell yea
this is one of the better episodes
this guy gives the worst lamest batman we never needed vibes
that s harassment i m sure he has been kicked from multiple businesses
this guy is the ultimate troll
i hate this guy so much he says he s not antagonizing but that s literally all he s doing i think simply calling people out for not putting the cart back is good enough to follow and throw stuff on people s cars is too far
i ll say it again doing this is dumb one day you ll run up on someone who ll just pull out the all because you had a point to make
as a person who pushes their carts in those cart spots fuck cart narcs can t stand them
this is cartnarc on youtube shit is hilarious although i think its pretty stupid of him to do just take your carts back lazy
waiting for the driver that runs him over and over and over and dumb shit has a deathwish in this culture he ain t a hero he found a niche and this antagonism is for clicks and lawls
is that a nissan leaf should this go in r nissandrivers or r evdrivers
what an idiot
alternative title asshole harasses people and faces the consequences
don t defend yourself ma am they pay people to do that just call the police instead of assaulting strangers
i keep a vigilant watch for this guy in the hopes that i can someday go viral throwing a tantrum about my cart and i do not imply any sort of sarcasm in this statement
but the thing is about this guy is that he doesn t give a fuck about the people who have to go get the carts or the people who can t get into a parking spot because a cart is there he does this for money he found a niche idea to monetize on youtube this is his job
shopping cart
is there any videos of these guys getting beat down lmao
i imagine most people just ignore him wild that he has this much time to spend on shopping carts while the world around him burns to the ground
person doing this has major little sibling vibes
publixfreakout
typical day in florida
why are you so angry well i didnt take my meds today
hi this is mr garrison with the cart narcs
it s coming it is likely he will die or get severely injured from this wrong person wrong day type thing it is entertaining to watch i hope that someone is able to get his camera and post the one where he gets shot or run over
the fact that he does this in florida is extremely ballsy
spot the british person in the group
weep skeet weedily whoop that s not where the carts go
why doesn t anyone just slug this guy in the mouth he keeps approaching her when she s clearly told him again and again to leave her alone at that point it s assault defend yourself and hit this dumb motherfucker p s don t start with the lazybones bullshit these idiots aren t helping anything they re harassing people for views just like any other asshole irl streamer
yeah this is a lady losing her shit over such a small finger wag of her laziness if i were in that situation but i wouldn t because i always take my carts back after having stray one ding my car i would ve of driven a little further away from him and as he s running to catch up to me taken it off and driven off this woman is so far gone that i d be more concerned she s now going to have an accident on her way home

it has been all down hill since tbh
you need to apologize bush needs to be trialed and locked away
why are you booing me i m right
bush needs to go to jail cheney too
please keep this reposted also for tony blair here in the uk for friends who served and lost for the iraquis who died for living at home and who continue to die as a result of the lies
what a shameless country no wonder why they support israel same dog different leash
this dude ain t wrong
completely justified public freakout
what was bush s response
someone had to do it god damn
he s not wrong
damn
i m gonna play devils advocate here sorta i don t know if bush knowingly lied i would fully believe it if cheney and his advisors lied to him and he just went with it because he s stupid not to say he s not at fault but he never came across as a big decision making man
oh this guy again mike prysner a member of the party for socialism and liberation the party that supports authoritarian dictatorships around the world the spouse of abby martin another famous tankie who hates the west the tankies always repost this loser it s getting boring https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_socialism_and_liberation https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_prysner https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/abby_martin
but can we talk about how i was a month ago years old when i found out obama and bush have had serious ties since obama was a baby his mom worked for some org and connected to the bushes way way back then and boom obama is president i didn t know y all i didn t know
deleted
similar thing happened to pelosi
got the ball rolling patriot act sealed the deal
dick cheney pocketed a cool 33b off that war we need to get him too
it blows my mind that americans let that man and cheney live any semblance of a peaceful life after leaving office and now i ve seen both dumb liberals and anti trump republicans try to white wash his legacy some how trying to gaslight everyone that he was not worse than trump don t get me wrong trump is a monster but he is the product of the legacy that the bush administration left behind and all the institutional decay and cynicism that was kicked off as a result of bush and his entire admins false pretenses for sending troops to iraq and the overall deregulation of the economy not to mention how in the living fuck does one admin in terms take a billion budget surplus at the beginning of their time in office and leave it with trillions in debt that alone should have had people surrounding his ranch with torches and pitchforks
yeah i hate trump but bush is a straight up war criminal
his response sit down and behave yourself he never once admitted he was wrong or that the entire war was just straight up money from war
no man it s common knowledge they weren t even enriching uranium or anything i work with quite a few iraqis dude they don t even have electricity in a lot of areas it s a fucking third world country we invaded them killed their people and it was all based on lies
nice seems pretty cool thanks for the info
ok but the message is still solid
you support jailing people for free speech
and this restrict act will bury it
it blows my mind that americans let that man and cheney live any semblance of a peaceful life after leaving office the number of american soldiers who died in iraq is miniscule and manufacturing the bombs that killed iraqi children created valuable jobs in shitty rust belt states i guess that s how the reasoning goes
i ll be honest i m and growing up in american during that time has destroyed all faith i have in the system they way it judges and punished people and the irrefutable undeniable truth that our country is a master hypocrite condemning others then doing exactly what we say we are against anyone that can t see that from afghan and iraq all of those places we were and had no business
common knowledge is an uncommon virtue i get what you are saying but on the other hand don t underestimate a place just because they are a 3rd world country i spent years there while in the army and can tell you i was honestly surprised at the ingenuity of people that don t have first world comforts

looks like competitive recess
when the peasants spend their time fighting each other the oligarchs sit back and laugh their asses off
people who go out and support trump have serious mental issues and need medical help and a straight jacket
what do you mean trump would take bullets for these guys
ya wanna talk about people getting paid
ask the central park one of them just took a full page add out to comment on trump s arrest as well
there is quite a few blacks for trump there i can god am guarantee his racist ass doesn t give any fucks about them
you can t reason with stoopid people as they have no ability to talk rationally
magats are not about rational thought or discourse they are all ginned up pitchfork simpletons they are morons who literally line up to be grifted they would crawl thru broken glass and shit to get their bias confirmed it is only productive to debate maybe of the us population the rest cannot do it they have zero training so protest march counter protest and fly your freak flag but don t think there is any change happening here
damn do you also patronize black people and tell them what they re supposed to think and how to properly be black and how not to be a traitor and sell out their race you just witnessed blatant racism and cheered it on
this comment can be screenshot and put in a dictionary for the definition of psychological projection everything you said is an assumption based on your feelings i m sure there were people marching for social media clout and wrong reasons but you know nothing about this lady your word choice is very telling in the way that it appears that you believe any white person who believing that injustices exist feels superior to the black race empathy exists in the world despite what you ve seen heard empathy does not equate superiority complex go outside and interact with other cultures you d be surprised how much we all have in common
yeah shame on her for standing up to people that think a wannabe dictator should be president if my eyes could roll anymore from your inane comment they d roll right out of my skull
do you own a mirror
he doesn t care about his white supporters either just ask those who were convicted for their actions on jan 6th who thought he had their back
was he a racist before he was president
you can t reason someone out of a position they didn t reason their way into
they just drag you down to their level and beat you with experience
these black s for trumps folks are those guys who get paid to show up at places right one of them men looks familiar
u firm_complex718 s comment history is hilariously moronic
your amateur psych eval equates to i am rubber and you re glue you didn t capitalize the descriptor black did you miss that part at your racial sensitivity seminar i bet you listen to and sing a long with rap songs that contain the n word but because you don t used the hard r you don t feel like a racist i obviously struck a nerve with you to thine ownself be true smell yourself
are you the person in the video
yep he would shove his sons in front of hailing bullets to protect his ass he cares about one thing and one thing only himself
yep his own actions prove it and even his niece has said that racism was normal all throughout their entire family
you took the time i am touched want to hug it out
doubling down on the projection and assumptions i see
great come back did you think that up all by yourself wanna give the troll comments another go i ve got faith in you buddy
you sound like you re down with these guys what were they trying to get the woman to say
when you know you know
they look like they re just having fun with her that s really all you can do when someone comes off as that much of a psycho

the wasn t a beatdown that was a slapfest also r firethecameraman
well he was outnumbered like to so just jumping to conclusions here but i doubt he gave the beatdown i m pretty sure he got the beatdown
why he hit curtis
friday night sissy fights
i need context
dancing is just a way for him to get closer to the one he wants to beat up hahahaha lol
i could hear natalie even with this muted
is that drake
we know things that man cannot dance he skips leg day
one of them all dudes clubs huh
not how i remember black widow
i m so confused
fights you w rizz
sly enough but how come nobody can throw a punch
didn t see a beat down
they had the same energy as my two house cats fighting over that prime couch spot
is this a dance battle or a dance attack
that escalated quickly and fabulously
this looks like a zeus production i see curtis and natalie i think the one with the mic that s shorter is mula i can t tell but i def peep curtis hear natalie and her chin through the blur lol
who goes to the club wearing that
oh yes the classic duck head and windmill arms maneuver
more like a slap down lol
slap slap slappitty slap
handbags at dawn kind of fight
dance like a lady slaps like a bitch
reminds me of the chappelle show skit with the gay boxing the tyrannical teabagger
pussy shit
even though i read the title i did not expect this
smooth criminal
bitch fight
meanwhile the entire building is burning down because doucheface knocked over three hookahs and now there s burning coals all over the dance floor
what a bitch
drake
his boyfriend was cheating on him
r unexpected
song
that escalated quickly
nahh hell nah
a little seduction and a whole lot of ass whoopin

i know you wanna party yeah party just for free yeah girl you got me dancin girl you got me dancin dance and shake the frame ooh this is america

missed his leg day
is that nicky fro baddies west
ignorant people
prince naseem is that you
naww it s like watching bunny rabbits fight

that s a common reaction from listening to too much chris brown too often
thug how are you gonna assassinate that fool thug don t worry i googled how to assasinate and learned about this sultan who got assasinated by a sexy belly dancer he won t suspect a thing
what in the love and hip hop and going on
click r3 joystick to lock on enemy

nahhh camera man had to hop in and help out bro
it s better than r donthelpjustfilm tbh
these gays are trying to kill me
mathematically speaking of course
and i didn t see curtis hit back once lmao
i love it
omg finally i can share my completely useless knowledge on these people the people sitting at the table are reality tv producers reality tv entertainers security etc they re not filming i think in this video but when they are it s also constant fighting and arguing shows called bad boys on the zeus streaming site as far as why the guy danced up and punched the guy who knows anymore they re all just obnoxious people who make money off stuff like this i doubt this is staged but definitely normal behavior for them
hooka bar karaoke slap punches lgbtq vibe that s all i got
reality show nonsense
you know i wasn t there but i m willing to assume the context you apparently need consists of the man dancing not liking the man he hit
i run la
that s what i was gonna say he really let himself go
very perceptive indeed
lol crimson chin
hurr durr because gay

what on earth are all those metal detectors for isnt it safer if everyone is armed s
scumbag cops they will brutalize anyone just tell them to x200b oh except if it is a fellow cop they won t do that enforce a mask mandate nope selective they are shitty people and how fucking obese is that fucker going up the stairs at jesus

is storming the capitol becoming some sort of hobby in the us
awww does that make you swwwaaddd
i hope tennesseans remember this fiasco when it s time to vote
it is but the group of insurrectionists there are against guns so they dont carry them that makes everyone unsafe hence the need for metal detectors
they were asked to leave the capitol and they didn t not leaving after being asked is the definition of trying to destroy democracy i have heard that everyday from the only source of news i trust so please dont disagree with cnn msnbc and the new york times or you will label forever as a democracy destroyer denier
we are supposed to think this one is a good storming
no actually them trying to overthrow the election was destroying democracy
because it is
and so is impeding government business using fear to get your way is a seditious act
and so is impeding government business oh so like refusing to perform their constitutional duty of voting on supreme court nominees
have been charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states obstruction of an official proceeding and entering and remaining in a restricted building attackers actions did in fact impede and disrupt the orderly conduct of government business and essential functions language similar to the seditious conspiracy statute this is what was written about jan 6th protesters and rightfully so sounds a lot like what happened in tennessee
does it there were attackers in tennessee who died
oh thats the only reason someone can and should be charged with trying to overthrow democracy is if someone dies i didn t know that i stand corrected
wait so now impeding government business is overthrowing democracy how long until you call it a holocaust
yes that how all my news channels i watch labeled the jan 6th and rightfully so and im glad those same news channels are labeling these people in tennessee the same way
good for this guy title is misleading
i love that you can hear the protesters in the background the whole time
has the vote happened yet and if so what is the outcome

fuckin douchecanone asshole
what the actual fuck does this have to do with that atrocious hag marsha blackburn
the title had me confused
happening now jones out and johnson in
nothing he s referring to marsha johnson d that narrowly avoided expulsion for things she didn t do
ask op
yeah isn t marcia blackburn a republican
yes and a entirely different person lol
guarantee that guns weren t allowed in this meeting and there was probably a metal detector at the door
will teachers school be liable for incidents that are sure to happen
lol you know those people we treat terribly pay poorly and don t respect enough to pick the books they use in class let s give them guns
what do they vote to do if a teacher carrying a gun shoots somebody
don t y all have guns tennessee republicans diablo mobile meme
are they being paid extra to risk life and limb to fight a shooter no then fuck off
next up arming the students let those good six year olds protect the class from the bad ones
so what happens when a faculty member accidentally leaves their gun in the bathroom this has happened it was found by a student who thank god turned it in but next time they probably won t be so lucky it will also be exciting to see what happens when a armed faculty member gets in an altercation with a student are they going to draw on a student there are way too many what if s
the party that thinks the solution to stop abortions is to ban abortions also thinks the solution to stop mass shootings is to introduce more guns makes sense
wasn t the police response time like minutes on this shooting what logic says joe soap with a handgun would have effected a quicker better outcome against an ar gop have crossed all the way into cartoon supervillain territory at this point
so teachers will be put in the position of potentially killing their students students will also be put in close proximity to more firearms make it make sense
it s not the teacher s job to protect and serve that s another duty that belongs to the city or county to protect the teacher and the student doing their jobs most of us grown ups never ever thought of a gun in school as a kid i never did and i grew up in houston in the s we had the rent a cops but no military style shit nowadays nor bs in local government proposing this god help us all
this is just excellent now if they have a school shooter they can blame teachers for not being armed or they can blame the armed teacher for not acting if in some wild ass chance an armed teacher stops a shooter they re going to parade it around like they have solved the problem then what happens if there s a shooter and the armed teacher accidentally shoots an unarmed student or two who s liable
america is beyond being a joke at this point
in the usa we love guns and are indifferent to the murder of children
new schoolteacher ai about to drop like gif giphy pnghlljucezce
but like teachers having to buy needed classroom supplies they ll have to buy their own guns training bullets and tac gear
school shooters will no longer be required to provide their own guns
what s the response going to be when a teacher ends up shooting two kids for getting into a fight arm the students as well
pro life party
god this country is a dumpster fire i am so embarrassed what this nation has become letting children little children be killed and not do anything to stop it what pieces of shit
gop doesn t serve their constituents they serve their pocket books
i m from tn and never voted before because i hate all politicians and both the left and right but i m most definitely going to try and help vote these dumb fucks out i m that fed up with it
so what happens when a group of nervous terrified individuals armed with handguns are scattered throughout the campus i e not in classrooms what happens when they shoot at first sight of someone else with a gun they aren t trained in negotiating an active shooting scenario what if there are multiple shooters like columbine what happens to substitute teachers will they be expected to be fully trained and licensed in firearm safety and combat training are counselors now going to be certified to handle this level of trauma and who will handle theirs which out of shape yr old do you want to be this good guy with a gun the ones with arthritis so bad they either can t pull a trigger at all or their hands already shake so much they almost look blurry what about scared staff and or students trying to get in somewhere safe what if trigger happy teacher blows them away in defense of their class are school staff going to now have qualified immunity too how far does that extend then bottom line if the problem is people are getting shot in this environment we don t want anyone to be shot in this environment ever the solution simply is not we will add more guns into the environment staff will now have the ability to arm themselves they do not have to tell other staff members if they are armed at any specific time it starts with we are only allowing them to carry weapons if they really want to it will too soon be staff will either be trained and certified so as they may be armed when on campus or will be replaced with an appointed peace officer
republicans just keep moving the abortion goal posts if it s not after weeks before birth it s weeks after
how are police going to be able to determine the shooter from armed teachers
if mass shooters targeted politicians instead of children gun control would pass yesterday
there is zero proof that having armed staff at a school helps there is a study that shows schools with armed guards had a higher amount of deaths they also have a slew of other unintended consequences shooters often know the layout of the school most dont think they will make it out alive and account for the armed staff staff had guns at the nashville school shooting and that clearly did not stop the shooting here is a list of gun related incidents from armed staff at school https://giffords.org/lawcenter/report/every-incident-of-mishandled-guns-in-schools/ my personal favorite is a teacher s loaded gun falling from his waistband during a cartwheel
buncha fat old white dudes ofc
just awful
you can also marry your first cousin in tn so we shouldn t be surprised
wow do you think at any point these folks will look back on history and realise the answer to their guns problem was not more guns
republicans are fucking sick
they don t trust them to choose reading material but they trust them with guns i just can t wrap my head around republican ideology it s almost like there is none
there s only a few options here either a crazy teacher shoots a student a student messes around with the teacher s gun and shoots someone else a panicked teacher empties a mag at an active shooter but misses most of their shots and kills a student a teacher kills an active shooter and the police burst in and see the teacher holding the gun and shoot the teacher or murphy s law takes the day off and there s only one dead active shooter thanks to a teacher who is way underpaid overstressed now has ptsd and will need therapy for years to come i know most teachers would probably do a lot of things for their students and dying might be included but killing should not be on that list
it won t take long for a mentally disturbed kid to get ahold of little ms johnson s gun
teachers were carrying guns at the last shooting
united states is so backwards that they d protect a piece of metal than to protect kids
why do these legislators keep putting themselves further and further within our anger do they think their money makes them bulletproof
unfortunately they ve already cashed their checks from the nra so your opinion doesn t matter to them
dumbest thing i ve ever heard so stupid these people are clueless
these politicians know that multiple people in the school were armed right and they didn t stop shit
america is such a fucking stoner cartoon of a country i feel sorry for the normal people who have to deal with this backwards ass shit all the time
republicans are fucked lmao
i see teachers on this sub going bananas and breaking down weekly because of the students lets hand em guns that s really smart
we can t even trust teachers not to sleep with students you think giving them a firearm is going to help more than anything else
armed trained cops at uvalde and they did nothing wtf is a teacher going to do
the lady s argument is that she won t carry a gun because she loves her kids but won t shoot them
republicans have a huge hero complex they believe that anyone with a gun is going to jump into action and start to hunt a shooter in their heads they re the hero of their own made up stories as a ccw holder if i were ever in a situation like that my primary concern would be to use my firearm to protect myself and my family i would definitely not be heading out with my firearm to hunt down a shooter and accidentally get shot by the police or another ccw holder
we have a gun problem the answer more guns
teacher with gun teachers dressing in plain cloths cops shows up shoots teacher instead of the gunman that s how this will play out
don t trust teachers to select the books in their class but you trust them with guns riiiiiight
why would the teacher shoot her students
republicans leaning full tilt into crazy before the election do they think this is going to help their chances if so they have finally reached peak delusion
this is only gonna get worse
the thing that gets me is the nashville school had armed faculty it didn t stop this shooter
your politicians bought and paid for by the gun lobby
what s more important access to firearms or the lives of children those are your two choices
i don t get the outrage no one is requiring the teachers to carry it s just allowing them to carry if they want to it s just giving them the choice
all i am really saying is that they don t really care about us mj
i hope the teachers union demands more pay for this go on strike
these same people voting to arm teachers are the ones who vilify them the rest of the year and paint them as unqualified to even teach children yet they expect them to properly handle a firearm in a crisis
lol people of tn acting like they haven t been enabling this broken system of government for years suddenly they re getting eaten up by it and now it s finally a problem let s see if they actually vote against their beloved republicans
they need to teach with ar 15s slung over their backs with an rpg tucked into the corner of the classroom just in case and if all all else fails just set off the claymore at the front of the classroom when the shooter walks in
all they care about is staying in power and money this kinda thing won t change unless something very drastic happens and if school shootings aren t drastic enough to inspire change i hate to imagine what will
worlds gone fucky
can t wait for a kid to have easier access to firearms s
let s give underpaid teachers even more responsibility lol this is so fucked
and none of it will matter because republicans do not care about human life
america truly is the country of band aid solutions never actually tackling the underlying problem
when a republican thinks of a child killed by guns they see themselves depositing a fat check from gun lobbyists
i will quote a comment that i read recently if guns make america safe we should be the safest country in the world but we are the least safe from mass shootings almost daily
see you tomorrow is a great end to the video house and senate have full session tomorrow where democrats are on the docket to be expelled from the house it s going to be a madhouse definitely recommend watching here https://www.capitol.tn.gov/)
vote em out
remember how the government was supposed to be for the people if you have a room full of booing you might want to consider your priorities as a lawmaker
we need more guns more guns in the schools more guns in public let s keep throwing guns into the gun problem that should solve this fucking idiots yeah let s throw more gas on the fire that should stop it rolls eyes
idiots get elected when idiots make up the majority of people who get off their couch to go vote
fuck the morons who would allow guns around children or in educational settings pathetic
so they rather give them guns instead of better pay lol bro these politicians aren t thinking shit through
start voting blue folks that s the only way to make real changes looks what s happening in wisconsin real changes for the better
these people are asking teachers to be murderers all so they can maintain their ammosexuality it s despicable
republican politicians are scum
spoiler alert there was armed staff at the church school according to the call ooops
you know what s funny these red party politicians won t do the same thing for their kids and the school they go to
schools can t even afford to pay for kids lunches let alone pay for a gun per classroom with a full magazine
there was armed staff they did nothing because they are not good well trained cops
can t trust them with books but you can trust them with guns
wow just wow how out of touch are the republicans
republicans live in bizarro world
someone needs to stand up at one of these stupid republican things and demand to know why guns aren t allowed where these politicians are but it s okay for guns to be around our children
there were armed staff members at the covenant school that did not stop the shooting
we are a mess
in before cops accidentally gun down a teacher they mistook for a threat
i just watched like videos back to back on my reddit timeline is that what s this called here of children beating the shit outta teachers what happens when a student beats the shit outta a teacher and steals the gun to shoot them
what about a cop seeing an unknown person carrying a gun that turns out to be a teacher
that lady has a point if teachers were expected to point their gun at one of their own students and pull the trigger would they be able to do it lives hang in the balance yes but most teachers and people for that matter aren t trained to make those kinds of decisions i don t think the majority of people would be useful in a situation that includes potentially fatally harming someone they know in order to save others heck a lot of people probably aren t okay with shooting anyone
their goal is to dismantle public education this is just a step to get more parents to pull their kids out of schools so they can claim that no one wasn t to go to public school anymore with that excuse they can close schools and give all the educational finds to private evangelical and for profit elementary schools
it s not a matter of if but when eventually a teacher will get pissed shoot a child i ve seen so many videos here on reddit where teens are up in a teacher s face screaming taking swings etc no matter what someone will die
then what you gon do when the shooters become teachers or when the one student gets too disrespectful
ah yes teachers have been signaling for the last few years how high stress their jobs are and the resentment they carry let s totally let them carry a bunch of guns no one s gonna to snap and teachers are totally more trained than the last group people security guards polices towns elect to do this job
guy in the mask sounded like he was half a second away from saying rappaport is gay for wanting to suck his dick but had to catch himself because of the audience

straight up what fucking moron shows up to engage in blac bloc tactics when they are happy with a situation these assholes are why i dont dive deeper into leftwing politics dont get me wrong i am an ardent socialist and absolutely believe black bloc tactics have their place in the rare situations that require a truly angry response but these dumbasses are looking for trouble in spaces where they are just causing more level heads to want to be distanced not every situation needs broken windows
you can suck my dick then i ll f ck you in the ass if he really wanted the guy to suffer he d do it the other way around
why is he so mad at the guy in black bloc
as much as i find rapaport hilarious i ll always remember the video of him bitching an someone cracks him with a snowball and tells him to shut the fuck up

it always turns into homophobic stuff with these guys but when the guy challenging them to a fight says yeah i m going to make you suck my dick then they have nothing to lean on lol then he quoted mike tyson raw af
i knew i liked mr
for posterity i believe michael challenged him to a cocksucking followed by a mike tyson inspired complimentary assfucking but maybe i misheard him
the government shoulda make a holiday or government run organization that allows ppl to beat each other legally bc honestly america needs to get it out of their system

the list is longer deniro john lennon dylan for a while joni mitchell hoffman garfunkle simon
michael rapaport well known actor from new york who has a reputation for being outspoken is arguing with some guy in a mask implying that he is an agent provocateur then we cut to rapaport being interviewed some unknown amount of time later and the guy seems to be trying to goad him on rapaport tries to call him out to an actual fist fight and then they both devolve into childish lol gay insults that s pretty much all we can tell from what s provided we seem to be missing a ton of lead up and context
yelling guy is asking guy dressed in black out on a date but he s very awkward about it
has been searches for publicity

is attack on titan good should i watch it
note how the emphasis is so solidly and intentionally on black
it looks like he s got a list of buzzwords on his computer that he s choosing from i m surprised he stopped short of selecting n
blah blah blah
i for one welcome our new black satanic communist overlords
he ran out of triggering words lmfao
big emphasis on black i see probably doesn t mean anything
i don t think jigga is a communist
i ll bet he finds dilbert hysterical
he truly believes that black is a negative way of referring to someone
it d always interesting to see the type of people that donald trump attracts as fervent supporters
christian ultra nationalist tribe
the logic is flawless and i have no doubt the facts are indisputable
bro if you re that bold just drop the n word sick of these people hiding behind dog whistles i d respect them just a little bit more if they were straight up in their views
do people really take idiots like this seriously
all these lies that america told us our whole life and then when we start getting it they try to lock us out of it he said they start inventing words like capitalist we ve been called n ers and monkeys and s t i don t care what words y all come up with y all gotta come with stronger words spoken by jay z in defense of being a capitalist this guy calls him a communist yes a billionaire communist you fucking moron

i made an immediate assumption based on her appearance that she was going to react in some way to what he was saying then i realized her skin tone and blank facial expression are actually a fake tan bad makeup and botox don t judge a book by its cover kids
he tries to make himself sound like idiot ass alex jones
he struggled to name black democrat politicians lmao also trump gave black farmers like billion and nobody gave a shit at all
you know politics can be very nuanced and complicated and there are multiple factors to consider on a variety of issues but one thing i know for sure the side that is claiming eric holder is a communist is on the losing side of the debate
this aggrieved is a convicted felon he looks and speaks like a criminal
correction he s actually orange
bruh the way he says black is an immediate red flag
it s just a madlibs word salad o o gif giphy pphyav5t9v8djyrfjh downsized
man anyone can set up a background have a youtube channel and pretend their opinion means anything hmmmmm
i almost miss when republicans used to justify everything and anything they wanted to do now it s just a weird litany of buzzwords that scare them but they couldn t define if you asked them
this dude has that small dick energy
how do you say this out loud and think you re smart
santanic
the word black has never sounded so much like a slur as it does coming out of his mouth
cause he can t say what he really means cause he is afraid of being fired because he is a pussy
balaaaaaaaaack
he s saying black communist with a capital n and a hard r he s really really holding everything he has in his soul back from slipping
they are so terrified of equality i wonder why
looks like he s reading something while talking bet his reading skills are too poor to read and speak at the same time
hail black communist satan
it s christian nationalism mad libs he s not even forming a coherent thought
he s a billionaire capitalist lol
yes
when regular ass alex jones just won t do
so he would fire himself from his own show
no he should fuck off with the racists dog whistles

it s a good thing that camera turned away because that man just met the most violent and painful end anyone ever could
i just watched premeditated murder
nono
she totally looks like that teenage girl that told her boyfriend to off himself scary af
this video transcends time language and culture pretty sure even a caveman would find this amusing
death stare
i had a jealous gf who would throw a fit and accuse me of ogling tittys on a painting for example or on tv or just accusing me of being distracted and looking over her shoulder etc that s no way to live fuck that shit i have adhd i almost always look distracted and my head is on a swivel most of the time for no reason she was a and i wasn t even interested to look at other women at that time
i understood that reference
the wrath of jodi

that stare ll give you goosebumps it s so creepy
yeah that s not cool there s nothing wrong with stealing a quick glance at someone you find attractive as long as you re not being an over the top creep about it it shouldn t matter some people have this expectation that once you get in a relationship you suddenly find no other human attractive it s a normal thing to do

and then reddit is going to call him a terrorist when he decides to fight back in the future
ehh to be fair he could have been doing something suspicious before the video started
ehh to be fair he could have been doing something suspicious before the video started so every palestinian moving boxes is now a threat how about israelis should everyone refilling a water cooler be watched too you see how asinine this is yes
yeah the dude restocking his store totally oblivious did something suspicious prior they didn t even try to arrest him anyways and one of the soldiers is pointing his gun at other people even they just wanted to beat him up he was
okay so they re right to start beating the shit out of him
because nobody s ever done anything bad and tried to act like they didn t
depends on what he was doing before the video started
bet you wouldn t have said the same thing if it was a ukrainian being abused by russians but with israel and palestine you just have to side with the piece of shit apartheid state
you must not know a goddamn thing about the idf this is their standard behaviour they don t face any consequences they beat children and the elderly and the pregnant and the sick they don t give a fuck cos there is an army of fucking idiots like yourself willing to justify everything they do
i think he was waving hello
i don t really care about anyone else s problems except for america so if your question is if i care about anyone s else suffering i d have to say no ukraine is europe s problem and they should pay the bill for it not us
lol
i don t really care about anyone else s problems except for america then stfu and don t talk about issues outside your shithole then no one wants your low iq takes
smooth brain doesn t understand that promoting democracy and uniting europe is in the usas best interest
if you don t want other peoples opinions maybe you shouldn t post videos on the internet not everyone is going to agree with you snowflake deal with it
democracy lol you still believe that exists the only thing that rules this world is money and whoever has the most of it
why comment on things you don t care about
i was commenting on what happened before the video and you asked me if i cared about ukraine so i answered your question anything else you d like to ask
i completely side with reloadedammunition here the idf are trained to be aggressive because they need to be to stop suicide bombings a bomb on a bus they even had to create the iron dome to stop missiles i could go on but am not going to as a israeli who knows people who died just trying to get to work on a bus i may be a bit biased but still before calling the idf terrorist s remember most of the just turned eighteen and just are trying to save lives by stopping some that even remotely acts suspicious thank you for reading my rant and have a good day

they new yorked at them until they fled
get the fuck on up outta here bitch
that is what everyone should be saying to all divisive media companies all the way to the border imo the influence of the news has made it damn near impossible to have an intelligent conversation about anything of importance people watch a poorly written minute segment on tv and they are instant experts it s so influential that you can usually pick out someone s news drip within the first few seconds of talking it s almost as if people are putting brand names on their emotions today s broadcast was brought to by fox anger available in every flavor of vanilla you can imagine
next on fox news antifa forces honest newswoman out of park
this should happen everywhere they go
come on hurry up get on outta here bitch lmao he sounds like a chappelle character
turnabout is fair play
these protestors have absolutely no respect their voice is even louder than the news anchor
omg i love ny
so there are actually consequences to blatantly lying for years and pushing a narrative that hurts working americans huh i thought they d just keep getting away with it
brings such a smile to my face when s tuckner s turn
good comparison of left vs right protesting left annoying but peaceful right she would ve been assaulted by some proud boys dickhead
lol i love new york
normally this might upset me but fox news has earned this
having it in ny where it s hard for rightwingers to brigade in their fucking uhaul trucks and overwhelm locals is fucking great just the icing on the cake they thrive on deception and always loved to puff up the numbers such as with orange losers inauguration the empty stadiums during his campaign runs and the five figure showing at the million maga march before jan 6th the inflated theatrics emboldens every brainwashed nutjob watching at home who think s they re legion
stio hatung each other get on outta here bitch
i love this so much
stop hating each other because you disagree lol
love to see it
this is fucking gold lmao
if they just stopped lying all the god damn time
they should be hounded out of wherever they are reporting from
fox news shouldn t lie and it wouldn t be treated this way hope that murdochs lawsuit sends him into poverty
not welcome in the city they re based in well done
fuck ya
they will run to the studio and clutch pearls no reflection on why so many people want a news station to fuck off
well it s not like maybe there was a lawsuit and a bunch of discovery that show that fox news intentionally lied and misled the american people about any significant issues oh yeah that did happen
cue neoliberals whose lives aren t really at stake chastising people actually standing on the right side of history for not coddling fascist propaganda
holding a sign that says stop hating each other because you disagree while chanting get the fuck outta here x200b gif giphy tugqktkwjsxmxi121u downsized
the old freedom of speech only works for me crowd
i would start howling like a husky throwing a temper tantrum because i didn t get to go outside
well that s just awful x200b what are you having for lunch
no one deserves to be treated like that whether you agree with them or not
deleted
we need to suppress views we oppose x200b because that s an american principle lol
lol so i can t go out to east armpit georgia but you can t go to ny or cali another own the libs moment
as a die hard liberal i m not cool with this talk a bunch of shit to them but forcing them out just played into their hands as i say this fuck fox news and the shit stain on american they created
a clear example of brainwashed people who were told who to listen to and who to shout at
people praising this behaviour that s literally the opposite of the left way of thought because a bunch of proletariat is ganging up against another proletariat killing the messenger won t kill their boss y all cunts can t stand the truth bunch of wannabes most leftists are a bunch of liberal twats that think having a certain amount of basic and educated opinions such as capitalism is bad automatically qualifies them as part of the wave mind me i m not saying criticizing someone is wrong but we shouln t waste energy on such meaningless individuals she s a pawn just like the rest of us
whoa
lol was that dave chapelle in the second clip
what did they think would happen with the bs they report on if your practice is to tell people what they want to hear rather than what you know to be true you are not a journalist you are an infotainer or a propagandist fox is not a news network but a propaganda outlet eugene robinson
gif giphy wkfunyu3bqcka downsized
get up on out of here bitch

the come on hurry up get on outta here bitch with the dave chapelle white voice is killing me
yo i am dying lmao
obama on the bullhorn outta nowhere
ugk we putting it down in the mfka
i think that there should be a law concerning material facts and the word news it might make the news kind of bland but it works for other stuff if it isn t actually cheese they cant say it s cheese on the package it s cheez or cheese product imitation crab isn t crab it s krab there is no penalty or punishment or really even reason not to go on tv and just straight up fuckin lie and so many people drink it up because it s news i don t know how it could ever work because people will just yell that fact checkers are biased but it s so frustrating
i live in western pa and it s almost like some sort of six sense to know when someone is a bigot just by the first couple sentences or even by glance the amount of times i ve guessed that someone would say something racist or bring up their horrible views and then they drop a slur or tweak about liberals a few minutes later is crayz
i am old enough to remember when you could a rational unemotional discussion about policy legislation lawmakers it really wasn t that long ago now it seems like a million years ago the almost instant degradation in to insult anger voice raising means there is no avenue for discourse it is sad somewhat frightening and i have no idea what the solution is
the government approves and disapproves all subjects
it s even worse when you realize of media companies in america are owned by just parent organizations
yep dude at my gym is insufferable every time i see him its like talking to cucker tarlson in person i absolutely hate him he goes on insane rants that i would have thought no normal person would say in public
oddly vague is that you paul ryan
so if i espouse progressive views my news drip is automatically cnn i know you didn t say that but i m certain you would gtfoh with your simpleton both sides analysis
agreed there s no debating these people it s bad faith i used to think fox at least bought their own bullshit not that it made the bullshit better but at least their motives were honest now with the dominion lawsuit we know that fox fully knows they re full of shit they ll happily push lies and be divisive for a few more viewers and few more advertising dollars they really are just terrible people
i d love to walk into the homes of all the brain washed baby boomers and just point at their tvs yelling get out of here with that shit get out of here with that shit
deleted
he would never get out there and stand next to those plebeians
i expect he will run for president either in the next election or the following
so chaz was a peaceful event when they pointed rifles at news crews
harassing is considered peaceful
not always the right are usually annoying as well and they do assault the left is not peaceful whatsoever and they re annoying too heck the further you go one way the worse you are man this country s screwed
but they aren t hating because they disagree it s because they encourage rage bait programs and flirt with promoting violence to their viewers
except fox news is the nazipublican news service exactly what they are protesting fuck that boomer asshole channel and every single gop cock
sorry all i m hearing is i don t like what they re saying so that makes it ok
ghislaine maxwell disagrees with me on the age of consent and i hate her for that
always the victim
republicans stopped using that card when they started banning schools of thought you need to update your talking points before you give away the game
in what way was her 1st amendment rights infringed upon feel free to be specific
removed
fox news is the single most destructive force on american society so yes get on outta here bitch is the perfect response
if you show up to a protest that you know is going to be hostile to your platform and try to monopolize speaking time yes you fucking deserve it she could easily have done her broadcast from anywhere but there but she decided to do it in the middle of a protest people yell at protests should the protestors have stopped talking because she wanted to shoot
if you work for and help a corrupt company yes you do deserve to be treated as what you are
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/amp/ eradication of transgenderism but sure we are the ones who have to sing kumbaya and just take this shit right
yeah lemme just cozy up to the people who help promote my eradication i should just be nicer to the diet coke nazis stfu
it s a propaganda channel look at there behind the scenes messages it not about a difference of opinion these people lie to their viewers they personally know they are full of shit that s why they are in court these people don t give a shit about the news the us or their viewers they just care about their stock price
but they could a done their shoot anywhere why try to record in the middle of a bunch of protestors who obviously come down on the opposite side of the issue from you tell me what should the protestors have don t shut up and let her broadcast fuck no they came here on their own time to make sure their voices are heard and she s at work reporting for one of the largest nes companies on the planet she could have gone literally anywhere else if their volume was interfering and if it wasn t then what s the problem
get outta here pelosi
this is what they created decades of blatant rage bait propaganda made this bed no one is obligated to have a respectful silence anytime someone with a fox microphone shows up
let that dumb bitch take that footage back to fox news hq and show their brain dead fucking audience what they can expect if they show up in our fucking cities no more pussy lib shit
in other news old man shouts at squirrel
you obviously don t know shit about the left she s a class traitor she works for the capitalist machine and is out there not as an journalist but as a propagandist for the fascist movement in this country fox news cares about their capital they care about their stock price they don t give a shit about you truth this country or their viewers she was yelled over she was told to leave she was called a bitch this didn t take any extra energy fox news doesn t give a shit about the truth look at the dominion lawsuit look at their messages to mark meadows look at their covid vaccine policy it should be taken off the air
just following orders
you literally don t understand half of the words you re using you just picked up some slogans that flatter your worldview and rattle them off
lol that plus calling a year old balding white dude n a is freaking hilarious
same i watched this over and over again for that very reason
and luther worlds colliding
i heard that too lol
there was a law for that but take a wild fucking guess yup repealed the fairness doctorine then add the adelsons and the sinclairs and the other news corp families then add other influential families companies the revolving door of public and private and the lobbiests fugaze eee fugaz iii
people will still just watch the newz and act like it s just as accurate
it will not happen in america the whole point of this country is freedom the freedom to exploit people without a government stepping in to put a stop to it
it always reminds me of marylin mason s lyric god is in the tv
you cant have a rational discourse when one side says we should help the poor more and maybe have training and licenses for guns and the other side says pedo liberal jewish space lasers make the frogs gay kill all demonrats it s like arguing with a rabid skunk
this is a protest and that lady represents a network that isn t known for rational unemotional discussion about policy legislation lawmakers
umm it s been a long time where liberals and leftists kissy footed around fascists shove your pearls outta the way
between the weird facial expressions and shit he reads on air i don t know why his show isn t labeled comedy
he expected the police but then a wagner pmc recruiting specialist showed up glorious news comrade you ve just won a vacation to bakhmut ukraine
he just wanted a free ticket to ukraine
if that wasn t in russia i d be so happy to be the random guy walking by outside
maybe he had a death wish
there s gotta be a reason for this right

he stomped his own sunglasses on purpose because he knew if he bent down to pick them up he d look weak and he is not weak
he s been rehearsing this for years at his fire pit late in the night after his family has gone to bed and he is knee deep in bud lights and pine ash
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime
well thanks for ruining eminem for me
john mcafee
anytime eminem is mentioned i want spaghetti
he s been preparing for this moment since when half of you were in diapers
go king
next time you act like a jackass at the airport just tell the judge it was my fault and i ll get sued
so raw so emotional rappers dont really have instruments to break when their set is over so i guess some sunnies and a cell phone will do
sir can you please not get out of your cage
i think that this poor fella got separated from his social worker
involuntary commit
this would be better if he at least knew the words right
someone needs an aa meeting
bruh really needs some vocals training
jesus if ya gonna repost post the whole thing lol
it s not even one of the good eminem songs
eminem does not deserve to be humiliated by this lunatic
our maga assholes really trying to use eminem lyrics do they not realize he is extremely anti everything they stand for
gif giphy noc6xdyllxd3q
where is the full video of this
i didn t even need to unmute the video to know where this fucking psycho was from americans are at childish meltdowns in public places
this is exactly who i picture would listen to shitty rap if you can even call it that xd
what kind of dude wears an america shirt just for no reason not 4th of july not a foreigner not homeless i don t get it
typical eminem fan most overrated artist ever
i just lit my lighter hell yeah

guess that music does effect people i was wrong
woooo slow down there killer
airport freak outs are always something else
could see this being my old roommate when i was in the army he played this song everyday for months when it first came out
nothing comes out when he moves his lips just a bunch of gibberish
the silence when everyone looks at the phone
this is the worst friday night funkin mod ever
not at the airport man
i feel like he went to aggressively slap his shades on for dramatic effect but they fell on the floor and as the artist he is the improv overcame him
i d be the one person in the way back to start clapping to the rhythm
my guy is having a rough day i see
anyone have an extended version i saw one but forgot to save it
my question is what s he gonna wear in his next i m mad and in my truck car video now that he has smashed his sunglasses
weirdo
it s a no for me dawg
ok but this guy is obviously mentally ill frankly one of the more normal things you ll see on a daily basis in any metro area i saw a woman screaming at pebbles on the ground today
damn john stewart looking rough these days
full on qanon lunatic meltdown over various lies and fake prophecies and the storm never arrives
how does someone who acts like this even live a normal enough life to be in an airport
that s a reaction
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
could hear the pain in his voice but he knew what he had to do
ong
now it s coor s light
he blew it
eminem has been doing that since
hes alive
knees weak arms are heavy
i m gonna make spaghetti tomorrow in your honor
same lmao
just say it was eminem s fault
you have no idea what this persons political persuasion is lol
coulda been european too they mad childish
did the big usa on his chest help too
yeah we d shoot your dog here
you can t lol
yup lol
he may be psychotic but he s spouting qanon craziness which is not helping
spaghetti on his heady already
something something spaghetti
did he ever pick up his cell phone
top tier comment
coor s and mom s spaghetti
in every way possible
burn
bowties and rigatoni hold sauce better though
this is an old video and there s a longer version where he goes on to complain about vaccines and 1st amendment right infringement
i know what you mean but i think random eminem and qanon does help make the case that this guy is not mentally well not to say that what he s saying isn t harmful just that not all of his lights are on
the iphone was forever lost when the police tackled him in the extended video
fair enough then
ooh i ll have to find that extended version thanks

isn t this the guy that aired political ads made to look like an emergency alert during a legitimate tornado https://www.themarysue.com/wisconsin-gop-fake-emergency-alert/)?
i live in chicago we just had a fairly animated race for mayor i got more texts calls and online adds for dan kelly spewing the most vitriolic shit imaginable than i did for our mayoral candidates combined i have never lived in wisconsin maybe if you had ran an actually campaign instead of warning people in another state that your opponent wants to trans our children and surrender the government to the forces of george soros you might have not gotten clowned in this election
kelly s pathetic concession speech is indicative of the pettiness of his character thankfully his loss was a huge gain for democracy
you d be hard pressed to find anything more satisfying than watching a piece of shit like that hold back tears after losing
this is the behavior of a small man
its fucked up that hershal walker had more class in defeat than most republicans these days wants to be a werewolf guy
this is the new republican schtick do not concede and if you must concede do it with the last amount of decorum possible blame smear project fear for the future do anything but accept that people chose someone other than you i m so sick of these toddler tantrums coming from grownass people
election result denier denies election result more at dude looked like he was about to burst into tears and i m always gonna be here for that
my dad always said you can tell a lot about a man s character by the way they handle defeat wow what a small pathetic man dan is he can t even be graceful in defeat this is the state of the republican party the party of if we lose we throw a fit and insult my opponent
didn t he probably slander the fuck out of the other person like sorry you can t do it to me but i got you
what a chode
thank him for proving he was the lesser choice
republicans are hilarious when they lose
did his opponent say that his hair looks like a dirty cocker spaniels ass cause his hair looks like a dirty cocker spaniels ass
what a lil biyatch take the l dude it s scares me someone with such a poor attitude got that close to such a high position of power
i am very happy to have voted against him
and democrats are the ones sewing division x200b side note r conservative is not breaking down mentally like you d think they are actually discussing why the republican party is losing support they are so close to understanding it reading it this morning actually gave me a little hope today but there s always tomorrow
dan kelly needs a diaper change he seems a little fussy
whaaaa they won fairly whaaaaa now i want to insurect gif giphy lwyxf0qkejnoi downsized
worthy enough to beat you lmao
didn t lost to a worthy opponent he said bro you got walloped lol
lmao maybe don t make abortion illegal what do they expect pushing through and enforcing deeply unpopular policy get fucked republicans vote them out
in years did they accomplish anything for the people of wisconsin or did they just push corporate interests
he lost by about votes about million were cast https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-general-elections-results-2023/43421021](https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-general-elections-results-2023/43421021)
accusations of being a serial liar sounds rich coming from a career politician
gif giphy 3oesanrehgl0ru7wm4
fun side note this is the second supreme court election he has lost both to women how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
republicans super mad they can t steal the election now
i do not have a worthy opponent this was the most deeply deceitful dishonorable despicable campaign i have ever seen run for the courts it was truly beneath contempt bro stop confessing we know your campaign was rank and that you hate women that was your whole brand already you don t have to admit to it
put that preemie in an incubator quick it can t survive outside the womb for this long without assistance
cope harder
hooray to the future
i m so tired of these entitled little bitches why do conservatives believe they deserve to win everything maybe start looking at your policies and why they are so unpopular
if i don t win they cheated petulant man child
brought to you by the fuck your feelings crowd

gif giphy sbcdjsjegghgm
funny how he publicly declares her a liar but give zero evidence straight from the modern day conservative playbook he s just upset he can t force women to do what he says
ah haahahaha there it is thanks for not sugar coating the disappointment in your failure
i don t think this is said enough in polite society but that man is a cunt
hasn t he lost twice now maybe it s you buddy
dan is lucky he isn t in jail yet he participated in the fake electors scheme
my dude you lost by double digits you don t need to concede you got absolutely demolished
gee it s a wonder why more republicans are losing elections truly a wonder
typical trump defense evil
he didn t lose he got stomped by like points republicans are losing everything and it s glorious
in other words the white men are losing power and he is really salty about it
im here for the conservative tears
small dick energy
they cheated by supporting abortion reeeeeeee conservative policies don t work and are extremely unpopular so they gotta lie cheat steal https://abc11.com/tricia-cotham-north-carolina-nc-house-rep/13086628/) to shove their failed policies down our throat
conservatives are such emotionally driven snowflakes
just take your ball and go home
morals matter but trump ok ethics matter but a supreme court members wife supports insurrection
memo to dan she isn t your opponent anymore she s a supreme court justice elect and well you are whatever you are
the party of sore losers no class
fuck uline there are better places to buy office products
clearly the product of everybody gets a trophy
maybe stuff will finally get done in wi we ve been ruined since scott walker was in office time for a good change
he says his opponent demeaned the courts this from an election denier who counseled the wi gop on overturning the election
lmao you re worried about lying you re worried about the integrity of institutions and you re a republican
looooooooooooser
republicans acting like spoiled children when they don t get their way shocker
lmaoooo taking the l like a man lmao see ya bitch get your trash ass out of wisconsin what a dickhead
i m not from the us is he one of trumps minions sounds like a page from their script i lost and i m going to whine like a child wah wah wah
it s it normal for the position of judge to be so partisan i understand that s just the state of the country right now but have elections for judges always been so extremely partisan i would assume you d historically want a neutral person in this position almost every dan kelly text voicemail ad that i received has a picture of donald trump on it and references george soros funding janet i know nothing about the guy other than that trump is apparently a major part of his identity
you don t have a worthy opponent and she still beat you by points damn what does that say about you dan
trump arrested finland joins nato this prick defeated cheers all around it s been a good week
man republicans just can t deal with losing
go fuck yourself you arrogant piece of shit the people of wisconsin are done with you corrupt maga scumbags who ve been ruining our state ever since scott walker finagled his way into office go back to colorado you carpetbagging piece of shit
he used literally every speech writing trope there is how many alliterations and pauses do you need bro honestly
cry harder fascist
oh crocodile tears i d send him thoughts and prayers but fuck him he s not worthy congratulations wisconsin
lol he lost and trump lost
worthy opponent another milk toast power hungry conservative hell bent on stripping away rights for women and minorities
republicans are so easily triggered
has this guy been around trump because he seems to have caught a case of whiney piss baby
got to vote in wisconsin for the first time yesterday and it was my privilege to vote against this disgusting little bitch i m not going to post any of his gross campaign ads here but they all contained really disgusting and triggering in the legitimate ptsd related sense of the word descriptions of rape because he cares so much about rape victims which is why he wants to force them to give birth

typical horseshit this is modern journalism journalism is now nothing more than propaganda passing opinion pieces and hit jobs off ass journalistic evidence is now the standard of what was once top tier news agencies this leads to further indoctrination among aspiring young journalists and on and on it goes i m no fan of the israeli s and i don t hold any cards at all in the game they got going on over there but calling a short video clip of some random police interaction without context apartheid in action is just ridiculous it s not like this type of interaction between the israelis and the palestinians hasn t been going on for thousands of years now and nobody believes it in fact it s more like no matter what is done to help doesn t do any good and the fighting will never end because there s religious doctrine telling a large portion of them that if the war is to ever end then it is a sign of the end of times i mean come on people wake up and realize that you re just enabling your abusers to continue to milk you dry war is the money machine for the elite and by god they can always count on the middle east to continue in providing the generational wealth for their families
oh my but even that is only part of the fun because the day before and the week before and the month before year decade
i guess you wont explain why their in there with those things huh who is coming to sacrifice goats
proof please
is this pasta
fail
well you can not control a large civilian mostly population without things getting out of hand every now and then even if the israel somehow backs off the not so nice fighters terrorists would set the area on fire just cause they are not allowed to take back control of all the palestinian territories which would include tel aviv if you ask them so easy on those videos and cool words like apartheid l
oh well as long as the heavily militarized police are just out of hand every now and then it s cool i guess
isn t every israeli citizen military trained

i never wanna hear you say which backstreet boy is gay
the power of 90s pop music is unrivaled i was walking in brooklyn behind a guy blasting mariah carey on his speakers and every person we passed lit up with delight
chills literal chills guys number five hes the one that killed my brother
i m not usually one to judge other people s singing but holy crap this guy is so off it s really hard on the ears lol
this is nice i almost scrolled past but ya needed

this is a well known scam done in times square as always best to not take anything from these guys and just keep walking
the first time i took my wife to hollywood i warned her that there were going to be dozens of people trying to hand her flyers cd s and or random bullshit from homeless folk told her to just ignore them and keep walking we parked in the parking garage underneath the chinese theater and i swear to christ as soon as i opened the door out to hollywood blvd dudes came out of the shadows trying to slang me their bullshit mixtapes told them not interested and kept it pushing they followed us for damn blocks needless to say my wife was good on ever going to hollywood again fuck these dudes
the last time some guy handed me a cd i told him the truth no one even has cd players anymore get a soundcloud
two hollywood phonies tried to give me their autograph ground
keep walking you re not hurting their feelings they don t care about people they can t exploit
drop that shit on the ground and walk away
happened to me too back in in time square and i was not aware of this scam a guy came to me saying he s part of a rap collective and wants to get some credit he hand me over a cd and told him multiple time thank you i m canadian i was genuinely happy and smiling until he asked me for money anything he said at this moment big dude surrounded me and started to show me their big pile of cash my excuse was that i only had credit card on me and they even had a fucking card machine on them i handed them their cd back and walked away minutes later another dude tried the same shit but i ignored him time square was packed with people i knew that i wouldn t get attacked and it was only intimidation but it can get scary quickly
happened to my younger brother the minute he opened his wallet they reached in like animals and took all the cash like they were a bunch of juvenile and delinquent degenerates he was so these scum will happily take advantage of and or rob children minors as they see fit
bet you guys didn t know those cds were blank straight hustlin
people like this are dirt bags i ran into this in hollywood get a real job or do a better job hustling don t harass people to buy your god awful cd
had someone from nyc try this shit on me in my tiny little town i m walking along and this guy says yo i m with a rap group out of nyc here s a cd i grabbed it said thanks and kept walking he runs after and is like yo that s costs i said oh no thank you and handed it back to him and just kept moving my friend said he looked completely shocked that his little trick didn t work
came out of a show on broadway once and a guy tried to get my attention for one of these and when i ignored him he called me a racist lol
i recall one of these cd guys got in a shootout with nypd fortunately his gun jammed so he was the only casualty
only been to nyc once from a small town i felt like such a jerk just cruising past these people trying to talk to me lol
when i was like we went for a school trip and a guy literally grabbed me and basically did this to me i was young naive and honestly kinda scared so i just gave him some money and left as fast as i could
got scammed like this one time they really know how to take advantage of the awkward people who love to avoid confrontation me
well he did ask for a small tip whip out my dick
this is a classic nyc scam the proper course of action is to say no and move on
oh my name it s quetzalcoatl yeah my parents were hippies
they are scamming people because they force them to give a tip in exchange of their signature even though people don t ask for it
that the evolution of the friendship band scam
pretend to be deaf
has some dude in vegas try this he handed it to me and i said oh free thanks he said and i repeated free right thanks he too it back and walked away
i love the voice at the end to avoid talking to people you don t want to talk to don t talk to them lmao
they no thanks me no no inglish i don t speako inglis batroom ant bear
happened to me in atlantic city i thought they were passing out menus or something they handed me a cd i took it and went to leave they harassed me until i gave them dollars
this happened to me in chicago i told the guy that i would listen to it and if i liked it i would come back find him and pay him as i would normally pay for a cd he had no answer to that haha
im a turkish guy i know how they fool tourists in istanbul guess same everywhere
i tried to continue walking before and they corned my girl these guys are fucking an i mals
i like ken
they make sure to outnumber the poor tourist too
reminds me of dipshits in new orleans
this happened to me during my freshman year at college the credit card company got me when they had a booth set up on campus
ha had this exact thing happen to me this part of times square blows
no eye contact and for goodness sake don t buy tickets to attractions from anyone on the street
they do this shit everywhere my friend got hustled in venice and had to pay and half a pack of cigarettes while i just walked right past them
happened to me and my friend when we were like we walked by them and she ended up grabbing the mixtape tried to give it back but they wouldn t take it got really mean ended up paying bucks and the mixtape sucked
happened to me in las vegas very pushy
worse than third world tourist hustlers
this happened to me years ago in union square the guy signed it and wrote to gravyontoast i was trying to be nice but just handed it back to him turned and left he yelled at me for a few seconds and moved onto his next victim fuck these assholes
had this happen to me in january actually was walking by and they handed me a cd i just grabbed it and kept walking they tried to make conversation with me as i was walking away like thanks for not being intimidated by the black guy where are you from as i m walking away i answer them and they continued following me and said can i sign my autograph it s my cd i didn t respond and just kept walking when they realized i wasn t gonna stop they just said let me get it back let me get it back so i gave it back to them and just kept walking
i ve lived in ny my entire life in the off chance that someone can t tell that i m not a tourist based on how i m weaving through the crowd faster than everyone else my go to line is do i look like a fucking tourist
they re called bullies
when i was a homeless guy was selling his cd s at a gas station in denver with one playing on his boom box i felt bad and gave him for one that thing was blank as fuck
ken you re to polite
got change for a quarter
i had the same thing happened to me in downtown seattle i m like years old new to the downtown life when he handed me the cd took look at the art and the track list for the album he demanded i pay him dollars for the album once they smell you scared it s over they will hound your ass til you give them something
they ve been doing this for a couple decades now pretty much ever since they started being able to burn cds you haven t been to nyc if you haven t had someone try to force you to accept a cd then try to force you to pay for it when you try to be nice and give it back the only answer if you unfortunately accepted it when they handed it to you is to put it on the sidewalk and walk away
i ve seen this at pacific beach in san diego the guy greeted me by exclaiming it was hug a black guy day
only thing free in the streets you get is aids
luckily i don t think cd scams will be viable much longer
they need to get rid of all these fuckers elmos batman monks jumping dudes fat naked chicks fuck em all
i had a dude on santa monica pier once give me a flyer of his social media handles telling me to look out for his upcoming mixtape and then asked me for a donation i told him i had nothing for him and he snatched the flyer out of my hands i fuckin lol d
ugh they do similar stuff in european countries i hate that it s started here too
while it s not this type of scam i remember being caught in another type at times square a few years ago i didn t even realize it was a scam until mid way i was visiting nyc with family at the time we were just strolling along times square when some performance thing started to happen we stopped to see what was going on that was when they started pulling a few of the audience to participate in their show my brother got pulled in and while he initially refused they sort of forced him by dragging him to the center we were honestly trying to catch a bus but was told it ll be quick so we waited well the performance was taking longer than we were hoping so i signaled to my brother that we gotta go who then relayed it to one of the guys from the group that he has to go so they ll need to find someone else from the audience we thought they d be cool about it nope they told him that their show wasn t done yet and that he gotta stay until the end of it my brother and a few others who were also dragged into it protested it but the guys were like nuh uh we re almost to the best part at this point we really had to go or we ll miss the bus so my dad approached what looked like the leader of the group and explained that we really needed to leave know what the leader said he said well he can leave if you pay up dollars my dad was like no way in hell we re paying for that but as my brother and dad tried to leave a few of the members started shaming my brother to the audience that he s killing the show and booing them out they even were blocking my brother from getting out there was a bit of a scuffle and i forget the details but eventually my dad ended up paying them because they just absolutely refused my brother from leaving we ended up missing the bus and nevertheless that experience left a bad taste in our mouth
happened to me in hollywood one of the trashiest places i ve ever been
these tactics only work for banks investment firm and insurance companies
had a dude attempt to chase me down to an atm when i was doing this scam once he kept trying to drag me into an alley scarred me as a kid
ugh i don t have a cd player playa
i am from new york you never engage in conversation you just walk away i guess this guy didn t know
tourist rule number do not take anything from go anywhere with strangers especially if they know you are a tourist
i had just done a huge purge of my tiny little apartment downtown and this pushy mf was trying to gift me his cd i had just gotten rid of every cd dvd vhs and cassette in my apartment and this guy wants me to have his cd he called me a racist i just said no thanks and kept my hands in my coat pocket and went into target when i came out he had found a family of tourists who were paying for selfies with him
dude got me and my moms one time on the drive back home popped that bitch in and it was blank there goes my dub
tip for people visiting nyc fuck these people on the streets fuck the clothes handbags all the bullshit merchandise these are not new yorkers visit the museums visit the wtc and the intrepid fuck these bitch ass out of townes
toss it drive away
lmao tell him get the fuck out your face and keep moving why are men so timid nowadays lol fuck you and your cd
ppl still carry cash whenever i have cash i try to immediately get rid of it either by spending it or depositing it cash is a liability imo
deleted
has anyone listened to one of these mixtapes and was actually good
it s the same as the flower scam goes like this here s a rose for you oh that ll be
why not just jail them antagonizing people or something like that
that nah nah nah pick that shit up buddy at the end is where my cool would end and i d bark back
similar thing happened to me visiting nyc years back i was walking around manhattan with my y o daughter we happen to walk by a group of guys and they asked if i liked hip hop i did do so i said yes they asked my name as i continued walking by and without understanding or thinking i told them one of the guys writes my name on a c d and goes here you go hip hop hammeredallday and at that moment i knew i was screwed i ended up giving the guy as i didn t need any hassles with my kid there another guy tried to jump in and i was like nah not dealing with this twice i still have the c d but i have never listened to it i keep it as a reminder that there is always someone hustling and to aware and prepared
this exact same thing happened to me and my wife in hollywood i almost got my ass kicked by a group of them for refusing a tip i ended up giving him a dollar and throwing the cd on the ground
glad i bought my copy of walking in city s for dummies years ago
some real bitches out there with weak game reduced to strong arm bitch moves had a cd shoved in my direction my little boy elderly mother at times square said i m good fucker ask me at least shake my hand so i won t feel like a slave said i m good fucker said what s up with that l a hat said i m from california we kill people like you out here and out the crowd others bitch ass fuckers add there cents all while noting cops are all around probably why them soft ass bitches felt secure talking shit for refusing to buy a whack ass cd with weak ass bars over puffy bum beats
i remember having this kind of thing happen in hollywood this guy was passing out cds of his music handed one to me and asked for a donation i thanked him for the cd and but had no cash on me so he snatched it back and walked away without a word
is he admitting that he devalued it by autographing it
i had a dude do this to me at a mall once they didn t get forceful they just kind of handed it to me then asked for money i gave it back and said no thanks
lmao ol ken gave them way too much time i love times square though these are like little side quests with amazing npc s
they do this is las vegas too assholes tried it with breast cancer awareness wristbands
i got his by this as a teenager at a local gas station in illinois the cd sucked
had this in hollywood dude tries to get me to take his free cd i said i didn t have a cd player ended up having a second conversation about how i actually don t have a cd player blew his mind shook my hand and went off to the next tourist
this is like the entrance to summer fest in milwaukee
seen this in vegas too
had this in san francisco guy signed a cd and handed it to me claimed he was supporting skepta at brixton academy the following week i was so naive i thought he was giving it to me so i said thanks and started to move on which he did not like proper snatched the cd away from me like it was some valuable thing lesson learned that day just keep walking
this happened to me they tried to separate me from my family
when we were there back in we gave to a guy who claimed he was raising money for his cousin s funeral he got pissy with us and told us that wasn t enough mind you it was strictly a donation nothing was given in return on more than one occasion we turned people down and they literally tried to force things like fruit snacks into our hands it was fucking mind blowing
always ignore these people dont even make eye contact with them just walk away same with the dudes in like batman spider man costumes as well they will come up to you and they will be relentless about getting a picture taken and wanting money
one guy did the same thing to me hope he found another guy with the same name as me
i kid you not i was in times square one time the man forcefully gave me the autographed album i didn t want nor ask for i didn t tip him obviously and he s like i ll just take that right back and snatched it i was like wtf just a weird ass interaction lmfao
part of going to the city you live you learn
new yorker here it s a common scam along with the fake monk clipboard and candy scam that they claim their raising for their school they are normally at times square but they re near javits center when ever comic con or any other convention is around they hand you their cd claiming it s free but as soon as you grab it they ask for your name and they sign the cover and ask for a donation or tip don t engage and walk away if you grab the cd place on the floor you will get called out by saying don t be afraid of black people or something
also a tactic on hollywood blvd aka the tourist trap
they do this in downtown san diego and probably many other places they d go away if no one gave them money but they re out there regularly for a reason
who has a cd player these days
that s why you tell them you are a local and keep walking
the one time that that happened to me i gave the dude quarters told him that it was all i had they left me alone as fast as they had appeared apparently if you only have coins they ll leave you alone
someone tried to do this to me in new kingston jamaica don t accept anything handed to you on a street
was this years ago
tucker looks like he s sporting a toupe
look at how much tucker gets off on the attention no matter what s being said about him he genuinely doesn t care about the truth as long as it s about him true delusional narcissism
he s got skin that goes directly from his collar bone to his chin interesting
tucker should pull one of those jussie smollet scenarios and hire me to be one of the guys who kick his ass
the weekly repost
i don t get the mindset of these tv quacks and i like that i don t get it if i say something rude or inciting to my wife a coworker my kid family etc i feel like an ass for days this dbag does it daily to millions of ppl and causes actual violence and harm with his dog whistles and straight hate
oldie but a goldie
i would like to buy this man an adult beverage of his choosing
like this narcissistic piece of shit cares what any self respecting person has to say about him heh he probably had a hard on from the attention he received
he was unfazed controlled his emotions and did not engage you can learn a thing or two from this
i would like to run into carlson in the wild like this
as soon as he touch his chest that dude should of clocked him
he is right
no lies told
this is a couple years old now maybe even pre covid that was before tuck got really crazy even i don t know how he can go out in public
i wonder if tucker s daughter has finally figured out who he is he seems super embarrassed for her to find out
idk dr faucci is way worse than tucker
if you consider tucker carlson to be the worst human being known to mankind you should be thankful for the amazing first world life you are living
what s his russian bankroll
so glad to see this
dan baily yelling at someone in dan baily s
wasn t he with his family at the time i get you hate the guy personally i can t stand his views on support for ukraine but there s a time and place for this stuff
clown
honestly tucker would have an iota of my and every other democrat s respect if his face was tonging trump s prostrate in spite of what trump said about his wife
don t know how tucker carlson or the man confronting him is interesting

still dont own a tv and i still dont understand why people get worked up over somebody with a tv show nobody knows who tucker is or what his show is like nobody watches the garbage on cable tv
what s up with tucker s neck
tucker narcissist he is a me me me me me kind of guy in a nation of me me me me me people truly an icon of modern america
ah liberals the epitome of tolerance
what did he do just wodnering
i ve watched tucker carlson and i was born in he s interesting and you can actually find value in some things he speaks on at least from my experience although i m not politically bias i know he s favored by conservatives and hated by liberals just thought i d add something a little different since the vast majority of this comment section seem to hate the guy like the guy in the video confronting him
july
yo i thought this was destiny being confronted
the guy did a great job staying calm tucker did too most people would have gotten angry and given him a head butt
yes long before jan 6th long before the election he s only gotten worse
hmmm i thought it was a toupee this whole time if it is his real hair he at least most definitely dyes it
it s a coping mechanism mommy didn t hug him and he wasn t masculine enough for his dad s approval or attention
yup just like that saying about wrestling a pig in the mud
just like trump
he could start a go fund me to choose the person and double his wealth overnight ok triple
but tucker bad
what is there to not get humanity unfortunately isn t known for favoring morals over money bad people will do anything if they get paid
was hoping it would be a new incident
i ve fantasized about it
you forgot the s on that
if you find yourself defending a dipshit on reddit you should be doing something else
wow and he wasn t wrong years ago
how ppl can put money over morals that was my point i don t get it when it happens and i m happy that i don t understand it if i did then that would make me like them
he doesn t get out much like this anymore he s _very_ insulated
how much do you trust me yes
give them all the money to just stop
at the mark i thought this was going to be a magic trick where the person got smaller and smaller and then he was ending up holding just a little box or something and the person had disappeared
this is so interesting i wonder their relationship i like to imagine they re both homeless and met on the street and have been like siblings ever since idk why but this reminded me of the aladin movie g pos
i can t stop laughing my stoned ass off at how the little dude just turns into a perfect ball and somehow doesn t get his head scraped every time he s swung down straight up cartoon like movements lmfao
in this video a kettle bell morphs into a human
man you can even see the bystanders reach to catch the kid on impulse when he s tossed into the flip some amazing talent here
that was scary
anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety anxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxietyanxiety
r nextfuckinglevel
this is by far the most fun type of child exploitation
the world has so much talent and skill and we build systems in place to keep them down we are all losing because of this fucking sad i wish those kids well
that was amazing
damnit how many times did i tell you to stop tossing your little brother around

lol only off by
he was a really good journalist in his early career sad to see this
taibbi used to have credibility but it s long gone
this was fantastic
jfc
matt s remaining credibility was absolutely destroyed mehdi hassan and john stewart are the only two people that seem to be able to conduct meaningful interviews
caught with pants down
oof matt i m not a rich man but i will contribute to your sound confident when speaking education fund
that dude s so beta
deleted
fucked him up you can see his brain hurting that is journalism at its finest
matt isn t actually off mehdi is misrepresenting the number of samples provided to twitter as the actual number of tweets that were flagged the million number is accurate https://twitter.com/mikebenzcyber/status/1644111356709289993](https://twitter.com/mikebenzcyber/status/1644111356709289993)
i always ask this question when i see him online wtf happened to matt taibbi i used to read his articles back in the day and they were very good he s lost it
i just watched the preview if that s the highlights that will be one boring interview the biggest gotcha is a couple dates and a typo
nah i didn t see a weiner this comment made me go watch the video
so you love his misinformation because you love the guy and followed him for years the fsck kind of logic is that
is this matt s mom or something damn look mrs taibbi this isn t a political post as you imply though judging by your post that seems to be what matt s goal was with this story i am merely watching one man absolutely destroy another man s journalistic integrity on a live video in which he falsified at least three pieces of info in a news story
ahhh yes this guy has all the answers lets trust this guy and ignore his status as a frequent contributor to the joe rogan subreddit
russia no coincidence the guy who lived and worked as a journalist in russia and wrote about his anal exploits of young women suddenly in starts to parrot the kremlin lines and goes full trumpy
i admit i kind of forgotten all about him and this is all new to me i remember liking him on bill maher back when he wasn t a complete waste himself
characterizing it as a couple dates and a typo would be like calling me murdering you a disagreement regarding future plans not technically wrong but you see how that would be a useless characterization of the situation right just a lil date make the whole claim impossible unless time machines exist just a lil typo changes his claim from potentially concerning to laughably irrelevant
his reported number of flagged tweets was only off by a few million what s the big deal
frequent contributor to the joe rogan subreddit spoken like a true blueanon it is irrelevant elon musk is a giant pulsating asshole but he allowed journalists access to twitter emails and we saw the horrific amount of censorship demanded by the government the fact that does not bother you is amazing

this coming from a guy who wants to change the judicial system in israel so that he can never be tried again
what a joke
firing missiles from cities into israel and using families as human shields isn t too civilised either
israel turns next month i give the palestinians another years before i suggest they give up and move on not sure why they think they can do better then ukraine vs russia if they were going to win they would have done it by now
armies are not made to be moral they are made to win battles wars combat they are made to be violent and kill other human beings any way they can his statement is just stupid and a oxymoron
people still use this stupid argument you re too old to say such crap
oooh he said it guys he said the word
let me remind you that france claimed algeria for years guess what happened and needless to remind you that at the time just like israel france had advanced military compared to algerian revolution but at the end you know who won and beat the invaders because they are the land owners
yes but the french have france israelies only have israel or you want all the jews to return to the countries they came from some of them are very hostile to them
remind me years when i m dead
france at that time said there was no algeria yet at the end they couldn t hold it forever as for the jews people are hostile against zionists not jews there is jews everywhere in the arabe world even in iran btwn the arab leaders never represented or got electrd by the people they are always imposed and supported either by the west or the east russia china to keep their interests in line for them in the area and they fuel the hatered to stay on power

terf issues aside this person is a violent rapist who raped women trying to get into a women prison by saying theyre trans if i was a woman in that prison id be terrified knowing theyre there that alone is cause to not let him have his way i support trans rights but this is both ridiculous and obvious there is no way they should be allowed to transfer because womans lives will be put at risk
it was a silent protest with a sign and they have a point in this specific case get some perspective
so is it the man that raped and murdered several women and during his trial he identified as a woman or was that in the uk and this is a different person either why this is a valid reason to protest edit who are the terfs in this situation
this is a stupid fight for a horrible person pick your battles let this one go
these women are in the right
i mean can t say i don t support these women guess imma terf
there will be new types of prisons soon i m sure one for trans men and for trans women and who knows what else a couple of years ago they sent a trans man who identified as a woman to a woman s prison and women became pregnant
this is a weird one you think it s between the protesters and dog lady but some other people come out of nowhere and just tear shit up i have no idea who is the true asshole in the video
terf
was she murdering women
use your guns
does this person have a penis
deleted
california is so doomed
good
that was awesome fuck all terfs
put him prison with lorena bobitt
not guna lie if i was a lifer in a women s prison and i had some violent offending rapist trying to play dress up and get near me and the girls ide make sure we made our life sentence counted
who is this person
you do know that prison guards are notorious for raping women in us prisons and that women have been known to rape other women right if a woman is sent to a woman s prison for raping or killing another woman are you going to be just as worried or outraged that she s housed with other women in a woman s prison
the women holding the sign are the terfs
easy enough solution make it females prison and males prison problem solved
it was near me in nj it was women
i remember that story because it was absolutely wild and preventable didn t the prison also pay for them to transition afterwards or was that a different one
right dog lady was genuinely shocked at what happened she seems sweet
yeah why wouldn t they want to keep the person who raped and murdered a bunch of women out of a prison full of women
based on this video don t they have one of the strongest economies in the union
last time i checked southern conservative states were the ones with the worst trends when is the last time you visited louisiana or mississippi
fuck all men that rape and murder women then try to pretend to be a woman so they can get into a females jail to continue their vile behavior
so you re in favor of men using violence against women who have different opinions
yes they are trash
the guy who says hes trans so he can rape women in a womans jail they re protesting his transfer
a woman can t get another woman pregnant nor do they have a physical biological advantage
for protesting against a male who raped and murdered women being transferred to a female prison because they identify as a woman now edit i m not trying to insinuate that you agree they re terfs i m just genuinely confused on why they re being called that
fuck you for false use of the term terf btw
cus they believe its transphobic and the rights of women not to be raped dont matter
shhhh little brain needed to parrot his spoon fed talking points just nod pat them on the head and say that s so cute
they are number four in the world for gdp
well obviously but that s not what those women are really there about they want to erase trans people because they feel threatened by trans women
i m in favor of violence against fascists terfs you should be too you ll be next once they re done lying about and attacking the trans community
does this person have a name i don t remember hearing about this the way you said it at first led me to believe this guy was referring to one of the attackers in the video
if it s someone who is post op transgender then they can t impregnate either yes there are plenty of women who are bigger and stronger than other women and do have a physical advantage over other women women harm other women in jails and prisons all the time it s ridiculous to try to portray a male to female transgender as somehow more dangerous than other women in a women s prison some of those women who are killers and rapists themselves if this really is a male to female transgender then they are at more risk of harm being put in a men s prison honestly people are carrying on way too much about this transfer
trans exclusionary radical feminists they re transphobes like you are who refuse to accept that trans people exist and misgender them just like you are
that s the title i got from the video from twitter who are they then
isn t that largely because of the entertainment industry though if you moved the hub of entertainment to anywhere else in the country would that change the ranking i m just curious
thats exactly what theyre there for though are they not protesting against violent men being put into prison with women seems like thats what the point was from the video or do you identify as some mind reading guru that can read thoughts through a video
you have a child like ability to reason
fuck his name fuck that dude
b but i m sure it s real i saw him in the field defending the corn from crows edit if it is a real person and not just terfs getting rekt then yes do not put that monster in a jail with potential victims depends on the state but i think they still go by sex in all jails nationwide anyways let s all be smart online
of course not every single women is of equal strength i never said so but it is well established scientific fact that males are on average much stronger and actually males are statistically more likely to commit violent crimes again another studied phenomenon i never said there weren t violent women just that women are much less likely to be violent the percentage of violence rate that is serious i e level women men serious violence related misconduct rate code for women is per and for men it is per indicating the female serious violence rate is only of the male serious violence rate https://www.bop.gov/resources/research_projects/published_reports/classification/oreprharer.pdf agree to disagree because i think this is a perfectly valid thing to be concerned about especially when the people incarcerated cannot fight for themselves
since when did asking someone to elaborate something automatically mean they re transphobic that s a reach
regardless of whether you support or don t support trans you can t argue that this person whose history is of violent crimes specifically directed at women being moved into a place filled with women isn t something you should be suspicious and think twice about
so you have no actual reason to call them terfs and are just defending a serial rapist because of the word trans i m sorry your life is that empty that you need to support a man who raped and murdered women
this isn t an acceptance issue it s a safety issue i support trans rights but i do not support unsafe conditions for women this murderer raped and killed multiple women and is saying they identify as one and now want to be transferred to a woman s prison as someone who was behind bars myself i would never feel safe with this decision stop calling people transphobic for wanting to stay safe
any rapist should be treated as such and should not be in genpop in our jail there s a whole segregated unit with rapists pedos and baby killers
people like you and these assailants who throw out blanket insults regardless of the situation or context set trans rights back far worse than any terf could ever do
lol
gif giphy xttps8x4waawy
that he killed three woman is just a side note you need to protect a serial killer because he suddenly identifies as trans x200b coocooo
bigot shortening people to refer to them in shorthand is bigotry reported
not gonna lie bro that sounds pretty gay
unidentified individuals unless you consider twitter to be a reliable source
tech farming tourism also play a large role
it could very well be but like the old saying goes if my grandmother had wheels she d be a bike lol
you must not be paying attention to this group
ok have a good one bud
misgender them just like you are reading comprehension at an absolute bottom of the barrel low among reactionaries
idk how saying we shouldn t misgender is supporting the choices this person made i don t support caitlyn jenner s ideology or decisions and i don t misgender her pretty wild how you choose not to understand the difference between not being a bigot and giving support to someone i m sorry your head is so empty you can t produce a thought worth the runny shit i just took
i wish you d stayed there so i wouldn t have to read your reddit comments tbh please get arrested again
lmao how much air duster did you huff before coming up with this moronic comment
same
i m not protecting anyone i m saying bigotry is bigotry no matter who it s leveled at but enjoy seething due to your poor reading comprehension
to women not wanting men in women prisons is that the group youre referring to i mean thats going to be most people kinda strange to want violent raping men to be in prison with females but then again its not surprising you do seem pretty unhinged maybe youre one of the men these women are worried about
so someone should care about the correct label of a serial rapist murderer now i guess monster isn t good enough we have to be nice to people who give zero fucks about killing someone bc someone in their moms basement is gonna flip shit if we aren t if that s the case then this world truly deserves what s coming
would you be fine if she was kept at a male prison
also your caitlyn jenner reference doesn t even make sense because she didn t come out as trans after being caught raping and murdering women so she could be put into a prison full of potential victims
except i didn t misgender them so you re just needlessly defending a serial rapist i understand that you want to show everyone how morally superior you are but it doesn t apply here also making childish insults is just sad and shows you may need to take an internet detox
lmao misgendering is awful yes but these comments aren t
you literally shit on a guy for being in jail just on this thread isn t that bigotry
stop pretending like you don t know what this is really about and stop trying to provoke me into getting aggressive lol you seem pretty unhinged is super dramatic calm down bud
because if there s a threshold you can pass where you re allowed to be misgendered again that means every trans person is only able to live in their identity by everyone else s good graces that said the murderer is obviously lying
i don t honestly have the answers for that i m not advocating in either direction bigotry is bigotry and deserves being called out it s really not a difficult concept to non bigots
she literally killed a person with her car while sober but sure the point is being a bigot isn t excused by anyone s actions i m not supporting this person or her actions and no i don t think this is necessarily a great idea due to the nature of her crimes but using her crimes to justify bigotry is also separately a shitty thing it s that simple lmao
a man who you literally did but it s ok it s clear you re too terminally online to have coherent thoughts
correct any more seething to do
saying i wish he was there so i didn t have to read his reddit comments is shitting on him for making stupid comments not being in jail lmao i swear of this website is illiterate
provoke you into getting aggressive over words on reddit yeah youre definitely unhinged might want to seek some professional help for that and your desire to have male rapist murders put into women prisons
no they can live how they like what they can t do is force people s acceptance respect or anything else of the sort same as i can t force you to change your views you can t force me to change mine i will insult murderers school shooters rapists and pedos and how they identify or live their life prior means absolutely nothing to me i don t think how someone sees themselves sexually or in the world s gender roles play a part in if they are a shitty human or not and honestly i don t think it s some sacred off limits thing where if you insult one person it suddenly effects everyone else who sees themselves the same minus the heinous crime of course the thing that brought about said insult
i don t think not raping and murdering is a high bar to meet
and you re being called out for your stupidity the monster in question violently raped women and is currently being transferred to a woman s prison them bring trans or not for not matter in this situation the safety of a man woman child wether they are trans gay bi what have you even a prisoner should never be compromised
okay well it s settled you re uncomfortable so everyone trying to have a discussion about what one should do in this situation is bigoted because that s how life works all or nothing
and she was a man at the time it happened and continued to identity as one until much later she also didn t use coming out as means to transfer prisons so again this had no relevance you trying to jump on some moral high horse but you just look insane it s wild how if you just throw the word trans into a situation people will aggressively defend a person without any use of critical thinking skills
a male who is what i said so i guess reading comprehension isn t your thing which is wild because you literally see what i wrote
yes please keep responding
notice i never mentioned or condoned what was being protest only that pointing out bigotry isn t excused be people s actions no matter how egregious or horrific get you a copy of hooked on phonics learn to read and go back through my comments and maybe your reading comprehension will be good enough to grasp that
do you think you used enough ellipses in your comment to convey how thoughtful and smart it was or maybe you want to edit in a few more
https://preview.redd.it/9fjvhdnhwbsa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83933bc5aa9249ae40571d55d179b9add02662c3 imagine being so committed to intellectual dishonesty that you try to lie with the proof two comments up
all under the unwavering and unconditional support of the us government
defund israel now it s decades past due
free palestine
freedom for palestine
israelis went from persecuted to persecutors in less than two generations
i wonder how the majority of the israelies don t see how they are behaving exactly as nazis many years crying about the holocaust and what about this shit how can they be so unfair after suffering the exact same shit even worse because germany wasn t in their country stealing their land but they can do this to palestinians and at the same time fund movies about the holocaust how shameless they are and they call themselves religious shame
israel defended it their defense was i shit you not that there were kids in there with rocks and fireworks so they had to bust in and beat them all up that s their explanation something they thought we d all hear and say oh i guess it s ok then they see nothing wrong with that and are baffled that we would think there s anything wrong with it source https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20230405-israel-blasted-after-riot-police-attacks-worshippers-in-jerusalem-s-al-aqsa-mosque): armed police in riot gear stormed the prayer hall of al aqsa mosque before dawn wednesday aiming to dislodge law breaking youths and masked agitators they said had barricaded themselves inside a barrage of rocks and fireworks met the officers police video showed and more than people were arrested
filthy pigs
ironic in a sad way israel went from the being the victims in ww2 to being racist cunts
is violence moral if so then all armies are equally moral if it isn t then the kiss army is the most moral
israelis literally see palestinians and muslims as a whole as sub human
let s see how fast reforms regarding the prosperity and safety of palestinians could be passed once the us halts financial and military support it would be a splendid little experiment
he didn t say their morals were good for what it s worth
eat your words asshole
for anyone that s wondering the chairs you see during the beatdown is used by the elderly or disabled for prayer i would not be shocked whatsoever to learn that they were beating senior citizens for the crime of not being jewish
sometimes i wish i believed in hell just so trash like this man can go there
how blatant can a lie be what they do is disgusting by any human standards they have become inhuman and unhinged
times like this highlight how unevolved we really are as a species still doing shit like this and then when getting called out on it oh i ll just say the opposite and then that s pretty much good enough to kick the accountability can down the road for another few months
the lie humans want to believe people don t lie you can say the biggest lie and most people will believe you
hahaha this dude should do stand up comedy he would be a superstar
israel aka the terrorist state
remember when usa used to get into foreign countries in the name of freedom why it s only countries they can steal their resources from why don t they even raise their voice about this shit

look if you re going to post these video clips that cut out the part where the people getting arrested took fireworks and stones into the mosque in the first place and used them and ignore that the israeli police spent hours trying to talk them out of the mosque before resorting to force and that these hamas goons do this shit every year on the eve of a jewish holiday just to ruin the cops and idf s family time then at least get the fact that these are not the idf these are the police it s really easy to tell the idf wear those weird big hats https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitznefet_(israeli_military)

you do understand that european jewish people aren t the only jewish people

probably because they re acting nothing like the nazis and to think there s any comparison shows you re either very very ignorant about israel palestine or about nazi germany the fact you ve used even worse and holocaust as comparisons suggests you re ignorant to both

every year during ramadan a group will barricade themselves in al asqa and attack jews trying to pray at the western wall below this year rather than wait for the attacks to start they simply broke them up the moment they barricaded themselves in with rocks and fireworks
israel didn t exist during ww2 israel was never a victim
just to clarify the right wingers in israel embrace this shit the rest of the population does not sound familiar
you think israel would have to change anything if they lost of their gdp think they couldn t immediately make it up with arms deals with china and india
nothing would change israel already got the support it needed everything is done they are already in the position of power the us should still pull funding but it wont change much at this point
the crazy thing is that the solution is easy and that s to make it one state where everyone is equal the two state solution died when israel continued to build illegal settlements sure the jewish character of israel would no longer exist and palenstians are going to have to swallow their pride and live beside others peacefully that they have viewed as their opposers for plus years but it s possible it s the only way forward and i think everyone knows that even if they don t want to publicly admit it
i m not pro israel but you are making a good observation israel gets a lot more criticism than other countries that do similar things
a lot of americans did the issue is that under us law the president can engage in a military conflict for days before having to get the approval of congress and due to the fact that the countries the us actually tend to go to war with are third world ones with little to no military power to speak of the conflict would essentially be over before congress would have a chance to veto any military intervention
jews pray with m 16s in mosques today i learned

thanks for your insight captain obvious
so that is why the army won t be searching for my stolen bag fuck
people once said that about a jewish homeland and about the possibility of israel becoming a genocidal actor so
yep but watch out if you name them because you just might run into financial troubles and have your life ruined for it
i ve seen the confessions the nazis taught them much
what are you trying to say i think his comment makes complete sense he s not saying other jews around the world became persecutors the israelis did
there s nothing to compare they are stealing the land and property of palestinians they are harming and killing palestinians they have roads and infrastructures that are only for israelies if you cannot find points to compare you are either brainwashed or blatantly lying there s no other way to see it
probably because they re acting nothing like the nazis and to think there s any comparison lol hasbarat
just a thought even if you don t think it s a fair comparison maybe clarify that you agree what they re doing to innocent civilians is horrible no need to compare to the usa or nazis or whoever else the actions in this video by these people is disgusting or do you disagree
damn you never see a zionist this self aware that they call themselves nazis i give you credit lironi1111 thanks for being self aware
it blows my fucking mind that you think that s a defense of this some people might do some violent stuff so we just went in and beat the shit out of everyone and arrested them all just in case they were planning on something
wouldnt muslims barricading themselves in al aqsa make it harder for them to attack jews it seems like the barricading is so that muslims can stay in the mosque longer than 10pm which is a big concern in ramadan why wouldn t israel just station troops around the western wall to protect jews and just let muslims pray in al aqsa
oh bullshit hasbarat jewish exttremist threatened to kill a goat there and the call went out to protect it yall are fucking fowl
wasn t it because far right israelis wanted to slaughter a goat within the compound because passover coincided with ramadan a letter was written to the prime minister requesting permission from my understanding animal sacrifices are not permitted at the site and this was done to antagonise muslims during ramadan
weird take
this is not true in israel the right wingers are definitely leading the pack but the oppression of palestinians is not protested or contested by the majority of israelis the recent protests in israel are not about palestinians but about the right wing government taking too much power
it would be funny seeing china and russia vetoing things at the un for israel
weird how israelis always claim that the us aid to their country is completely immaterial to them andc they could take it or leave it but every single time anyone mentions cutting the funding suddenly israeli politicians claim that it s because of anti semitism almost as though israel wants that money a lot more than they like to admit
so all america provides is money lol what a fool
people were criticizing the fuck out of the us for their military ventures remember the whole freedom fries mess because france didn t want to go to war with us in iraq in fact people still criticize the us which contributes to why china has been able to manavuer themselves as a alternative because for all of chinas bluster they tend to stay out of military conflicts the last one was what years ago

the reason is religion cultists in the us think if israel builds the third temple their magic man will come back ironically sending all the jews to hell for not believing in him so it s this weird dynamic with israel s biggest supporters also being the people who are gambling that all the jews in israel perish in the end times that will come about because of the actions of the state they are supporting
the israeliez aren t just jewish people from europe the european jewish are known as the ashkenazi the easter n jewish who never left the middle east and northern africa are the mizrahi they re much more aggressive and anti arab just like some arab talk about killing all jewish some mizrahi talk about killing all the arabs netanyahu is mizrahi so talking about how they suffered the holocaust has no bearing on the mizrahi because they didnt
oh so americas treatment of nazi germany was also nazi ish if that s the criteria we re going by as is their treatment of iraq afganistan korea vietnam or do you think those are the stupidest broadest categories imaginable
oh wow i always thought the bad things the nazis did were trying to take over the world and committing industrialized genocide i didn t realize they were also making roads that could only be driven on by nazis truly deplorable
they re not innocent civilians they were stockpiling fireworks and rocks to attack jews below on the western wall they do it literally every year the idf goes in to remove the fireworks and are attacked here s the start of the footage that this propaganda piece conveniently left out footage https://mobile.twitter.com/qudsn/status/1643377597609394176?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw%7ctwcamp%5etweetembed%7ctwterm%5e1643377597609394176%7ctwgr%5e9d26ed63741f3e395b8062e2f21cbcc0fef7ef2a%7ctwcon%5es1_&ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.jpost.com%2fisrael-news%2farticle-736430) footage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxql4becdbi) they didn t just come in and start beating people
removed
no they went in to remove the fireworks and those who had blockaded themselves in and were attacked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxql4becdbi jesus you guys just swallow the propaganda whole every time
no al aqsa is a temple and a compound https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temple_mount#/media/file:jerusalem-2013(2)-aerial-temple_mount-(south_exposure).jpg here s a picture if you like that space in the center left of the image is the western wall last years the palestinians barricade the entrances to the compound and then throw rocks and launch fireworks at those trying to pray at the western wall below the idf breaks into the compound to break them up the palestinians then cry about how unfair that is this year the idf just broke in the moment they started to set up the barricade
lol no in the past far right jewish extremists have threatened to sacrifice a goat there they are always arrested also the misspelling of foul in this situation is pretty funny
one guy wrote a letter israel banned the practice since forever and it s still banned if you want to argue that the palestinians armed themselves because they were afraid of jews with goats meh
the founding of isreal is a very odd occurrence people should be more informed about from the balfour declaration to the fact zionists made attempts at and succeded at stoping jewish migrations elsewhere the whole situation is very peculiar it s often seen as some grand decision by all the jews of europe l but really it was orchestrated by a small number of wealthy jewish elite s
they wouldn t partner with russia they re broke and failing but india or china would love an alliance with a nuclear power access to the mediterranean proxy control over the suez and a world leader in military tech the us doesn t buy israel s alliance for lolz
almost as though israel wants that money a lot more than they like to admit almost like it s one of the best deals in the history of deals israel gets money for weapons and all it has to do is not fight egypt or jordan
free arms for a country constantly threatened by their neighbors is of course valuable a promise from the us in return for israel returning the sinai to egypt which turned egypt from a russian ally to an american ally and secured american dominance over mena and the two most important trade routes in the world but the country isn t going to collapse without it which is what a weird number of redditors seem to want to believe
pretty much
yaaaay you finally learned that muslims pray in a mosque
oh so when confronted with the similarities between how nazis treated jews and how israelies are treating palestinians you change the subject to usa i thought i was arguing with a grown up i m sorry it takes time to grow up don t rush it but try to stay out of complicated matters until you do
typical hasbarat hey look over there
to be honest these videos are also kind of conveniently timed they only show them using the fireworks not the beginning of the interaction so i can t know if it was in defense or unprovoked do you have something about them doing this yearly
you can alway s tell a hasbarat their main goal is to never be critical of israel or their pay checks will be lower
soooo are we going to act as if this didn t start with far right israelis do you think if a muslim threaten to kill something at your holiest site tension would occur x200b far right activist arrested on suspicion of planning goat sacrifice on temple mount
removed
no they went in to remove the fireworks and those who had blockaded themselves in and were attacked so they raided the compound and the palestinians fought back
no one trust a hasbarat the real reason for this is because of jewish extremist https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11945369/how-calls-ritual-slaughter-goat-increased-tensions-al-aqsa-mosque.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11945369/how-calls-ritual-slaughter-goat-increased-tensions-al-aqsa-mosque.html)
here they are raiding the mosque so can you give a response

party on june 20th
there were two people in the garden of eden so did adam and eve start the cabal that secretly runs the world just a minor detail i guess wonder what he ll lie about on june eighth
these people have a huge floor calendar mat and they just toss a pebble and go with whatever it lands on
pretty sure he couldn t spell algebra
that made me think of kingdom hearts
this idiot doesn t even realize the contempt trump holds for them the only thing trump will take is their money
trump wouldn t even take a bullet for his kids lol
jesus cheated on his pregnant wife paid off the woman and lied about it in his messiah campaign finances the ads are right jesus gets us
the man would push you in front of the bullet to make sure you take it for him he is going to prison because of his actions his actions have consequences that are particular to him this whole thought process doesn t carry the logic they wish it did
pretty appropriate name for this podcast
wrong think is a perfect name for her show cause she s batshit crazy
president trump let his own lawyer and close friend go to jail and then mocked him while he was in there pretty sure he wouldn t make much of anything for you random conservative podcasters lmfao
he said we march to the capitol i ll be with you and than left to go and hide how can you expect him to take a bullet for anyone he would push his sons in front just to make sure he s not hurt
lady trump would use your face to wipe the dogshit off his elevator shoes
lol a bullet he wouldn t even risk a sunburn for her
trump wouldn t even take a bullet for his own children shut the fuck up
trump would use his grandkids as human shields if he had to guaranteed people like her are either paid very very well to spread this crap or they are very lost like uncharted island lost but not a good one
sooo crucify trump
sounds like someone woke up today and had a bigly bowl of naivety for breakfast trump would take a bullet for her after he says you first
wasnt he literally recorded saying his fans are disgusting or something like that
how d that work out for ashli babbitt
she s definitely crazy but this is not a public freakout r lostredditors
she would take his shot yeah
first trump would use you as a human shield and then rifle through your pockets for loose change secondly he s been avoiding and challenging every single court case he s been involved in for years because he s a coward third he s being indicted for using campaign funds to cover up him fucking a porn star while he was still married how is that christ like how is that taking a bullet for you
sweet deluded child the only way trump would take a bullet for you is if he grabbed you to use you as a human shield but then mistakenly spun in the wrong direction other than that he d sacrifice you before he d risk a broken fingernail on himself
who actually listens to this dope
unfortunately all her thinking is split second
trump is not the president and never will be again
trump wouldn t take a bullet for you you have dark skin
im sure she would have been first in line at the jim jones kool aid stand back in the day
literally
share yer drugs yer sick
the amount of dumb in a second video is astounding
yes the man who coined the term fk her in the pussy is christlike
where is replacement theory when we need it
trump wouldn t take a bullet for his own sons uday and qusay much less anyone else
the man wouldn t even go to vietnam to take bullets
remember when trump abandoned people in frozen muddy fields in the middle of winter pardoned the guy who stole millions of dollars from them wonder what it takes for them to realize he hates them
i d feel sorry for this woman if she wasn t so fucking stupid she really thinks the shitgibbon would take a bullet for her excuse me while i go laugh hysterically for a minute
how is saying dumb shit to a camera in your room a public freakout
pathetic and delusional
trump can t even get a bus for his supporters back to the parking lot no way he is taking bullets lmao
trump wouldn t block a dirty look for you
insane cultists

she s hot as fuck though
it s interesting how these posts showing how crazy the magas are get instantly downvoted on this sub but monthly reposts involving black people get shot up to the top
now there you see you thought every damned view of the orange man had been offered narcissists pathological liar ignorant fool anti democratic racists traitor but then we forgot the obvious jesus thank you anna for your deep insights into the maga mind
i can fix her
cool story
what people don t understand is the role they play in this
damn so sexy yet so stupid
whaaaat these people have a major soft spot on top of their heads he d make sure the grab her by the kitty and hold in front of him if he didn t just foul himself and twitch on the ground
donald trump wouldn t offer her a hand if help if she fell onto his feet
christ like so he is going to save you from what he is going to do to you kinda stuff
i d love to ask her to give a single example of something trump has done that would make her think that
yeah he d take a bullet just like george saved everyone from that fire in seinfeld
is this the dead eye that did the homeschooled kids video with her daughter it was over on the r qanoncasualties sub yesterday
hahahahahaa that selfish orange goblin wouldn t take an extra step if it meant saving her life unless he could sleep with her then he would
ever wonder if trump ran for president just so he could get the best body guards in the world for free for the rest of his life his family too
p s a don t have sexual relations with this woman
all jokes aside is maga a mental illness honestly they all claim to be christian but they worship someone that is a living contradiction to their beliefs they claim to hold so dear for the life of me i truly just don t understand
yeah no gif giphy 4jse3uzefhnq0
lol i doubt trump would even take a bullet for his own daughters
trump would pull her in front of himself to take a bullet
when filler goes to far
he wouldn t piss on her if she was on fire although he would like her to piss on someone
possibly he d take her virginity since she has that melania clint eastwood squint thing going on
definitely not don jr or tiffany that much is certain
trump would commit suicide by shooting someone else
not true he wanted to lead the insurrection personally but secret service wouldn t allow him he threw a tantrum in the car when he learned he wouldn t lead the riot
he wouldn t risk bonespurs for his country and she thinks he ll willingly take a bullet definitely not a cult
trump can t get sunburned with all that spray tan right
wouldn t matter if she was white trump wouldn t take a bullet for his own kids i m sure
never put your dick in crazy
how can you tell she s got so much makeup on it looks like a tiktok filter
that s not merely interesting it s god damned fascinating can you tell us more about this phenomenon
show up with a trump flag in your car and i bet it s an easy lay
yeah secret service was like we need to save this idiot from himself job done i guess
but it is true he didn t march to the capitol he got in the vehicle and the secret service wouldn t take him there s a difference between someone saying i will not drive you into a situation that creates danger for yourself and others the service is tasked to protect and i m going to stop you from marching where you want to go
didnt he try to choke out the driver
duh
organized brigades of trumpers anti semites karma whores 4chan rascists etc come on this sub and get their crap up to the top that s the phenomenon it s obvious and disgusting
with what you said it made it seem like the dark skin was the reason you thought he wouldn t
nah it s literally because nobody likes op and his astroturfing in this subreddit he has countless alt accounts that he uses to crosspost things from the subreddits he controls to help better sell his books

i don t call myself a fascist but this kid is disgusting on so many levels
he does realise this also applies to clinton obama and biden right
people like him when a democrat president commits a crime lock them up when a republican president commits a crime hey come on now so it s just a little moider they re an okay person amirite show some compassion come on
this isn t a public freakout or even a private freakout this is just some nobody airing out his poorly formed opinions
while we re at it we need to ask hitler s thoughts on being above the law s
i don t need fascists america doesn t need fascists apparently you re the only one who needs fascists because you can t make a living without them paying to work for the destruction of democracy in america russia pays better go there but stay away from high balconies
fuck this cunt
i m years old and my whole life i always thought people were assholes for saying another person has a punchable face like it didn t make sense to me cause i never felt the same then i saw this dude
everyone talking now about sigma but this fucker forgot about ligma
the thumbnail makes it look like he needs more fibre in his diet
because fascist dictators are above the law and can t be held accountable for their crimes by the peasants didn t work that way for mussolini
it wasn t good when there were only a handful of networks that controlled all broadcasted opinions but this thing where everybody has a microphone has turned out to suck too i m not proposing anything it s just an observation
obama getting the nobel peace prize then approving drone strikes is kind of absurd the president has to make decisions like that but when it comes to breaking the law for personal gain or to prevent yourself as president from facing legal charges then yeah you re argument that the world needs facists falls apart
hey doesn t call himself gay either but still wants to fuck dudes he ll get the ernst rohm treatment if his wishes are fulfilled
does he think this should apply to all presidents or just ones he supports isn t this the same group of individuals that think obama should be in prison
well trump isn t president anymore so what s wrong with that
sounds like the type of person that likes to make out with 2x4 s
if it wasn t for the insipid ignorance of americans this guy would be working at mcdonalds
literally live from his moms basement
is it a freak out delete this post please op this is basically just promoting the fascist bullshit
this has to be satire right
why does anyone pay attention to this stooge
he s a smarmy little bitch
pretty sure he s trolling with that smirk on his face even he can t take himself seriously he knows what he s saying is uttery ridiculous but knows he will get clicks views and a following of mentally ill people dude is a tremendous piece of shit
people like him rarely think things all the way through
not like that
i agree with you that it s just rage bait and therefore irrelevant to the subreddit i do not agree with your second sentence nick fuentes is a nazi and he sucks but he s not a nobody and his opinions as expressed on his show are very carefully crafted i don t want to make him out to be some evil super genius or anything because he s not but he is intelligent media savvy and politically connected if you treat him like a dumb yokel he s going to prove you wrong and he s going to do so in a way that makes his side look more attractive don t make that mistake
we don t need any fascists or communists
have you seen the face of the dude who repealed net neutrality ajit pai or something like that dude literally looks like a political cartoon
what s ligma
yeah that s the problem is that he panders to people with mental health problems and they go out and commit hate crimes he s just a dumpster fire
indeed king trump gonna get a reality check when he is thrown in jail with the peasants
don t worry no one is advocating for communism in the us
we don t need any fascists or communists jfc dude the 1950s called mccarthy wants to schedule a dinner with you to discuss policy
ligma balls
those hundreds of broke college kids simping for communism sure are scary to the millions of grown adults with money now currently simping for fascism
ok what would you think of the usa becoming a communist country would you like to see that happen
ayyyy
i don t think those broke college kids are calling for the elimination of private business most people talking about communism have no idea what they re talking about
those hundreds of broke college kids simping for communism sure are scary to the millions of grown adults with money now currently simping for fascism ok your use of simpism to describe global economic political policy automatically puts you behind the class
of course not no one is advocating for that
you really have to have your head up your ass to believe that there are no teachers or university professors in the us that are socialist communist or marxist and promote those thinges in us classrooms
real talk are you an adult
you don t even know what you re talking about socialism isn t communism you sound like a low information voter
the number of actual communists in the us is vanishingly small and they have zero institutional power or broad demographic appeal unlike fascists in the us who are much more numerous and powerful
can you give us a single example of that actually happening a single professor anywhere that is advocating in the classroom for communism no of course you can t but you unhinged right wing shitlords are so fucking brainwashed you think your red menace is everywhere it s pathetic
he sounds like every conservative ever
who in any position of power would outright or has outright declared i m a fascist
that guy thinks we still need mccarthyism but would he really want hearings to find racist people as much as he wants to find all these professors who have hidden caches of communist memorabilia
people in the klan tend to deny that they re racists too
no one would say that because they know it s bad hitler didn t call himself a fascist he didn t even call his party fascist
i mean mtg did speak at a fuentes event recently fascist adjacent isn t much better different
i asked you for a specific example i know there are racist cops here and there that have been exposed to have ties to white nationalist groups and that s very bad but for every one of those i m sure you ll find a university professor that secretely holds communist memorabilia but who in any position of power in the us has outright declared themself a fascist
ok well do you think you could say the same thing about communists surely there are communists that disguise their beliefs and only show their belief in communism through expressed principle

you shouldn t repeatedly ask people questions and then tell them to shut their ass up when they try to answer you
man that kid never had a chance born into dysfunction
this is a temper tantrum some people don t grow up
it s so easy to tell who was raised in an abusive home
smart people for those not getting involved in any way she d probably bitch slap anyone else who got in the middle of this baby in arm or no baby
you work here you need a new job bitch you wash clothes there your need your own washer and dryer
maybe my first thought was years of no consequences or accountability teach people they can get away with this kind of behavior she s gotten away with it times this year and she ll get away with this one to your point maybe it s generations of no consequences or accountability but literally people get away with acting like this everywhere nowadays so why not

as someone from paris i dont think this is in paris
garbage barrage
it is not in paris maybe in guingamp a city in brittany i can read plouisy on the traffic signs and its a small town near guingamp
ahah paris c est guingamp ou lannion la qualit est degueu j arrive pas  lire les panneaux
looks like there ll be plenty of work cleaning streets etc for those who ve been affected by the increase in the retirement age now
what puzzles me about these videos is why are the police still working this affects them too but they re literally just taking garbage for the gov what gives
ahh the smell of paris
mindsets are so interesting i have an accountant who is from france now lives here in the usa he told me that the citizens of france simply depend on their government to dictate a large part of their lives they expect them to do it responsibly of course whereas in the united states my mindset is who cares what our government does my future has to do with me and me only i depend on them for nothing and i expect nothing from them i got this myself and i really do there is no right or wrong way i just like depending on myself rather than someone else
gif giphy 42cgeldaprg3c
this is a stupid way to look at life imo it s the opinion of a lucky or young person because the reality of life is some people just get fucked over and we need systems in place to support those people the reason there are literally homeless villages in america is because there are no safety nets america is big enough that people can simply move away or build walls around their gated communities etc but some people get older and realise you want the world to work for everyone not just you but your kids their kids your friends and family everyone around you because when they prosper so do you
in france we are seeking equality and in the us its freedom those concept are completely incompatible is it a english word to
we dont depend on the gov we just chose to invest our taxes in social security that gives everyone the same chance and support thats call equality in you usa its the im priviliged to be born in a family that have money i got the head start and fuck you i got mine see ya sucker one is selfish the other is equals
exactly it s a privileged perspective to be able to think say i got this people tend to think homelessness and metal health issues come from drugs or some other scape goat truth is when you feel you re on your own and vulnerable that s when shit goes sideways amp that up with a global pandemic potential wwiii and economic uncertainty and some people just don t got it most americans don t appreciate those camps are also filled with soccer moms and people with great educations owned houses and had professional careers things can turn on a dime
like i said neither way is right or wrong mindsets are just extremely limiting
where s part
that s not the same guy who invaded the capitol
is there a full version
new yorkers won t put up with that fascist trump cult crap too funny
time magazine feature heroic inanimate skateboard on front cover
celebrating the assauly of someone expressing their 1a rights is a slippery slope it doesn t matter what side you re on
not the smartest move to attack a muscular guy and you are both on foot now that guy got up with adrenaline kicking

duuude that wheeze when he gets running
my thoughts exactly
more like where s the entire video
no different guy
that idiot is serving months
this guy is a performance artist that s been out trolling the trump supporters
aww they were just about to show a close up of the board
that side celebrated the death of cops after jan 6th that side spread vaccine misinformation leading to the needless deaths of millions from covid this is still ongoing that side brags they are domestic terrorists that side says fuck your feelings that side intentionally poisons the planet to pwn the libs fuck that side and fuck you fascist sympathizer
nope already released to a halfway house and will be fully released on may 25th
name one cop that died on or as a result of jan 6th then name one person that celebrated a cops death
from what i read this guy isn t a maga supporter he s a performance artist that s been out trolling the actual magats
here you go you worthless excuse for a human https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/loss-uscp-colleague-brian-d-sicknick](https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/loss-uscp-colleague-brian-d-sicknick) alex jones celebrated it i know your brain is really really bad and thinking clearly is difficult but if you look at the alex jones lawsuits you will see he is being sued for celebrating and calling the deaths of children a false flag by the government he said the same thing about capitol police and all your idiots followed suit enjoy your blow back little child
now you are on this alex jones and sandy hook thing the bottom line is if you don t think this klown has the right to express his 1a rights without being assaulted well then that makes you the facist it is sad reality that you must face
that was debunked https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brian-sicknick-capitol-riot-died-natural-causes/
from your own source lmao but did say all that transpired played a role in his condition
death not listed as a homicide is what matters in a legal sense
that looks like the result of practice and training i believe we have encountered a shit ninja
with great power comes great responsibility
yeah i m gonna stop at reading the title and just take your word for it
it was a tough fap but i was committed to see it through
defense mechanism

when was this taken
beanie babies at the post office what is this
yoooooo why tf he oggle at dude like that i would have said the same damn thing man
i always answer that with oh no we re all going to die in a mocking sarcastic tone try it sometime it s so satisfying
the beanie babies were super random haha
use to be easy to mail a letter
old boy shit his pants then he went to the post office
straight out of a sitcom lmao
exactly
it won t be their benefits gone it will be ours they will be long gone and we will be ones getting shafted because of their dumb choices
they would say i can t believe the democrats allowed this to happen
centrists and right wingers hate others more than they love themselves
lmao they know that they ll just enact sunsetting policies so the geriatric dumb fucks who vote r will get their full benefits while fucking over younger generations as is the norm
would be funny if the guy was like well i m technically right
i sure won t tell him
there s a lot of legends in their own minds walking around out there
well politics is apart of everyone s identity to be fair
something is not right in this post office tho who is running it who decided beanie babies need that much display space in a post office after the year
they should ve found a way to stop us
they re actually beanie boos which are a more recent thing and have been crazy popular i assume they re at a post office for the convenience of people who need a quick easy cheap to ship last minute gift to mail to a kid in their family whose interests and birthday they forgot about
ahh i see they are bringin it back
she ia giving manic episode vibes
is that credit card or cash no thank you i ll just use my race card
clearly needs mental health help
do you know who she is she s just holding the line and trying to have a bigger conversation in a safe space and these people are gatekeeping her she s standing her ground in the truth somebody shook up her scrabble tiles a little too much that day
i assume the back of her shirt says handles
good god she tries to bs her way to get the cops to agree with her
so i am immediately suspicious of all police and generally think that police culture in this country and others is broken but these two these two went above and beyond to treat this woman with courtesy and dignity while explaining the situation professionally i guess she wants to be the change she wants to see in the world she ll get to do that in court what a numpty
either this lady is crazy or she s a secret far right operative trying to discredit social justice liberalism by acting in such a ridiculous manner i mean she s not wrong about suffering in the world and selfish people holding society back but shaking down the local target for reparations isn t the way to remedy such problems also kudos to those officers they were way more patient and indulgent with her than cops typically are with suspects
here is a theory she cooked up a plan that could eventually get her some cash maybe she is genuine in her beliefs and making a stand but to she is playing to get some compensation
she freaked out and got punched in the face for it nevertheless an interesting watch maybe something to think about
she didn t try and steal anything she was arrested for trespassing and menacing she wanted something for nothing i think she has some problems
it s not mental issues i think it s critical race theory trauma
wth how many cops do they need worked retail for years only time we ever had a bunch of cops like that is when we had a murder suspect on the run and he tried to buy a gun we just got the nics system going and min after calling in and getting a delayed status the state police called me
you mean this isn t her rosa parks moment dude
yep it causes impulsivity and big ideas at very inconvenient times i m not sure if a thousand dollars on groceries is her normal amount but i m guessing she overbought and wasn t sure how to fix the problem on top of it all she has probably done this at least once before even if she was successful she ends up with a bunch of perishable groceries that go bad before they get eaten i don t say this often but those cops handled this well especially the one who listened he let her keep her dignity and she was the only one injured i hope she gets the help and support she needs
you re not kidding
hence tries to steal d
amen i really expected the cops to shut down and throw her on the ground he should be teaching at the academy
like i said she didn t try to steal anything she wanted to get it for free when she couldn t she became aggressive causing her arrest
this video is so fucking confusing why are they all standing around why didn t they make contact before entering the vehicle if the suspect was knocked out why were they sneaking the officers were lightly pulling and releasing the door handles like they didn t want to make too much noise to wake the suspect up the interaction makes no fucking sense that is leaving out the officer s choice to get in the vehicle and shoot the suspect while he was driving how can you justify lethal force when killing the suspect puts your life at risk the officer had no belt on he could have been thrown from the vehicle and crushed in what world would any of these actions be considered protection where was the law enforcement what law was being enforced wtf is going on
many years ago i arrived at a red light behind a sedan the light turned green they didn t go so i waited a couple seconds and tooted the horn nothing i honked a little more no response i honk some more and the light turned red i missed the whole green light so i got out and walked over to see what was up dude was asleep foot on the brake gearshift in drive he wouldn t wake up to me smacking his window so i gave up and called our local police it was really late out and an officer arrived in a minute or two the officer parked perpendicular to the car and about in front of him i walked over and told the officer that the car was running and in drive after a moment of consideration he backed up and pulled the nose of his cruiser up tight to front bumper of the sedan the officer got out and started shining his flashlight at the guys face while smacking the window and yelling police are you okay that woke the dude up he immediately reflexively took his foot off the brake and his front end lightly booped the push bar on the front of the cruiser dude was drunk but was just arrested for dui and wasn t injured while they took him into custody
couldn t they have blocked him in to prevent him from driving
stop or i ll shoot and then immediately starts blasting wtf is wrong with them
we did it guys we stopped the bad guy oh the destroyed house with a dead teenager in it nah ignore that
blasts him times in the back then says dont move
don t reach up and slam the car in park don t grab him and tell him to stop the vehicle simply start blasting him in the back that s the best course of action you fucking grape
another one of my days started off by watching a police murder
the suspect is dead asleep in the car anyone know why the police singled him out they could have easily blocked him in with their squad cars and then woke him up via loudspeaker the civilian would have woken up completely surrounded and outmanned and outgunned and not able to anything but roll down a window instead ninja cop sneaks in now i imagine the driver is dead someone s home is destroyed the cops had the manpower on scene to go about this a safer way and chose to do the opposite
they ambushed him while sleeping these cops are dumb as nails like what the fuck do you expect
so anyway i start blasting
i am pretty sure the boy was dead the moment he collapsed in the car all the patching up and the cpr at the end was pure dramatics not once they checked pulse they just wanted to mantain appereances we tried to save him bullshit he shot to kill they didn t give a shit they just wanted to make things look less awful for the camera they failed at that too
god fucking damn stupidest fucking cops wtf i hope they rot in jail however we know that won t happen they ll get a high five from their shit ass cop pals fuck them
shooting the driver in the back is absolutely inexcusable that was handled about as poorly as possible could have caused civilian injuries or deaths they re lucky it didn t rip to the driver you didn t deserve that ending
cops find suspect sleeping in vehicle have all the time in the world to block escape methods why bother doing that when you can startle the suspect suspect starts car and takes off with cop in the backseat stop or i ll shoot why wait when you can unload half the mag into the suspect let the vehicle run off the road and crash into a residence hogs be wildin and trying to make their own action movie scenes
the dumb cop shouldn t have gotten in the car it s like going into a cave and poking a bear they know the car is stolen and do it anyway why not block the car in and take a better position however the title is misleading you forgot to mention the part where he takes off with the officer in the car and the fact that the car was stolen
why do police just start blasting like wtf there were so so many solutions to that
i fucking hate cops even if i m not doing anything at all wrong they still make me nervous to just end a dudes life shooting him in the back like that what a pussy ass bitch of a cop most cops are all the same insecure douchebags that do not need to have weapons of any kind
deleted
unarmed there was a gun in his vehicle
wow two weeks ago i feel asleep in my truck when it was running because i had a tough nights rest and i was waiting for work to start it was and the gate for the job i was on doesn t open until i woke up to firemen and a police officer pounding on my door ambulance on the way i was shaking in fear and was so disoriented i couldn t tell them where i was aparently someone walking by called the police and said i may have over dosed on heroin but i just have sleep apnea and was tired as fuckkkkkkkk anyway they took care of me and helped me get back to work they fucking shot this kid same exact situation except they murdered this black kid f because he was scared
me a person with more than iq knocks on window you ok need help cop with creamed corn for brains sneaks into car ambushes teenager shoots him destroys house internal investigation everything the cop did is well within departmental policy
okay knowing the context of this situation via the bbc i m going to bite the bullet here and say this isn t outrageous the guy stole the car and was known to be armed when caught he drove off erratically with a police officer in the back who lets be real here this is the one time where that fear for their life phrase would actually apply as fuck knows where the guy is driving off to yes with captain hindsight we can say there are different ways they could have done it but stealing a car while being armed and driving erratically with a cop in the back seat well that s probably one situation where being shot isn t an acab situation
you mean they are not supposed to do this
they were concerned that the driver would wake up startled and drive away they should have parked a police vehicle in front of the driver s vehicle
so much misinformation in one post for starters it wasn t his car he was sleeping in it was a stolen car the cops were trying to arrest him for vehicle theft secondly he was definitely not unarmed and was armed with an illegal handgun could it have been handled better probably was he an innocent unarmed teenager who had done nothing wrong absolutely not i get that reddit hates cops but at least add context on videos like this rather than lying about what happened smh
it s part of the game you do shit like steal cars and rob people someone might kill you even teens know what they re getting into too bad
this is a misleading title for this post
unarmed teenager stolen car and there was a gun discovered but okay
why did they let the suspect drive there is only one suspect and there are many police
why not block the vehicle in with the other cruisers that way when you wake him up he can t drive away sometimes you have to second guess how smart some cops are
how the fuck did they fuck up this badly they have the suspect literally asleep in a car and somehow they turn that into a shooting and a car going through a random person s house everyone would have been safer if the cops had stayed home that day
wow what tf
i just want to see these guys explain to the desk sergeant how they started with an unconscious suspect in a stationary vehicle which if they had pc to enter the car should have been an easy slam dunk apprehension and somehow ended up with an unarmed dead suspect a totaled vehicle which is also now a crime scene technically a kidnapped officer though now freed and significant damage to an uninvolved third party s home this is like something out of the naked gun movies
everything that could go wrong did or how to fuck up in
ah a black kid makes sense now
ummm i feel this shouldn t be so controversial
fuck the police that is all
fuck off with the blatant misleading title
holy shit these cops are so fucking stupid an absolute menace to society
how exactly does the country prevent this from happening
the fact he says stop or ill shoot then literally gives the guy half a second to comply before point blank dumping on him is sooooo crazy
this is insane death penalty to cops who murder
unbelievable so many other ways to approach this and they landed on the one that kills a teenager destroys someone s home and destroys the car that they were trying to return fucking idiots
title should read police shoot car jacker armed with pistol because that s the truth that s cool though refuse to read articles not made by each other of reddit and continue twisting the truth only thing wrong here is the leo s approach what a fucking terrible way to try and apprehend a perp
thats fucking murder
removed
bunch of murdering thugs they wanted to kill him thus the stealth only the loser in the backseat got the chance acab
this makes me furious with anger stop or i ll bang bang bang bang bang shoot
all these ideas for alternative approaches are good but they re missing the fundamental element that police culture hypes up lethal force and many who become cops are looking for these kinds of situations that inevitably they end up creating for themselves everything is a threat and everyone is a potential enemy combatant and they have the police unions and the court system to back them up and grant them impunity so they get to live out their murder fantasy
cops sure do love intentionally putting themselves in unnecessarily dangerous situations that end up justifying their lethal force
shooting a fleeing unarmed suspect in the back is murder
all thieves are bastards
cops first instinct reaction is to shoot to kill they are trained to do this kill
all of them should be fired for misconduct let me reiterate what i m saying i just saw some gangster shit go down where homie got scared that he got trapped in the vehicle he was attempting to rob and shot and killed the driver who was just trying to take a nap so as to not danger other drivers on the road
misleading title more questions remain after a year old was killed over the weekend in a park police involved shooting two park police officers were hurt in the process one dragged the other trapped in the back seat of a car the teen driver of the vehicle has been identified as year old dalaneo martin u s park police officials says they responded to a call around a m saturday from d c police for assistance with a suspicious vehicle at 34th and baker streets near river terrace park a federal park in northeast d c the driver of the car appeared to be asleep at which point officials say one of the u s park police officers got into the vehicle with him authorities say the driver then woke up and hit the gas officials say the officer s weapon was discharged after they say martin refused to stop martin was struck and died at the scene after martin was shot the car crashed into a nearby home the officers involved were hospitalized with non life threatening injuries the teen s mother and family members were at the scene of the crash saturday morning looking for answers as to what exactly happened alnwick says that per u s park police policy the shooting is being investigated by d c s metropolitan police department s internal affairs division she says police say a weapon was recovered from the vehicle
op is a shitty person with a shitty title
what the fuck is wrong with cops
this kid died while thinking he was escaping a car jacking bet his brain never processed it was the police
maybe try not jumping into the back seat of the car before taking the keys
stop or i ll shoblam blam blam fing domestic terrorists
it s the officer ok i hope he didn t get any trauma he should get some counseling and pay time off for probably a year to help him with this murder
why did they jump the guy while he was sleeping couldn t they have just woken him up before jumping the guy i mean the dude probably was confused when you are woken up like that and find strange people in your car so natural instincts kick in which is probably why he took off
murder
well what the fuck this feels gross i feel bad for the cop actually doing compressions he knows it s not good that kid didn t have a chance
that s some bullshit
cops are such useless fleshbags
they knew exactly what would happen jump on a guy asleep ofcourse he s going to flee he probably thought he was getting robbed this is a straight up execution if you ask me why not block the car and then wake him up from the outside calmly and thn have a talk
absolute cold blooded murder please for the love of lord xenu tom cruise someone tell me this cop is sitting on death row right now
acab
dumb cop like really dumb
stop or i ll shoot less than a second after finishing his sentence pop pop pop really the kid had so little time to even comprehend what he was saying hope this pos got some sort of punishment
nice misleading title teenager kidnaps cops and refuses to stop vehicle creating a deadly situation where lethal force was authorized
absolute amateurs
end qualified immunity
awww poor little murderous baby has a head injury
fucking murderers acab
misleading title op should be banned when you click on the link you see bodycam suspect takes off with officer in the car before shooting washington d c march 6k views hours edit dude has every chance to surrender peacefully instead he fought off the cops then took off with one in the back the cop even had time to say just let me out dude kept driving then got another two warnings before getting shot was the cop just supposed to wait and hope the guy decided to stop no dude would have crashed anyway and the cop would have got hurt or killed
whos gonna pay for the house
stop or i ll pop pop pop
it s like the only thing they how to do is shoot a gun so many other ways this could ve been handled
shot times in the back self defense plus he fired the first shot less then a second after telling him to stop or i ll shoot
oh boy if i could turn back time they had all that time before he woke up to plan where were the other cars to block in the car let s hope they use this video as what not to do in cop school
this sub will find the crazy excuses for people
let me guess he got promotion soon after
well this is depressing as fuck holy shit killed him and endangered the life of anyone in that neighborhood in front of that car that cop is a psychopath at least to the people in that neighborhood
couldn t even count thousand from the moment the cop said stop or ill shoot before he started firing how fast are people supposed to react before death waking someone up in a panic state then saying just stop and let me out to stop or ill sho bang bang bang ok they guy my be a criminal but should that equate to death so many people love to say well don t commit crimes then it s crazy why even have the court system then idk
even in the military they know for the first seconds after you wake up you are in a dazed and confused state they gave this boy less then that to comprehend so many commands zero reason this should ve happened
he was still a kid he hadn t even reached fucking adulthood now he can t experience many beautiful firsts this shite keeps happening and like usual no solution i hope he s resting in peace now
people need to stop stealing cars lol
idgaf how y all about to fell downvote away honesty i have absolutely zero respect towards any man or woman the correct term no matter the gender is trash that wears a badge never have never will don t like it come kill me about it pussy
it s not just some cops that are bastards
violent sociopath asshole bastard cops x200b all they love to do is execute black men what a fucked up country to continue employing and celebrating brutal murdering cops x200b he puts shots into the guy s back and then screams over and over and over don t move like he didn t just execute this poor man x200b cops are fucking bastards
just want to point out that it s literally fucking nuts that this dirt bag steals a car and creates all this risk and there are virtually no comments placing any of the blame on him being a cop is a fucking thankless job
when i watch videos like this i feel like usa is fucked beyond repair and sadly i watch way too many videos like this
coward murdered the kid frightened awakened alarmed people yelling and grabbing at him he s like a preschooler who can t use his words
what the actual fuck
kills a teen don t move
what a shitty title made to produce a reaction
the cop is without a seatbelt in the backseat of a speeding vehicle dude could absolutely crash it and kill the officer without warning this is a justified shooting
you really don t even need to say maga dumbfuck if you just say maga the dumbfuck is always automatically implied
didn t just lose by a little lost by freaking percent
maybe he shouldn t have run such a deeply deceitful dishonorable despicable campaign
what a spoiled brat child insane to even think of anyone wanting him to make any major decisions for people s lives
maga tears taste good https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ula8oi_m4ww).

do you think op is a democrat 8p
your feelings on the matter are irrelevant please hesitate to share them in the future
even higher it was percentage points vs every time i passed a giant kelly sign along the highway the last couple days i smiled to myself good riddance you corrupt lying loser what an embarrassment to our state he is
i do not know the total numbers but they were showing percentages of certain counties on the news and showing why they were calling it so early he was underperforming badly in traditional conservative strongholds usually my voting place is staffed by latinos cus of the areas makeup but this time it was all white women who looked a little too suburbanish to be from my hood lol the overturning of roe v wade really really screwed republicans over lol
not only that but his assertion that his opponent ran a dirty campaign is pure projection he had several ads pulled because they were straight up lies and divisive whatever a conservative complains about is always a confession
could you elaborate i ve been looking into it a little he s totally disingenuous about abortion there s an law that kicks in now that roe is dead so abortion is illegal according to an law and he s totally being coy about whether he would uphold it or not she was not and pointed out his obfuscation of course a republican calls it unfair when you point out exactly what they are doing saying believing
the people who vote for morons like this don t want people making decisions in their lives they vote for this guy because they want him making decisions for people who don t agree with them and force them to live by their beliefs
same difference
d all of the above
oh dang you re right he might be thanks for reminding us we ll check
who cares can t you just enjoy a crying politician
do you think op is a democrat 8p yeah a democrat you know those people who unlike republicans never decided to storm the capitol because they were unhappy about the outcome of an election you didn t see us storm the fucking capitol when trump won in did you
ugh grow up already jesus fucking christ almighty
no i think op is a bot and you need only look at the post history to confirm
your feelings on this matter are irrelevant please fuck off

not to split hairs but that was no traffic stop they were in pursuit of a felon the first detective is lucky he didn t catch fire running up there as he did
get on the ground get on the ground i am on the ground get more on the ground
opens fire on the cops and then decides to surrender odd choices
that car was definitely not cleared yet
gang shoot out
they must have thought it was uvalde cops out there
but they want teachers to carry guns to take down active shooters get your fucking heads out of your ass tn
call me old fashioned but i still can t used to scene cops with full sleeves of tattoos
book em dano
bothers me that he said car was clear after just a glance through driver door
did he just surrender when he ran out of ammo
cop with the body cam is tatted up
i don t why they re angry all i heard was popcorn cooking i guess you can t jiffypop while driving
clean reload tho
let s ask the questions no one is brave enough to ask why do most cops have shite tattoos
wtf is wrong with these cops blm y all could ve used a taser instead or just tried to reason with him

mad respect to these officer for keeping their cool when they approached must be hard after getting shoot at to not kick the guy in the head or something when you walk up
yeah more guns is gonna fix it s
deleted
civilians vs aryan brotherhood reskin
yea i would have kicked him one time
when will you wake up that you need to make it easier for more people to have guns then no one will shoot anyone
lmaooo
im salty no officers were hit
they got to live their fantasy hope it was worth it
being a cop is sooooooo dangerous
ok but like anyone gonna call out the fact that these guys aren t in a cop car but a regular car if i got pushed to the side of the road because the way the other car doesn t exactly look like they peacefully and slowly got into that position and then a guy got out his car and pointed a gun at me i would probably be choosing self defense too
you can split my hairs whenever you d like you metal bastard
the description is the wording nashville pd used when they uploaded the video
it is a traffic stop a vehicle was pulled over by law enforcement hence it being termed a traffic stop versus a stop and frisk or a knock and talk at a place of business or residence
limbo championships
he ran out of bullets no other choice really
i was thinking the same he s lucky he wasn t shot like a dog
so the driver of the car whose pov were seeing from didn t have any emergency lights on it hard to tell from the video but i wonder if there s some plausible deniability that the suspect knew he was being engaged by a cop
yeppers
gang tattoos from what i can see
i m not entirely sure but almost positive that officer quinn didn t even fire at all he shifted position and by reflex replaced his mag
get out the car get out the oh
i think there were some people across the street that weren t armed so maybe that was the problem
maybe if everybody had two guns no one would have fired at the scene i too vote for more guns
it s another ford fusion they re frequently used as unmarked cars

yes because getting shot at isn t dangerous we all know this
shame he missed with all those shots
ha legit laugh over here thank you
i m sure they did and i wasn t going after you so hope it didn t come across as harsh i wanted to point out you don t have two unmarked vehicles with plain clothes detectives in ballistic vests making traffic stops probably just the pd trying to drum up support for the police showing how dangerous their jobs are
that s by design they want to make it seem like this is a normal situation cops deal with and not them going after a known violent felon
the truck crashed into a telephone pole and had a flat front tire but sure it was just a traffic stop by two unmarked vehicles and three plainclothes detectives in body armor nothing more to the story
i think these are called felony stops and are distinctly different meant for known wanted felons traffic stops are for mundane traffic infractions
shout out to the cops for taking this man alive after being shot at most people let alone cops may not be able to do that
the slide seemed locked back as if all the rounds were spent when he was running back to the car
get back in the car
always funny to read the comments from people thinking theyd be calm and collected after being shot at
yall living in some fansty land over here lmao
probably just the pd trying to drum up support yup
happens all the time police get shot at more often than you d think and a large amount of the time no one gets killed thats why i think saying that being a cop isn t dangerous because they don t get killed often is very misleading just because they don t get killed often doesn t mean they aren t in danger quite often
professionalism
here s a warning let that be a lesson to ya
alright guys this is what i would do
oh no i wouldn t be the oh would be much more frantic is what i m saying
do you have a logical explanation for why less dangerous jobs have much higher deaths than police like garbage collectors and pizza delivery drivers
what you can t shoot the gun out of his hands while doing a backflip into oncoming traffic then you shouldn t be a cop
complacency or murder it s easier to murder an unarmed delivery driver
use common sense who gets shot at more often cops but guess what cops have and delivery drivers don t body armor guns a radio backup minutes away and training
you re mistaking intrinsically dangerous jobs and living in america
so cops are protected by they re status authority and the protective gear weapons that are funded by average every day citizens like the delivery drivers who die way more often than them bc of the crimes they re supposedly helping prevent w their budget that s inflated every year
so i guess that means it s more dangerous to live in america as an average citizen than to be an american cop
what kind of argument are you making here you want cops to escort delivery drivers or you want cops to predict things they can t what is stopping anyone from stabbing a delivery driver at their front door nothing how can you expect the police to stop that
it s definitely more dangerous to be a student
cops definitely shouldn t do that because one of them would probably end up brutalizing or killing an innocent person i m arguing that cops are not only regularly in less dangerous situations than delivery drivers as most cops never actually have to fire their gun but also that we should drastically cut their funding and instead invest in social policies that actually prevent crime

oh man that could ve ended badly
damn that was close which makes me wonder has it happened before
yeah i get that sense from him
inch from a life of misery
the reactions from the people in the back
spotters
that made me go whooaaohhhfuck while at work not really a public freakout but it freaked me out publicly
man he raised the bar then lowered it again
holy shit a lot of folks could have walked away that day with life crippling ptsd had this gone a different way i m not sure i can even imagine what it s like to witness in person a man s head be popped like a grape by a few hundred pound barbell damn
right infront of some chicks
gif giphy wurbbocxdrb8rwimus
the bar still hit his head

finally a non political video
how is this a public freakout
he almost final destinationed him self
i thought he was gonna shit himself or something not almost get his head crushed like a grape damn
that could have been his last lift wholly shit that was close
his left side is weak
this is why i don t understand this deadlift thing it s so dangerous for so many reasons
he didn t do a very good job evading it
the worst part is he got hit by the smaller rod that means all of that weight and force got pressurized into that small grooved area right on top of his skull
it did though
he got back up and did the lift no joke
you mean deadly
could ve ended worse
i was in a couple of weightlifting competitions in high school if i remember correctly i think you re not supposed to drop the weights on your head
if it has i bet it was on ways to die
death
how are they gonna spot that
not supposed to spot a clean and jerk the lifter is supposed to properly trained on how to bail out of the lift ideally stepping back and pushing the bar to your front worst case he could have stepped forward instead he over committed to the lift and that is a sure fire way to get injured those look like all bumpers which would make this 255lbs so not a small lift but not a big one either he should have been able to bail without too much effort
yeah but concussion is better than having to mop up brains
this man went on to become a crazy right winger on the student council he needs to be stopped
the political shit is infuriating
it did i watched it frame by frame and can t tell if it barely touched him or killed him
is he didn t put his hands to his head afterward i would have agreed with you lol
it could ve ended worse
with the way he was falling i d say he got lucky in the end
linda i m high enough for both of us i m a bleeding heart who s here for lulz
it looks like it touched him but i don t think it made full contact to press his face against the ground i bet it left a mark
the frames at the end where he isn t dead are quite telling
yeah the bar outside of the weight rack slammed on his head if he had the actual weights hit his head he would be done for still that had to hurt hope he is okay
looks like the end of the barbell smashed into his head just barely missed the weight plates
like sucked into a black hole worse or giant bunny type worse
the bar slammed his head on the ground
is it though i saw an officer get slightly bumped into the other day and he seemed fine he died the very next day
yeah i forgot about the end of the bar it most likely hit him pretty damn hard makes sense my bad
like head go squish worse
yeah the end of the bar definitely did
i think he got clonked by the bar rather than the weight the weight hit the ground and bounced as if unimpeded
headbutt guy he wasn t dead last i read
aren t there supposed to be spotters to prevent weight lifters from hurting killing themselves
i don t see the bar connecting with his head
wait really i really really hope he s not dead let me see if i can find out
unless things have changed afaik there is no way to spot these type of exercises
the end of the bar it isn t clear but seems something hit him and i reckon he would have been less conscious had it been the weight
yeh i think he had a stroke and ended up in icu i could be mistaken
ohhhhh duh gotcha gotcha that s a huge possibility makes perfect sense
gotcha thanks for the heads up
anytime
